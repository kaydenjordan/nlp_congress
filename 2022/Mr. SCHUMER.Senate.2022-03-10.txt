 Madam President, last night, the House of  Representatives passed the strongest, boldest, and most significant  government funding package we have seen in a very long time, bringing  us one step closer to fully funding the government for the 2022 fiscal  year.   As we all know, funding the government is a basic responsibility of  Congress, but rarely does this responsibility arrive at such a critical  moment for our country and for the world. War has erupted in Europe,  and Americans are looking to relief from rising costs, and this package  is critical for facing these challenges.   After weeks of hard work, I am pleased to report that this bipartisan  funding package represents a robust and unapologetic investment in the  American people: It will give our troops a raise, provide more money  for schools and Head Start programs and Pell Grants, reauthorize the  Violence Against Women Act, fund the President's Cancer Moonshot, and  open the floodgates for funding the bipartisan infrastructure law. This  funding bill is overflowing with very good things for our troops, for  American jobs, for our families, and for America.   Once this bill arrives at the Senate, Republicans must work with  Democrats to pass the bill as soon as possible--hopefully, tonight.  There is every reason in the world to believe that we can arrive at a  path forward quickly.  [[Page S1070]]    For one, the people of Ukraine need our immediate help, and this  omnibus is the quickest and most direct way of getting them the help  fast. At nearly $14 billion, Congress will approve more than double-- more than double--what the administration originally requested for  Ukraine aid, and that is a huge accomplishment. We took the President's  original request for Ukrainian aid, examined it and added to it.   I can confidently say every last penny of this aid package will be  much needed and well spent. It will provide food, medicine, shelter,  and support for over 2 million refugees and resources for Ukraine's  ruined economy. It will also inject billions into military assistance.  It will enable weapons transfers like Javelins and Stingers. It will  reassure and strengthen NATO and add teeth to our defenses against  Russia's malicious cyber warfare.   And to every corrupt Russian oligarch who has dined off Putin's  regime for years, beware. This package will increase the government's  tools for hunting you down and holding you accountable.   The Ukrainian people are fighting for their lives and fighting for  the survival of their young democracy. Congress has a moral obligation  to stand behind them as they resist the evils of Vladimir Putin and his  campaign of carnage.   The 2022 government funding bill is one way we are keeping that  promise, and for that reason alone, it should pass the Senate as  quickly as possible.   But on the homefront, as I already mentioned, there are lots of  important things. This package increases investments across nearly  every single domestic priority, very much needed.   I am particularly thrilled to say that, after a decade of false  starts, this package will finally reauthorize the Violence Against  Women Act, which I originally helped write and pass when I was a  Congressman back in 1994. Unfortunately, this very needed, important  bill to protect those who are abused has languished in limbo for far  too long. VAWA is one of the most important pieces of legislation of  the past 30 years, and once it is reauthorized, it will once again  provide lifesaving support for countless women who face sexual assault  and domestic abuse. I thank Senators Feinstein, Durbin, Ernst,  Murkowski, and all the cosponsors--bipartisan--for helping to bring  this law back to life.   Now, of course, nobody argues that this package is perfect. I am  deeply disappointed--deeply disappointed--that the administration's  request for more COVID funding failed to make it into the House bill,  but we are going to keep fighting to make sure we get that money  approved as soon as possible.   COVID funding right now is all about being prepared. It will provide  funding for vaccines and therapeutics and testing, which means it will  be much easier to keep schools open, to keep businesses open, and to  keep life closer to normal than it was during Delta and Omicron. So we  will keep working on COVID relief. It is very much needed.   Now, we are not over the finish line yet, but I want to thank  appropriators from both sides of the aisle--bipartisan--for putting  this package together, never an easy task. I especially thank Chairman  Leahy for his leadership and his counsel over the course of this  process, and I thank Ranking Member Shelby as well, and my House  colleagues, too, for working in good faith to make this bill possible.   It has not been easy to draft this truly robust package, but after  years of needless chaos and uncertainty under Donald Trump, this year  Congress has been able to work together on a bipartisan basis to fund  the government in a serious way. Now the Senate must follow through in  finishing the job by approving this bill quickly and sending it to the  President's desk.                            ____________________     Madam President, so we still have some more work to do,  but it has already been a remarkably busy and productive week here in  the Senate.   After nearly a decade of work, this week the Senate finally passed  the largest postal reform bill in a very long time, with huge  bipartisan support, I am happy to say. We also sent to the President's  desk the first bill in American history that finally, finally--long  overdue--declares lynching a Federal crime after a century of failed  attempts. These are both momentous and indeed historic accomplishments,  and I thank my colleagues for working in good faith to get them done.   I have always said that, whenever possible, Democrats would be  willing to work in a bipartisan way to get things done, and, once the  omnibus is done, in this week we will have achieved three major  bipartisan accomplishments.   Yesterday, Senate Democrats also met for our DPCC retreat over at  Howard University, where we had a spirited and productive conversation  about the biggest issues facing American families: lowering costs. As  the world continues to struggle with COVID, supply chain disruptions,  and Russia's war on Ukraine, Americans need relief--relief on  everything from energy costs, prescription drug costs, the cost of  groceries and meat and so much more. Democrats will keep working these  issues with laser-like intensity and unflinching focus.   Moving forward, the Senate will also continue the process of  considering and, ultimately, confirming President Biden's exceptional  nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court: Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. That  Judge Jackson is qualified for the High Court is not in question. That  she merits bipartisan support should not be disputed, because on three  occasions she has already come before this Chamber and has been  embraced by people on both sides of the aisle.   When Judge Jackson's confirmation hearings begin on March 21, the  entire Nation will get to see what many of us in the Senate are  learning for ourselves: Judge Jackson is brilliant, she is beloved, and  she belongs on the Supreme Court. The three b's: brilliant, beloved,  belongs.   We have more work to do before this week comes to an end, but, for  now, I thank my colleagues for a very, very productive few days.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is my understanding that the Senate  has received a message from the House of Representatives to accompany  H.R. 2471.    I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate the message to  accompany H.R. 2471.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives       (H.R. 2471) entitled ``An Act to measure the progress of       post-disaster recovery and efforts to address corruption,       governance, rule of law, and media freedoms in Haiti.'', do       pass with an amendment.  [[Page S1089]]                        Motion to Concur with Amendment No. 4984     Madam President, I move to concur in the House amendment  to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2471, with an amendment.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S1089, March 10, 2022, first column, the following  appears: MOTION TO CONCUR WITH AMENDMENT NO. 4984   Madam President, I move to concur in the House amendment to H.R.  2471, with an amendment.      The online Record has been corrected to read: MOTION TO CONCUR  WITH AMENDMENT NO. 4984  Madam President, I move to  concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R.  2471, with an amendment.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      That is the correct number.   I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I have an amendment at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading.    Madam President, I move to refer H.R. 2471 to the  Committee on Appropriations, with instructions to report back  forthwith, with an amendment.    I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I have an amendment to the instructions  at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I have a second-degree amendment at the  desk.    I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that if Senator  Paul makes a motion to discharge S.J. Res. 35, the vote on the motion  occur at 4:15 p.m. today; further, that following the vote, the Senate  proceed to executive session and vote on the confirmation of Calendar  No. 547, the nomination of Maria Pagan, as provided for under the  previous order; and that following the disposition of the nomination,  the Senate resume legislative session.    I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up  the following amendments to the motion to concur with an amendment: Lee  No. 4989, Braun No. 4990, Kennedy No. 4983; that they be the only  remaining amendments in order to the House message on H.R. 2471; that  at 8:30 p.m. today, the Senate vote in relation to the amendments in  the order listed; that upon disposition of the amendments, the motion  to refer and the motion to concur with an amendment be withdrawn and  the Senate vote on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the  Senate amendment to H.R. 2471, and with 60 affirmative votes required  for adoption of Kennedy No. 4983 and the motion to concur, with 2  minutes for debate equally divided between each vote, and all votes  after the first vote be 10 minutes; finally, that if the motion to  concur is agreed to, the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table without intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, now, in the last 4 days alone, the U.S.  Senate has passed a sweeping postal reform bill, unanimously approved  anti-lynching legislation, approved emergency aid to Ukraine, and now  we are about to fully fund the government. From start to finish, it has  been a very productive and very bipartisan week in the Senate. If we  cold boil down this week to three words in the Senate, they would be  ``productive,'' ``bipartisan,'' and ``successful.''   In a few moments, the Senate will pass the strongest, boldest, and  most significant government funding package we have seen in a long  time. This bipartisan funding package is a significant and far-reaching  win for the American people, and I am glad the Senate moved as quickly  today as I hoped we would.   To my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I say: Bravo. A job well  done.   We are keeping our promise to support Ukraine as they fight for their  lives against the evil Vladimir Putin. With nearly $14 billion in  emergency aid, Congress will approve more than double what the  administration originally requested. We took the President's original  request for Ukraine aid, examined it, and added to it, and every last  penny of the money will be well spent. We are giving the Ukrainians  billions for food, medicine, shelter, and support for the over 2  million refugees who have had to leave Ukraine, as well as funding for  weapons transfers like Javelins and Stingers.   We are going to reassure and strengthen NATO and add teeth to our  defenses against Russia's malicious cyber warfare.   We promised the Ukrainian people they would not go at it alone in  their fight against Putin, and once we pass this funding in a short  while, we will keep that promise.   On the domestic front, this funding bill is awash with good news for  our country. We are about to give our troops a pay raise. We are  increasing funding for our schools and Head Start Programs and Pell  grants. We are reviving at last the Violence Against Women Act. We are  kick-starting the President's Cancer Moonshot. And with this package,  we will unlock billions upon billions to fully fund the bipartisan  infrastructure law.   Of course, we didn't get everything we hoped for. In the weeks ahead,  we must--we absolutely must--work to secure more COVID money. COVID  funding is about being prepared. By funding vaccines and therapeutics  and testing, we will be ready for the next variant and stand a better  chance of keeping schools open and preserving normality in our daily  lives. We are going to keep working on this. It is too important to  ignore.   Now, as we reach the finish line, I want to sincerely thank Chairman  Leahy and Ranking Member Shelby. What a fitting and worthy  accomplishment as they near the end of their tenures in office.   I have always said from my first day as majority leader that  Democrats would be willing to work in a bipartisan way to get things  done whenever we could. Once the omnibus passes, the Senate will have  sealed the deal on three major, bipartisan accomplishments this week  alone.   Of course, when we are unable to find common ground, Democrats will  hold firm in defense of our values and be willing to work alone if  needed, but this week, bipartisanship has propelled us over the finish  line. It has not been easy to put this package together, but we are  moments away from getting it done, and I thank my colleagues from both  sides of the aisle.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, if we want to hasten the evening, I  would suggest everybody stay around. Try to sit in your seats. We are  going to try to limit the rest of the votes to 10 minutes.    Madam President, before I do all of these things, let me  just thank Senator Leahy, who was so diligent and so relentless from 3,  4, 5 months ago in warning our caucus of the dangers--of the very real  dangers--of a CR, which wouldn't have been able to move the government  forward. His hard work, his diligence, and his dedication has been  amazing.   I join him in thanking the great staffs of the Appropriations  Committee, who are second to none, as well as my staff, who worked very  hard with them. Meghan Taira is another person of whom I might be able  to say it wouldn't have happened without her.   It is a very good night for this country, a good bipartisan night,  and I thank our Senator from Vermont--and our President pro tempore, of  course.   (Laughter.)    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 79, which was  received from the House.    I further ask unanimous consent that the concurrent  resolution be agreed to and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.J. Res. 75, which was  received from the House and is at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the joint resolution be  considered read a third time.    I know of no further debate.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 209, S. 497.    I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 543, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 726.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 718.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, March 10, be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session and the EPW Committee be discharged from  further consideration of PN1676, Corey Wiggins, to be Federal  Cochairperson, Delta Regional Authority; and the Senate consider the  following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. PN1676, 641, 776, 782,  785, 786, 787, and all nominations on the Secretary's desk in the  Foreign Service; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc  without intervening action or debate; the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate; that any statements related to the nominations be printed in  the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action, and the Senate resume legislative session.   There being no objection, the committee was discharged, and the  Senate proceeded to consider the nominations en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m., Monday,  March 14, and that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Young nomination; further, that the cloture  motions filed during today's session ripen at 5:30 p.m.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 10:27 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, March 14, 2022, at 3 p.m.                            ____________________
