 Madam Speaker, America is experiencing an energy crisis.  The price of oil, a gallon of gas, electricity, and natural gas are all  topping 7-year highs. But what does that really mean for the American  people?   It means less money to buy groceries and more money at the gas pump;  it means less money to take care of your kids and more money to heat  your home; and it means less money for your healthcare and more money  for overhead to run your business. That is a terrible tradeoff for  every American working hard to support their families.   It is only happening because the Biden administration is intent on  implementing policies that make it harder for American energy producers  to develop cleaner, more affordable energy right here at home.   President Biden must wake up and see that there is only one way to  reverse this course: Embrace American energy.                            ____________________
