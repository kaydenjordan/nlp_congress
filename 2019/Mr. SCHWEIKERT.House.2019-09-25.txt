 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted nay on rollcall No. 543.                            PERSONAL EXPLANATION     Madam Speaker, this is going to be one of those  evenings where I am going to try to actually go through sort of complex  numbers, but a lot of it is incredibly optimistic.   I am going to do two things tonight:   Part of this is just some frustration on numbers that I keep seeing  out there that aren't being discussed here in this body that are  incredibly optimistic in the economy.   And the second thing is: I want to talk about, remember last week the  theme was global warming, climate change, the environment, and I had my  issue of The Economist on what is called the climate issue?   I want to talk about some really amazing technologies that I can't  believe weren't discussed last week that are actually about to create  stunning breakthroughs.   So, let's first actually talk through this. I have this intense  frustration that my brothers and sisters on the left, and even a number  of us on the right, don't talk enough or at all about the amazing good  things happening to the American worker, to people out there who had a  pretty rough previous decade.   The math is the math. So the premise I want to give right now is  economic growth is moral because it uplifts, it makes work valuable, it  improves your future, your retirement, and your ability to take care of  your kids. Economic growth is moral.   The reason I have this particular board up--and we try to do this  every week--is what are some of the greatest threats to our society?   I actually believe it is the stunning size of our unfunded  liabilities. Once again--and I say this almost every week when I am  behind this microphone--the next 30 years, if you take Social Security  and Medicare and remove it from the 30-year window, this country, the  Federal Government, the CBO projection, $23 trillion in the bank, if we  pull Social Security and Medicare into that number, then we are $103  trillion in debt--negative.   That is not Republican or Democrat math, it is just demographics.  There are 74 million of us who are baby boomers. We are moving into our  earned benefits, and the honest truth is, the resources that were  required to meet these earned benefits were never set aside.   So how do we keep our commitments?   We are actually proposing over and over and over that it is a  combination. There is no magic bullet. It is a combination. Madam  Speaker, you have got to grow the economy like crazy. So tax policy  that grows and expands, trade policy that grows and expands,  immigration policy that grows and expands, regulatory policy that grows  and expands, and incentives to be in the labor force that grow and  expand the economy.   The adoption of disruptive technology to change the price of  healthcare is absolutely necessary. We need incentives for Americans  who are older and who feel they are healthy and still want to work, to  stay in the labor force. We go over these details over and over and  over again.   There is a way to make the math survivable without some of the lunacy  of functionally almost buying constituencies with outlandish promises,  just managing the reality of our demographics and our current promises.  Once again, every 5 years, just the  [[Page H7981]]  growth in Social Security, Medicare, and healthcare entitlements--just  the growth--will equal the Defense Department. That means every 10  years two Defense Departments is just the growth.   CBO projects that in the next 10 years, 91 percent of the growth will  be in spending on Social Security, Medicare, and healthcare  entitlements. Much of that is calculated with actually a new much, much  lower medical inflation. It is demographics. It is population shifts  moving into those benefits.   You would think, Madam Speaker, if those who come behind these  microphones actually loved and cared for their brothers and sisters,  they would actually try something new, and that would be invest in a  calculator, tell the truth about the math, come together, and make it  work. We believe there is a way to make it work.   Part of the reason I am behind the microphone tonight is I want to  talk about some of the amazing things that are happening, proving the  first part of that discussion, that you can change the economic cycle.  I have been on the Joint Economic Committee now for years. And these  freaky smart professors, demographers, and economists would come and  sit in front of us and say: David, it looks like your future is a 1.8,  maybe a 1.9 GDP growth. We are going to have a labor force that is  going to fall somewhere into the mid-50s as people retire, because  remember 10,300 Americans turn 65 every single day.   That was our future, Madam Speaker, and you couldn't make this math  work at all.   So how many times did you hear the term a fiscal cliff is coming?   Then this crazy thing has happened the last couple of years where we  changed our tax law and we updated our regulatory environment. We are  still negotiating, trying to update our trade environment. But just  those couple of levers changed the economic life for so many Americans.  Yet this place is so incredibly sour, I don't know why there is not  joy.   I want to walk through some of these numbers. Look, these are just  some of the headlines. Associated Press said that U.S. household income  finally matches 1990 peak, while poverty rate hits its lowest since  2001. That is what they call inflation-adjusted dollars. We had a lost  decade. We had a couple of lost decades. We are back.   For the first time, most new working-age hires in the U.S. are people  of color. It turns out, when we would sit in the Joint Economic  Committee a couple years ago, we would hear that those who didn't have  graduate degrees, those who didn't finish high school and who didn't  have these particular skill sets were going to be consigned to the  permanent underclasses.    Besides just the common cruelty of accepting that, the darkness of  accepting that, it turns out it wasn't true.   Why isn't there joy?   This is an editorial from The Wall Street Journal from the editorial  board on the 20th, and there are some numbers in here we have been  tracking. They did a fine job sort of lumping it together. But we all  saw it here on this floor in some of those 1-minute comments a couple  weeks ago, a number of our brothers and sisters on the left were just  outraged that in 2018, Medicaid rolls declined.   Do you know why they declined?   It turns out they declined because workers' earnings increased by 3.4  percent while the poverty rate decreased by another half a percent. So  now the poverty rate is at 11.8. It is still unacceptably high. It is  also the lowest since 2001, and some of the fastest reduction of  poverty in U.S. history was just last year.   If you say you care about those who don't have many of the same  opportunities or haven't had them in life, Madam Speaker, shouldn't  there be just a little recognition there is something pretty amazing  happening out there in the economy for these folks who were being  written off as being part of the permanent underclass? Yet they have  the fastest growing wages in those lower quartiles.   I am sorry. I know I get behind this microphone and often sound like  an accountant on steroids. I struggle with a way to make this sort of a  powerful story, a powerful narrative. So many of our brothers and  sisters around here get behind this microphone and are great at telling  stories. But understanding this math--I don't care if you are Democrat  or Republican, Madam Speaker, you should be joyful that something is  working out there, and you would think policy-wise we would have a  discussion of how we keep it going.   Some more from this editorial: Full-Time, year-round workers  increased by 2.3 million in 2018. Employment gains were the biggest  among minorities, female-led households. The share of workers in  female-led households who worked full-time year-round increased by 4.2  percent, and among Hispanics 3.6 percent.   It is the next paragraph that caught my eye when I was reading this  on the airplane, and I can't believe it wasn't headlined around this  country, because we all talk about how we care about those who have had  a really rough decade, those who have been poor, and those who are  fighting and struggling to feed their families and move up.   As a result, real median earnings--and let's stop for a moment. When  you hear the words ``real median earnings,'' Madam Speaker, what does  that mean?   It is something we call inflation-adjusted dollars. So, if we tell  you your income went up 2 percent, but last year inflation was 1  percent, you only went up 1 percent. So when you hear the term real  dollars or constant dollars or adjusted dollars, it means we have made  up for inflation, so your purchasing power is held constant.   As a result, real median earnings for female households with no  spouse present jumped 7.6 last year.   How many speeches have been given on this floor over the last decade  about that population and the crushing burden of poverty?   More happened last year than had happened in the previous few years  in moving that population out of poverty.   I am sure our brothers and sisters on the left when they hear the  actual math will be joyful because they care about these folks, right?   The poverty rate among female households declined 2.7 percent for  African Americans--Blacks--4 percent for Hispanics, and 7.1 percent for  their children. Those are amazing numbers.   It is part of my point that I keep trying to make over and over.  Economic growth is moral.   But what was more important, because the irony of this editorial, the  real cure for inequality, it turns out that the share of households  making less than $35,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars has fallen 1.2  percent, because they were making more. But when you actually look at  the amount where the income growth was, it wasn't at the upper  quartiles of income. It looks like the growth in income with what they  say in the lower quartiles. Meaning, as this editorial--and we still  don't have the math yet, but we are tracking it, we are probably not  going to have it for another year when we look back at 2019--but  preliminarily, 2019 may be the year, the first year in modern times,  where income inequality actually shrinks.   It is not because the wealthy didn't get wealthier. It is because  those in the lower income finally were receiving pay raises, because  they are finally working in a world where there are more jobs than  there is available labor, so their labor is more valuable.   Isn't that exciting?   Shouldn't we all get together, Republicans and Democrats, and figure  out how to do more of this?                                time  1900    The editorial touches on this, but I want to give an explanation. As  10,300 Americans retire every day, those are often individuals who are  near the peak of their earning cycle, their lifetime earnings.   The economists for years and years had said they expected to see  certain mean income fall because high-skilled workers, because of their  time in the workforce, they were retiring and their salary was going to  come out. Younger workers weren't being paid as much. It turns out,  some of our youngest workers have had some of the biggest pops in  income.   Mean incomes increased in households between the ages of 15 to 24 and  25 to 34 by 9.1 percent and 5 percent, respectively. It turns out our  young workers had some of the most aggressive, positive pay raises in  all of society.  [[Page H7982]]    How much have we heard that on our media? How about our financial  press? How much here on the floor? How much from those who care about  social policies?   Look, the reality of it is that something pretty amazing is happening  out there in our economy. When you saw the August unemployment numbers  of how many Americans who were not even looking came back into the  labor force, because, back to our previous point, labor force  participation, a growing economy, is moral. It is something that I hope  everyone here, no matter what your ideology, is joyful about. That  economic expansion, we are starting to see it in the early data from  CBO, and soon, hopefully, the Social Security actuaries. The dates of  running out of money in our earned entitlement programs are getting  pushed off because of the amount of payroll taxes that are coming in.   As you look at these numbers, try to absorb how stunning. Earnings  for single female households in just 2018--we are not talking multiple  years--just 2018 of 7.6 percent. If I had shown up here a couple of  years ago and said that is what 2018 was going to produce, you would  have laughed me out of the place, but it happened.   Poverty rates for female households are down 2.7 percent; for  Hispanic, down 4 percent. The 2.7 is African American.   Hasn't this also been the goal around here? We were going to find  policies that created a level, egalitarian sort of equity in  participating in the American Dream, the economic expansion. It is  happening.   I am sure when my brothers and sisters on the left see these numbers,  they will soon be coming to these microphones overjoyed, joyful,  excited that the policies from the Republicans over the last couple of  years have brought economic numbers that a lot of those really smart  professors, economists, and demographers who sat in front of us over  the last decade said were impossible.   We need to rethink. If you claim you care, maybe we should engage in  policies that really do work. Just as the Wall Street editorial makes  very, very clear, we have seen distribution not lift people out of  poverty. In many ways, the math has kept them in poverty. But the  economic expansion, the economic miracle from the last couple of years,  is working. Maybe we should consider doing more of it. So, look, that  is just an intense frustration I have.   I want to start with this slide, sort of as the thought experiment. I  am someone who cares a lot about the environment, but I also care about  telling the truth about the math. Virtue signaling does not make the  environment healthier and cleaner. It may get you reelected. It may get  you some nice comments on Twitter or a blog. It doesn't make the  environment better. So every once in a while I will bring this slide  up.   D.C. is one of the communities that has banned straws. Bless them.  How many U.S. straws end up in the ocean? Oh, pretty much none.   Madam Speaker, 90 percent of the ocean plastic--and I am someone,  before I got this job--look, I am blessed to represent one of the  greatest districts you can imagine, lots of smart people, lots of  people who care. Lots of people have chosen to move their lives, their  existence, their prosperity, and work hard in the Phoenix-Scottsdale  area. But when you are in the desert, you used to love to go to the  ocean and go scuba diving. So plastic in the ocean was always one those  things you talked about, you cared about.   Madam Speaker, 90 percent of the plastic in the ocean comes from 10  rivers, eight of them in Asia, two of them in Africa. If you cared  about plastic in the ocean, you would do something that is simple and  logical: Go to the 10 rivers that are 90 percent of the plastic in the  ocean and do something.   A number of us on the Republican side are trying to find ways to  adjust parts of our foreign policy, our environmental aid, some of our  engineering skills, and those things to these locations of these 10  rivers that are 90 percent of the plastic in the ocean. It is  absolutely fascinating the reaction I have had from some of our  brothers and sisters who just stare at me because--well, that pretty  much ends the virtue signaling of: We are going to get rid of straws,  even though 90 percent of the problem is these 10 rivers, eight in  Asia, two in Africa.   If you claim you care, learn the actual facts, because virtue  signaling does not make this world cleaner.   Let's talk about this last week and optimism. Amazing article, a  company called TerraPower, and apparently, Bill Gates is a substantial  investor in it. It is a new, dramatically more efficient type of  nuclear power. There were some numbers in the article that I thought  were important for the continuation of the thought experiment.   About 20 percent of America's electric power comes from nuclear.  Seventeen percent comes from renewables. Nuclear still is more than  renewables. About 63 percent is from fossil fuels.   Here is the problem with that: If you take a look, the column over  here on my right--if you are watching this, your left--are different  nuclear power generation that has been shut down or is being shut down.  This goes back to 2016. That was some of the newest data I could find.  The other side is photovoltaic.   Do you notice something? The two lines are almost identical. If you  are someone that is giddy--and look, I am from Arizona. We love our  photovoltaic, but we also have the largest nuclear power plant, which  is run by Arizona Public Service, in the country at amazing uptime.  They do an amazing job running that facility. But this is nuclear power  coming offline. That is photovoltaic going online.   You will notice there is no net positive. If you are someone that  cares about CO2, greenhouse gas going into the atmosphere,  unless you are stabilizing nuclear power, instead of taking it offline,  you didn't get anywhere. But we reward virtue signaling around here and  not actual math.   Let's talk some more about the good news and some of the technology  breakthroughs that are happening around us. This one is one of my  favorites because something the Committee on Ways and Means did last  year--and we did it bipartisan, demonstrating you can do these things-- is we updated what we call the carbon sequestration tax credit.   This is a facility that is up and running--what is it?--outside the  Houston area, in Texas. I hope I don't butcher the technology, but it  is a natural gas-fired power plant with no smokestack. They figured out  how to take the natural gas, explode it, slam it through the turbines,  spin the turbines, produce electricity, and on the other end, capture  all the CO2. Then they sell it, recycle it. Now we are  learning they can take that CO2, and through a process--I  think you have to put it to like 150 bars of pressure and those  things--it turns out it becomes an incredibly clean-burning fuel  because it is really pure carbon.   This facility, I think--if I remember the article--they are trying  now to find funding to go up to around 300 megawatts. But they have  proven you can burn a hydrocarbon, produce baseload electrical power,  and not have a smokestack.   The technology is up and running today and, apparently, a few miles  away, there is another plant that is doing the same experiment with  coal and no smokestack.   This is a big deal, but there are many of us who also think of the  greenhouse gas issue as global. When you have countries like China and  its Belt and Road Initiative, it is bringing on 32, 33 coal-fired power  plants with functionally almost no greenhouse gas mitigation, carbon  capture. They are not using the newest technology.   What happens to a world where someone like myself says that we need  the economic growth, that we don't have the economic growth, that we  can never keep our economic promises that we have made to our seniors?  Retirement security is crucial to economic expansion, but we want a  clean environment.   The lunacy of some of the proposals, I beg of them, please, come by  our office. We have binders of the disruptive technology that is coming  out. This is one that I think we have to be joyful about.   How many of you have ever heard the discussion of negative carbon  emissions? We have discussed this concept for 100 years. You can pull  CO2 out of the air.   It turns out this facility is up and running in its pilot project.  Bill Gates  [[Page H7983]]  is also a funder of this. It is in Canada. I wish it was in Arizona.  They are claiming right now that their facility can pull carbon out of  the air for about $100 to $150 a ton, capture that carbon, package it,  and make a clean-burning fuel out of it.   If the rest of the world continues to go the way it is going, the  concept that we now have the technology to yank carbon out of the air,  and if it is really heading toward $100 a ton, it is at the threshold  where it is economical because, it turns out, the dollar values--some  of the sequestration tax credits we do, but also the ability to convert  it back into a fuel, it is almost in the money.   This is exciting. How many did you hear talk about this technology  over the last 10 days? It is here.   My beloved university, Arizona State University, the biggest  university in the United States, has an entire center devoted to this  concept of technology that is a negative carbon sink. Functionally, it  pulls carbon right out of the air. Their technology is passive, where  the other one is active.   The professor working on this--I have met with him--freaky smart. He  has a joyful view that basically says let's let the technology compete.  Whoever does it the best will win.   This one is more a distributive model of this passive collection  where you can put it in lots of locations. Part of it is the cover for  your bus stop, but it is also pulling carbon out of the air.   The technology is here, so the Malthusians of this place--and if you  don't know what that means, please go look it up--somehow think we need  to go back and live in the dark ages, basically, or that man has  demonstrated over and over technology is a disruption.   Look, when I was growing up, I remember having a teacher read us the  Population Bomb, scaring me to death that by the late 1970s, we were  all going to be starving. How many of our kids out there today hear the  propaganda on some of the reactionaries, the folklore about what is  happening out there, that they are going to be in a planet that is  burning up in their late teenage years?   The issues are real, but so are the technology solutions. It turns  out solutions often aren't as elegant as a great speech with lots of  virtue signaling.   I am very proud of the things that are happening out there.   A final bit of this thought experiment is, years ago, we were  blessed--we had a Ph.D. of physics. I think he is now--well, he is at  one of those special agencies that does really complex stuff right now.  But he did a math experiment for us. Methane, in our formula, was  considered 84 times more greenhouse-causing in its first year than  carbon. So, okay, you get 84-to-1.                                time  1915    He came to me with this math experiment saying, if you could build a  substantial pipeline or multiple pipelines in west Texas and a couple  other large hydrocarbon-producing areas and it was designed to capture  methane and take that methane and pull it in in enough density to  actually convert it to a fuel, and then he had that and a couple other  things, you hit the Paris accord numbers.   Isn't that exciting? How many of our brothers and sisters here are  already saying we need to be building a bunch more pipelines to go  collect that methane so we can capture it, compress it, make sure it  doesn't go into the air--except pipelines are, functionally, part of  the religious process here and need to be opposed.   If anyone is watching, listening, go look this up: photosynthesis, 40  percent. I actually believe this may be the single most disruptive bit  of technology in our lifetimes.   It looks like the inherent problem of plants. You remember all of  your high school biology class where we were told plant cells have had,  for millions of years, a small flaw. Sometimes they really, really want  that carbon molecule so they can make a sugar out of it and, instead,  they grab an oxygen molecule.   Apparently, through synthetic biology, they figured out how to  rearrange that plant cell so it always grabs the carbon. It grows the  sugar, and the plants grow 40 percent more efficient.   Think about that. What would happen if that technology was part of  our commodity crops, our fresh produce, the things we eat. The world  would feed itself for another 250 years. It would mean 40 percent less  land, 40 percent less water, 40 percent less fertilizer.   It turns out, world agriculture produces 2.2 times the greenhouse  gases of every car on Earth. Do you know, if you had this type of  technology as the crops for around the world, it would be equal to  removing every car off the face of the Earth?   And, yes, it is a GMO, because the fix was done through a type of  synthetic biology.   But it would equal removing every car off the face of the Earth.   These are joyful thought experiments, but the technology is real, and  it is here. We have to figure out, as a body, how we adopt these things  that it proves we can grow as a society, we can grow economically as a  world.   My soon-to-be 4-year-old little girl can have an amazing future. We  don't have to be terrified about the debt cliff that is going to crush  us because we grew. And we can have the amazing clean environment and  deal with the issues of greenhouse gases.   Are we ready to pull our heads out and actually do that crazy thing  of reading and math and understand the technology disruption is in  front of us?   Madam Speaker, are we ready to adopt, embrace the technology  disruption that allows us to grow, prosper, and meet so many of our  goals?   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
