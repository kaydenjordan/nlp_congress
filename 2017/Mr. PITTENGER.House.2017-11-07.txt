 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Dr. Billy  Graham, a revered national treasure, who celebrates his 99th birthday  today.   The world honors Dr. Graham's birthday because of a decision he made  83 years ago. On November 1, 1934, at a Mordecai Ham tent revival in  Charlotte, North Carolina, young Billy Graham accepted Jesus as his  personal Savior and committed his life to telling others about Jesus'  love and forgiveness. God used that decision to impact countless lives  around the world.   While Presidents have sought his counsel over many decades and  millions have gone forward to accept Jesus Christ at his meetings, Dr.  Graham is remembered most for honoring and following his Lord and  master.   On a personal note, I first met Dr. Graham back in 1971 when I served  as his caddy at the Byron Nelson Pro-Am, playing with Byron Nelson, Bob  Hope, and Arnold Palmer. That was a fun time, but I have admired his  walk with Jesus ever since.   Happy birthday, Dr. Graham.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 2148,  the Clarifying Commercial Real Estate Loans Act. I would also like to  thank my colleague, Chairman Huizenga, for his leadership on our  behalf.   This bipartisan legislation makes commonsense reforms to the high  volatility commercial real estate loan process and clarifies the  existing regulations to help simplify real estate financing in high  volatility markets, including economically depressed urban communities.   The complexity of the current HVCRE definition, combined with the  failure of Federal regulators to clarify and define HVCRE rules and how  and where they are to be applied, has made certain that these  development loans have become way too expensive. This has increased  borrowing costs and reduced credit availability.   These failures directly impact local communities. We have seen fewer  jobs, less economic growth, and increased costs for community projects,  in addition to setbacks for local banks and developers.   My bipartisan legislation addresses many of these concerns by  broadening the types of equity the developer may place towards the  heightened risk requirements of an HVCRE loan. We also clarify which  types of loans should and should not be classified as HVCRE. We must  codify and improve the HVCRE rules to ensure market and industry  stability.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman David Scott, Congresswoman Carolyn  Maloney, and Ranking Member Waters, who actively worked with me on this  important legislation. Please join us in supporting this commonsense,  bipartisan legislation.
