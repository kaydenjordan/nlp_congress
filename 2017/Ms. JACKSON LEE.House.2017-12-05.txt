 Mr. Speaker, a few minutes ago, in Detroit, the dean  of the United States Congress offered his retirement immediately. He  has asked me, a member of the Judiciary Committee, to offer his words  to his colleagues and to put his statement in the Record that indicates  that he has notified Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, and Governor Snyder  of his retirement from the United States House of Representatives.   It is important to note, as I begin, that there is no difference or  no undermining of the rights of women and the abhorrence of sexual  harassment and sexual assault. But this is a statement that I believe  should be read on behalf of the dean of the United States Congress, Mr.  John Conyers.                                time  1100    As a Member of Congress, I have known Mr. Conyers to not shy away  from a legislative challenge. In addition to being the first Member to  introduce the Martin Luther King holiday bill, he was the first to hold  hearings on police misconduct, the first to examine the problem of  solitary confinement, the first to offer racial profiling legislation,  the first to introduce legislation protecting against  disenfranchisement of ex-felons, and the first to pursue legislation  protecting Black farmers from discrimination, among many other civil  rights measures.   In 2007, Representative Conyers stood up for the prerogatives of the  House of Representatives and successfully brought a suit against the  former President Bush White House for failing to comply with subpoenas  relating to a U.S. attorney's investigation.   He has been the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; and he will  continue to, in his life, as he has indicated, stand for what is right.   It is now my privilege to read this statement from Mr. John Conyers.  I reiterate that he says that he notified Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi,  and Governor Snyder of his retirement from the United States House of  Representatives.   It was his honor--these are his words--and his privilege to serve the  constituents of Detroit, Michigan, as their United States Congressman  in the 13th and 14th Congressional District for 53 years.   This is his statement again:         I came to Congress in 1964. Since then, I have devoted my       entire career to improving the lives of my constituents in       Detroit and on the behalf of justice everywhere. These years       witnessed a profound evolution in civil rights, led by       millions in the streets who marched for justice and people of       conscience in the Congress--both Democrats and Republicans--      who heard them and enacted the Civil Rights Act, the Voting       Rights Act, and other landmark reforms. I have been in the       forefront of the civil rights movement. I have been a       champion of justice for the oppressed and the       disenfranchised. I never wavered in my commitment to justice       and democracy.        I am proud to have been part of that rich history. I have       been privileged to be a founder of the Congressional Black       Caucus and to represent the United States Congress by being       dean.        I passed, as indicated, the law dealing with the Martin       Luther King, Jr., Holiday Act, the Violence Against Women       Act, the Hate Crimes Act, the USA Freedom Act, and the       extension of the Voting Rights Act. I have led the fight       against mandatory minimum sentences, hoping to reverse the       devastating incarceration rates for African Americans and       poor people. I have tried to pass a universal healthcare law,       H.R. 676. Every Congress since 1989, I have introduced H.R.       40 to study reparations for slavery, and I deeply appreciate       those handful of courageous colleagues who have joined me.        For Detroiters, I am proud of what we have been able to       accomplish to bring hundreds of millions of dollars in       critical grants and Federal funding for southeast Michigan to       revitalize our great city, attract rich talent, and return to       us prosperity.        I recognize that in this present environment, due process       will not be afforded to me. I was taught by a great woman, my       mother, to honor women. The first employee I ever hired was       Mrs. Rosa Parks, who worked in my office for 22 years. It has       been my great honor to work alongside some of the most       talented and honorable staff on Capitol Hill and in Detroit.        I have stated my position on these allegations. I have       worked with both women and men.        Given the totality of the circumstance of not being       afforded the right of due process in conjunction with my       current health condition, and to preserve my legacy and good       name, I am retiring.        I hope that my retirement will be viewed in the larger       perspective of my record of service, and as I enter a new       chapter, I pledge to continue my commitment to a progressive       vision and a better future for this country that I love. I       owe that to the legacy of my father, John Conyers, Sr., who       integrated labor unions in this country; to my brother       Nathan, who integrated business, and he is my ``main man;''       and to my loving wife, Monica; and to my son, John III, who I       believe offers hope to this generation of leadership, and who       is committed to being an advocate of fairness and justice for       all; and to Carl Edward, who never leaves my side.        I cannot allow the great work of this body to be distracted       from the important work, or the goals of the Democratic Party       to be distracted. It has been an honor and a privilege of my       life to represent the people of Michigan in the House of       Representatives, but that responsibility will now fall to my       colleagues and my successor. They have my deepest support and       prayers. Jobs, justice, and peace.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me, first of all, thank my good friend, Mr. Katko,  who is the original sponsor; and I am proud to be an original cosponsor  of this legislation. We serve on the Homeland Security Committee and  have oversight over the Secret Service, as does the aspects of this  legislation, as relates to Judiciary has oversight as well. So ensuring  that our men and women, who put their lives on the line daily, are  protected is an important initiative. As I said earlier, I am proud to  be an original cosponsor, along with my colleague from New York (Mr.  Katko).   The Secret Service Recruitment and Retention Act of 2017 is intended  to provide overtime pay for employees of the United States Secret  Service. Currently, the premium pay for protective services, under the  Overtime Pay for Protective Services Act of 2016, has severe earning  limitations, or otherwise caps, which many of these men and women have  reached.   Due to earnings limitations put in place through 5 U.S.C. 5547, many  Secret Service employees are not receiving timely or full payment for  the hours they work. The requirements of protective operations directly  contrast with the intent of an annual pay cap, as the protective  mission requires continued, uninterrupted coverage for our protectees,  beyond the control of the Secret Service. I think that is an important  point.   And I want my colleagues to know that I wholly support that our  protectees are protected wherever they go. But I would be remiss if I  did not express my concern on the number of trips that the Secret  Service today has had to make on outings for entertainment, Mar-a-Lago,  which I think is over 100 times, and the enormous amount of money and  burden that is being placed on the Federal Government.   This does not mean that I do not want these individuals to be  compensated. And might I stop for a moment to thank the Secret Service,  who I have known and have seen working over the years that I have  served in the United States Congress in many different ways. Let me  personally thank them for their service and for their professional  service, dedicated service, and longstanding service and commitment to  sacrificing their life for their protectee.   I would say that this problem often requires individuals to work over  the amount of premium pay, for which they are able to be legally paid,  due to the annual cap. We have seen the extent to which Secret Service  members are stretched in this administration alone. Providing  protection for the President, his family members, and other high  officials requires depth within the agency to ensure protectees are  covered as well as their respective posts when pulled away. As I made  the point, these various family members and President go in many ways  off of the path of their government service related to the people of  the United States.   It is my hope that we are able to eventually work collaboratively on  a more permanent fix to this problem since the Secret Service cannot  administratively control protective overtime, which is dependent on the  schedules of the protectees. Raising the pay cap will aid the Secret  Service in reducing attrition rates and retaining personnel, which is  what this bill purports to do. I truly want to make sure that happens.   Exit interview data indicates the pay cap issue is the number one  concern among employees leaving the Secret Service. We must ensure that  we are employing the best available candidates when dealing with the  protection of America's highest diplomats. Therefore, pay should not be  a deterrence in the recruitment and/or retention of Secret Service  agents, and it is crucial that we retain them.    Departing employees said raising the pay cap would have had an effect  on their decision to leave, and they would have stayed. They are  leaving the Secret Service for other positions in the Federal  Government with equal pay and less travel.   The U.S. Secret Service is currently protecting a historic number of  protectees--about 25 percent more protectees--than during the Obama  administration. In comparison to the previous five Presidential  administrations--Bush 41 to Obama--for the first 6 months in office,  Trump administration Secret Service protectees had more travel stops  and travel days than any other President.   As such, the operational tempo for protective activities have  remained higher than normal. Protective overtime hours for special  agents are about 15 to 20 percent higher when compared to CY 2015, the  last non-Presidential campaign year.   For CY 2017, as of 9-30-17, the Secret Service anticipates  approximately 1,200 personnel will exceed the statutory pay cap.   The costs related to protective overtime in excess of the pay cap for  CY 2017 is estimated at $10.5 million. The same costs are projected for  2018, if the protective tempo remains unchanged.   I, therefore, support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same. Any way that we can help protect the protectees, and keep these  well-experienced, committed, dedicated agents, willing to sacrifice  their lives, from leaving, so that we can also recruit, is a vital step  forward. I hope not only is this bill passed by the House, but I also  hope passed quickly by the Senate to be able to be signed by the  President of the United States.   Ensuring that our men and women, who put their lives on the line  daily, are protected is an important initiative. I am proud to be an  original co-sponsor along with my colleague Mr. Katko from New York.   ``The Secret Service Recruitment and Retention Act of 2017'' is  intended to provide overtime pay for employees of the United States  Secret Service.

I therefore, support this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, we must do everything we can to protect our United  States Secret Service personnel and ensure an effective process for  recruitment and retention of these agents.   These agents play a vital role in our democratic system both here at  home and abroad. Their keen attention to details and adequate response  to dangerous situations around the world cannot be measured in dollar  signs.   Beyond protecting the President, Vice-President, their families and  other identified individuals, the Secret Service plays a vital role in  representing the United States interest around the world through  criminal investigation activities that span the gamut from anti- counterfeiting operations to now encompassing financial crimes,  identity theft, counterfeiting, computer fraud, and computer-based  attacks on the nation's financial, banking, and telecommunications  infrastructure, among other areas.   For all these reasons, I therefore, support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler), the ranking member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Cummings), the chairman and ranking member of the  Oversight and Government Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me acknowledge Mr. Cummings for his leadership on this  legislation. I believe the combination of Members who are sponsoring  this legislation and the work of the Oversight and Government Reform,  Homeland Security, and Judiciary Committees clearly speak to almost the  crisis of the issue and what we are dealing with.   As we come to a close, Mr. Speaker, I am hoping that my colleagues  will vote for this legislation in resounding numbers and I hope that  the Senate will hotline this legislation so that it can immediately get  to the desk of the President.   I would also ask that we recognize that we must do everything we can  to protect our United States Secret Service personnel and ensure an  effective process for recruitment and retention of these agents.   I am glad there is an element in this legislation that will allow for  a review of all of these issues and that the Congress will have a role  in assessing how we can work with the Secret Service agency to improve  its performance, its retention, and certainly to say to those  hardworking agents that we appreciate them, by way of compensation.   These agents play a vital role in our democratic system both here at  home and abroad. Their keen attention to details and adequate response  to dangerous situations around the world cannot be measured in dollar  signs.   Beyond protecting the President, Vice President, their families, and  other identified individuals, the Secret Service plays a vital role in  representing the United States' interests around the world through  criminal investigation activities that span the gamut from  anticounterfeiting operations to now encompassing financial crimes;  identity theft, which has exponentially grown in the United States;  counterfeiting; computer fraud; and computer-based attacks on the  Nation's financial, banking, and telecommunications infrastructure,  among other areas.   Congress is standing up to make its voice known and to make  appropriate changes.   I think it is appropriate for the administration in this instance,  the Commander in Chief, to stand up as well and review the extensive  travel and the burdens that are being placed on the Secret Service  agents and their families. They are not complaining, but I think it  behooves any good leader to look at what can be improved and what can  be corrected in order to ensure the astuteness, the excellence, and the  safety and security of the protectees and those agents who are out  there on the line sacrificing or willing to sacrifice their life.   For all of these reasons, I therefore support this bill. Mr. Speaker,  I ask my colleagues to vote for this legislation, H.R. 3731, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Florida for managing  this bill along with the previous initiative, and let me thank Mrs.  Maloney and Mr. Trott for their leadership on this very important  legislation.   Protecting girls and young women from abuse and exploitation is vital  to the health of our communities. The Stopping Abusive Female  Exploitation Act is intended to amend 18 U.S.C. Section 116 by raising  the penalty such that the maximum penalty for the crime of genital  mutilation is 15 years.                                time  1300    Given the abhorrent nature of this practice, States should have in  place laws that require healthcare professionals, school employees, and  other professionals who work with children to report any suspected  practice of female genital mutilation to the appropriate law  enforcement entity.   This legislation is important as a means for Congress to  appropriately punish those who commit this crime. Female genital  manipulation, cutting, is internationally recognized as a violation of  human rights of girls and women. It is currently a crime in 26 States,  including Michigan and Texas. It is also a Federal crime.   Around the world, at least five girls are mutilated, cut, every hour.  An estimated 100 million girls and 140 million women worldwide are  living with the consequences of FGM. Despite the fact that FGM has been  banned in the United States since 1996, people continue to engage in  this abusive practice.   Recently, Michigan was faced with the first Federal prosecution under  this statute, whereby a Michigan doctor was charged with performing  female genital mutilation on two girls that crossed State lines.  Because this intolerable practice has no medical benefits, it has no  place in our society, and those who commit these horrendous crimes  should be held accountable for their actions. I, therefore, ask support  for this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.  [[Page H9638]]    Protecting girls and young women from abuse and exploitation is vital  to the health of our communities.   ``The Stopping Abusive Female Exploitation Act of 2017'' is intended  to amend 18 U.S.C.

Mr. Speaker, we must do everything we can to protect victims,  particularly, the most vulnerable people in our society, our children.   This bill will certainly do that. Beyond serving as a deterrence for  many in our society that continue to engage in the practice of female  genital mutilation, this legislation will also provide a more  appropriate punishment for violation of the FGM statute, under 18  U.S.C. Sec.  116.   For all these reasons, I therefore, support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to yield 2  minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B.  Maloney), a good friend and a champion of these issues dealing with  vulnerable women, the original sponsor of this legislation along with  Mr. Trott.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), the ranking member of the  House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Again, let me thank the gentleman from Florida for managing and  joining me in the managing of this legislation, and, again, I thank the  cosponsors.   Let me also express my appreciation to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Trott) for his service to this Congress and, as well, for his  excellent bill that is on the floor.   I thank the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), as  well, for her leadership on this legislation.   I think it is important to note that these are dastardly acts against  women and girls; and as I indicated, across the world, we are talking  about 140 million women and 100 million girls who have been subjected  to living with the consequences of the FGM. It was banned in the United  States since 1996, but we know this act still goes on. So we must do  everything we can to protect victims, particularly the most vulnerable  people in our society: our children.   This is not a mandatory minimum. This is upwards of 15 years. This is  a deserving penalty for a horrific crime. This bill will certainly do  that to try to protect these children here in the United States.   Beyond serving as a deterrent for many in our society who continue to  engage in the practice of female genital mutilation, this legislation  will also provide appropriate punishment for violation of the FGM  statute under 18 U.S.C. 116.   For all these reasons, I ask my colleagues to support this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.
