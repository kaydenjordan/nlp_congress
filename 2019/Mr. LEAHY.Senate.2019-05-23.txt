 Madam President, the Appropriations Committee staff was  working until midnight last night, as they do so often, on the disaster  supplement. We know that in January the House sent us a disaster  supplemental appropriations bill to help communities across the Nation.  These communities were dealing with the deadly aftermath of hurricanes,  floods, earthquakes, and volcanoes.   It has been my experience over the years that normally disaster bills  sail through both Chambers of Congress. Every Member knows that one day  it will be his State or her State that needs help recovering from a  disaster.   I well remember when we had a terrible hurricane in Vermont; it  created the most damage in generations in our State. The day after the  devastation, I went with our Governor and the head of our National  Guard in a helicopter to survey the damage. For many towns, the only  way we could reach them was in a helicopter. The bridges were like a  child's toy, twisted and gone. The roads totally disappeared. Houses  were upside down in the river.   It was heartbreaking, but as we were going there, I received email  after email. My Senate colleagues, many of them Republicans, said  ``Vermont stood with us when we had''--and they named the disaster.  ``We will stand with you.'' That is what we do. It doesn't make any  difference whether you are a Republican or a Democrat; if there is a  disaster, you stand together.   What I cannot understand is that in my 44 years here--it was  different this time. When we brought up a disaster supplemental  appropriations bill in January of this year, the President of the  United States came out swinging against it. Why? Because the bill  contained assistance for Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico had been hit by 2  back-to-back, category 5 hurricanes, and apparently providing  assistance to 3 million Americans in need was a step too far for him.  He did not want to provide aid to these Americans. ``Not one more dime  for Puerto Rico'' he was reported to have said--shocking words for  somebody who holds the highest office in the land, especially after  they had nearly unprecedented back-to-back hurricanes.   From the beginning, I have said what my Republican colleagues and  Democratic colleagues have always said. It is a role of the Federal  Government to stand by all Americans in times of need. It should not  matter whether you are a Georgia peach farmer, a California small  business owner, or a child living in San Juan. If your community is  devastated by a natural disaster, you are an American, and the American  community will stand with you. That is what I have always fought for.   So here we are, 5 months later--5 months of negotiations, 5 months of  talks--and we finally reach a deal on a disaster aid bill that helps  all--all Americans. We don't pick and choose. It is a good deal. It  addresses the need from Alabama to California and many States in  between. But 5 months is too long to wait. It is far too long for the  communities who are trying to rebuild their homes and their towns, so  we have to act now.   The President has asked that we add $4.5 million to the disaster  supplemental bill to address the issues that we face at our southern  border. I agree with the President that some of this money is badly  needed. We don't dispute that. But everyone in this Chamber,  Republicans and Democrats, knows that under this President, anything to  do with immigration is controversial; it is going to be hotly debated.  We have been working night and day to strike a compromise on the  President's request. When we finished in the middle of last night, we  were close, but we are not there yet.   I hope in the next few hours we can resolve our remaining  differences, but if we cannot reach agreement, then at least pass the  disaster bill without it today--not tomorrow, not next week, not next  month--today. Five months has been too long for America to have to  wait.   We have a deal on the disaster aid bill. It is a bipartisan bill. It  is supported by Democrats and Republicans. It is ready to go. Let's  pass it today, and let's show the American people we stand with them in  times of crisis, just as Members of this body stood with my beloved  State of Vermont when we were hit. We didn't say we are Republicans or  Democrats. We said that we are Americans, and Americans have been hurt,  and Americans stand together when we are suffering. Today, Americans  are suffering across this country. Let us--as the conscience of the  Nation, the U.S. Senate, let us stand with them, and let's get the  disaster aid they need.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle for their votes. Even though the final vote might be 5 months  late, today is a good day for the Congress, for the Senate, for the  American people, and for the Nation.   I have said from the beginning--a position I have taken in all of my  decades in the Senate--that any disaster supplemental that passes this  Chamber cannot pick and choose which American citizens to help in their  time of need. We are all Americans. The American community bands  together to support one another when disaster strikes, regardless of  where we are from, what our politics are, or what our beliefs are. That  is the American way, and it is the role of the Congress to make sure  that it is done.   I am glad to stand on the Senate floor today, and I am glad to be  here with my dear friend, the senior Senator from Alabama and the  chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Shelby, to support  what is a bipartisan, bicameral disaster supplemental appropriations  bill.   Think of what we have done. This bill will provide long overdue aid  to the people of California, Georgia, Florida, Nebraska, Iowa, North  Carolina, South Carolina, Hawaii, Texas, Missouri, Alabama, and Puerto  Rico just to name a few. Some of these people--they are all American  citizens--have been trying to put their lives back together for nearly  2 years--since August of 2017.   It provides $19.1 billion to help communities in these States and  Territories to rebuild stronger than they were before. It includes more  than $2.4 billion in community development block grants, more than $1.6  billion for the Federal Highway Administration to rebuild roads and  bridges, and more than $3 billion to support our Nation's farmers who  lost their crops and livestock in the storms. It also provides more  than $3 billion to rebuild our military's storm-damaged infrastructure.   It has been no secret that how to help the American citizens of  Puerto Rico has been at the heart of our dispute on disaster aid, but I  am pleased to report that the bill provides much needed assistance to  these Americans, including $605 million for the Nutrition Assistance  Program, and $304 million in community development block grants to help  the island meet the FEMA match requirements.   One thing that we learned when Tropical Storm Irene struck Vermont is  that you have rebuild better than you were so you are stronger when you  face the next storm. We have included language that requires FEMA to  rebuild the island stronger and better than it was before to help  mitigate the damage of a future storm. We did this in certain areas in  Vermont, and it made all the difference in the world.   This supplemental will unlock billions of dollars that Congress had  previously appropriated for Puerto Rico and other communities across  the country that the Trump administration has held back in the  Treasury.   We reached this agreement because the Republicans and the Democrats  came together across the aisle. It is a strong bipartisan agreement. It  reflects that we are one Nation in times of need and that all Americans  can count on each other. I was happy to see the strong support from the  Senators here, but our work is not yet done.   Now we have to address the humanitarian crisis at our southern  border. We have to help those who are fleeing from violence and  persecution in their own countries. The President has requested $4.5  billion. Some of this money is badly needed. There is no dispute about  that, and I will support the part that is badly needed.   Everyone in this Chamber knows these are difficult issues that are  often made more difficult given the President's rhetoric and extreme  policies. Difficult issues take time. Let's lower the rhetoric, and  let's do as we have done here--work together. We have been working day  and night to strike a compromise on the President's request. We are  close, but we are not there yet. Even as of late, late last night, we  were still working on that. When we return, I hope we can negotiate a  bipartisan agreement to provide additional humanitarian assistance.   To reach this agreement today, many of the Senators--and I mentioned,  of course, Senator Shelby, my friend, as chairman--and I, as vice  chairman, worked together. So did many others, but none of us could do  it without the dedicated staff that was involved. I could go home at 9  o'clock and 10 o'clock at night, but they were still there. I am  talking about both the Democratic staff and the Republican staff. So I  asked my Appropriations chief of staff, Chuck Kieffer, to give me a  list.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  at the end of my remarks the list of names of both the Democratic staff  and the Republican staff who worked so hard on this.   I said on a personal basis earlier that I remember when Tropical  Storm Irene hit Vermont and how totally discouraged I was by the  damage. Yet, within hours, I had texts and emails from Senators in this  body--Republicans and Democrats alike. They said: When we were hit by a  tornado, by flooding, by an earthquake--whatever it might have been-- Vermont stood with us, and we will stand with Vermont.   That is what we are as the United States of America. The Senate did  what it should do today. The Senate acted as the conscience of the  Nation. We stood together to help all Americans.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  List Submitted for the Record by Appropriations Committee Vice Chairman     Leahy of Staff for H.R. 2157, the Supplemental Appropriations Act         Charles E. Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jess Berry, Jay       Tilton, Hannah Chauvin, Dianne Nellor, Jean Toal Eisen, Erik       Raven, Doug Clapp, Ellen Murray, Scott Nance, Chip Walgren,       Drenan Dudley, Reeves Hart, Rachael Taylor, Alex Keenan,       Jason McMahon, Tim Rieser, Dabney Hegg, Christina Monroe,       Catie Finley, Shannon Hines, Jonathan Graffeo, David Adkins,       Carlisle Clarke, Hamilton Bloom, Brian Potts, Tyler Owens,       Andrew Newton, Adam Telle, Erny Lesofski, Laura Friedel,       Sarah Boliek, Patrick Magnuson, Paul Grove, Clare Doherty.     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President I want to bring to the Senate's attention  the story and the example of Alberto Curamil, an environmental activist  who is a member of the indigenous Mapuche people in Chile's Araucania  region. The Mapuche are Chile's largest indigenous group, and since the  1800s they have struggled to protect their culture, territory, rivers,  forests, and natural resources against encroachment and destruction by  settlers and energy companies that have often acted with impunity and  the backing of the government. Mr. Curamil has dedicated his life to  this cause. It is the existential struggle of indigenous people in  scores of countries as the insatiable global demand for energy, arable  land, water, timber, oil, gas, and minerals threatens their ancestral  lands and way of life.   Several years ago, during a prolonged drought in Chile, the Ministry  of Energy announced a plan for two large hydroelectric projects in  Araucania, without consulting the Mapuche people who live there. The  projects would reportedly divert more than 500 million gallons of water  for power generation, severely limiting water flow and damaging the  ecosystem of the Cautin River on which many of the Mapuche people  depend for survival.   Mr. Curamil, who has three children, lives on the outskirts of the  town of Curacautin. He is a farmer who raises animals. His wife teaches  the Mapuche language. Fearing what the harm to the river would mean for  his people, he organized Mapuche and non-Mapuche, environmental  organizations, lawyers, and academics to try to stop the projects. In  public protests and in court, they argued that the government had  ignored Chilean law which  [[Page S3094]]  requires free, prior, and informed consent of affected communities  before approving such projects. Despite harassment, threats, and  violent attacks, Mr. Curamil succeeded in uniting the opposition, and  in 2016 the projects were canceled.   But that was not the end of it.   On August 14, 2018, Mr. Curamil was arrested by Chile's national  police and imprisoned. He has been charged with assault during a bank  robbery in which a guard was injured and hostages taken. An anonymous  witness reportedly said that one of the robbers looked like a Mapuche,  and they arrested Mr. Curamil. There have been no judicial proceedings,  and Mr. Curamil remains in pretrial detention.   Mr. Curamil and his family say that he is a victim of retaliation for  his environmental activism, that he was attending a meeting in a  different town at the time of the robbery, and that multiple people can  attest to his presence there. At the time of his arrest, his house was  ransacked by police and left in a shambles.   In November 2018, another Mapuche, Camilo Catrillanca, age 24, died  after being shot in the back by police. He was a member of the Mapuche  Territorial Alliance, a grassroots organization that seeks to  reintegrate the Mapuche people through reclaiming their language,  territory, and rights that were fractured and repeatedly violated  during the past two centuries.   I mention these events to put in context the recent announcement that  Alberto Curamil was selected as one of the 2019 winners of the Goldman  Environmental Prize. The prize honors grassroots environmental  activists from around the world, singling out individuals for their  extraordinary and sustained efforts to protect the natural environment,  often at great personal risk.   Not only did Mr. Curamil lead a successful challenge to the unlawful  decision by the Chilean Ministry of Energy, he is being subjected to  what many suspect is a flagrant and vindictive abuse of the judicial  process of the type that we have come to expect in countries with  authoritarian governments like Russia but not democracies like Chile.   If the Chilean authorities have credible evidence to support the  charge against Mr. Curamil, they should produce it in a public trial  and provide him with the opportunity to defend himself. Instead, nearly  10 months since his arrest, he languishes in jail while his wife and  children are alone fending for themselves.   The attempts to intimidate and silence Mr. Curamil and the threats to  his people and the natural environment are not unique. This is  happening to indigenous people all over the world, and each year the  prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize helps to call attention to  those like Mr. Curamil who have risked their lives on behalf of their  communities, wildlife species, rivers, lakes, forests, and oceans that  are being threatened or destroyed.   Mr. Curamil is an activist for environmental and social justice that  Chileans should take pride in. Like the many hundreds in attendance in  San Francisco and Washington who cheered when his daughter, Belen  Curamil, received the prize on his behalf, the Chilean people should  recognize Mr. Curamil for his courageous defense of Chile's natural  environment and diverse cultural heritage.   We should also be concerned that Mr. Curamil 's arrest takes place  against a backdrop of escalating violence between the national police  and Mapuche activists. At the heart of the dispute is land ownership  and lack of consultation on legislation or investment projects that  directly affect the Mapuche. Timber is Chile's second-largest export  commodity, worth billions of dollars annually, and the political elite  is deeply invested in the industry. Mapuche activists are engaged in a  campaign against the timber industry and its defenders in the  government. In response, prosecutors are using an anti-terrorism law  originally introduced by the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet  to stifle political dissent. The law allows for indefinite pretrial  detention, investigations being kept secret for up to 6 months, and  evidence admitted in oral hearings from anonymous witnesses, as in Mr.  Curamil 's case.   This situation is aptly described by Global Witness in its 2017  report, Defenders of the Earth:         It is increasingly clear that, globally, governments and       business are failing in their duty to protect activists at       risk . . . Ironically, it is the activists themselves who are       painted as criminals, facing trumped-up criminal charges and       aggressive civil cases brought by governments and companies       seeking to silence them. This criminalization is used to       intimidate defenders, tarnish their reputations and lock them       into costly legal battles.    Chile's police have intervened violently on the side of private  companies, intimidating Mapuche communities. The UN Special Rapporteur  on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples warned that the government and  police are increasingly targeting activists who are campaigning to  protect their land from mining, logging, and dams. The Inter-American  Court of Human Rights has condemned the Chilean Government for applying  anti-terrorism laws against Mapuche leaders.   According to Amnesty International, ``Although violence against  defenders is a constant in the region, little is known about what is  happening in Chile, especially in relation to the historical context of  criminalization and stigmatization of the Mapuche and their leaders.  The Chilean authorities have an obligation to guarantee conditions that  enable human rights defenders to carry out their work and to establish  protection mechanisms for environmental defenders and Indigenous  leaders who face constant criminalization and stigmatization.''   Again, these circumstances are not unique to Chile. Similar  confrontations are occurring in many countries. But Mr. Curamil's  receipt of the Goldman Environmental Prize should cause everyone to pay  attention, and to ask, Should not these issues be handled better? Is it  acceptable for the Chilean Government to label these largely  defenseless, mostly impoverished people as ``terrorists,'' for trying  to protect their territory and way of life? Should not the Chilean  Government act as a convener of a dialogue that recognizes the  legitimate rights of its indigenous population, that ensures they are  consulted in a timely and meaningful way, as the law requires, about  decisions that affect them, and that their views are properly reflected  in those decisions? Is that not the government's responsibility? To  listen to its citizens who have traditionally been ignored and whose  way of life is threatened and to find creative, sustainable solutions?   I join others in congratulating Alberto Curamil for setting an  example at a time when the natural environment is under siege due to  human development; recklessness, and greed. We see the consequences on  every continent--tropical forests cut down for oil palm plantations,  coral reefs destroyed, rivers polluted, dammed and diverted, fish  populations depleted, and other wildlife species facing extinction.   Earlier this month, a UN assessment of the world's biodiversity  compiled by 145 experts from 50 countries over 3 years, reported that  ``the health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is  deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very  foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and  quality of life worldwide.''   This is true in Chile as it is in virtually every country.  Complacency is not an answer, and I hope the Chilean Government will  recognize that people like Alberto Curamil should be listened to and  supported, not threatened and jailed.                            ____________________
