 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. It is sad to  say, but this coronavirus pandemic has caused some of the greatest  suffering in our time for individuals and for our country at large. And  yet there are those few who would see this as an opportunity to benefit  for themselves and their companies by price gouging or, one might say,  pandemic profiteering.   We have good reason to be skeptical about many of these companies,  including the pharmaceutical industry. For example, even during this  crisis, we saw Gilead seek and receive from the FDA 7 years of orphan  drug exclusivity for a possible treatment for the virus. Only after  organizations stepped in and protested did Gilead go back to the FDA to  withdraw their request.   Do we really need an oversight committee? Look what has happened  already.    Headlines such as a $55 million contract to a  bankrupt company, who is a baker, in order to make N95 masks.   ``Hedge Fund Managers Claiming Bailouts As Small Businesses.''   ``Over 43,000 U.S. Millionaires Will Get `stimulus' Averaging $1.6  Million Each.''   Yes, we need an oversight committee, and we need it now.
