 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the life and legacy of Pat Daugherty, a pillar of the Centre region and  the Penn State community.   Pat Daugherty owned and operated the Tavern Restaurant for four  decades in State College, Pennsylvania. He was a mentor to many, a  friend to all, and a champion for our community.   Sadly, Pat passed away on November 7 at the age of 75. While his  absence has been felt by friends, family, and loved ones, the  outpouring of anecdotes and stories from those who have known Pat over  the years has illustrated what can be truly described as a life well  lived.   Pat first arrived in State College in the early 1960s for his  freshman year at Penn State University and proceeded to make the area  home. He was a two-time graduate of the university with a bachelor's  and a master's degree in civil engineering.   While attending Penn State, Pat, like many students, worked an off- campus job. Pat's place of employment was a historic inn turned  restaurant called The Tavern. It would only be a few years later that  Pat would return to The Tavern, this time as its owner.   For the next 40 years, Pat welcomed students, staff, the Penn State  nation, and visitors of all kinds to his restaurant. He always greeted  them with a smile on his face and the goal to treat each person like  family.   Pat loved the community and loved Penn State. He cared so much for  his town and would do everything he could to make it a better place.   His drive to connect the community to the college and the college to  the community was evident. Throughout the years of owning The Tavern,  Pat employed hundreds of Penn State students. He is beloved by  generations due to his years of mentorship.   He was always giving back; as an active volunteer and avid sports  lover, Pat was a supporter of all Penn State athletic programs. The  Tavern established several scholarships and an endowment for freestyle  wrestling.   Leading up to Penn State's biggest philanthropic event of the year,  THON, The Tavern was a frequent place for fundraisers and team  meetings. The Tavern actively supported Mount Nittany Medical Center,  Nittany Valley Symphony, Pennsylvania Chamber Orchestra, as well as the  Central Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts.   Pat was always putting his community first. His passion to help  others and make the community a better place did not go unnoticed, and  his contributions to State College cannot be overstated.   In 1999, Penn State named him the Renaissance Fund Honoree. This  title is an annual tribute to someone for a lifetime of service to Penn  State and the State College community through philanthropy and civic  leadership. That year, contributions to the Renaissance Fund endowed  three scholarships in honor of Pat, his mother, and Tavern alumni.   More than 20 years later, those scholarships are awarded to students  with outstanding academic records who show the greatest financial need.  Pat's philanthropy did not stop with the university. He continued to  work to better the State College community, volunteering and serving  among a variety of organizations.   He was a member of the Downtown Improvement District, where he played  a significant role in the planning of the future of downtown State  College. He served on the board of the Chamber of Business and Industry  of Centre County and the Pennsylvania Restaurant Association.   He was always ready to lend a helping hand, and in 2019 the board of  Centre County's Constitution Day celebration awarded Pat the inaugural  James Madison Award for Civility in the Community.   Mr. Speaker, I have fond memories of meeting with Pat in the  community and especially on Capitol Hill, when he would travel to  Washington on behalf of the Pennsylvania Restaurant Association. We  often shared a laugh, and during one visit he may have even shared the  recipe for the Tavern's world renown ``Original Sin'' cocktail with my  staff.  [[Page H6862]]    Pat Daugherty's work in the community goes well beyond being a  restaurateur. For more of his years he was a pillar of the community, a  mentor, and an avid supporter of Penn State University and the greater  Centre region. Most of all, Pat was someone who everyone called a  friend.   I extend my sincere condolences to Pat's wife Ruth, his children, Sam  and Dawn, and his family and friends. Pat will be so truly missed, and  his legacy will live on forever.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the 80th anniversary of National Bible Week. In 1941, weeks before the  United States entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt  declared the week of Thanksgiving as National Bible Week.   This celebration recognizes the spiritual and historical significance  of the Bible. It is a week where we can come together and celebrate  this holy book. The Bible has shaped our Nation's history and continues  to provide guidance to the lives of so many.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to live in a country where we can freely  read the Scripture and worship the Lord without fear of persecution.  The Bible is timeless and continues to provide us with words of wisdom,  comfort, and guidance as we navigate unprecedented times.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to leave you with this verse  from 2 Timothy 3:16. It is one that I keep close to my heart.         All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for       teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in       righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped       for every good work.                            ____________________
