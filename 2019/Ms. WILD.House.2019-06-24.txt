 Mr. Speaker, under President Obama, the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau was created and tasked with implementing critical  protections for the American people. That work continues to be  important today, and I urge the CFPB to maintain the safeguards that  were put in place to ensure that Americans get a fair opportunity to  succeed.   Protecting military families and others from predatory lending is not  a partisan issue. Making sure that banks are not targeting students  from working and middle-class backgrounds with excessive fees is not a  partisan issue. Looking out for senior citizens, who are  disproportionately vulnerable to scams is not a partisan issue.   Countering fraud and abuse isn't just morally right, it is also an  economic imperative. We cannot forget the lessons of the Great  Recession about what happens when we let fraudulent and predatory  practices run rampant across our economy. We all lose.   The House recently passed H.R. 1500, which would reverse recent  changes that have weakened the agency's ability to carry out its work.  Now the Senate needs to hold its vote on this bill.                            ____________________
