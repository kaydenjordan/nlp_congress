 Mr. President, let me express my appreciation to the  majority leader for highlighting this crisis at the border. There is no  State more directly impacted in our United States than the State of  Texas.   We, obviously, share 1,200 miles of common border with Mexico, and  this is a humanitarian crisis. As the majority leader said, not only  the New York Times editorial page, but Barack Obama in 2014 called far  fewer numbers than are coming across today a humanitarian and security  crisis then, and it has gotten nothing but worse.   I appreciate the leader's bringing this to a head and holding Members  accountable. We know that people talk a good game sometimes, but there  is nowhere to hide when it comes to an up-or-down vote on this  emergency appropriations bill.   I would add that there are other measures taking place. The chairman  of the Judiciary Committee, as the Presiding Officer knows, is working  on a bill that would address the underlying asylum laws, which are  being exploited by the human smugglers who are getting rich moving  people across Mexico from Central America into the United States and  charging them between $5,000 and $10,000 a head--sometimes more. It has  been the unwillingness of the Democrats to engage on that underlying  asylum law and a fix there that has precipitated or contributed to this  humanitarian crisis.    I will.    We hope to see. And we will see one way or the other when  we vote on this legislation next week.   I am happy to say that my Democratic colleague Henry Cuellar from  Laredo, TX, which is more directly impacted probably than any place on  the border, joined me in one proposal we call the HUMANE Act, which  would deal with this underlying asylum issue.   We have been working with the chairman, Senator Graham, to come up  with a consensus piece of legislation that will really plug the dike  that has been breached now, which has caused this humanitarian crisis.   There are a number of ways we can deal with this.    Mr. President, I agree with the majority leader. We do  need to do both.   I would also add, for those who were disturbed by the President's  invocation of his tariff authority to try to bring the Mexican  Government to the table to negotiate some changes in the way the  Mexican Government deals with this flow of Central Americans coming  across its country, none of that would have been necessary if our  Democratic colleagues had simply worked with us both on the underlying  legislation and on this appropriations bill.   Frankly, the President was put in a corner, and there was not much  else he could do. I am grateful he was able to get a result. Only time  will tell whether those numbers actually go down from the 144,000 last  month.   But while the Democrats are sitting on their hands and maybe talking  a good game, I am glad to know we at least have leadership in the White  House and here in the Senate.    Mr. President, that is a sad but true statement. It is  unbelievable to me that the Mexican Government, under President Lopez  Obrador, is doing more than congressional Democrats to try to solve  this humanitarian and security crisis, but that is where we are.    Mr. President, I thank the majority leader again for his  leadership and for his comments today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, last week, we commemorated the 75th  anniversary of D-Day, and in just a few weeks, we will celebrate  America's independence on the Fourth of July.   It is important for us to pause and remember the contributions made  by the men and women who wear the uniform of the U.S. military who  fight every day to protect our freedoms.   The Senate Armed Services Committee just completed its markup of the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 and voted  overwhelmingly to send this legislation to the Senate floor. This is an  annual event for us in the Senate. We pass the Defense authorization  bill to ensure that crucial Department of Defense programs are  continued, that America's servicemembers are paid, and that our  national defense is modernized to keep pace with the rapidly evolving  threat landscape.   One of my top priorities in the Senate has been to ensure that  America's military men and women have what  [[Page S3463]]  they need to keep our Nation safe from threats both at home and abroad,  and this bill, the national defense authorization bill, fulfills part  of our commitment to do just that.   There are more than 200,000 military men and women stationed in Texas  at places like Fort Hood, Fort Bliss, Lackland Air Force Base, Naval  Air Station Corpus Christi, and Ellington Field. We in Congress have a  duty to provide these men and women with the training, the tools, and  the resources they need to achieve the most difficult missions they  face today and embark on those that will inevitably arise tomorrow.   I have no doubt that these talented servicemembers could have chosen  any career--certainly one that involved fewer sacrifices and more time  spent at home with their families--but, instead, they have chosen to  serve their country. That decision should never stand in the way of  their ability to exercise one of the most fundamental rights we have as  American citizens, and that is the right to vote.   In 2016, only 46 percent of Active-Duty military voted by absentee  ballot--46 percent. What concerns me is the fact that one-third of  those who did not vote said that the absentee voting process was too  complicated. We have to change that, so I have introduced a bipartisan  bill called the Military Voter Protection Act that simplifies the  absentee voter registration process for servicemembers stationed  abroad. It would ensure that within 30 days of arriving in theater  during a deployment, servicemembers are provided with a briefing on  absentee voting registration and an opportunity to fill out the  registration form or application.   Currently, 28 States allow the Federal write-in absentee ballot to  serve as both the registration form and the actual ballot itself. My  bill encourages the remaining States to follow suit, reducing the  amount of paperwork military members have to fill out in order to  exercise their right to vote.   This is an important step to simplify that process for our men and  women in uniform and ensure that arduous and cumbersome paperwork does  not deter them or dissuade them from casting their ballot. I have been  working with the chairman and the ranking member on the Armed Services  Committee to ensure that this provision will be included in the Defense  authorization bill for fiscal year 2020 to make it easier for our  servicemembers to make sure their voices are heard at the ballot box.   As we prepare to consider the Defense authorization bill here in the  Senate, I want to thank the men and women who serve our country and  assure them that we will continue to do everything we can to support  them and ensure they are empowered and mission-ready and, yes, that  they can also cast their ballot.
