 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by title for  the second time.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         A bill (S. 1757) to strengthen border security, increase       resources for enforcement of immigration laws, and for other       purposes.     Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further  proceedings.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the bill will  be placed on the calendar.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to begin by extending the  Senate's heartfelt sympathies to those affected by Hurricane Harvey. We  have seen the devastation across Texas, Louisiana, and the gulf coast.  We know the recovery will not be easy, nor will it be quick.   We also understand the Federal Government's important role in  assisting impacted communities. Last week, the President submitted a  supplemental emergency funding request that will allow this critical  work to continue. It will also allow our country to be better prepared  for future natural disasters. It is especially important, given the  potential for another major hurricane to strike our country this very  week.   As I said when the President submitted his emergency funding request,  the Senate will work closely with his administration and the House of  Representatives to deliver that much needed relief. I am glad to see  the House Appropriations Committee has already taken important steps to  get us there, and I look forward to the House sending over legislation  so the Senate can act on it as soon as possible.   I know that securing this emergency funding is very important for the  President, and I know that preventing a default or shutdown amidst such  a historic natural disaster is also very important to him--and even  more so now with another major hurricane on the way.   These are the President's immediate priorities: pass disaster relief,  prevent a default, and fund the government. These are my immediate  priorities as well, and I am sure all of our colleagues feel the same  way. We have to get all three of these things done, and we have to do  it very quickly.   In the case of the debt limit, we need to act quickly, given the new  uncertainty from the large costs of storm recovery. As the President's  Budget Director wrote in his letter to Congress last week, ``Given the  need for additional spending as a result of disaster response and  initial recovery from Hurricane Harvey, the Administration continues to  urge Congress to act expeditiously to ensure that the debt ceiling does  not affect these critical response and recovery efforts. Otherwise it  may not be possible to get those critical resources to Americans who  desperately need them.''   Here is why. As Treasury Secretary Mnuchin explained, ``[O]ur first  priority is to make sure that the state gets money, it is critical, and  to do that we need to make sure we raise the debt limit. So if Congress  appropriates the money, but I don't have the ability to borrow more  money and pay for it, we're not going to be able to get that money to  the state.''   He called for Congress to ``put politics aside'' and get these things  done as quickly as possible. That was the Secretary of the Treasury.   I look forward to continuing to discuss these important issues with  the President's team and congressional leaders of both parties at the  White House tomorrow. I look forward to discussing other important and  shared priorities as well.   Nominees, for instance. It was good to see the Senate clear a large  package  [[Page S4918]]  of nominees before we left for the State work period. Now our work  continues. There are other vacancies to fill. There are nominees, for  instance, for positions that are critical to recovery from Hurricane  Harvey. We have to work together to get those nominees confirmed  quickly, and we have to keep working together to fill other vacant  positions in the Federal Government as well.   Another issue of extraordinary importance is tax reform. We will  actually have another meeting at the White House today on that issue  specifically. It is clear the President is very engaged on this issue.  As he wrote in an op-ed over the weekend, ``Our self-destructive tax  code costs Americans millions of jobs, trillions of dollars and  billions of hours spent on compliance and on paperwork. . . . We owe it  to the American people to fix this broken system. American businesses  want to prosper on our shores, and middle-class families are ready for  more growth, more jobs, and higher pay.''   That is the aim of tax reform, and that is the message I hope the  President will continue to take around the country, including his trip  this week to North Dakota. In the meantime, work will continue among  Members and committees in both Chambers to keep moving forward on this  important issue.   In addition to these issues, I also look forward to tomorrow's  discussion about the national security challenge that is before us.  Administration officials will be coming to Congress later that day to  give a briefing on challenges like North Korea and Afghanistan. I am  looking forward to that important meeting. These are complicated  issues, and they will require smart responses from both the  administration and from Congress.   Here in Congress, we will have an opportunity to address some of them  soon as we work to pass related legislation such as the annual Defense  authorization bill. The chairman of the Armed Services Committee,  Senator McCain, will take the lead on that legislation. We have kept  Senator McCain and his family in our thoughts over the State work  period. We are glad to have him back with us. We know he will again  manage this year's legislation with skill and dedication.   There are obviously other important issues before us as well. There  are many goals we share with the administration. There is a lot we want  to get done, and we have three critically important things before us  right now that we need to do quickly: pass disaster relief, prevent a  default so those emergency resources can actually get to Americans who  need them, and keep the government funded. Those are the three  important things before us now.   We will continue working with the administration and our friends on  both sides to accomplish those things.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with  respect to the nomination of Timothy Kelly, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.
