 Mr. Speaker, each August, I conduct a  bus tour of South Carolina's Second Congressional District with my  wife, Roxanne, and dedicated staff from all offices. This year, I  especially appreciate scheduler Emily Saleeby for the very meaningful  agenda.   It was humbling and inspiring to meet with constituents and visit 22  locations, from small businesses and schools to local chambers of  commerce and large employers. I had the opportunity to thank employees  for their service, and I observed firsthand the extraordinary success  of jobs created by President Donald Trump's tax cuts, promises made,  promises kept.   Many of the businesses were multigenerational success stories, such  as Shumpert's IGA, which has been in operation for four generations and  is currently led by Frank Shumpert.   We also visited with newer companies that thrive, like Tidewater  Boats of Lexington, which started in 2006 and is currently in the top  10 of saltwater boat manufacturers in the Nation with the leadership of  Jimmy Metts and Chris Martin.   I was grateful for the opportunity to receive, personally, questions,  concerns, and input from citizens on the bus tour.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Thank you, Congressman Madeleine Bordallo, for your remarkable  achievements, your loving devotion for the families of Guam, and your  tireless bipartisan support of a strong national defense.   Madeleine Bordallo is a living legend of effective service for the  people of Guam.                            ____________________
