 Madam Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5376, the  mislabeled Inflation Reduction Act.   This is another reckless tax and spending spree that is not being  accurately portrayed to the American people by Democrats.   Washington Democrats are trying to convince Americans that adding  more reckless government spending and raising taxes during a recession  will combat inflation. Even nonpartisan organizations say this bill  will have virtually no impact on inflation and at least half of the  expected tax revenue for next year is estimated to come from Americans  making less than $400,000 a year.   Americans will see more IRS audits because this bill gives the IRS  the ability to hire an army of new IRS agents. People should pay the  taxes they owe, but instead of an army of IRS agents focusing on  auditing low- to middle-income Americans, we need to put our resources  into hiring more Border Patrol officers to protect the border and stop  the flow of illicit drugs such as fentanyl.   More troubling parts of this bill are the healthcare provisions. I  strongly disagree with using Medicare money to pay for ObamaCare  subsidies for the wealthy. I introduced an amendment to keep Medicare  savings in Medicare, which is already at risk of insolvency in the very  near future. Unfortunately, House Democrats didn't even give this  amendment a chance to be considered.   While Democrats praise government price setting, or, as they call it,  negotiation, they fail to mention that such policies would lead to at  least 15 fewer drugs coming to market, according to the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office.   What are the 15 cures? Could it be the cure for Alzheimer's? Could it  be the cure for diabetes? It could be.   They also won't mention that the nonpartisan CBO said this bill will  lead to higher prices on new drugs.   Finally, Democrats are voting to give Secretary Becerra a $3 billion  slush fund to set drug prices, despite HHS botching the response to the  COVID-19 pandemic, including politicizing guidance that kept schools  closed and young children masked in Head Start programs.   How can anyone support giving billions of dollars in more  unrestricted authority to HHS that we know will lead to fewer cures for  our loved ones?   Let me be clear: We absolutely need to address the cost of  prescription  [[Page H7681]]  medication. In the Energy and Commerce Committee, there is a bipartisan  bill ready to go, H.R. 19, that could achieve this, but the Democrats  have repeatedly refused to bring the bill to the floor for a vote.   Our country is also facing an energy crisis created by President  Biden and Washington Democrats' war on American energy. Despite this,  the Democrats' solution is to double down on the nearly $400 billion to  be spent on far-left Green New Deal policies and impose billions of  dollars of tax increases on energy that will be passed to consumers.   Unbelievably, even as energy prices are at historically high levels,  they have included a new tax on natural gas and revived a tax on  petroleum products that will cost consumers tens of billions of  dollars.   I filed an amendment to exempt our defense bases from this natural  gas tax, but again, Democrats refused even to consider it.   Democrats want to create a $27 billion slush fund at the EPA for a  national climate bank to subsidize the solar energy that is heavily  dominated by the Chinese Communist Party and even spend $9 billion in  rebates for wealthy Americans to green up their homes with new  appliances and electric vehicles.   To conclude, this legislation not only crushes hope for patients and  their families living with devastating diseases that currently lack a  treatment or a cure, but it also significantly undermines our economic  and national security.   I cannot vote for the more appropriately named inflation expansion  act. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing it, and  I reserve the balance of my time.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton), the chair emeritus of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce, who is retiring. We are going to miss him.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), my good friend on the Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an editorial from  The Wall Street Journal titled, ``Tilting at Climate Windmills,'' which  notes that the massive spending bill reduces global temperatures at the  most by 0.28 degrees.                       [From the Wall Street Journal]                        Tilting at Climate Windmills      Shumer-Manchin will have little effect on the world's temperature                            (By Editorial Board)         Nearly all of Washington--Democrats, the press, lobbyists--      is taking a victory lap with Senate passage of the Schumer-      Manchin tax, climate and drug price control bill. The climate       lobby is especially thrilled, claiming a historic victory       that will reduce temperatures, hold back the rising sea, and       save the planet.        Or, maybe not. Our contributor Bjorn Lomborg looked at the       Rhodium Group estimate for CO2 emissions reductions from       Schumer-Manchin policies. He then plugged them into the       United Nations climate model to measure the impact on global       temperature by 2100. He finds the bill will reduce the       estimated global temperature rise at the end of this century       by all of 0.028 degrees Fahrenheit in the optimistic case. In       the pessimistic case, the temperature difference will be       0.0009 degrees Fahrenheit.        In other words, the climate provisions in this ballyhooed       legislation will have no notable impact on the climate.        This isn't surprising. No matter what the U.S. does to       reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, it will be dwarfed by what       the rest of the world does. China, India and Africa aren't       about to stop burning fossil fuels as they develop, and China       is sprinting ahead to build huge new coal capacity despite       its pledge to start reducing emissions after 2030.        Barring a breakthrough in battery or other technology,       carbon emissions will continue to increase. No one knows how       much the Earth's temperature will warm, though even the U.N.       model has modified its estimates from the apocalyptic       predictions of some years ago.        Schumer-Manchin won't reduce inflation, won't reduce the       budget deficit, and it won't reduce the world's temperature.       What it will do is transfer some $369 billion from taxpayers       and drug companies to the pockets of green energy businesses       and investors. It will tighten the hold that politicians have       on the allocation of capital, as they pick winners and losers       with their grants and tax credits. Everyone will get a nice       warm feeling as they pretend they are cooling the climate.     This bill will not do what those on the floor today have  said it will do.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs.  Miller-Meeks).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This bill drives a massive build-out of unreliable wind and solar  power, not nuclear, not natural gas, and not baseload power.   I include in the Record a report from the North American Electric  Reliability Corporation, the authority on electric reliability, which  underscores the risk of blackouts from the oversupply of weather- dependent energy.      [From North American Electric Reliability Corporation, May 2022]                     2022 Summer Reliability Assessment                                 Key Findings         NERC's annual SRA covers the upcoming four-month (June-      September) summer period. This assessment provides an       evaluation of generation resource and transmission system       adequacy and energy sufficiency to meet projected summer peak       demands and operating reserves This assessment identifies       potential reliability issues of interest and regional topics       of concern. While the scope of this seasonal assessment is       focused on the upcoming summer, the key findings are       consistent with risks and issues that NERC has highlighted in       the 2021 Long-Term Reliability Assessment and other earlier       reliability assessments and reports.        The following findings are NERC and the ERO Enterprise's       independent evaluation of electricity generation and       transmission capacity and potential operational concerns that       may need to be addressed for the 2022 summer.      Summer Resource Adequacy Assessment and Energy Risk Analysis        Midcontinent ISO (MISO) faces a capacity shortfall in its       North and Central areas, resulting in high risk of energy       emergencies during peak summer conditions. Capacity shortfall       projections reported in the 2021 LTRA and as far back as the       2018 LTRA have continued Load serving entities in 4 of 11       zones entered the annual planning resource auction (PRA) in       April 2022 without enough owned or contracted capacity to       cover their requirements. Across MISO, peak demand       projections have increased by 1.7 percent since last summer       due in part to a return to normal demand patterns that have       been altered in prior years by the pandemic. However, more       impactful is the drop in capacity in the most recent PRA:       MISO will have 3,200 MW (2.3 percent) less generation       capacity than in the summer of 2021. System operators in MISO       are more likely to need operating mitigations, such as load       modifying resources or non-firm imports, to meet reserve       requirements under normal peak summer conditions. More       extreme temperatures, higher generation outages, or low wind       conditions expose the MISO North and Central areas to higher       risk of temporary operator-initiated load shedding to       maintain system reliability.        At the start of the summer, a key transmission line       connecting MISO's northern and southern areas will be out of       service. Restoration continues on a 4-mile section of 500 kV       transmission line that was damaged by a tornado during severe       storms on December 10, 2021. The transmission outage affects       1,000 MW of firm transfers between the Midwestern and       Southern MISO system that includes parts of Arkansas,       Louisiana, and Mississippi. The transmission line is expected       to be restored at the end of June 2022.        Anticipated resource capacity in Saskatchewan will be       strained to meet peak demand projections, which have risen by       over 7.5 percent since 2021. SaskPower is projected to remain       above their planning reserve margin threshold and have       sufficient operating reserves for normal peak conditions.       However, external assistance is expected to be needed in       extreme conditions that cause above-normal generator outages       or demand.        Drought conditions create heightened reliability risk for       the summer. Drought exists or threatens wide areas of North       America, resulting in unique challenges to area electricity       supplies and potential impacts on demand:        Energy output from hydro generators throughout most of the       Western United States is being affected by widespread drought       and below-normal snowpack. Dry hydrological conditions       threaten the availability of hydroelectricity for transfers       throughout the Western Interconnection. Some assessment       areas, including WECC's California-Mexico (CA/MX) and       Southwest Reserve Sharing Group (SRSG), depend on substantial       electricity imports to meet demand on hot summer evenings and       other times when variable energy resource (e.g., wind, solar)       output is diminishing. In the event of wide-area extreme heat       event, all U.S. assessment areas in the Western       Interconnection are at risk of energy emergencies due to the       limited supply of electricity available for transfer.        Extreme drought across much of Texas can produce weather       conditions that are favorable to prolonged, wide-area heat       events and extreme peak electricity demand. Resource       additions to the ERCOT system in recent years-predominantly       solar and some wind--have raised Anticipated Reserve Margins       above Reference Margin Levels and ease concerns of capacity       shortfalls for normal peak demand. However, extreme heat       increases peak demand and can be accompanied by weather       patterns that lead to increased forced outages or reduced       energy output from resources of all types. A combination of       extreme peak demand, low wind, and high outage rates from       thermal generators could require system operators to use       emergency procedures, up to and including temporary manual       load shedding.        As drought conditions continue over the Missouri River       Basin, output from thermal generators that use the Missouri       River for cooling in Southwest Power Pool (SPP) may be       affected in summer months. Low water levels in the river can       impact generators with once-through cooling and lead to       reduced output capacity. Energy output from hydro generators       on the river can also be affected by drought conservation       measures implemented in the reservoir system. Outages and       reduced output from thermal and hydro generation could lead       to energy shortfalls at peak demand. Periods of above normal       wind  [[Page H7685]]       generator output may give some relief, however, this energy       is not assured. System operators could require emergency       procedures to meet peak demand during periods of high       generator unavailability.        All other areas have sufficient resources to manage normal       summer peak demand and are at low risk of energy shortfalls       from more extreme demand or generation outage conditions.       Anticipated Reserve Margins meet or surpass the Reference       Margin Level, indicating that planned resources in these       areas are adequate to manage the risk of a capacity       deficiency under normal conditions. Furthermore, based on       risk scenario analysis in these areas, resources and energy       appear adequate.      Other Reliability Issues for Summer        Supply chain issues and commissioning challenges on new       resource and transmission projects are a concern in areas       where completion is needed for reliability during summer peak       periods. Assessment areas report that some generation and       transmission projects are being impacted by product       unavailability, shipping delays, and labor shortages. At the       time of this assessment publication, WECC-CA/MX, and WECC-      SRSG have sizeable amounts of generation capacity in       development and included in their resource projections for       summer. In Texas (ERCOT), transmission expansion projects are       underway to alleviate transmission constraints and maintain       system stability as the BPS is adapted to rapid growth in new       generation; delays or cancellations of transmission projects       can cause transmission system congestion during peak       conditions and affect the ability to serve load in localized       areas. Should project delays emerge, affected Generator       Owners (GOs) and Transmission Owners must communicate changes       to Balancing Authorities (BAs), Transmission Operators, and       Reliability Coordinators, so that impacts are understood and       steps are taken to reduce risks of capacity deficiencies or       energy shortfalls.        Coal-fired GOs are having difficulty obtaining fuel and       non-fuel consumables as supply chains are stressed. No       specific BPS reliability impacts are currently foreseen;       however, coal stockpiles at power plants are relatively low       compared to historical levels. Some owners and operators       report challenges in arranging replenishment due to mine       closures, rail shipping limitations, and increased coal       exports. Some GOs have implemented controls to maintain       sufficient stocks for peak months while BAs and Reliability       Coordinators are continuing to conduct fuel surveys and       monitoring the situation.        The electricity and other critical infrastructure sectors       face cyber security threats from Russia and other potential       actors amid heightened geopolitical tensions in addition to       ongoing cyber risks. Russian attackers may be planning or       attempting malicious cyber activity to gain access and       disrupt the electric grid in North America in retaliation for       support to Ukraine. The Electricity Infrastructure Sharing       and Analysis Center (E-ISAC) continues to exchange       information with its members and has posted communications       and guidance from government partners and other advisories on       its Portal. E-ISAC members are encouraged to check in       regularly to receive updates and to actively share       information regarding threats and other malicious activities       with the E-ISAC to enable broader communication with other       sector participants and government partners.        Unexpected tripping of solar photovoltaic        (PV) resources during grid disturbances continues to be a       reliability concern. In May and June 2021, the Texas       Interconnection experienced widespread solar PV loss events       like those previously observed in the California area.       Similarly, four additional solar PV loss events occurred       between June and August 2021 in California.     This bill does not do what Democrats say it will do.

Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a Bloomberg News  story reporting how power costs are already forcing U.S. factories to  shut down, featuring an aluminum mill in my district, in Hawesville,  Kentucky.   This underscores the risk to our Nation's competitiveness that these  policies bring about, and this bill will not do what those on the floor  say that it will do.                    [From Bloomberg News, July 7, 2022]   The US Industrial Complex Is Starting To Buckle From High Power Costs                     (By Joe Deaux and Naureen S Malik)         It was only a matter of time, really.        Europe's fertilizer plants, steel mills, and chemical       manufacturers were the first to succumb. Massive paper mills,       soybean processors, and electronics factories in Asia went       dark.        Now soaring natural gas and electricity prices are starting       to hit the US industrial complex.        On June 22, 600 workers at the second-largest aluminum mill       in America, accounting for 20 percent of US supply, learned       they were losing their jobs because the plant can't afford an       electricity tab that's tripled in a matter of months. Century       Aluminum Co. says it'll idle the Hawesville, Kentucky, mill       for as long as a year, taking out the biggest of its three US       sites. A shutdown like this can take a month as workers       carefully swirl the molten metal into storage so it doesn't       solidify in pipes and vessels and turn the entire facility       into a useless brick. Restarting takes another six to nine       months. For this reason, owners don't halt operations unless       they've exhausted all other options.        It's the most poignant signal yet of what's to come-but not       the only one.        At least two steel mills have begun suspending some       operations to cut energy costs, according to one industry       executive, who asked not to be identified because the       information isn't public. In May, a group of factories across       the US Midwest warned federal energy regulators that some       were on the verge of closing for the summer or longer because       of what they described as ``unjust and unreasonable''       electricity costs. They asked to be wholly absolved of some       power fees-a request that, if granted, would be       unprecedented.        It's no wonder. By the beginning of June, natural gas       prices had tripled what they were a year earlier, threatening       households and businesses alike with some of the biggest       utility bills they've ever seen. This summer, electricity       rates for industrial customers are set to hit their highest       levels ever, based on US government forecasts. Because US       plants and factories depend on both electricity and gas, this       could very well be the moment the rug's pulled out from under       American industry.        Manufacturing overtime hours have already declined for       three straight months, the longest downward stretch since       2015, and a measure of US manufacturing activity weakened in       June to a two-year low as new orders contracted. A week after       Century's announcement, the nation's largest aluminum       producer Alcoa Corp. said it's closing a third of its       production at a mill in Indiana because of ``operational       challenges.''        These headwinds could eventually threaten what some see as       a longer-term boom in US manufacturing as corporations look       to reduce their dependence on China. Executives are       highlighting plans to relocate production at a greater clip       this year than they even did in the first six months of the       pandemic, but energy and labor costs will pose challenges for       any company looking to build a new operation in the US.        Manufacturing isn't the bellwether of the US economy it       once was. The plants that 70 years ago employed more than a       third of the nation's labor force now account for about 8       percent of nonfarm workers. An industrial downturn on its own       won't tip us into a recession, but it could if combined with       weakness in other sectors. While the might of American       industry has significantly weakened over the years, it still       accounts for more than a tenth of US gross domestic product-      and for that reason holds an outsize place in the hearts of       politicians whose factory visits are a perennial staple of       campaigns.        Plants will try to operate more efficiently to lower their       utility bills, but there are limits to how much they can       save. In a lot of regions, industrial users aren't just       paying for the power they use; they're also paying for what's       known as capacity, essentially an insurance policy that keeps       enough power on the grid for the most extreme of demand days.       (Think hot summer days when everyone's air conditioners are       blasting.) And with wholesale energy prices near the highest       levels since 2008 and aging power plants shutting, those       insurance premiums are growing exponentially, particularly in       the middle of the country where much of the country's       industrial operations lie.        One potential bright spot, or an indication of how       desperate industrial companies are becoming: Some are       partnering with startups to explore alternative energy       sources: Nature Energy says it expects to start building       facilities this year to collect and convert cow dung and crop       waste into renewable natural gas. Power Edison, which is       proposing to stack massive batteries on barges that can be       shipped around to customers in need, is attracting more       attention.        As Katie Coleman, an attorney for Texas Association of       Manufacturers, puts it, her members have three big cost       drivers: taxes, electricity, and labor. Those three vary in       proportion over time, she says, ``but right now, electricity       is an even larger factor than normal.'' Some companies with       multiple factories are trying to decide which plants to keep       running this summer based on how cheap they can get their       electricity, she says, and some may decide which to       permanently close. Such is the case for Century, which will       keep operations running in Iceland where power is incredibly       cheap because of local renewable energy resources.        There is a lot to blame for this year's surge in US energy       prices: Russia's invasion of Ukraine; the ensuing surge in US       natural gas exports to markets overseas; extreme weather       brought on by climate change; aging fossil-fuel-fired power       plants retiring at a record pace. They're all coinciding with       a sharp rebound in post-pandemic demand.        One group of manufacturers will say they told us so. The       Industrial Energy Consumers of America has been calling on       the Biden administration for months to limit the amount of       gas US energy suppliers send overseas, warning that exports       would eventually lead to supply shortages at home. But a       measure like that would set a dangerous precedent and       threaten the billions of dollar of investments in liquefied       natural gas terminals along US shores. Shipments overseas       have so far remained unfettered.        How severe of an industrial downturn we're heading into       depends on a lot of variables -chief among them being how       long energy prices remain high. Milder weather, fewer power       plant disruptions, and more solar and wind farm deployments       could shift the natural gas market back into an era of lower       prices and improve the fortunes of manufacturers. Today, we       are far from that.        Michael Harris, whose firm Unified Energy Services LLC buys       fuel for industrial clients, says costs have risen so high       that some are having to put millions of dollars of credit on       the line to secure power and gas contracts. ``That can be       devastating for a corporation,'' he says. ``I don't see any       scenario, absent explosions at US LNG facilities'' that trap       supplies at home, in which gas prices are headed lower in the       long term.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Balderson).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.       Madam Speaker, there is nothing in the bill that increases our  production of natural gas. The Methane Emissions Reduction Program is a  natural gas tax that will impact the entire economy. The natural gas  tax will make everything more expensive for American families. The  natural gas tax will increase the price of fuel, fertilizer, and food.   Madam Speaker, 180 million Americans use natural gas to heat homes  and run appliances. About 5\1/2\ million businesses use it to run their  workplaces and manufacturing facilities.   This bill will give EPA sweeping authority to expand the natural gas  tax to other sectors, including agriculture. There are no guardrails to  prevent the EPA from ratcheting up the natural gas tax in years ahead.
