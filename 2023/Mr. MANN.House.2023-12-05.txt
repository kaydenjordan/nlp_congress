 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of the Second  Amendment and in honor of Roger Theede, a freedom-loving American, gun  store owner, and Kansan who has been deeply wronged by President  Biden's politicized, weaponized Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms,  and Explosives.   My team and I have met with Roger, his coworker Jenny, and their team  in their store in Hutchinson, Kansas. Heartland Outdoor is a local,  family-owned small business in central Kansas where people buy their  hunting and recreational shooting supplies.   Roger has been a Federal firearm licensee for 30 years, during which  time he has never had a violation or sold a gun that has been involved  in a crime. He literally has decades of perfect scores from the ATF who  have held his store in the highest regard, an example of how a gun  store should be operated.   On ATF's most recent visit to Roger's store, however, agents found  minor, unwillful, debatable issues which they called willful, serious  violations. As a result, the ATF revoked Roger's license to sell  firearms and effectively took his livelihood away.   Sadly, this story is not unique. It is an example of the ATF abusing  President Biden's zero-tolerance policy, which he announced in June of  2021, and which resulted in a 500 percent spike in Federal firearm  license revocations across the country.   Enough is enough. This week, I am introducing the Reining In Federal  Licensing Enforcement Act. The RIFLE Act will hold the ATF accountable,  establish separate categories for minor and serious violations, clarify  the word ``willful'' as it applies to violations, and create an appeals  process for individuals whose licenses were revoked on or after  President Biden's zero-tolerance policy went into effect.   No gun store owner in America deserves to have his or her business  shut down over a typo on a form. No gun store owner deserves to be  forced to pay tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees just to appeal  the revocation of their license.   Apparently, since the Biden administration can't just do away with  the Constitution and our Second Amendment, shutting down our local gun  stores has become the strategy.   My legislation will stop that, defend the Second Amendment as a load- bearing wall in our system of rights, and honor Roger and lawful gun  store owners just like him.   I invite my colleagues to cosponsor the RIFLE Act to ensure that what  happened to Roger and to other lawful gun store owners across the U.S.  never, ever happens again.
