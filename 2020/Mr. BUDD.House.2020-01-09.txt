 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight one of the most  rewarding responsibilities I have as a Member of Congress: the honor of  nominating students to the service academies.   This past weekend, I met with my Service Academy Nomination Board for  North Carolina's 13th Congressional District to begin the review  process. This year's board includes Mr. Ronald Hope of Advance, Mr.  Matt Reyes of Mooresville, Mr. Doug Lain of High Point, Mrs. Rayne  Brown of Lexington, Mr. Wayne Davidson of Greensboro, Mr. John Sherden  of Mocksville, and Mr. Frank Pugh of Greensboro.   I am grateful that these individuals sacrificed their time and effort  to help review applications, interview candidates, and recommend  qualified individuals for the nominations. I look forward to announcing  our nominees in the coming weeks.   Madam Speaker, please join me in thanking the members of our board  and all the applicants who want to serve our great country.                            ____________________
