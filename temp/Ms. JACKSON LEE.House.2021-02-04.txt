 Madam Speaker, I rise with a somber spirit and a  heavy heart to be able to celebrate the law officers, the police  officers, who stood their ground on behalf of this citadel of democracy  on January 6.   Police officers were beaten, sprayed with mace, hit with stun guns,  and  [[Page H359]]  beaten with the United States flag and symbols of Nazism. You could see  their valiant efforts, the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police with  our own Capitol Police. They stood their ground, being beat  continuously by insurrectionists and, of course, domestic terrorists.   Madam Speaker, I offer today my deepest appreciation for them and  sympathy for their brothers who were lost in the fight to preserve  democracy. Yes, it was a fight because it was an attack on the United  States Capitol. We owe them a great deal of gratitude and, as well,  admiration.   Madam Speaker, I intend to introduce a resolution that will honor all  those who stood their ground and protected this place, Members of  Congress, and others, and were in the midst of a battle where so many  were hurt. I express my sympathy and concern for those still  hospitalized.   And I do say that it is important for us to say the simple words  thank you. Thank you to the men and women of the United States Capitol  Police, the Metropolitan Police Department, and, of course, our  National Guard, and others.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from New  York, first of all, for her courage and for convening us together. And  I might say to the gentlewoman that we are not doing this for  ourselves. We have taken an oath of office.   I have said this many times today as we debated a question of the  status of a Member. We took an oath to defend this Nation against all  enemies, foreign and domestic. And we realize that that oath is really  above our own personal safety; that if we were called upon by this  Nation to defend her, to defend our constituents, I would venture to  say that most Members would stand by their constituents and this  Nation.   This should not be taken as Members fleeing out of fear. But it  should be taken as an explanation and an expose' of what happened in  this place; how it was desecrated, undermined, diminished; how the  American people watched this precious place.   For those of us who have been here, I fled this place on 9/11. We  were in a meeting, and all you could hear is a lot of noise. Members  continuing to meet, not wanting to be disturbed, did not move until an  officer or screaming came, and we heard the noise saying, we don't know  what's going on, but get out.   In that instant, we fled, and all we could hear was, run as fast as  you can and hit the ground way on the other side near First Street and  the Supreme Court. I could see the billowing smoke and the plane that  had hit the Pentagon. And so, that fleeing, of course, was because we  were told to do so.   But Members began to look for their staff and wanted to know what  they could do. It was different from having a pandemic. It was  different from the setting here, except for the fact that Members cared  about what was going on with their constituency and their staff.    Here, we were in the same way. Members were protecting their staff in  their offices. So I want this not to be about us, but the story needs  to be told.   As you have already heard, there were those of us participating in  this debate, some on the floor, some in the gallery.   And I will tell you that the first thing I saw, Madam Speaker,  because we did not know of the huge crowds down near the White House.  We didn't know that there were people dancing to music inside the White  House, watching activities of attack here. But we did know about the  major speech that was provoking a crowd of insurrectionists that had  planned to come here and kill people.   But the first thing I saw was good friends here rising up out of  seats and moving out quickly. And only after they began to move did we  hear the words, Hurry up. Get out. Flee. Not necessarily flee, but the  first words I heard was our good leadership calling for the doors to be  closed. Thank them for that, our Sergeant at Arms, who are here in this  place.   As we fled, we could hear the attack coming from the Senate side, and  then we could hear the shooting that occurred right outside in the  cloakroom area. And we crouched there, and some of my good colleagues  and I began to pray.   I started out by saying this is not about us, but it is about truth.  And as I mourned and honored Officer Sicknick, as he was honored by  being in a state of honor in this House, I was reminded of the many  officers, Capitol Hill and Metro Police, that are in hospitals; that  are still hurting; and that are still suffering. And I said earlier  this evening that I offered to them my deepest concern and sympathy and  respect, and I will be introducing a resolution to honor them.   But I think the importance of this reliving what we went through is,  as I have heard from my colleagues, we must get to the bottom of this.  We cannot let white supremacy, which is now the number one terrorist  activity or terrorist group in America, more so than foreign  terrorists, dominate the goodness of what this democracy and this  Constitution stands for.   We can't let the idea of free speech be the source of the fueling of  hatred and anger that turns to violence. We can't let individuals storm  this building and call for the killing of the Vice President, or the  killing of the Speaker of the House, or the putting on of plastic cuffs  on Members of Congress.   We can't frighten Members of Congress in their offices. We cannot  allow this kind of attack on voices like the gentlewoman from New York  who simply wants to tell truth. She has freedom.   So I am here on the floor to say that we shall not be denied. We are  never going to give up our love for democracy nor its vitality; nor are  we going to let this country be dominated by the insurrectionists who  came to this place to do nothing but act in a bloodthirsty manner. We  are not afraid of you.   And yes, on behalf of all of those officers that the video showed us  that were beaten by American flags, beaten with signs of Nazism, we are  going to get to the bottom of this for you. We are going to find out  what happened.   We are going to find out why the information came from the FBI to the  City of Washington, D.C., and their police, and it was evident that it  was given to the brass here, but that there was no response in terms of  the kind of equipment or the numbers of officers that were there, or  why wasn't permission given to the mayor of the City of Washington to  call up the National Guard.                                time  1930    Why did this President deny access to the National Guard to protect,  not us, but this place of democracy?  [[Page H362]]    I am grateful for this opportunity. We have work to do. But I think  the greatest statement that we can make tonight, that we are in the  light of day on this floor, as I said before, not for us, but to be  able to stand in the shoes of all those heroes who fought in different  ways, whether it was in the peace movement, whether it was in the civil  rights movement, Black power movement, whether it was Cesar Chavez  fighting for farmworkers--people who fought to make a difference for  goodness.   For all of those patriots, all of those fallen leaders, some  assassinated like Dr. Martin Luther King, we cannot stand and allow the  voices of those who provided horror to this place to suggest to the  world that they have overcome us.   I close by simply saying to the world that we had a day, January 6,  an attack on this place, insurrectionists and domestic terrorists  penetrated the United States Capitol, but they never penetrated the  strength of the Constitution and our values and our commitment to  protect democracy, but also to give respect and comfort to those who  lost their lives on that day or thereafter, in terms of our law  enforcement officers, and sadness for those unfortunately who lost  their life by being misguided, but also to be able to say that this is  a place that we will hold sacred.   We will be victorious. White supremacy, insurrectionists, and also  domestic terrorism will not prevail over us. We will win, and we will  win for the many Americans who believe in the goodness of this country.   I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, and I thank her so very  much for her courage.
