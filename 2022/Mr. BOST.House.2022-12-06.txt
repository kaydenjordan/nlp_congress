 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California for yielding  the time for me to speak today.   I rise in opposition to this legislation. This bill is unnecessary  and creates additional carve-outs to an already broken immigration  system.   Right now, DHS can't even do their job of securing the southern  border and enforcing current immigration law. Just last month, we saw  the highest number of got-aways ever at the southern border. That is  73,000 individuals that evaded Border Patrol.   DHS agents and staff are overwhelmed and overworked. We should not be  adding more to their plate when they already struggle to secure the  border.   Now, as a veteran, I greatly appreciate those who are willing to  raise their right hand and swear to protect our Nation and our  Constitution, and I served with many of them.   Even though an individual is a veteran, that shouldn't excuse or  create an excuse for poor judgment or criminal activity, and I fear  that this bill may encourage just that.   We already have a pathway for individuals who are serving our country  in uniform to stay here in the U.S. and become citizens. Instead of  this bill that we are debating today, we should improve the information  provided to our servicemembers during the Transition Assistance Program  on how to upgrade their immigration status. Making improvements to the  TAP has been and will continue to be a top priority of mine.   During that time, we could explain to them, once again, how important  it is to follow the laws and the Constitution, which they fought to  uphold.   Next Congress, I plan to be working on the TAP to ensure a smooth  transition to civilian life for all of our servicemembers, but on this  bill, I urge a ``no'' vote.
