 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor the Harkness Hotel as the Idaho Small  Business of the Month for December 2022.   Aaron and Arianne Hunsaker opened the Harkness Hotel in July 2014.  The Harkness Hotel was a personal project for the couple, who decided  to move from Washington, DC, back to Aaron's home State and open a  luxury hotel after they stayed in a memorable but mediocre  establishment for their honeymoon.   They searched statewide for a historic building to renovate, before  finally purchasing the old McCammon Investment Company in 2013. Built  in 1906, the McCammon Investment Company was located less than a block  away from the original Harkness Hotel, lost in a fire over 100 years  ago. The Hunsakers drew inspiration from the legacy of the Harkness  Hotel and set out to transform the old bank--which included apartments,  a general mercantile store, and a post office--into an award-winning  boutique hotel.   The Harkness Hotel blends the historic beauty of the past with modern  comforts with an on-site spa and salon for the enjoyment of residents  and visitors. Both ran and designed by the Hunsaker family, the  Harkness Hotel serves as a symbol of pride for the McCammon community  and highlights Idaho's natural beauty and genuine hospitality.   Congratulations to the Hunsakers and all of the employees at the  Harkness Hotel for being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the  Month for December 2022. Thank you for serving Idaho as small business  owners and entrepreneurs. You make our great State proud, and I look  forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
