 Mr. President, I congratulate U.S. Marine Capt.  Anneliese Satz, of Boise, ID, on her many achievements, including being  the first woman to fly the F-35 fighter jet for the U.S. Marine Corps.  Above all, I thank Captain Satz for her service to our Nation.   In June, Captain Satz became the first female marine to complete the  F-35B basic course. Before she joined the Marines, she earned her  commercial pilots license flying helicopters. I understand Captain Satz  has been assigned to her first operational unit: The Green Knights of  Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121 in Iwakuni, Japan.   My home State of Idaho is full of trailblazers. Among them are the  women who are leaders, innovators and architects of a new reality where  the ``first woman to . . .'' is rightfully becoming a descriptor of the  past. Captain Satz is a courageous marine fighter jet pilot. She is  also a groundbreaker who worked hard to complete her training and  prepare for her service ahead.   Thank you, Anneliese, for your service to our country and for your  hard work and great leadership. Your preparation and diligence are  commendable. You are showing young Americans and adults alike through  your example of dedication and proficiency that high goals are  achievable.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I congratulate Jane Wittmeyer, who  is retiring after a more than 40-year career in Federal, State,  agricultural, and natural resources policy work.   Jane has provided knowledgeable, helpful, and insightful counsel to  many throughout her decades of dedicated service. Jane managed my  Washington, DC, office, for 4 years during my time serving in the U.S.  House of Representatives. She brought with her the experience she  gained working previously for two former U.S. Senators for Idaho,  Senators Steve Symms and James McClure, and serving in positions at the  U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA. Her work at USDA included serving  as Deputy Manager for USDA's Federal Crop Insurance Corporation. Jane  was invaluable in helping me get started in Congress. She came aboard  to run my DC office at the beginning of my tenure in the U.S. House of  Representatives. Her knowledge and understanding of the procedures,  policies, and politics in Congress were useful, as I, as a freshman in  the minority, worked to best represent Idaho. She had a deep  understanding of Idaho through her previous work for Senators McClure  and Symms, and I always knew I could count on her advice and opinions  to help me make good decisions on legislation and other matters. Jane  left my office to return to Idaho and join the Intermountain Forest  Association.   Most recently, for the past 15 years, Jane has operated her own  government affairs firm, Wittmeyer and Associates, assisting many in  the timber, agricultural, and other related industries. Jane is direct  and personable. She recognizes the great value in and makes use of  bringing multiple perspectives to the table to advance a common cause.  She has lent her energy and expertise into getting countless things  done for Idahoans and others. I have been one of the lucky people to  benefit greatly from having Jane on my team. Her thoughtful guidance is  a true asset.   I understand that in retirement, Jane plans to find something she can  do to help people in addition to traveling and spending time with  family and friends. That does not surprise me. Jane has dedicated much  of her time to helping others, through identifying solutions, providing  experienced advocacy on their behalf, assisting with navigating State  and Federal policies, and more. Thank you, Jane, for your outstanding  work and friendship all these years. Congratulations on an exemplary  career. I wish you all the best for a retirement filled with great  happiness you so deeply deserve.                            ____________________
