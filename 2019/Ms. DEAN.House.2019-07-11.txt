 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the committee and I also  thank the designee for yielding me this time.   I am pleased to introduce two amendments to the National Defense  Authorization Act that deal with PFAS contamination issues.   The first amendment, amendment 125, provides an additional $5 million  for the nationwide Centers for Disease Control and the Agency for Toxic  Substances and Disease Registry PFAS health study, authorizing a total  of $15 million for this critical research.   We know that PFAS chemicals are linked to devastating health  consequences and are present in 99 percent of Americans, but many  questions remain unanswered. This study will help get the answers our  constituents deserve and the solutions we need.                                time  1930    I thank Representatives Kildee, Fitzpatrick, Upton, Pappas, Boyle,  Rouda, and others for cosponsoring this amendment.   The second amendment, Amendment No. 126, phases out the Department of  Defense's use of AFFF firefighting foam by 2025, reducing PFAS  contamination and protecting our communities.   The amendment also substantially limits the Department of Defense's  ability to use waivers from 6 years to 1 year. Currently, the  Department of Defense can use waivers that allow the use of AFFF  firefighting foam up to 2035, almost a decade longer than this phaseout  provision would allow.   I thank, again, Representatives Kildee and Pappas for supporting this  amendment.   I also thank Chairman Smith and his extraordinary staff for working  with me on these critically important issues.
