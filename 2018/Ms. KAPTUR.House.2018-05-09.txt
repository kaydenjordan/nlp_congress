 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor northwest Ohio's own Rogers  High School women's basketball team on their monumental achievement of  winning the Division II State Championship. This breaks a nearly 37- year drought in women's basketball State titles for the city of Toledo.   The joy of their victory is shared by everyone in Toledo: the  students, coaches, families, friends, teachers, and loved ones. The  city even honored the Rams with a ceremony at Promenade Park.   Well deserved, Rams.   Each member of this team has now chiseled their name into the history  books. What a great start for this young generation of future leaders,  the players who worked so hard for this.   Go Rams. You have made Toledo proud, as you set your sights on  excellence.   I include in the Record an article written for the Toledo Blade  titled, ``Toledo Celebrates Rogers Girls Basketball State Champions.''   Thank you, Rams.                   [From the Toledo Blade, Apr. 21, 2018]         Toledo Celebrates Rogers Girls Basketball State Champions                           (By Lauren Lindstrom)         The whooping cheers, celebratory signs, and ample crowd       Saturday made one thing clear: Toledo loves its championship-      winning Lady Rams.        Rogers High School girls basketball players were feted with       a parade through the streets of downtown Toledo and a rally       at Promenade Park, where they basked in the admiration of       their ardent and vocal fans.        The team won the Division II state championship game March       17 in Columbus with a 51-37 victory against Gilmour Academy       in Gates Mills, Ohio. First-team all-state guard Zia Cooke       scored 33 points, sealing the first girls basketball state       title for a Toledo team since 1981.        ``I want to thank you for all of the Toledo support,'' said       Miss Cooke, a junior point guard who also thanked her       coaches, teammates, and parents. ``Toledo may be a small       city, but our fan base is bigger than most. Man, it's a       blessing to be a state champion in 2018.''        Miss Cooke teared up when talking about her grandmother,       who died late in the team's season.        ``She was my drive to do better, and she still is my drive       to be a better person in life,'' she said. ``I made this       promise to her, and I kept it.''        Rogers head coach Lamar Smith reveled in his team's       underdog status.        ``They said we couldn't bring this home, we've been hearing       it: Rogers is done, Toledo can't win a state championship,''       he said. ``Well, we proved them wrong. I'm very proud of       these ladies.''        Those who spoke Saturday highlighted not only the players'       athletic successes but also their status as role models for       younger students.        ``It's important as a city that we celebrate our successes;       that we have pride in Toledo, pride in TPS, pride in where we       come from,'' said Toledo Public Schools Superintendent       Romules Durant. He lauded the girls' success on the court and       in the classroom.        ``Our ladies represent what Toledo is all about,'' he said.       ``The minute they begin to think they can count us out we       continue to keep fighting . . . these are our leaders today,       our leaders tomorrow, and more importantly [they're] leading       the city of Toledo as we move to the future.''        Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz presented the team with a       key to the city and congratulated the players and coaches.        ``For an occasion this historic and a moment this       important, we're going to go to the big guns,'' he said as he       presented the key. ``Post it with pride and--no pressure--      let's do this again next year.''        Members from the 1981 Libbey High School team were on hand       to celebrate the next generation of champions.        ``They are going to have a lifetime of memories,'' said Ann       Strong, a center forward and class of 1981. ``We still talk       after 37 years about our state championship win. They have a       lot to look forward to and talk about for years to come. It's       a great feeling.''                            ____________________
