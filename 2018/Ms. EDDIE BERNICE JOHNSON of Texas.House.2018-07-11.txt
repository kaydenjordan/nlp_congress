 Mr. Speaker, while the Trump  administration has clearly taken steps to reunite immigrant children  with their families, there are still 100 children under the age of five  in the government's custody. The court ordered deadline to reunite all  of these children with their parents was yesterday. The Departments of  Homeland Security and Health and Human Services must continue to make  it a top priority to locate these children's parents and reunite these  families in a timely manner.   The Trump administration's inhumane ``zero-tolerance'' policy was  finally stopped by the President, but the terrible effects of this  policy continue. DHS' poor recordkeeping has resulted in the prolonged  separation of these children. Twelve of these children's parents have  already been deported, making it much more difficult for them to  reunite with their children. The Department of Homeland Security has  had to resort to DNA testing to ensure that children are properly  reunited, a costly and tedious process that prolongs the trauma these  children are experiencing. This excess cost to American taxpayers could  easily have been avoided had the Trump administration thought about the  reunification process rather than solely focusing on separating  children from their parents.   These children have already endured an incredibly dangerous journey  from their home countries, and the Trump administration has subjected  them to even more suffering. The American Medical Association has  stated that separation from parents can cause lifelong psychological  trauma for these children, particularly children who are under the age  of five. Sadly, there are already reports of children who no longer  recognize their parents after these prolonged periods of separation.   The Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services  must take immediate action to expedite the process of reunification,  and Congress must use its legislative authority to hold these  departments accountable and ensure that these human rights violations  are corrected. Children have been taken from their parents, and it is  all of our responsibility to ensure that this administration are  reuniting them as quickly as possible.                            ____________________
