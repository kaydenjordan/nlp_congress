 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Madam President, I come to the floor tonight to discuss  the troubling state of judicial nominations before the Senate. This  week, we are voting on, among others, two district court nominees-- Campbell Barker and Andrew Brasher--who have, in my judgment, very  concerning records.   Just several weeks ago, Senate Republicans changed the Senate rules  so that they can continue to put on the Federal bench highly  ideological and sometimes unqualified jurists who have the corporate  stamp of approval but I don't think the mainstream stamp of approval.  Under new Senate rules, these nominees will receive only 2 hours of  postcloture consideration time on the Senate floor, but if confirmed,  they would sit on the Federal bench for life. So 2 hours postcloture  for a lifetime appointment.   I will start with Mr. Campbell Barker, who has been nominated to the  U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. He has a  troubling record from his time as deputy solicitor general of the State  of Texas. In 2016, he defended Texas's voter ID law, which the Fifth  Circuit said violated the Voting Rights Act because it prevented  minority voters from exercising their right to vote.   Second, Mr. Barker submitted amicus briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court  attacking the Affordable Care Act. In those briefs, he argued that the  individual mandate is unconstitutional--a position rejected by the U.S.  Supreme Court. He also opposed the contraceptive coverage mandate,  which was a critical part of the ACA's efforts to make sure that women  have access to the medical care they need. He also signed amicus briefs  arguing that businesses should be allowed to discriminate against LGBT  customers and supporting the President's travel ban, which, in my  judgment, was a bigoted policy that discriminated against the Muslim  community.   The second nominee I will make some comments about tonight is Mr.  Andrew Brasher, a nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Middle  District of Alabama. Like Mr. Barker, Mr. Brasher has a troubling  record from his time in the state solicitor general's office. In 2014,  he defended the Alabama State redistricting scheme, which a Federal  court determined violated the Constitution because it packed African- American voters into a few districts, diluting the power of their vote  on the basis of their race.   Similar to Mr. Barker, Mr. Brasher challenged the contraceptive  mandate in the Affordable Care Act and argued that the reasonable  accommodations made for religious nonprofits were still too  burdensome--an argument that the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals  rejected.   In 2015, he submitted an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court  arguing against the right of same-sex couples to marry--a position the  Supreme Court has rejected.   Lastly, Mr. Brasher submitted amicus briefs to the Supreme Court  arguing against commonsense gun laws, such as age requirements for gun  purchases and restrictions on concealed carry licenses.   There is no good reason why we should be confirming these judges with  these troubling records on matters of critical importance to many  Americans. There is no shortage of qualified, mainstream attorneys or  judges, State court judges and other judges across the country. Of  course, in the case of a Republican Senate and Republican President,  these judges are often Republican in their party affiliation or by way  of their philosophy, but I think there is often a big difference  between a conservative jurist or potential judge who has a conservative  view on issues--that is different from being extreme right, as many of  these nominees are.   Just by way of contrast to these nominees and others we will be  considering, Senator Toomey and I have worked together jointly to  recommend experienced, consensus nominees for Federal district courts  in Pennsylvania. Everyone knows we are in different parties. We have  different views. We rarely vote together. But we have figured out a way  on most days--not every day, not every nominee or potential nominee,  but on most days--to work together to try to find consensus for  district court nominees.   I want to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey, for  his commitment to our process over these many years we have served  together now, since 2011. This process has allowed us to confirm 18  Federal judges to the 3 Federal district courts in Pennsylvania since  2011. We have five others who are being considered by the Senate now,  including Joshua Wolson, whose nomination is on the floor this week. I  returned a blue slip and will vote for Josh Wolson. He is experienced.  He has strong academic credentials. He is a conservative. He probably  [[Page S2530]]  wouldn't be my first pick, but I am supporting him. He has been a  partner at a distinguished Philadelphia law firm, the Dilworth Paxson  firm, since 2008 and has both the ability and I think the integrity to  serve as a Federal district court judge. So that is a demonstration  that this process can work when you have consensus, even between  Senators who don't often vote together.   This is a bipartisan process. It requires both parties to work very  hard. It requires our staff to work hard. It requires consensus. It has  required several White Houses now--the Obama administration's White  House, as well as the Trump administration--to work with us. But we  found a way to make it work on most days.   This bipartisan district court process is indeed the exception, not  the rule. In so many other instances, especially with regard to circuit  court nominees, we have seen extreme nominees being pushed through. The  rule change that I referred to earlier that cut the postcloture time to  just 2 hours means there is very little time to fully consider nominees  to these lifetime appointments to the Bench. The Judiciary Committee  has stacked multiple circuit court nominees in single hearings, giving  Senators on the Judiciary Committee less time to ask nominees  questions.   Circuit court nominees now receive votes over the objection of their  home state Senators. That is new. That wasn't happening just a few  years ago, and it wasn't happening many years before that.   The blue-slip process has been eviscerated for circuit court judicial  nominees. That is a loss for the Senate, which may be the only body in  the world that has the kind of rules that govern our work so that we  will arrive at a consensus by empowering the minority to work with the  majority to arrive at that consensus. It is a loss for the Senate, but  it is also a loss for our constituents who are served by Federal  district courts and Federal circuit courts.   Last year, the Senate confirmed David Porter to the Third Circuit  Court of Appeals in Pennsylvania--Pennsylvania being one of the States  represented in the circuit. That nomination and confirmation was over  my objection as a home State Senator. This was in spite of my record of  bipartisan work on judicial nominations. My record now goes back over  the course of three Presidencies and different Senates--Democratic  Senate, Republican Senate. Despite all the bipartisan work, this  nominee was both nominated and confirmed without my consent.   For the first time in history, we have confirmed two judges to the  circuit court--Eric Miller and Paul Matey--without the consent of any  home State Senators, meaning you have two Democratic Senators who did  not give consent, and now they have been confirmed. I don't think that  is good for the Senate in the long run. I am certain it is not good for  our constituents, as I said. I think they would prefer judges who come  through a process where there is a degree of consensus, including all  of the vetting that these nominees go through.   This isn't how the process is supposed to work. This process is  supposed to be one of advice and consent. Advice and consent as to  nominating people for lifetime appointments to the Federal courts,  especially the circuit courts, has been gutted. ``Gutted'' might be an  understatement. These nominees will impact not just the lives of the  parties before them in court, but, of course, the lives of all  Americans.   It is true that in our system, one Federal judge can affect the whole  country. We know that from our history. And that includes both district  court judges, as well as circuit court judges.   In the case of circuit court judges, often that is the last stop.  Very few cases are briefed and argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. In  many cases, the last stop is the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. For  all intents and purposes, that becomes the Supreme Court for a lot of  cases--the highest level of review.   I hope we can return to a more inclusive process that focuses on  putting experienced, mainstream judges on the bench rather than ramming  through--and that is the best way to describe what has been happening  lately--nominees with views and with records that are out of the  mainstream. I would argue for purposes of the near-term votes that both  Mr. Barker and Mr. Brasher would not fit under the umbrella of being  mainstream.   I think there are plenty of folks around here in the Senate who would  like to work together to arrive at more of a consensus. It doesn't mean  that we will not have disagreements; it doesn't mean that one side will  not have a different point of view. But I think someone can be  conservative and philosophically aligned with one party or one point of  view without being so far out of the mainstream that a lot of Americans  would consider them extreme.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
