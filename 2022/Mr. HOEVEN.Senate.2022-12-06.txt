 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed  with the vote.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to make 5-minute  remarks before the vote is called.    Mr. President, I wanted to get to the floor today to say  thank you to some colleagues that are truly deserving of it. There are  three of them here. My understanding is that Senator Shelby, or ``The  Chairman,'' as I call him, has not yet made his farewell speech, so I  am going to reserve my laudatory comments for somebody who I will  always consider ``the chairman'' of the Appropriations Committee, even  when he is the ranking member and even when he is not here. He is truly  the chairman, and I have learned so much from him and am deeply  appreciative for his incredible work and want to talk about that at  greater length after he has made his floor speech.
