 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to this Republican-only compromise immigration bill. The  only thing that is compromised in this legislation is America's source  of strength as a nation of immigrants.   This bill guts asylum protections for those fleeing danger and dashes  the hopes of legal immigrants seeking to reunite with family members.  It continues this Presidential Ponzi scheme of forcing taxpayers to buy  an expensive but useless border wall that Trump promised Mexico would  pay for.   As a mother and, frankly, as a human being, this bill makes my  stomach turn. Despite Republican crocodile tears, this bill doesn't put  an end to the Trump administration's child abuse, and our innocent  Dreamers would be forced to navigate a confusing path to citizenship  that could take 20 years.   Just like with taxes and healthcare, Republicans just refuse to reach  across the aisle to address our Nation's challenges. The President put  children on our borders in fenced cages, and Americans were revolted.  With this bill, Republicans in Congress are about to put Lady Liberty  in a fenced cage, which would be equally revolting.
