 Madam Speaker, today we proclaim that no  person is above the law, not even the President of the United States.   Donald J. Trump abused the power of his office and violated his oath  of office by extorting a new and inexperienced President of a  vulnerable foreign ally to dig up dirt on Mr. Trump's domestic  political opponents.   He then obstructed the Congress, this equal branch of our government,  from undertaking our duty, outlined in the Constitution itself, to  investigate and check these violations.   Today, we do nothing more and nothing less than fulfill our duty to  our country and to our Constitution.  [[Page H12187]]    Mr. Trump has allowed foreign powers to interfere in our domestic  affairs. He has endangered our national security and our democracy  itself. Madam Speaker, for those reasons, we must impeach this  President.
