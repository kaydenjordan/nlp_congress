 Madam President, I support the nomination of Robert  Lighthizer to be the United States Trade Representative.   Trade agreements should meet two tests: Does the agreement improve  worker wages? And does the agreement add American jobs? For far too  long, U.S. Trade Representatives have prioritized profits of large  multinational organizations over the interests of the American people  and our country as a whole.  [[Page S2901]]    The USTR should be someone who negotiates on behalf of the American  worker and advances labor and environmental protections, and the USTR  should be someone who works to enforce agreements. While I don't agree  with everything in Mr. Lighthizer's resume, his record suggests that he  will be a USTR who will approach trade policies in the ways I have  outlined. I hope the approach he takes going forward will reflect the  positions he has taken in the past. I expect him to ask: Does it  improve worker wages? And does it add American jobs?   I believe that Mr. Lighthizer will bring fresh eyes to trade policy.  I hope that he will focus on increasing transparency at the USTR. I  hope that he will stand up for worker rights, both domestically and  internationally. I hope that Mr. Lighthizer will work to enforce trade  policies that protect the environment.
