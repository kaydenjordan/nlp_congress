 Mr. President, November 2016 marked the 100th  anniversary of the founding of McCormick County, the smallest and  second youngest county in South Carolina. Known as the Gem of the  Freshwater Coast, McCormick's rich history dates back to before our  Nation's founding. The first overt act of the American Revolution in  South Carolina occurred in McCormick County, at Fort Charlotte near  Mount Carmel on July 12, 1775. McCormick continued to grow after the  discovery of gold in 1850 and the expansion of the railroad. Today  McCormick is known for its ``Natural Pace of Life,'' with ample outdoor  recreation opportunities and hospitable citizens.   On behalf of South Carolina and all of us here in the Senate, I offer  congratulations to the entire McCormick County community on reaching  this milestone. Best wishes for continued success and  prosperity.                            ____________________
