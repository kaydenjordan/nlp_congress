 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding time so that I can speak, and not just in support of this  legislation, but in strong support of the legislation by my colleague  and friend from Michigan (Mr. Trott).   In the short time I have been in Congress, Mr. Speaker, one thing I  have come to realize, there are some people in this Chamber who never  met a regulation that they didn't like. Regardless of how effective or  ineffective or misguided that regulation is, or how outdated the  regulation is, they always just want to hold on to a piece of  government regulation.   I, too, appreciate the ranking member for going through the litany of  mission statements of special interest groups here in Washington, D.C.  But this is precisely what the American people are tired of. They are  tired of the Washington, D.C., swamp. They are tired of the special  interests, and they want legislation that affects them personally. This  piece of legislation will affect millions of Americans directly.   Now, I am not just speaking today from prepared remarks, which I  have, but I am speaking from someone with experience in this area. I  spent 30 years, Mr. Speaker, in the IT services business. Ten of those  years I spent protecting some of our Nation's secrets, through military  intelligence, and then working in the defense industry. Twenty of those  years I had my own business, and we were responsible for protecting the  sensitive information of businesses and their customers. So I am well  versed in the idea of protection, and, as a constitutional  conservative, I am very sensitive to privacy protection.   This piece of legislation is commonsense legislation. It is exactly  what the American people want us to pass, and I can give you some great  examples of why, because one of the aspects of security, especially  data security, is being continually aware of the threat.   Now, what happens--and I remember when this happened. I was still in  my IT business when the original legislation was passed; and all of a  sudden, I am receiving a privacy notice of what my rights are, and,  unlike most Americans, I sat down and actually read all of it.   Now, where the confusion came in is when, a year later, I receive  another one, and then I receive another one, and I am literally  comparing the two to see what has changed, and I find out that nothing  has changed.   So what was the reaction after that? Every time I get a notice in a  big envelope, instead of just a bank statement, I would just take it  and throw it in the trash, not knowing if something has actually  changed, which would be important.   Now, Mr. Luetkemeyer, another colleague of mine on the Financial  Services Committee, passed a bill 2 years ago to provide correction to  that problem. All Mr. Trott's bill is doing now is expanding that to  other industries.   This is a consumer protection bill because now, if someone in those  industries, if there is a change, they receive a notice, they know that  there has been a change.   But, as the chairman has pointed out time and time again, this is  actually going to give more immediate access to know what the privacy  policy is of financial institutions, to identify if there have been any  changes because they can go online to see it. I mean, you can get that  instantaneous with these devices that almost everyone carries. It is  time to bring us up into the current century and the technology that we  have.   So I commend my colleague on actually bringing commonsense  legislation, the type of legislation that Americans want, that  consumers want. They want to know what their rights are, but they don't  want to be inundated with useless information continually, over and  over again, because then they would actually not be aware of what their  rights are and what has changed.   Now, this is especially beneficial to Georgia because Georgia has  become an auto manufacturing hub. And as we continue to grow this  economy, and more people--I believe in the next few days, when we pass  this tax bill, you are going to see a rise in people buying  automobiles. Why? Because they are going to have more money in their  back pocket. They are going to spend more money, and they are going to  be taking out more loans.   So we need to make sure that they know immediately what their privacy  rights are, and this bill will make it to where those will be available  online.  [[Page H9912]]  This simply makes--it right-sizes government by making government  smarter, more effective, and, actually, that the regulation is tailored  toward the consumer, not toward the special interest groups and the  trial lawyers in Washington, D.C.    Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation. I urge my  colleagues to join me in a favorable vote for this.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Again, it is interesting how my colleagues on the opposite side of  the aisle describe their consumers. These are people, they say, who  don't want to be inundated with useless information. They are saying  that the privacy information is of no use.   It is interesting that Mr. Loudermilk said he read his privacy  notice, unlike most other Americans who don't read their privacy  notice. I think that is very interesting to describe himself as someone  who read his privacy notice, but able to speak for all other Americans  who don't read their privacy notice.   What is very interesting also about his comments is he refers to the  consumer groups as special interests, while he is representing the  banks and the financial institutions, the real special interests.   Why is it Representatives who come to this Congress to represent  people who vote for them somehow see their responsibility to protect  the real special interests, such as the financial institutions who have  lobbyists running up and down these Halls every day, who make  contributions to Members of Congress, rather than the consumers who are  represented by the kinds of groups that I have taken time to describe  here this morning, because these individuals and the average citizen do  not have paid lobbyists from financial institutions and banks  representing them here.   So it is also interesting that Mr. Loudermilk talked about how many  of these consumers are going to be buying automobiles because of the  tax fraud bill that he is referring to that is being advanced by the  opposite side of the aisle. The only thing that bill is going to do for  consumers, which will hurt our economy, is create a $1.5 trillion debt.   Well, he said that consumers were going to be buying more cars. Yeah,  the wealthy will be, the ones who are given the breaks in this tax  bill. The wealthy may be buying more automobiles, but the very people  who are represented by these consumers that I have shared the  information on this morning, they won't be able to buy automobiles  because they are going to be harmed. It is only the wealthy, only those  who are making extraordinary amounts of money, and corporations, that  are going to benefit from the tax bill.   I don't even know how and why he talked about it in the same breath  that we are talking about our consumers being able to be respected with  privacy information that they would get because we have laws that give  them the right to have this information.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I don't intend to take 30 minutes, but  the time that I do spend is very important, because I want to honor a  very, very special person.   First of all, let me start off by wishing you a Merry Christmas. I  say that because, as we are getting into the season, many of us are  thinking about family and friends and spending Christmastime at home,  which I hope to be able to do as well.   Every Christmas season my thought goes back about 73 years ago. You  see, my dad was a medic in World War II, and December 16, which will be  just a few days from now, will be the 73rd anniversary of one of the  largest, most significant battles of World War II: the Battle of the  Bulge.   My father was a medic in the Battle of the Bulge, and I still  remember the stories he used to tell of the cold weather and the snow  and how, when the Germans broke through the Siegfried Line, they  decimated American forces--we lost thousands and thousands of troops in  those few days--how the snow was just so heavy and so thick that many  were trapped in their foxholes, unable to escape. Many retreated back  to areas of safety and the lines behind.   But I don't want to talk about my dad here today. I want to talk  about someone else, a dear friend of mine, someone I got to serve in  the Georgia Legislature with. It was another young Georgian from  Spalding County who was a pilot in the Army Air Corps.   Now, Captain John Yates was not what you may think of. Most people  think of an Army Air Corps pilot flying a B-29 or a B-25 Mitchell. What  John Yates flew was a small, single-engine Piper Cub aircraft. He was a  liaison pilot.   Now, most people aren't familiar with what a liaison pilot is, but  they played a very crucial and critical role in the victory in Europe  in World War II and even in the Pacific theater.   You see, as a pilot, I have a lot of appreciation for someone who  will fly a very small plane. I mean, I am a pretty tall guy. I don't  fit in the cockpit of a Piper Cub very well.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would like to just take a moment and  recognize another anniversary. Six months ago today, on a baseball  field just a few miles from here, I and several of our colleagues found  ourselves in a combat zone of our own.   It doesn't seem like it has been 6 whole months since a crazed gunman  walked onto our field and started shooting at us. But the reason I want  to bring that up today is because every person on that field that day  who was shot at is still in this House today and still walking around  in Washington, D.C.   By the grace of God, we were protected during that time, and I just  want to thank everyone for their prayers and support, and those who  responded to that event and came out and saved the lives of many of us.   Steve Scalise, the whip whom we serve with here; Matt Mika, one of  our staff members; Zack Barth, a congressional staffer; and Capitol  Police Special Agent Crystal Griner all were wounded during that  battle, and it really was a battle.   But I also want to highlight some of those who did not leave the  field that day, who stayed and helped others; people like my good  friend from Mississippi, Congressman Trent Kelly, an Army Reservist,  who, when he identified the shooter, did not panic, but he alerted  others, and then eventually led many to safety behind a concrete  building.   Representative Mo Brooks stayed and helped apply a tourniquet to Zack  Barth who had been shot in the calf.   Representative Brad Wenstrup, who is also a colonel in the Army  Reserves, a combat doctor, was out on the edge of the field and could  have easily run away, but he stayed and was one of the first to be able  to run out and give aid to Steve Scalise out on the field as he lay  near second base.   Retired Lieutenant General Representative Jack Bergman was able to  actually lead several of our players and staff members to safety inside  of the dugout away from the gunfire.   Brian Kelly, a civilian staff member on the team, stayed with me  throughout the gunfire as we tried to lend aid to Matt Mika who was  lying next to the Capitol Police SUV throughout the entire incident.   Finally, my thanks go out to Special Agent David Bailey, who I  personally watched on numerous occasions put his own life in danger as  he would move out into the line of fire to draw fire away from myself  and Brian Kelly. He saw that, whenever the shooter was not shooting at  Capitol Police, they were shooting at us so he would purposely move  himself in the line of fire, and again, miraculously protected us, even  as one of the rounds hit his cellphone which deflected away from his  body.   Lastly, I want to thank the Alexandria Police Department, who came to  our aid and eventually took down the shooter.   Moments like this are surreal to me and to others, and it is  important that we go back and reflect and remember these moments.  Because the only way that we can correct mistakes from our past, is if  we go back and we relive them and we look at what caused this.    As we stand here today, one of the things that I see that we need in  America that we have lost is the idea of civility. We have heard here  on the floor  [[Page H9936]]  today differing opinions regarding policy; ideas of what is good for  this country, what is right for this country. That is part of the  strength of this country. That is the freedom that we have, which is to  bring different ideas.   The whole idea of this Chamber is to bring different ideas and  different policy opinions to the floor and debate them, and those ideas  and opinions that have the support of a majority of the Members are  moved forward.   But at some point in the past, we have transitioned beyond just  arguing over ideas and we bring rhetoric that is distasteful. We attack  the person and their families. I just believe that we can do a whole  lot better in this Nation if we, once again, find the ability to agree  to disagree and respect the rights, freedom, and the liberty of the  other person to have their opinion. If we can do that, then we can  engage in discourse and we will lessen the amount of violence that we  see that is driven by political rhetoric.   That would be the message that I would pass off to America on the  anniversary of the shooting because that is the idea that people like  John Yates lived their lives for and fought their battles for, was for  the freedom that we have in this Nation to continue to exist.   I believe America's greatest days are ahead of us, but we have got a  little work to do to actually grasp hold of it.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to honor the memory of my  good friend and colleague, John Yates.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
