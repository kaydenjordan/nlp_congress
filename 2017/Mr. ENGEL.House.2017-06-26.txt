 Madam Speaker, after Hurricane Sandy, thousands of  homeowners throughout the New York region learned that they were  ineligible for federal disaster assistance because they lived in a co- op or a condo; not in a single family home.   According to the FEMA's policy, co-ops and condo associations are  ``business entities''--not eligible for federal assistance that can  reach up to $30,000 per household.   As a result, community associations are often faced with the daunting  task of cleaning up and rebuilding after a major natural disaster-- without the help or resources that other homeowners receive from the  federal government.   To help bring fairness to the federal disaster relief process, my  colleague Jerry Nadler and I introduced H.R. 1684, the Disaster  Assistance Support for Communities and Homeowners Act.   Our bill directs FEMA to provide technical assistance to help  community associations qualify for disaster assistance grants.   It also directs FEMA to provide recommendations to Congress, within  12 months, on additional ways that co-ops and condos can become  eligible for assistance.   I encourage swift passage of H.R. 1684 to help ensure that all  community association  [[Page H5146]]  homeowners have access to federal disaster benefits.    Mr. Speaker, I join Chairman Royce and all of my  colleagues in welcoming President Moon of the Republic of Korea as he  travels to Washington this week.   Across 135 years of diplomatic ties, the United States and the  Republic of Korea have forged a strong and unshakable relationship. Our  countries have sacrificed together in war--from the Korean war to  Vietnam, to the Persian Gulf, to Afghanistan--and we have prospered  together in peace.   Our alliance, enshrined in the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1953, has  been a pillar of stability and security for both of our countries. That  alliance is especially important in light of the grave threat just 35  miles from Seoul: the dangerous regime controlled by dictator Kim Jung- un in North Korea.   America grieves with the Warmbier family over the tragic death of  their young son, Otto. His unjust detention, abuse, and death haunts  all of us. We must do all we can to secure the safe return of the three  Americans still detained in North Korea.   I trust that President Moon's visit will deepen an understanding  between Washington and Seoul in these trying times so that we may face  this challenge as we have others: in lockstep, side by side.                            ____________________
