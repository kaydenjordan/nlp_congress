 Madam Speaker, we, the people, have a common tie that  binds us together now as it has since the founding of our country, and  it is our shared respect for the Constitution of the United States.   Let us all step back from the maelstrom of the moment to recall that,  at our country's inception 243 years ago, the concept of a democratic,  self-governing rule was a breathtaking and idealistic aspiration. When  the 13 American Colonies boldly rejected the rule of the British  monarch, our Founders were determined to form a government that would  rule instead with the consent of the governed.   Ensuring that this noble experiment endured through the ages was an  enormous existential challenge. It was met with the adoption of the  Constitution in 1788.   At its heart are two bedrock principles that have served as  touchstones for our country ever since. First, it established America  as a nation of laws, where no person is above the law. Second, it  established the concept of a separation of powers where three coequal  branches of government would check each other, lest power be  concentrated in one at the expense of liberty to all.   Madam Speaker, when President Trump abused the power of his office by  soliciting foreign interference in the upcoming election for his  personal benefit, he willfully infringed upon the right of citizens to  decide who will lead our Nation. In doing so, he placed himself above  the law and in violation of his oath.   When he denounced, denied, and defied the clear authority of Congress  to investigate his conduct, he repudiated our constitutional system of  checks and balances and further violated his oath to preserve, protect,  and defend the Constitution.   It is for these reasons that I will cast my vote in favor of  impeaching President Donald John Trump.
