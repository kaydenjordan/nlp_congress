 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Tonko for  leading this Special Order hour in commemoration of our dear colleague,  the Honorable Louise Slaughter.   Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues on the floor today to honor a  remarkable woman. Words just couldn't adequately capture the sense of  sadness I felt after hearing of the loss of Congresswoman Louise  Slaughter, the dean of the New York delegation.   Louise dedicated her life's work to the people of western New York  and, indeed, all Americans across our great Nation. She embodied a  spirit of strength, wisdom, and grace, and she was beautiful inside and  out. She represented the very best of the American spirit, our values,  and our ideals.   Louise was a trailblazer and was the first woman to serve as chair  and ranking member of the powerful House Rules Committee. She commanded  the respect and admiration of all of her colleagues. Having had the  honor of serving with Louise has enriched my passion for service and my  commitment to fight for the most vulnerable amongst us.   Louise was indeed a woman on whose shoulders I stand. The United  States Congress has lost an esteemed leader, the New York delegation  has lost a beloved dean, and I have lost a cherished friend and mentor.   It was my great privilege to serve with Louise Slaughter, and she is  missed immensely.
