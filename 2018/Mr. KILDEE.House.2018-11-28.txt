 Mr. Speaker, during the campaign, then-candidate Trump  came to Warren, Michigan, and promised workers: ``You won't lose one  plant, I promise you that.''   Well, the President's promises ring hollow. Just this week, General  Motors announced plans to close five plants, including factories in  Michigan just miles from where President Trump made his broken campaign  promise.   These plant closures are symbolic of the Trump economy, one that does  not work for the American worker. It works for boardroom executives. It  works for wealthy shareholders. It works for corporations and the  people at the top.   I am a Flint, Michigan, kid. General Motors was founded in my  hometown. We know what happens when companies move their jobs overseas.  We used to have 80,000 auto jobs in my town--now, less than 10,000.  These plant closures have a devastating impact on the lives of  thousands of people.   We need an economy that works for everyone, and we need a President  who is willing to work with Democrats and Republicans to craft an  industrial policy that puts America to work, that stands up for the  American worker.   No more hollow promises.                            ____________________
