 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the work of the  outstanding corrections officers and staff at FCC Allenwood and USP  Lewisburg during the COVID-19 pandemic and recognize them as PA-12  COVID-19 heroes.   Prior to and during the pandemic, the corrections officers at these  two facilities, located within Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional  District, stepped up in a big way.   These dedicated men and women went to work every day, overseeing  Federal inmates, many of whom had been moved across State lines to  Central Pennsylvania. In the face of these unprecedented challenges,  our corrections officers took on expanded responsibility at great  personal risk.   These corrections officers and staff at USP Lewisburg and FCC  Lewisburg answered the call and they deployed to other BOP hotspot  facilities to assist with diminished staffing capacities due to COVID- 19.   Answering the ongoing call to duty, USP Lewisburg was asked to step  up in a big way when storms destroyed portions of FCI Estill in South  Carolina, requiring nearly 1,000 new inmates to be moved from that  facility to Central Pennsylvania.   For dealing with unprecedented challenges under pressing conditions  and answering the call to duty, it makes me proud to recognize the  corrections officers and staff at FCC Allenwood and USP Lewisburg as  PA-12 COVID-19 heroes.

Enacted as part of the CARES Act, and later replenished due to its  success, the Paycheck Protection Program has been a tremendous asset to  small businesses and their employees across the country, and the  employees were able to stay employed.   In April, to highlight the success of the program, Orrstown Bank's  Executive Vice President, Luke Bernstein, I was welcomed to the White  House to discuss the bank's work in processing and facilitating loans.    Asked to facilitate loans with little Federal red tape and even less  notice in order to help our economy survive this terrible virus, banks  like Orrstown have been instrumental in keeping America employed and  small businesses operating. I thank them for their work and again  recognize them as a PA-12 COVID-19 hero.          Recognizing Penn State University as a PA-12 COVID-19 Hero     Mr. Speaker, Penn State University is undoubtedly a PA-12  COVID-19 hero.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, Penn State University, one of the  world's best research institutions, put their assets to use in a new  way. They scoured their campuses and schools for personal protective  equipment that might be used in research or other academic endeavors  and found 10,000 pieces of PPE they donated to local hospitals to aid  in the fight against COVID-19.   Not only that, but Penn State put their academic skills to practice  by partnering with local businesses in the State College area to use 3D  printing to make PPE for smaller healthcare providers and nursing  homes.   While President Trump and his administration worked to make sure our  hospitals and healthcare providers had what they needed to meet the  surge capacity and combat COVID-19, critical community partners like  Penn State helped to meet the need.   For their work in providing needed PPE supplies, Penn State  University is recognized as a PA-12 COVID-19 hero.          Recognizing Lewistown Printworks as a PA-12 COVID-19 Hero     Mr. Speaker, Lewistown Printworks is a central  Pennsylvania small business that is undoubtedly a PA-12 COVID-19 hero.   Lewistown Printworks is a small business in Mifflin County,  Pennsylvania, that experienced the struggles of operating a small  business through the COVID-19 pandemic. This small, family-owned  business saw an opportunity to help others. In their ``Support Small''  project, Michelle and Caleb Fetter, the owners of this small, family- owned business, asked local businesses for logos that could be printed  on T-shirts. Those T-shirts were then sold as part of an online  fundraiser with $20 of each sale going to local businesses whose logo  was on the shirt. As of mid-May, the project earned $5,300 for local  businesses to help them weather the COVID-19 pandemic.   For their ingenuity, resourcefulness, and generous spirit, Michelle  and Caleb Fetter of Lewistown Printworks are recognized as being PA-12  COVID-19 heroes.                            ____________________
