 Mr. Speaker, Montgomery County, Philadelphia, and all of  Pennsylvania mourn the tragic loss of two State troopers: Branden Sisca  and Martin Mack, III; and a pedestrian, Mr. Reyes Rivera Oliveras, of  Allentown. All three were killed by an alleged drunk driver on I-95  near Lincoln Financial Field on March 21.   I want to take a moment to remember State Troopers Branden Sisca and  Martin Mack, and their extraordinary lives of service.   From an early age, they both had an incredible drive to serve and  were examples of leadership. Branden Sisca, just 29, volunteered for  the Trappe Fire Company from the age of 16 and rose to chief. He is  survived by his wife, Brittany. They are expecting a baby girl in July.   Martin Mack, just 33, first served as a member of the National Guard.  He was a devoted husband to his wife, Stephanie, and father to two  daughters, Olivia and Rowan.   It is heartbreaking to lose such extraordinary men so tragically so  young. I pray for their families. God bless them. May their memories be  a blessing.                            ____________________
