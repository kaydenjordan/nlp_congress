 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to  H.R. 693, the PAST Act.  [[Page H7372]]    The only thing good about the PAST Act is the name, because it is  reflective of just that, the past.   I have been listening to my colleagues, and I don't think they have  been spending time where I have, in the inspection barns over the last  six-plus years, where I see people who love their animals, take care of  them, and treat them like family.   What I have seen is inspectors that were abusing the process, not  self-policers, people sent by the USDA. And these people are being  disqualified, not being able to perform, and then not subsequently  being cited or penalized after the fact.   Now, the last couple of years there has been an improvement. And  today, the Tennessee Walking Horse has over 96 percent compliance rate,  according to the USDA's own numbers.   The only problem with the Tennessee Walking Horse today is that the  current inspection methods are subjective. The PAST Act does nothing to  change this.   What is even more concerning is the PAST Act would increase fines and  penalties, including up to 3 years in prison, while still utilizing  subjective inspection methods.   I have a bill, H.R. 1157, that numerous groups, including the  American Farm Bureau Federation, believe is a better course of action,  as it would require all inspections be objective and science-based.   As a medical professional, I realize the importance of utilizing  science to identify medical conditions. USDA realizes this problem and  has sought to address it by partnering with the National Academy of  Sciences to determine the best objective, science-based methods to  inspect the Tennessee Walking Horse.   I strongly believe that all legislation should be held off until this  study reaches its conclusion next May.   This legislation is a product of animal welfare groups spreading  misinformation on the status of the Tennessee Walking Horse industry,  again, living in the past. I fear that, to this point, some Members  have been fed one side of the story from powerful interest groups like  the Humane Society or PETA who, in advocating for their position,  neglect the fact that numerous veterinarians, equine experts, and  agricultural groups, including the Tennessee and Kentucky Farm Bureaus,  have come out in strong opposition to the PAST Act.                                time  2230    An example of the biased presentation of this bill is the misguided  scrutiny of action devices that are highlighted in the PAST Act.   The claims put forth by special interests behind this bill that  action devices are cruel or inhumane rest on very little academic  evidence. In fact, to the contrary, a 2018 study by the American  Veterinary Medical Association, the scientific authority on animal  welfare issues, found that the application of stacked wedges and action  devices to the forefeet of horses evoke no acute or subacute stress to  the horse.   I heard my colleague and good friend Dr. Yoho talk about his  wristwatch. Most of you in here are wearing wristwatches, or some of  you may just use your smartphones now, but you wear those all day, and  that doesn't hurt you. If there is a soring agent applied, then, yes,  that is going to cause problems. Action devices are pieces of equipment  no different than a saddle or a bridle or a bit.   This is a slippery slope, folks. What will these groups seek to ban  next? Saddles, maybe riding horses at all.   Like my colleagues, I feel strong that animal abusers should be  identified and punished; however, the PAST Act will not accomplish this  goal. These horses are already incredibly regulated, more so than any  other horse, including those in rodeo, those that race, and those that  do jumping and dressage.    No other horses are subjected to taxpayer-funded  inspections, and these owners are already incredibly compliant.  Furthermore, it is not true when groups suggest there is no additional  cost to taxpayers. The CBO has scored this legislation at $2 million  per year.   The PAST Act purports itself to be an innocent bill that would  provide stricter enforcement of standards in protecting horses. The  fact of the matter is that it is a Federal overreach into an issue in  which compliance is higher than any other USDA-regulated industry,  including the food industry.   I strongly urge my colleagues to carefully consider the consequences  of this bill before casting their votes. It should go back to committee  and be transparent.
