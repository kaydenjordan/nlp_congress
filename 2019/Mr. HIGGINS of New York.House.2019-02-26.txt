 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of action in  the fight against gun violence. Congress is finally acting.   Over the last decade, we have witnessed gun violence take the lives  of innocent children in our schools, terrorize our neighborhoods, and  harm our fellow colleagues in Congress.   Each event invoked a moment of silence. We can no longer remain  silent.   This week we have the opportunity to vote on two pieces of  legislation that close loopholes in the gun purchase background check  process.   These aren't radical or partisan policies. Background checks are  supported by 97 percent of Americans, including 97 percent of gun  owners.   On behalf of the families who have lost someone to gun violence and  those who we long to keep safe from future gun violence, I stand  proudly in support of congressional action to protect our communities  from gun violence and urge my colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
