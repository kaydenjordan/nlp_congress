 Mr. President, the continued spread of the  coronavirus--COVID-19--has the world on notice.   Here in the United States, we are fortunate not to be facing an  immediate crisis.   In response to early reports of the outbreak, the administration  began monitoring efforts and enacted commonsense travel restrictions to  help blunt and delay the spread of the virus here in our country.   Obviously, as our public health experts remind us, a nation of nearly  4 million square miles and more than 300 million people cannot be  hermetically sealed off from the rest of the world. There seems to be  little question that COVID-19 will eventually cause some degree of  disruption here.   The question before us now is how we can help the administration and  our professional medical experts continue their efforts to take  advantage of this head start. Our task is to make sure these dedicated  professionals have what they need to continue preparing in ways that  are calm, smart, and effective.   Here in Congress, first and foremost, that means providing additional  surge resources for the comprehensive Federal response. It is our job  to ensure that funding is not a limiting factor as public health  leaders and frontline medical professionals continue getting ready.   That is exactly why, several days ago, the Trump administration  submitted an initial request for supplemental funding to begin the  conversation. It was exactly the kind of action that many of our  Democratic colleagues had been demanding, but as soon as the  administration did take action, to the apparent puzzlement of basically  everyone, including his fellow Democrats, the Democratic leader began  launching partisan political attacks at the White House instead of  working together to get this done.   Just days ago, the Democratic leader signed a letter ``strongly  urging'' this kind of funding request, but almost the instant it  arrived, he began blasting it as ``too little too late,'' and our  colleague continued to move the goalpost.   His strong views on the necessary amount of funds varied daily. It  has been a strange and clumsy effort to override normal, bipartisan  appropriations talks before they even happen and replace them with top- down partisan posturing.   Everyone from his fellow Democrats to President Trump have seemed  perplexed by the Democratic leader's political game playing. It is not  clear to  [[Page S1162]]  anyone why he is prioritizing fighting with the White House over simply  letting the appropriators do their work.   I feel confident that the coronavirus does not care about partisan  bickering or political news cycles. This new disease is not going to  press pause so that Members can engage in performative outrage that  gets us further from results rather than closer.   This is our first step in confronting the challenge. The Congress  must be prepared to work together across the aisle in a collaborative  way and actually get results.   Fortunately, it appears we will have an opportunity to put this  cynicism behind us quickly and move forward in a unified way.   Bipartisan discussions are already underway among our colleagues on  the Appropriations Committee. I have full confidence that Chairman  Shelby, Senator Leahy, and our colleagues are fully capable of handling  this quite well.   I have faith the committee will carefully consider the right sum to  appropriate at this time to ensure our Nation's needs are fully funded.  I hope they can work expeditiously so the full Senate would be able to  take up the legislation within the next 2 weeks.   And I hope, as we move forward through this challenge, this body can  put reflexive partisanship aside and uphold the spirit of cooperation  and collaboration that this will require.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on an entirely different matter,  earlier this week I said paying tribute to departing Senate staff is  one of my favorite and least favorite things to do, simultaneously.   So I am especially unhappy to be back at it again today.   There is almost nobody--nobody--in this institution with whom I have  worked more closely, or whose counsel I have sought more frequently,  over the past 6\1/2\ years than Laura Dove.   Few people actually understand how important the Secretaries for the  Majority and to the Minority are to this institution. These two  officers supervise each side's cloakroom and floor staff. They are sort  of like air traffic controllers who help Senators sequence the bills,  amendments, and nominations that we vote on. They keep every office  apprised of what exactly has happened, is happening, and will happen on  the floor.   They serve as in-house procedural experts to each side, advising the  leader and the chairmen. And they build close relationships with every  Member of their side, trying to ensure the floor schedule reflects  everything from Senators' policy priorities to their personal  scheduling conflicts.   And while the two Secretaries are doing all this work in parallel  with each other, they are also constantly working together. On many  daily questions of process and of timing, their one-on-one relationship  is the diplomatic frontline between the two sides of the aisle.   The Senate, as you know, is a consent-based institution. Almost every  practicality is made much easier with bipartisan agreement--from  scheduling major votes to packaging nominees, to literally turning the  lights on every morning. And it is often Laura and her counterpart,  Gary, who hammer out those details.   Consider the limitless scope of this job. It is no wonder Laura has  made a certain piece of human resources phraseology into her personal  mantra and her cloakroom's motto: ``Other duties as assigned.''   The Secretary for the Majority is essential to the Senate, and so  Laura has become essential to all of us.   There cannot be many father-daughter pairs in world history--in world  history--who have bonded over parliamentary procedure, but the fact is,  it doesn't just seem like the Senate is Laura's natural habitat; she  literally grew up in this place.   Laura's father, Bob Dove, started in the Parliamentarian's Office in  the 1960s. He kept rising, and in the 1980s and 1990s, he was the  Parliamentarian.   Bob was known for a wry saying he would repeat after tough days:  ``You may love the Senate, but the Senate may not love you back.''   Unfortunately, for his family, one of the Senate's love languages  turns out to be keeping people here late at night, which meant that the  Dove family dinners, orchestrated by Laura's mom, Linda, sometimes  happened in the corners of this very building.   The exposure sparked Laura's curiosity. Those family dinners turned  into days off from school, spent wandering the halls and trying to  imitate the duties of the pages. Then she put on the page uniform  herself, and that is how this distinguished decades-long Senate career  began: delivering notes, filling water glasses, and studying for math  tests in the attic dorms of the Library of Congress.   That was the mid-1980s. Laura debuted in the cloakroom right around  the time I debuted as a freshman Senator. Neither of us knew what  awaited us.   From the lowest rung to the top of the ladder, Laura threw herself  into literally everything. At every step, no task was too insignificant  and no challenge was too great. Laura has had a hand in every  accomplishment of this institution for nearly a decade. She has played  a significant role in literally every single victory of this majority.   Her job performance alone would be stunningly impressive. But what is  even more unfathomable is the level of kindness and good cheer she has  maintained while doing it. She seems to begin every day with a smile on  her face and a show tune on her lips. She treats everybody with the  same respect and simple kindness, from the pages whom she invites over  for home-cooked holiday meals to the Senators whose family details she  has committed to memory.   She is as happy tutoring junior staff in Senate basics as talking  strategy with senior members. No matter how late the floor was open the  night before, the same Laura clocked in the next morning, full of joy  and maybe a new recipe to share with fellow Senate foodies.   Laura reminds us that the Senate's strength comes from its people.  She has embodied this in her professional conduct, fighting to preserve  and protect this institution as she helped us navigate through it, and  she has embodied this institution in her personal character as well.  She treats everybody with such warmth and respect as though this  Chamber were our shared second home--and in some cases, it literally  has been.   This staffer is so dedicated that she has rung in major milestone  birthdays on these very premises, stolen sleep on a couch during  overnight sessions--you get the picture.   Few were shocked when Laura's previous attempts to leave the Senate  fizzled out after a year or so. I remember being relieved when I got  another year, but I suspected she would be back.   But this time is different. In recent months, I know Laura has grown  more and more excited to reallocate some time from her second home to  her real home, to the family she has built with her husband Dan and  their children, Abby and Jake.   Laura loves this body, its rules, its quirks, and its history more  than almost anything. I say almost anything. But she loves a family  dinner with those three, a glass of Chardonnay, and a game night by the  fireplace even more. And as they prepare to send their oldest off to  college soon, that time is becoming extra precious.   For us Senators it is hard to imagine what it is going to feel like  next week when Laura is not here. I imagine she may feel the same way.  But I know this: Those of us who remain will frequently ask ourselves  ``What would Laura do?'' And whether the issue at hand is institutional  or strategic or culinary, we will know asking that question will point  us in the right direction.   I also know that Laura will be departing with some new wisdom of her  own. She will know that, in a rare occurrence, her brilliant father  actually got one thing wrong--that funny old saying: ``You may love the  Senate, but the Senate won't love you back.'' Well, his daughter will  leave knowing that is only half true.   So, Laura, this institution cannot thank you enough, nor can this  majority, nor can I. But I feel certain you will never quite be a  stranger to the Senate. I don't think you could manage it even if you  tried. So we won't say goodbye. We will just conclude with one more  piece of Laura lingo she made famous: ``Ciao for now.''
