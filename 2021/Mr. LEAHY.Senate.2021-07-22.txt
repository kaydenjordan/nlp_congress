 Mr. President, I will get right to the point: the very  definition of democracy in the United States is under attack. You see  it in State legislatures across the country. Powerful partisans  advancing bill after bill to restrict voters' access to the ballot box.  It flies in the face of the very evolution of progress.   Gone are the days when voters rode on horseback or walked for miles  to cast their ballot. Technological advances, commonsense  understandings of the daily lives of hard-working Americans--all these  things and more recommend an open, accessible, expanded, and secure  election process. Yet instead of seizing these opportunities to ensure  every voice, every vote counts, partisan efforts are afoot to take us  back--back to a time when senseless barriers were erected to block the  votes of very specific communities.   The U.S. Senate--the democratically elected U.S. Senate--should not  stand for such an assault on our democracy. And every Senator who  swears the oath of office should stand up and stand against this bitter  attack on the ballot box.   Protecting the right to vote has long been bipartisan. I stood  alongside my dear friend, himself a soldier in the war against voter  oppression, John Lewis, when we reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in  2006. And it was with a heavy--but hopeful--heart that I reintroduced  the Voting Rights Advancement Act last year to bear his name. I will  soon do so again. This bipartisan legislation should advance, and  quickly.   Now is the time for every American--regardless of party, regardless  of politics--to stand in defense of our democracy. To stand for what is  right, and to stand with the clear arc of history--the arc that bends  toward justice, toward inclusion, towards equality. With one loud and  clear voice, we should reject erosions of voter protections. And we  should do so now.   Vermont has always been at the forefront of expanding access to the  ballot, and one of our State's leaders in that fight has been Secretary  of State Jim Condos. I ask unanimous consent that a column by Secretary  Condos, published in the July 14 edition of The Times Argus, be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Times Argus, July 14, 2021]                      Our Democracy Is at a Crossroads                              (By Jim Condos)         ``The vote is precious. It is the most powerful non-violent       tool we have in a democratic society, and we must use it''--      John Lewis        This month we celebrated the birth of our nation.        Since its inception, American democracy has undergone       continual transformation. During the past 245 years, many       activists and advocates have fought tirelessly to expand the       franchise that our democratic ideals depend on: the right to       vote.        From suffragettes to civil rights leaders, their work has       ensured that the march of progress has been oriented forward,       focused on increasing access to the ballot box.        This Independence Day was an opportunity to reflect on the       resiliency of our country and of our democracy. There has       been no shortage of challenges during the past year and a       half. Despite these challenges, we achieved record breaking       turnout for a general election, which nonpartisan experts       have described as the most secure and the most scrutinized       election in U.S. history. We were able to do so with common-      sense voting reforms, providing voters with more options for       receiving and casting their ballot.        After the ballot counting was completed, and the careful       town by town certification process took place, we had       official results and a list of election winners and losers,       just like every other general election in memory.        Unlike other election years, what has followed has brought       our democracy to a crossroads. Without producing any       evidence, the former president and his allies have used known       false voter-fraud claims as justification for their attempts       to use state legislatures and phony `fraudits' to supersede       the will of the people and, more significantly, to restrict       access to the ballot box.        Our democratic principles should have to endure constant       debate. However, willfully disregarding the certified,       official election results in an effort to circumvent the will       of the people and prevent the peaceful transition of power       sets our country on a dangerous path.        Sending us even further into treacherous territory, some       state legislatures are using `the Big Lie' to roll back the       voter access expansions made during 2020, and to further       suppress voting rights through measures such as the       implementation of more restrictive voter ID laws, limits on       the ballot-by-mail request period, elimination or reduction       in ballot drop boxes, and closure of polling precincts.        After record-breaking turnout in 2020, and with zero       evidence of widespread fraud or election rigging, why would       they want to make it harder for eligible Americans to vote?       The answer is simple: because they were unhappy with the       results and want fewer people to vote.        Overall, there have been over 350 bills introduced in 47       states with the sole purpose of reducing access to the       ballot. In June alone, 17 state legislatures enacted 28 new       voter restriction laws. A small few include reasonable,       understandable reforms.        Most make no sense at all. It is clear that some lawmakers       would prefer to pick their voters, rather than voters picking       their representatives.        Frankly, I am concerned for our nation. We stand at a       crossroads, and the decisions we make now will ripple       throughout time.        There is hope. In Vermont, we saw the record turnout as a       positive, so we made the mailing of ballots to all voters a       permanent fixture of Vermont general elections. We also       created a new pathway for voters to correct a defective       ballot so that their vote will count. We did this by working       across the aisles with the support of Democrats, Republicans,       Progressives and independents.        In the face of the alarming rise in state-level attacks on       voting rights, we cannot afford to wait for solutions one-by-      one in all 50 states. With the gutting of the Voting Rights       Act by the Supreme Court, we no longer have the luxury of a       ``wait and see'' approach. Congress can, and must, create       minimum voter access and fairness standards that states must       abide by, so that eligible voters are not being denied their       voting rights.        The true voter fraud in this country is denying any       eligible American their right to register and vote.        Congress alone can put an end to restrictive and       unnecessary obstacles to voting, prohibit racebased and       partisan gerrymandering, make automatic, online and same day       voter registration the law of the land, and make voting by       mail accessible for every voter, regardless of which side of       an invisible line you live on.        Two federal bills pending, the For the People Act, and the       John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, give Congress this       opportunity to act. The time has come for the partisan,       political games to stop. Those who are prioritizing the       promotion of politically motivated falsehoods about the       security of our elections, over the voting rights of the       people who put them in office, are committing a severe       dereliction of duty.        In 2021, our democracy has come to a crossroads.       Fortunately, we have a roadmap, we just need to follow it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, since the start of the pandemic, the State  of Vermont, at every level of its leadership, has taken heroic efforts  to mitigate spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus. With strong leadership  from Gov. Phil Scott, and bolstered by a firm belief in scientific  facts, the State nearly halted altogether the spread of COVID-19,  minimized the number of Vermonters lost to the disease, and now leads  the Nation in the percentage of residents who have received at least  one vaccine shot. As we look to hopefully soon be on the other side of  this pandemic, I strongly believe that there are invaluable lessons to  be learned from Vermont's response, so that we are better prepared for  the days, months, and years ahead.   Aisha K. Jha's ``Vermont's and South Dakota's COVID Infection Rates  are Remarkably Similar--But their Outcomes are Not'' article published  in the Washington Post on July 13, 2021, reviews the important steps  Vermont took to not only protect the health of its residents but also  ensure that minimal economic damage was done given  [[Page S5042]]  the circumstances. A strong public health approach, led by Vermont  Health Commissioner Mark Levine, always communicated scientific  evidence clearly and thoughtfully. This fostered a sense of trust and  community that has now resulted in Vermont nearing herd immunity and  able to fully reopen local businesses for everyone to enjoy.   I am so proud of every Vermonter who stepped up to do their part to  not only protect themselves, but their families, friends, and  neighbors. This is truly the Vermont way. I know that if all States  followed Vermont's example, and continued to vaccinate all residents,  we would be able to put this dark chapter of American history in our  rearview mirror.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article  mentioned above, about the important work in Vermont to protect our  State from the COVID-19 pandemic.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, July 13, 2021]     Vermont's and South Dakota's COVID Infection Rates Are Remarkably                    Similar--But Their Outcomes Are Not                             (By Ashish K. Jha)         Two states. Two different paths in responding to COVID-19.       Together, they offer invaluable lessons about the road ahead       for the nation--especially as infection rates creep up       because of the delta variant.        The two states are Vermont and South Dakota. Both feature       among the three states that COVID Act Now classifies as       falling in the lowest-risk category, along with       Massachusetts. This may be a surprise. While New England       states are known to have done extraordinarily well in       vaccinating their populations, South Dakota is in the middle       of the pack. So, what explains the fact that South Dakota has       infection numbers almost as low as Vermont, the most       vaccinated state in the nation?        Let's start with some basics. Vermont and South Dakota       share several important similarities. Both have relatively       White, older and rural populations. They have comparable       median incomes. Both states have Republican governors,       challenging the simplistic notion that COVID risk is a       partisan phenomenon.        Over the past two months, the rates of infection in Vermont       and South Dakota have appeared remarkably similar. Both       states have seen steep declines in cases, making both states       near the best in terms of infections per population.        But this is where the similarity ends. While nearly 75       percent of Vermonters have had at least one vaccine shot,       putting the state near the threshold for herd immunity, only       half of South Dakotans have had at least one shot. South       Dakota's substantial population immunity instead comes in       large part from prior infections, particularly during the       fall. This massive surge in infections was driven by the       Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in August that brought nearly half a       million people to South Dakota, sparking outbreaks across       that state and, indeed, the nation. With little to no       interest on the part of its governor to squelch the outbreak,       South Dakota reached the highest levels of infection seen by       any state during the pandemic. At its peak, the state was       reporting more than 160 new cases per 100,000 residents.       Vermont, in comparison, never climbed above 30 cases per       100,000.        Unsurprisingly, these states experienced stunningly       different outcomes. Adjusted for population, nearly six times       as many people died in South Dakota from covid-19 as in       Vermont (230 per 100,000 in South Dakota compared to just 40       per 100,000 in Vermont). In real numbers, while about 250       Vermont residents died from the disease. more than 2,000       South Dakotans died. And as of today, Vermont has a lower       unemployment rate, suggesting that there need not be any       trade-off between public health and the economy.        By some estimates, nearly half of the people of South       Dakota may have been infected. These infections led to huge       amounts of suffering beyond the deaths themselves. We are       seeing an increasing body of evidence that many who survive       serious illness from the virus have long-term complications       and symptoms. When infections spike, a run on hospital beds       means other people die because they can't access hospital       care, which almost surely occurred in South Dakota at the       height of the surge. Vermont took a different approach,       keeping public health measures in place to keep infections       low and then, building up population immunity through       excellent vaccination campaigns.        The virus isn't going away. In fact, it is likely to become       endemic, meaning it will continue to circulate, occasionally       causing outbreaks in low-vaccination communities. Most people       will encounter the virus at one point or another. And if they       don't have immunity from vaccines, many will get sick. The       harms from infection are large, especially in comparison to       the generally mild side-effects of the vaccines. And there is       some evidence that the vaccine-induced immunity is more       effective than natural infection-induced immunity. As the       highly contagious delta variant spreads, states that have       experienced high levels of infection such as South Dakota may       be more vulnerable than highly vaccinated states such as       Vermont.        In the spring of 2020, governors had to make decisions with       little federal guidance and little historical precedent. But       by that summer, it was much clearer how to curtail the       disease, protect public health and manage the economy       carefully. By following the science, Vermont saved an       enormous number of lives and has now reached a degree of       population immunity through vaccination that makes large       outbreaks unlikely. Embracing a policy of ``personal       responsibility,'' South Dakota did little to protect its       residents, leading to the deaths of more than 2,000 South       Dakotans and the suffering of tens of thousands more. To       avoid more unnecessary outbreaks, we need to learn from       states that have successfully weathered the pandemic, follow       the science and keep vaccinating Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it has been 40 years since the Nation lost  a champion for the hungry, and the American people lost a talented and  inspirational musical artist. And I lost a dear partner and friend.   I was proud to have been able to work side by side with Harry Chapin  on several projects to address hunger, here at home, and in the world.  We strategized. We met with other Senators to build support. And I got  to know him well. He stayed at our home and even sang for our  enthralled children. I was with him on the grounds of the Capitol  Building when he pulled out his guitar and gave an impromptu concert.  Passersby were drawn to him, and it was one more magical moment, among  so many with Harry.   Harry had incredible energy and drive and commitment to his goals.  Bill Ayres, a former Catholic priest who cofounded the organization  WhyHunger with Harry, has noted that Harry used to say: ``When in  doubt, do something.'' And do something, he certainly did. Since its  founding in 1975, WhyHunger has raised more than $30 million to help  more than 10 million families, children, veterans, and others around  the world gain access to nutritious food and vital services.   One of Harry's ideas was to convince President Jimmy Carter to form a  Commission on world hunger. I readily signed on to help him. When we  had that meeting with the President in the Cabinet Room, Harry's  persistence was on overdrive. President Carter agreed to establish the  Commission. So that goal was in hand. But Harry kept telling the  President why we should do this, and President Carter kept trying to  tell Harry that he agreed with him. Harry was wound up and excited to  have the chance to lay out the case for a Commission. And I finally  said: ``Harry, don't talk him out of it.'' Everyone laughed because we  all knew that it was a moment that distilled the pure energy for which  we all loved and admired him.   I worked with Senator Byron Dorgan and others in gaining  authorization for a Congressional Gold Medal, which I was honored to  carry to a memorial concert at Carnegie Hall to present to Harry's  family. Harry Belafonte and Bruce Springsteen were there and so were so  many others who had known and worked with Harry. Harry Belafonte, whom  I also admire so deeply, has said this:         I grew to really admire him, not only for his commitment to       the cause of hunger, but also the fact that he did it with       such passion, such real commitment. As an artist, I certainly       loved his work. Not only his music, but the content of his       words. He spoke about the human condition with a sense of       humor and as a lyricist he had his hand on the pulse of       social needs.    A few years ago, I received a letter from a 16-year-old Canadian boy  in Newmarket, Ontario, Ryan Kruger. He had heard about my work with  Harry and wanted me to know how much he admires him.   ``I am a big fan of Harry,'' he wrote, ``and think he exemplifies the  ideals of both of our respective nations, as well as the world, or at  least what they should be. In this volatile political climate, on both  sides of the border, as well as around the world, I think we need a bit  more Harry.''   And we certainly do.   Harry's children wrote an eloquent tribute that was carried in the  New York Daily News on July 16. They, and many of us, want to keep  alight and aloft the candle that helps Harry Chapin's important legacy  live on and on.   I commend their tribute to the attention of the Senate.  [[Page S5043]]    I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From the New York Daily News, July 16, 2021]                  How Harry Chapin, Our Dad, Fought Hunger     (By Josh Chapin, Jen Chapin, Jason Chapin, Jono Chapin and Jaime                                  Chapin)         For many, attaining fame and fortune is enough to feel       successful. For our father, Harry Chapin, it wasn't. His true       fulfillment came through service, and 40 years following his       untimely death, along with his timeless hit song ``Cat's in       the Cradle,'' our dad's passionate commitment to ending       hunger is what he is best remembered for. During his life       (1942-1981), he released 11 albums, performed 220 concerts a       year, and received Grammy and Oscar nominations as well as       Emmy, Tony and many other awards, including the Congressional       Gold Medal. While music was his passion, our father's success       became not laurels to rest upon but rather a platform that       led to his becoming one of the leading humanitarians of his       generation.        Through starting three dynamic and visionary organizations       in his short lifetime, WhyHunger, Long Island Cares and the       Center for Food Action in New Jersey, he left a lasting       impact in the fight against hunger and poverty.        Today marks 40 years since our father's passing in an       automobile accident on the Long Island Expressway. It's been       four decades without him--four decades of change in culture,       politics, music and technology--but after all that change,       and even a global pandemic, his legacy organizations       WhyHunger and Long Island Cares remain centered on fulfilling       our dad's mission of deeply understanding the root causes of       hunger and seeking solutions grounded in community power and       self-reliance.        Notably, during his lifetime, our father worked with       President Jimmy Carter, his dear friend and Democratic Sen.       Patrick Leahy, Republican Sen. Bob Dole, and a bipartisan       team to form the first and only Presidential Commission on       World Hunger. Our father's work to create political urgency       and a truly patriotic, bipartisan dialogue surrounding the       human right to nutritious food--in our wealthy nation and in       a world that can feed itself many times over--should be a       call to inspire a new surge of commitment today.        While he embarked on a mission decades ago to combat       hunger, the work is far from complete. Today, nearly 2.1       million New Yorkers face hunger every day. On Long Island,       nearly half a million face the same reality--a problem that's       many times worse than when he started Long Island Cares in       1980. These statistics are staggering, and sadly have       increased over recent years. While prior to COVID-19, Long       Island neared a 40% reduction of food insecurity, during the       height of the pandemic, an additional 223,000 Long Islanders       became food insecure, nearly doubling the prior population       count.        A generous charitable response and a massive,       industrialized emergency food system are not enough. What our       father understood years ago is that in order to ameliorate       this needless suffering, we need to address the root causes       and advance the human right to nutritious food in the U.S.       and around the world. Hunger in the U.S. and hunger around       the world are deeply connected, and thanks to the work of       WhyHunger and our diverse array of partners, exciting       alliances are building self-reliance and lasting change.       WhyHunger has shown that by offering critical resources to       support grassroots movements, we can build community       solutions rooted in social, environmental, racial and       economic justice.        Our hope is that the current administration is prepared to       substantively address these issues and do what our father       knew was, and still is, possible: bring an end to hunger.       Currently, Rep. James McGovern of Massachusetts is asking       President Biden to convene a new White House Conference on       Hunger, just as our father pushed for four decades ago. When       asked what his motivation was for this cause, McGovern said       that meeting Harry left a lasting impression on his political       views on hunger.        What Harry Chapin began with WhyHunger, Long Island Cares       and the Center for Food Action continues to make a great       impact, but of course there is more to be done. More       organizations need to realize that fighting hunger is not       only about handing out food in times of need, or even the       proverbial teaching people to fish--it is about supporting       social movements so that people can organize, advocate and       work together to ensure they will always be able to feed       their families. Additionally, we need to keep speaking up for       social and legislative reform that promotes social and       economic justice. If you happened to love our father's music       and message, if you care about America reaching its yet       unrealized mission of justice for all, or if you want to live       in a more peaceful and sustainable world, consider this a       call to action.        The authors are the sons and daughters of Harry Chapin.                            ____________________
