 Mr. Speaker, for many of our residents, the images of the  United States Customs and Border Patrol officers on horseback whipping  Black Haitian immigrants at the border were triggering. It was  traumatic. It was a reminder of our country's ugly history and its  decades of mistreatment of Black folks.   What we all witnessed in Del Rio, Texas, was disgusting, not just  because of the rogue, out-of-control CBP but also because the actions  were a blatant betrayal of our human rights values.   Those brave Haitian refugees have a legal right to seek asylum in our  country, like all who are fleeing violence and repression.   America is supposed to be a safe haven. Instead, Black asylum seekers  at the border are being met with violence and deportation back to a  crisis-stricken country.   All Black Haitians deserve to be treated with human dignity, and we  must do better. Our failure to act  [[Page H4880]]  against Federal agencies, at least oversight of Black immigrants coming  in, is going to enable these shameful acts to continue. We must act  together to stop it.                            ____________________
