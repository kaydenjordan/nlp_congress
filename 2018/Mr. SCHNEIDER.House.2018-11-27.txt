 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Garamendi from  California, for organizing this evening's conversation, but more  importantly, for drawing attention to this critically important issue.   It is more than a little bit shameful that the administration chose  to release the Fourth National Climate Assessment on Black Friday, a  day, as the gentleman noted, when most families, most people, are  focused on the Thanksgiving holiday. Some are shopping, and some are  hanging out with their family and friends. But it was clear that this  was an apparent effort by the administration to introduce this report  at a time when people weren't paying attention.   Fortunately, people are paying attention to this issue. We are seeing  it with the concerns people have watching the fires in California; the  floods and hurricanes this summer or fall in Florida; last year, with  the hurricanes and flooding in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the  Virgin Islands.   The report that was released on Friday was a rigorous report,  assembled by 13 Federal agencies and covering more than 1,000 pages of  detailed analysis and data, highlighting the impacts we can expect over  the next decades into the next century if action isn't taken.   Impacts include increased storms, flooding, devastation, mudslides  from the size of these storms; loss of physical property; incalculable  human cost from loss of life and other damages; droughts that are  leading to fires, crop failures, loss of arable land, not just in our  country, but, literally, around the world.   The facts are clear. But, again, the Trump administration tried to  bury this report, and the President himself says he does not believe  the report.   Well, to put it simply, this is not about beliefs. This is about  science. The facts could not be clearer. Climate change is a serious  threat to our Nation. It is a threat to our economy, to our national  security, and to the planet that we pass on to our children. We need to  take action now before it is too late.   The report forecasts that more severe storms, droughts, coastal  flooding, and other climate effects could reduce the size of the  American economy by 10 percent before the end of the century, almost  doubling the impact to our economy of the Great Recession of 2008.   The recent fires in California were exacerbated by climate change,  and more fires are forecast in the Southeast and throughout the West,  if action isn't taken.   The agricultural Midwest, from where I come, will be particularly  hard-hit. This report forecasts the farming sector could lose so much  productivity that the crisis of the 1980s could even seem tame. We need  to do something.   On the national security front, we will be affected. The report says  that climate change variability and extreme events, in conjunction with  other factors, can exacerbate conflict around the world, as we have  already seen. Droughts, floods, storm surges, wildfires, and other  extreme events stress nations and people through loss of life,  displacement of populations, and impacts on livelihoods, the report  continues.   While the White House refuses to make climate a priority, I am  heartened that the Pentagon continues to treat this threat with the  seriousness it deserves and focuses on it as a national security  crisis.   This is a global challenge. It can only be met with a global  response.                                time  2015    It needs the people of the world and the nations of the world to come  together. This is literally a call to action for all of the people of  the world. That is the power that was behind the Paris climate accord  where every nation has come together and said: We must act, and we must  act with urgency.   The world needs American leadership, and, sadly, this administration  is turning away from that responsibility and that obligation. But  thankfully, we are seeing many cities, communities, States, and even  business leaders saying: We are in. We are not going to step away.   The Trump administration continues to say: We are walking away.  [[Page H9661]]    The Trump administration, in fact, continues to make matters worse.  They rolled back the Clean Power Plan to slow our transition away from  dirty forms of energy. They have undercut environmental regulations to  limit methane pollution. Most significantly, last year, the President  announced he was withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate  agreement.   Climate change is a global problem that requires global solutions,  and American leadership must play a role. We must stay within the Paris  accord.   There is still time to fix this problem if we take action today. If  we come together as a nation and if we come together as a world, then I  hope we can do that in this body. I hope we can do this as a nation,  and I hope this country can continue to lead to make sure that we pass  on to our children an environment, a climate, and a world that is  worthy of the legacy of our great Nation.
