 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding  [[Page S6669]]  Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial  spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize BluMine Health, LLC  of Louisville, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Headquartered in Louisville, KY, BluMine Health began operations 6  years ago as Alternative Health Solutions. Led by Michael Dees, BluMine  Health was established to meet a demand for individualized, easily  accessible medical care. Through its direct primary care--DPC--model,  BluMine Health provides local businesses with affordable healthcare  services. As an alternative to fee-for-service insurance billing,  BluMine Health's DPC charges employers a flat monthly per-employee fee.  This fee covers primary care services, including clinical and  laboratory services, consultative services, and comprehensive care  management. DPC allows family physicians to care for the whole person,  reducing the overhead and negative incentives associated with fee-for- service third-party-payer billing. Through onsite care clinics and  shared on-site care centers, BluMine Health provides a practical  alternative to the third-party insurance coverage system.   Today, BluMine Health has become a regional leader in direct primary  care. They continue serving communities across Kentucky, with locations  in Brandenburg, Lexington, Madisonville, Elizabethtown, Somerset,  Richmond, Shelbyville, Shepherdsville, and Dunnville. BluMine Health  provides care to dozens of clients, covering 20,000 individuals and  their families. Since 2019, BluMine Health has partnered with Baptist  Health, the leading healthcare provider in Kentucky and southern  Indiana, to provide additional services such as hospital care and  physical therapy to its clients. BluMine Health is expanding its  services throughout the Ohio River Valley, establishing a clinic in  Jeffersonville, IN, and announcing an expansion into Ohio in August  2021.   Like many small businesses, BluMine Health is active in its  community. Locally, BluMine Health regularly supports nonprofit  organizations and sponsors charity events, such as the Kentucky Harvest  fifth annual golf tournament. They are actively involved with industry  and business organizations, including the chamber of commerce and the  Health Enterprise Network, Louisville's regional healthcare business  network. As a healthcare provider, BluMine Health stepped up to meet  the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. They continued to offer  in-person care and adapted to provide telemedicine service, with  telehealth appointments surpassing 40 percent of their medical  delivery. Through their partnership with Baptist Health, BluMine Health  provided a COVID-19 workplace reopening service, enabling local  businesses to create and maintain healthy workplaces as lockdowns  lifted.   BluMine Health, LLC is a notable example of the critical role that  small, community-oriented healthcare providers play in their  communities. Local medical practices like BluMine Health form the heart  of towns across Kentucky, regularly stepping up to support their  communities in times of crisis. Congratulations to Michael and the  entire team at BluMine Health, LLC. I wish them the best of luck and  look forward to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky  and beyond.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize a  family-owned small business and Louisville staple, Dan-O's Seasoning of  Louisville, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Like many college students, Dan Oliver knew nothing about cooking.  One day, while seasoning chicken, he threw together some spices and  cooked the best chicken he had ever had. That spice blend planted the  seeds for what would become Dan-O's Seasoning. Over the next 15 years,  whenever he cooked for friends and family, Dan used his original spice  recipe. After a career in the professional sector, Dan joined the  restaurant industry as a cook and bartender. Dan, an aspiring  entrepreneur, used his passion for cooking to develop what he called  his ``million-dollar idea:'' selling his signature seasoning mix. Two  years--and nearly 200 modifications later--Dan-O's Seasoning launched  in 2017.   Today, Dan-O's Seasoning is a thriving company selling products  nationwide. The business is based in Louisville, where Dan and his team  prepare and package the product. Initially, Dan traveled across  Kentucky selling his seasoning at trade shows and flea markets. The  low-sodium, sugar-free, 100-percent natural seasoning was a hit, with  sales doubling every year. Dan-O's Seasoning was soon available at  Louisville-area stores and online. Like many small business owners, Dan  adapted to overcome the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  With the trade show circuit closed, he turned to social media to keep  his business afloat. After a video clip went viral on TikTok, a video  creating and sharing platform, Dan-O's gained thousands of new  customers and increased its sales more than tenfold. Their success was  profiled in several local and national outlets, including WDRB, the  Louisville Courier-Journal, Louisville Business Journal, and BuzzFeed.  And in March 2021, Dan-O's exponential growth led to their products  being sold at Kroger's, a regional supermarket chain located in the  Midwest and South.   Like many small business owners, Dan is actively involved in his  community. Locally, Dan-O's Seasoning regularly supports community  organizations, including the Louisville V.F.W. Post 6182, the  Permanently Disabled Jockey Fund, and the Boone County Cancer Society.  When the company hosts events, like its annual cornhole tournament,  they prioritize working with local small businesses. Notably Dan-O's  Seasoning sponsors several athletes, including NASCAR drivers, dirt- track racers, tournament fishers, cornhole players, and NCAA athletes.  In June 2021, Dan earned the Silver Fleur-De-Lis Award from the Greater  Louisville, Inc. Metro Chamber of Commerce, recognizing his company's  exponential growth and innovative marketing tactics.   Dan-O's Seasoning is a remarkable example of how hard work,  ingenuity, and discipline can turn a dream into reality. Small  businesses like Dan-O's Seasoning form the heart of towns across  Kentucky, regularly stepping up to support their communities.  Congratulations to Dan and the entire team at Dan-O's Seasoning. I wish  them the best of luck and look forward to watching their continued  growth and success in Kentucky and beyond.                            ____________________
