 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two Newark  firefighters who last week made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of  duty.   Firefighters Augusto ``Augie'' Acabou and Wayne Brooks, Jr., were  some of the first responders to an incredibly devastating fire at the  Port of Newark in New Jersey.   With the instinct that only the men and women who proudly serve in  fire departments across the country have, they went straight to the  heart of the battle encountering a scene unlike any they have ever  experienced in their careers, but they never hesitated.   They put it all on the line, and they made the ultimate sacrifice.  They leave behind their families. They leave  [[Page H3604]]  behind their friends. They leave behind their brothers and sisters in  the Newark Fire Department.   We must carry Augie and Wayne with us, carry on their legacies, carry  on their memories, and that is what we will do. On behalf of every  resident made safer by people like Augie and Wayne, we extend our  deepest condolences to their family, friends, and fellow firefighters.   We commit ourselves to protecting our firefighters and ensuring they  have everything they need to safely return home to their families.  Today, we mourn the loss of these two incredible individuals.                            ____________________
