 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise to speak about the nominee for the  Department of Education, Betsy DeVos. I cannot vote for her  confirmation.   The mission of the Department of Education, as mentioned, ``is to  promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness  by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.'' The  Department achieves this by establishing policies on Federal financial  aid for education and distributing as well as monitoring those funds,  collecting data on America's schools and disseminating research,  focusing national attention on key educational issues, prohibiting  discrimination, and ensuring equal access to education. After  considering that mission, I do not believe Betsy DeVos should be the  next Secretary of Education.   Surely we can agree that every child in the United States should have  access to a first-rate education to ensure a chance of a good job and  good pay. I know this from my own life experiences and, in particular,  the impact that a good teacher can have on a young child. You see, my  first grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson, God rest her soul, attended  my law school graduation. I would not be standing here were it not for  the education I received, and I know that to be true for so many of our  colleagues in the Senate.   After I reviewed Betsy DeVos's nomination, including her record and  confirmation testimony, and after speaking with teachers and students  and parents from across California, it is clear she does not understand  the importance or the impact of a public school teacher like Mrs.  Frances Wilson.   Why? Well, first and foremost, our country needs a Secretary of  Education who has demonstrated basic competency when it comes to issues  facing children. They just need to know what they are talking about.  When questioned in the hearing by my colleague Senator Franken, it was  clear Mrs. DeVos didn't know the difference between two basic theories  of testing: proficiency and growth. This, in fact, is one of the  biggest debates occurring in the education community today, and she was  unaware of the significance of the nuances and the difference between  the two. As we know, proficiency essentially asks whether a student has  a basic competency or understanding of a subject; looking at a child  and asking: Is that third grader reading at third grade reading level?   Growth. It is a question of whether a student is progressing from  year to year or asking if a third grader who started their year reading  at first grade level can now read at second grade level. Has there been  progress? This debate will define how we are judging schools across the  country, and her lack of knowledge and fluency demonstrates her  complete lack of experience, understanding, and curiosity about one of  the hottest issues in modern education.   Now let's talk about guns in schools. At first, she at best showed  ambivalence toward gun-free school zones, but it gets better. She went  on to say that she does not have any questions, and that without any  questions, she does not believe you need guns in schools. Then she went  on to say, well, but we need guns in schools, yes, because grizzly  bears may pose a significant threat to the safety of our children and  perhaps their education.   I say Ms. DeVos poses a far greater threat to public education.   Let's talk about title IX. Another moment in her hearing is when the  [[Page S723]]  nominee refused to commit to actually enforcing title IX. Now, let's be  clear that title IX was brought into being because our country had a  rampant policy of discrimination against women in our education system.  For example, women were not being admitted to the University of  Virginia. Even Luci Baines Johnson, the daughter of President Johnson,  was barred admission to Georgetown University after she got married  because it was common perception at that point in time that if she was  married, then that is what she should pursue. She should pursue a  career in the home and could not be capable of doing that as well as  working outside the home. Title IX is a law that guarantees women and  girls the right to a safe education, free from discrimination.   Let's be clear how title IX helps today. It is title IX that required  universities to prioritize a safe environment for girls--safe from  abuse and sexual assault. We know this is a real issue. In fact, the  Department of Education estimates that one in five women has been  sexually assaulted during her college years.   As attorney general of California, I was proud to bring together  colleges and local law enforcement agencies to create protocols for  investigating and prosecuting sexual assaults. It has helped schools  and law enforcement implement changes to California law to better  protect survivors of sexual assault. I championed new methods to allow  California to process rape kits and clear a longstanding backlog of  rape kits in the State crime labs. I fought to ensure that survivors  have the support they need and that their attackers face swift  accountability and consequences for their crimes.   There is no question that ending campus sexual assault should be a  moral imperative for our country, and it should be a priority for the  next Secretary of Education of the United States. For that reason, it  is unfortunate--and, yes, troubling--that Mrs. DeVos will not guarantee  enforcement of title IX.   Then let's talk about the Individuals with Disabilities Education  Act, or IDEA. I know my colleague Senator Hassan has spoken extensively  about this. This act has been around for decades--four decades, to be  exact. Before it existed, we were not prioritizing these children. We  did not give them the services they needed. We had written off a whole  population of our children. When asked by my colleague Maggie Hassan  about this piece of legislation, the nominee showed a complete lack of  knowledge about how it is implemented. That is simply unacceptable. We  cannot go back to a time when we wrote off a whole population of  people, and it cannot only be the parents of those children--but all of  us, as the adults of a society and a country--who look out for our most  vulnerable children.   Then, let's talk about for-profit colleges, which I know something  about since I had to sue one of the biggest for-profit colleges, which  was defrauding students as well as taxpayers. I know about the reality  of abuses of for-profit colleges, and I applaud my colleague Elizabeth  Warren, who asked whether or how she would protect against waste,  fraud, and abuse at for-profit colleges. She asked this of the nominee,  and it was troubling to see that the nominee was equivocal at best.   Now, let's talk about the nominee's record as it relates to the  children of her home State of Michigan. Since the growth of charter  schools, Michigan has gone from performing higher than average on the  National Assessment of Educational Progress in the year 2000 to below  average by the year 2015. A 2015 Federal review found an ``unreasonably  high'' number of charters in Michigan which were among the bottom 5  percent of schools nationwide. According to a report from Chalkbeat, an  education publication, when the Michigan legislature attempted to add  oversight for both charter schools and traditional public schools in  Detroit, the nominee's family opposed the measures and poured $1.45  million in the legislature's campaign coffers--an average of $25,000 a  day for 7 weeks. The oversight measures, she is happy to say, never  made their way into the legislation. We cannot have someone who wants  to lead our highest Department of Education who does not support the  importance of oversight, of making sure that the children are getting  the benefit of their bargain.   According to data released from the Michigan Association of Public  School Academies in 2015, only 17 percent of Detroit charter school  students were rated proficient in math, compared to 13 percent of  students in traditional public schools. Even Eli Broad, a great  Californian and strong supporter of dramatic education reforms, has  expressed strong concerns about the nominee's nomination. That should  tell us all something.   Now let's talk about the impact on California. During the campaign,  President Trump said he would take $20 billion from existing Federal  education programs--which, by the way, is more than half of the  Department's budget for K-12 education--and instead put that money into  a voucher-like system. The President also committed to getting rid of  the Department of Education in its entirety, which would put half a  million teachers out of work. The nominee has committed to working with  him on these plans.   Let's be clear. This plan would be devastating for public schools,  including the schools in California that serve over 6 million students.  This also means California students could lose $2.3 billion in Federal  education funding, which could end critical programs. For example, the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act serves thousands of  California's disabled students and serves them well. But his plan would  slash $1.3 billion in Federal funding--money that our children rely on.  The Trump proposal to cut the Department of Education budget would also  harm California's students. Some $3.8 million in Pell grants for  California students could be lost, 43,000 or more teacher positions in  California could be eliminated, and $8.96 billion in student loans  could be at risk for California's college students.   The bottom line is this--fewer teachers, fewer resources for students  and parents, and less aid to make college affordable. Maybe one school  will cut their after-school program or stop teaching the arts, or it  doesn't have a guidance counselor or decides they will just let class  size balloon because they don't have enough teachers. We know that is  not good enough for any of us.   There is a clear connection between public education and public  safety. When I was the district attorney of San Francisco, there was a  rash of homicides one year. All of us in a position of leadership were  rightly concerned, and we did the predictable and the right thing: We  figured out how to put more cops on the street, we looked at our gang  intervention strategies, and we figured out very predictable and good  ways of reacting to these crimes after they occurred.   But I asked a question. I asked a member of my staff: Do an  assessment and tell me who are these homicide victims? In particular,  who are the homicide victims under the age of 25? The reason I asked  that question is pretty simple. There were just a lot of them. Sure  enough, the data came back to me. It included the fact that, of the  homicide victims under the age of 25, 94 percent were high school  dropouts.   Over the years, I have taken a closer look at this issue. I have  learned that 82 percent of the prisoners in the United States are high  school dropouts. I have learned that an African American man who is a  high school dropout between the age of 30 and 34 is two-thirds as  likely to be in jail, have been in jail, or dead. There is a direct  connection between what we do or do not do in our public education  systems and the price we all pay in terms of our public safety. I say  to everyone concerned: There are good reasons to care about the  education of children. If nothing else, be concerned about why you have  to have three padlocks on your front door. If we don't educate our  children in our public school system, we all pay the price.   Mrs. DeVos's agenda means fewer teachers and resources and worse  schools. Fundamentally, her lack of understanding of the rights  teachers have today, the rights parents have today, and the rights  students have today mean one thing: She cannot--and will not--uphold  the law if she does not understand the law. Her testimony has made  clear that she does not understand IDEA, she does not understand  initiatives like gun-free zones in schools, and she does not understand  the history or the need for title IX.  [[Page S724]]    If Betsy DeVos gets her way and cuts funding for public schools, that  means fewer teachers. If she does what she did in Michigan, that will  mean poor outcomes with fewer high school graduates. What we know is  that these are the kinds of policies that prevent us from actually  achieving all that we know we can be as a country, which is about  paying attention to all the members of our society, and, in particular,  our children, and investing in them with the education they so richly  deserve so they can one day stand in this Chamber as a Member of the  Senate, doing the best of what we know we can do as a country.   Simply put, I will say this. It is clear from her testimony that  Betsy DeVos has not done her homework. She hasn't done her homework in  terms of preparing for the job, and she did not do her homework in  terms of preparing for her hearing. I say that right now the Senate  must do our job, we must do our homework, and we must refuse to confirm  her as the next Secretary of Education.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the suggestion that reciting the words of  the great Coretta Scott King would invoke rule XIX and force Senator  Warren to sit down and be silent is outrageous.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, my parents met when they were graduate  students at the University of California, Berkeley, in the 1960s when  they were active in the civil rights movement. In fact, my sister and I  joke that we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent their  full time marching and shouting for this thing called justice.   I was part of only the second class to integrate Berkeley, CA, public  schools almost two decades after the U.S. Supreme Court declared that  separate was inherently unequal in the great case of Brown v. Board of  Education--a case, I might add, that was supported by an amicus brief  from the then U.S. Attorney General.   In fact, it was the lawyers in Brown v. Board of Education--Thurgood  Marshall, Charles Hamilton Houston, and Constance Baker Motley--who  inspired me at a young age to become a lawyer.   Simply put, it is likely that had the U.S. Supreme Court not decided  the  [[Page S944]]  way it did in Brown v. Board of Education, I would not be standing here  as a Member of the U.S. Senate.   So then, as a direct beneficiary of landmark rulings by the U.S.  judicial system and the American judicial system, I am acutely aware of  the lasting and profound impact our courts can have on the everyday  lives of Americans. It is with a deep sense of respect and admiration  for the role of our justice system that I rise to oppose the nomination  of Senator Sessions to be the next Attorney General of the United  States.   The mission of the Department of Justice is clear: ``To enforce the  law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law;  to ensure public safety against threats, foreign and domestic; to  provide Federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek  just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure  fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.''   It is those words--``justice for all''--that best articulate the  spirit behind our judicial system.   I am a career prosecutor. In fact, I started my work as a young  deputy district attorney in the Alameda County District Attorney's  Office. That office was once led by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice  Earl Warren. Every time I filed a case, it would never read with the  name of the victim versus the name of the defendant. It always read  ``the people'' versus the defendant because in our democracy, in our  great judicial system, we have rightly said a harm against any one of  us is a harm against all of us, especially because we know that harm is  most often directed at some of the most vulnerable and voiceless among  us. So we rightly have declared that as a civil society, we will not  require them to fight alone. We will stand with them. Justice for all.   This point is what raises my question of whether this nominee can  fulfill the role and responsibility of this job. Let's be clear. This  is not a debate about a President's nominee. It is not simply a debate  about a President's nominee. This is a debate about the fundamental  ideals of our country--ideals that date back to the founding of our  country and those great words we spoke in 1776: ``We hold these Truths  to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are  endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among  these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.''   All men are created equal, with unalienable rights. In other words,  President Lincoln was fulfilling the promise first made in the  Declaration of Independence, a promise that made clear the basis for  legal equality derives not through a right that is given but from  natural rights--rights that have been endowed upon us by our Creator;  rights that cannot and should not be taken away or given up.   So let us recognize that civil rights are not given through the  enactment of a law or the publication of a court decision. Rather, our  inherent civil rights are fulfilled when we guarantee them through the  implementation and enforcement of the law.   Well-meaning people indeed can argue over the best means to ensure  our fundamental rights, but it is crucial that we do not allow  ourselves to be drawn into a suggestion that enforcing civil rights is  favoring one group over another. Protecting civil rights is not about  taking care of someone else. It is in our common interests. It is in  each of our self-interests.   Liberty for each of us depends on liberty for all of us. It is just  like the Department of Justice's mission, which articulates in those  three words, ``justice for all.''   This is the Department's charge. It is its mission, and the next  Attorney General of the United States must use his powers as a  prosecutor to uphold it.   This brings me to the troubling and, frankly, unacceptable record of  the nominee for this office. It is the U.S. Department of Justice that  is charged with enforcing the rights of those trying to cast a ballot,  but Senator Sessions cheered the Supreme Court's decision to gut the  Voting Rights Act, used his power as a U.S. attorney to prosecute three  African-American Civil Rights activists in Alabama, and then called the  NAACP ``un-American.''   It is the U.S. Department of Justice that addresses systemic  inequalities that we know, unfortunately, still exist in our criminal  justice system and have led to mass incarceration--but Senator Sessions  led the opposition to bipartisan sentencing reform.   It is the U.S. Department of Justice that investigates and prosecutes  crimes motivated by hate based on race, religion, gender, nationality,  disability, or sexual orientation of its victim--but in the 1990s, when  lawmakers worked to pass hate crime legislation after the brutal  killing of Matthew Shepard, Senator Sessions was a vocal opponent.   It is the U.S. Department of Justice that uses the power of the  prosecutor to protect women who have been victims of crime--but Senator  Sessions voted no when both Democrats and Republicans came together to  reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which gives support and  assistance to survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault,  including members of our LGBT community.   It is the U.S. Department of Justice that defends that most  fundamental right of freedom to worship--but it was Senator Sessions  who was one of the most outspoken defenders of then-candidate and now- President Donald Trump's unconstitutional Muslim travel ban which, by  the way, was roundly denounced by many of his fellow Republicans.   It is the U.S. Department of Justice that enforces Federal laws  prohibiting employment practices that discriminate on the grounds of  race, sex, religion, and national origin. But Senator Sessions has  opposed the Paycheck Fairness Act, Lilly Ledbetter Act, and the  Employee Non-Discrimination Act.   It is the U.S. Department of Justice that implements the Americans  with Disabilities Act. But when both Democrats and Republicans worked  to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which  provides resources to children with special needs, Senator Sessions  said that providing educational services for these children ``may be  the single most irritating problem for teachers throughout America  today.''   Whether you are the father of a special needs child in a classroom, a  woman trying to earn fair pay, an African-American man in a voting  booth, or a victim at a police station trying to report a crime,  Senator Sessions has not been your advocate.   As a former U.S. Attorney General, the great Bobby Kennedy once said:         We must recognize the full human equality of all our people       before God, before the law, and in the councils of       government. We must do this, not because it is economically       advantageous, although it is; not because the laws of God and       man command it, although they do; not because people in other       lands wish it so. We must do it for the single and       fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do.    The right thing to do. That is what makes us special as a country.  That is what makes us right. That is what makes us great--our values  and our ideas. It is the belief that no matter who you are, whether  young or old, rich or poor, gay or straight; whether you are a child  from Oakland or a child from Birmingham; whether you came here by plane  to escape the hardships of war and torture or by foot to build a better  life; whether you have been the victim of gun violence or opioid  addiction; whether you are paid less than others doing the same work or  stopped at a red light because of the color of your skin, you deserve  an Attorney General who recognizes the full human quality of all  people.   It is what led Attorney General Herbert Brownell, when there was  rampant voter discrimination and intimidation here in the United  States, to create in the United States Department of Justice the Civil  Rights Division, whose mission is to ``uphold the civil and  constitutional rights of all Americans, particularly some of the most  vulnerable members of our society.''   It is what led Attorney General William Rogers to forcefully demand  the integration of an elementary school at the Redstone missile center  in Alabama when the children of Black servicemembers were being denied  entry.   It is that commitment that led Bobby Kennedy to send 500 U.S.  marshals to Oxford, MS, to escort a young Black man, James Meredith, to  enroll at Ole Miss. It is what led U.S. Attorney General Elliott  Richardson to resign rather than do the bidding of a corrupt President  during Watergate.   It is what led my friend, Attorney General Eric Holder, to sue the  State  [[Page S945]]  of Arizona over SB 1070, a law that led to the unjust racial profiling  of immigrants and to say that the U.S. Government would no longer  defend a law that prevented LGBT Americans from expressing their love  for one another.   It is what led Attorney General Sally Yates, on a Monday evening this  month, to stand up and refuse to defend a Muslim ban.   More than most Cabinet positions, the U.S. Attorney General enforces  the principles that are the founding of our country, but I have seen no  evidence in his record or testimony that Senator Sessions will approach  this office in furtherance of these noble ideals. The gains our country  has made are not permanent, and it is incumbent on the Attorney General  of the United States to fight for the civil rights of all people.   No one said it better than Coretta Scott King:         Freedom is never really won. You earn it and win it in       every generation.    If Senator Sessions won't, then it is incumbent upon the rest of us  to persist.   I urge my colleagues to vote no.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
