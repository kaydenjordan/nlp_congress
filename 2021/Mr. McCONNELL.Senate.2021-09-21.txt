 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the senior House Democrat told us back  in March of 2020 that COVID presented ``a tremendous opportunity to  restructure things to fit our vision.''   President Biden said last week that ``while this pandemic has been  godawful for so many reasons . . . it does present us with an  opportunity.''   The reckless taxing-and-spending spree that Washington Democrats are  assembling behind closed doors would put more debt, more borrowing, and  more inflation on the shoulders of American families. It would make  Washington, DC, dramatically more involved in families' childcare,  their health coverage, their local energy utilities, and on and on.   There are so many controversial changes being crammed into one mega  bill that it must be a deliberate strategy: try to achieve everything  the far left has wanted for 20 years in one fell swoop before the  country has time to realize what hit it.   So today, I am going to focus on just one example. Let's look at the  tax hikes, a staggering historic set of tax hikes; tax hikes on small  business, tax hikes on family farms, tax hikes on Americans that would  shatter the pledge to spare people earning less than $400,000 a year,  tax hikes that would put even more Americans into unfair double  taxation of the death tax, massive taxes on the U.S. economy that would  give us one of the least competitive tax structures in the developed  world.   For example, even Communist China taxes their own businesses  significantly less than President Biden and his allies want America to  tax ours.   Tax hike after tax hike after tax hike--a smothering wet blanket  thrown onto an economy that is already struggling to fully recover  because of the inflation and worker shortages that Democrats' policies  have already unleashed.   So when you add it all up, Democrats want to ram through one of the  largest peacetime tax hikes on record, if not the single largest. So  let me say that again. Behind closed doors, Washington Democrats are  drafting what may very well be the largest peacetime tax hike that our  country has literally ever seen.   But this isn't to say that nobody gets a leg up in this bill. So  listen to this. Somehow, mysteriously, many of the Democrats' favorite  groups and special interests come out just fine. Isn't that  fascinating?   For example, their legislation would allow ordinary Americans'  charitable deduction on top of the standard deduction to expire. Ah,  but they would replace it with a brandnew tax break of almost exactly  the same dollar amount for union dues that go to Big Labor. So you take  out a charitable deduction for regular Americans, put in a new one for  union dues that would benefit Big Labor. They are scrapping Americans'  extra deduction for donating to charity and replacing it with a special  subsidy for union dues for Big Labor.   Really, you can't make this stuff up. Sorry, Red Cross. Sorry, local  churches and houses of worship. Sorry, soup kitchens. Democrats think  the Teamsters and the SEIU need the money more than you do.   And they aren't the only group that Democrats favor, who literally  make out like bandits. Look at high-income earners in coastal blue  States. The bill that raises taxes on everything that moves somehow-- somehow--makes room for a special, gigantic tax cut for wealthy people  who choose to live in high-tax States. More than half the benefit of  the so-called SALT policy would go to the top 1 percent of households.   There is also a special tax break for people who choose to purchase  expensive electric cars. You get the picture: make U.S. industry less  competitive than China in order to massively subsidize the coastal  cosmopolitan lifestyle. That is what the Democrats want.   This bill would also create a new national dragnet for ordinary  Americans' banking information. Community banks and credit unions would  be hammered with new requirements to report to the feds whenever  citizens make transactions--listen to this--in excess of $600.  Community banks and credit unions would have new requirements to report  to the Federal Government whenever citizens make transactions in excess  of $600.   Big Brother wants to peer into America's bank accounts. Here is how  one local Kentucky lender described this concept to me: a ``flagrant  violation of privacy and offense to liberty.''   That pretty well sums it up. So, huge tax hikes on Americans,  expensive giveaways for coastal elites, and new government snooping-- snooping--into families' finances.   So that is just one corner of this reckless taxing-and-spending spree  that should never see the light of day.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on a different matter. Last week,  Senate Democrats announced what was marketed as a compromise on carving  out a bigger role for Washington in elections all across our country.   It was hardly the first time our Democratic colleagues had given  their takeover of 50 States' election laws a makeover. Over the years,  it has sometimes been sold as an urgent overhaul of our democracy;  other times as just a set of narrow tweaks. But for all of their  attempts to change up the pitch, the unfortunate fact is that the bones  of the Democrats' proposal are still the same.   The latest version is only a compromise in the sense that the center  left compromised with the far left. Under the hood is the same  Frankenstein's monster that has been there since 2019, years--years-- before the State-level actions which Democrats now claim have made it  all necessary.   It still makes Washington bureaucrats the de facto board of elections  for all 50 States, dictating the terms of things like automatic and  same-day voter registration. It still insists on impeding State efforts  to ensure integrity of voter rolls through popular, commonsense voter  ID measures. It still has government dollars going directly to  politicians' campaigns--that  [[Page S6560]]  is the public funds for bumper stickers and attack ads. It still  empowers partisan regulators to circumvent the bipartisan FEC and  engage in even more intimidation of private citizens who engage in  political speech. And these, of course, are just to name a few.   Now, surely, as the Senate continues to do its job and strike down  misguided ideas like these, we will hear plenty from folks who consider  it evidence that this body is broken. But, of course, that simply is  not true. The Senate is fully capable of taking landmark, bipartisan  action that makes it easier to vote and harder to cheat.   Back in 2002, I was involved, along with my colleague Chris Dodd, in  passing the Help America Vote Act. I was one of the leaders on that. We  empowered State and local election systems to follow commonsense  guideposts for integrity and accessibility. It provided basically a  grant program to States to help them upgrade their voter systems after  the Florida election in 2000. And the Senate passed it 92 to 2--92 to  2.   So if our Democratic colleagues really want to find common ground and  act on common sense, the roadmap is right there. But, unfortunately, we  know that has never been the case.   Unfortunately, this latest ``compromise'' is just a repackaging of  what even reporters called a messaging bill that was headed nowhere.  The substance is not really changing, so neither will the result.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
