 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of  S.J. Res. 15, a resolution to repeal the OCC's so-called true lender  rule.   Earlier this year, my State, Illinois, passed a law that protects our  consumers from predatory, high-interest loans. Eighteen other States  have done the same.   I introduced the House version of this resolution because the true  lender rule undermines laws like ours, laws that keep working-class  people out of cycles of debt they can't pay back.   The rule is a rubber stamp for rent-a-bank schemes, where a lender  can dodge State law by having a bank's name on the loan paperwork. That  is all. No skin in the game, no investment in our communities; just a  name on the paperwork.   This rule doesn't encourage innovation. It encourages playing games.  This isn't a partisan issue. As a matter of fact, last year, 82 percent  of Nebraska voters joined States like Arkansas and South Dakota to  protect their communities from unpayable debt, and this rule from the  OCC provides bad actors with a new tool to ignore them.   So a broad coalition of over 400 organizations--rural, urban,  suburban--have come together in support of this measure, and they  include consumer advocates, labor advocates, veterans, credit unions,  and many other actors, including evangelical congregations.   Madam Speaker, I urge this body to pass this resolution and empower  working-class communities like mine that are targeted by predatory  lenders, and voters across the country who support consumer  protections.
