 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to repeal  of the Affordable Care Act.   For 7 years, all we have heard from the Republicans regarding health  care is repeal and replace.   After 7 years and more than 60 votes, they still have not come up  with the replace. This isn't just a talking point. This is literally a  matter of life and death for people.   Raymond, from Napa in my district, was diagnosed with stage III renal  cancer in 1996. His premiums rose year after year until we passed the  ACA.   Before the ACA, Raymond worried about losing his insurance because of  his preexisting condition. In fact, his cancer returned in 2014, but,  thanks to the ACA, he got the treatment he needed.   What are Republicans going to do for Raymond if they repeal the ACA  and his premiums go up, or his insurance drops him because he had  cancer over 20 years ago, or he hits his lifetime cap on coverage?   Republicans need to ask themselves if they are willing to return  Americans like Raymond to a time when the care they needed was always  beyond their grasp.   I am not saying that it is perfect, but we need to keep it. It also  kills 3 million jobs.
