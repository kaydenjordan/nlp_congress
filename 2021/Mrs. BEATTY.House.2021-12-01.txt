 Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Congressional Black  Caucus, I rise today in honor of the memory of Rosa Parks, our Nation's  greatest hero.   It has been 66 years, Madam Speaker, since Rosa Parks refused to give  up her seat for a White rider, sparking her arrest and the beginning of  the civil rights movement.   My Congressional Black Caucus colleague, Congresswoman Representative  Sewell, is the original cosponsor of the Rosa Parks Day Act, a bill  that would make December 1 a Federal holiday in her honor, along with  Congressman   Jim Cooper and I.   Many of you may not know, but 17 years ago, through my leadership,  Ohio was the first in the Nation to pass Rosa Parks Day legislation.  Our district will celebrate this year's Rosa Parks Day on December 13  in a celebration called ``The Power of One: You.''   So please join me and my colleagues in supporting the Rosa Parks Day  Act to honor a great American. This is our power. This is our message.                            ____________________
