 I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 965, the Young African  Leaders Initiative Act, led by Representative Bass and Representative  Smith.   YALI provides fellowship opportunities at U.S. universities and other  training programs at Regional Leadership Centers throughout sub-Saharan  Africa on leadership skills, entrepreneurship, and effective public  administration.   Not only is this an investment in future generations of African  leaders, but this is also effective diplomacy. At a time when the  Chinese Communist Party is ramping up exchange programs across the  continent and establishing Confucius Institutes, programs like YALI are  critical to providing alternate opportunities.   I urge my colleagues to support this important measure. I yield back  the balance of my time.  [[Page H1939]]         I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Meeks and Representative  Connolly for working on this compromise text for the Protection of  Saudi Dissidents Act that strikes an important balance.   The bill we are voting on today shows that we can strongly advocate  for human rights in Saudi Arabia and for its nationals abroad without  leaving Saudi Arabia and Americans in the region vulnerable to threats  from Iran and other malign actors. This bill shows we can protect our  values and our security interests at the same time.   I urge all Members to support this legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1083, the Southeast Asia  Strategy Act, important legislation that I introduced to ensure the  United States engages proactively and meaningfully in a critical region  of the world.   This powerhouse region joins the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean  regions and serves as a conduit for global trade. The Southeast Asian  states are increasingly vital to the prosperity of the U.S. economy,  generating hundreds of thousands of American jobs.   The People's Republic of China, eager to undermine U.S. interests in  this key region, is aggressively working to expand its influence in  Southeast Asia. It seeks to exploit its predatory investment,  development, and trade policies; illegal military installations in the  South China Sea; and disinformation campaigns to coerce countries to  accept its agenda.   The United States has long enjoyed strong relations with Southeast  Asia, and it must now fully realize this strategic partnership. The  Southeast Asia Strategic Act will ensure the United States develops and  communicates a coherent regional strategy that addresses all aspects of  the relationship, from trade and humanitarian goals to diplomatic and  security arrangements.   We have a national interest in sustaining U.S. leadership in  Southeast Asia, supporting human rights and respect for democratic  freedoms, and articulating our strategic priorities.   We will find willing partners in our many friends and allies in the  region that share our grave concerns regarding China's belligerence and  growing power.   I thank Representative Castro, with whom I co-chair the Congressional  Caucus on ASEAN, for working with me on this legislation. Congress'  strong bipartisan support for U.S. engagement in Southeast Asia sends  an unmistakable message of American resolve and leadership to the  region.   Madam Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1083, the  Southeast Asia Strategy Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1945
