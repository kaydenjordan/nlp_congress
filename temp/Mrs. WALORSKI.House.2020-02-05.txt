 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4031, the Great  Lakes Restoration Initiative Act.   GLRI is a vital program that coordinates Federal efforts among 15  agencies to address the most significant challenges facing the Great  Lakes.   The Great Lakes are among our most precious natural resources and a  key economic driver in my home State of Indiana. For instance, the  recreational boating industry alone provides $2 billion to Indiana's  economy each year. Yet the environmental and economic health of our  region is under threat from a host of issues facing the Great Lakes,  including pollution, severe erosion, loss of native habitat, invasive  species, and destructive algae blooms.   GLRI is a critical investment in preserving and protecting the Great  Lakes as well as creating jobs and growing our economy. That is why I  am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 4031, which would  reauthorize the program funding through fiscal year 2026.   Protecting and improving the Great Lakes means making sure current  and future generations can experience the natural beauty and the  recreational activities like fishing, boating, and hiking that have  always been important to our part of the Midwest.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representatives Joyce and Kaptur for  their hard work on this bipartisan legislation. I also want to thank my  fellow Hoosier, Congressman Pete Visclosky, for his decades of service  and his leadership in making the Indiana Dunes Indiana's first national  park.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to protect the Great Lakes by  voting for H.R. 4031.
