 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for  yielding and for holding this Special Order tonight.   The American people are frightened by what they are seeing unfold at  the southern border. That fear is real, and it is only amplified by an  administration that has chosen to sit back and do absolutely nothing.   For months, the Biden administration has struggled to decide what to  call this situation, often scrambling to find the newest and less  severe synonym to the word ``crisis.'' The word ``crisis'' suits this  situation perfectly, but apparently, that word is too harsh, according  to the White House.   Pretty soon, this administration won't have any words left to use,  and they will accept the reality that they need to own up to the crisis  they created.   Republicans are not interested in letting complacency take hold while  the country we love is left open and vulnerable and changed forever. We  will continue to call out this administration for its failures, and we  will continue to fight to protect America and its citizens.
