 Madam Speaker, in January, House Democrats pledged to  get to work for the people and take action to uplift the lives of  everyday Americans.   I am so proud of the progress we have made and the proposals we have  advanced that would have real, meaningful impacts on our communities.  Unfortunately, our partners in the United States Senate have abdicated  their responsibility to do the same.   We have sent over 300 bipartisan bills to the Senate so far this  year, and not one has been taken up for a vote. This includes  legislation to keep our communities safer by enacting universal  background checks on all gun sales, legislation that would raise the  minimum wage, safeguard our elections, protect people with preexisting  conditions, and ensure equal pay for equal work.   We were elected to serve the American people, and I will keep  fighting alongside my colleagues in the House to advance legislation  that improves the lives of everyone who calls our Nation home. I call  upon the United States Senate to do the very same.                            ____________________
