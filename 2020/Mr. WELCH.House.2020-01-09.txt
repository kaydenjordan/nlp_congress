 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The President's policy towards Iran is to tear up diplomacy and  embrace so-called maximum pressure.   The most recent strike, far from making us safer, is making us more  insecure.   Think about the deliberate consequences from that act:   One, the Iraqi street is demonstrating against the U.S., not against  Iran, as they were before;   Two, the Iranian street is demonstrating with the mullahs against the  U.S. instead of against their own government;   Three, the Iraqi parliament voted to expel the United States from  Iraq, jeopardizing our anti-ISIS mission;   Number four, our military has suspended training for anti-ISIS  activities in Iraq because of this strike;   Number five, the Iran nuclear deal that the President tore up that  Iranians complied with, they are now renouncing, so we are closer to a  nuclear Iran than we were before.   All of this has happened when the likelihood of Iran's further  responding is grave.    Madam Speaker, the gun is cocked and loaded.   We cannot go to war without Congress being involved in the debate and  the President telling us what his policy is going to be.
