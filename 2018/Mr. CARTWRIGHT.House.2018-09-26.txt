 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 302,  the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, as amended. For many years,  aviation has been the safest form of transportation in the United  States. This is by no means an accident, it is the result of a strong  regulatory framework built over time, paired with an ongoing airline  system safety culture that is one of the most ambitious in our nation's  history.   Mr. Speaker, when this bill first came to the House floor as H.R. 4,  I strongly opposed a provision that would establish a research and  development program in support of single-piloted cargo aircraft  assisted with remote piloting and computer piloting, and offered an  amendment striking that section. Attempts to roll back safety  regulations in this manner are counterproductive and compromise safety.  I am pleased to see this provision stricken from the final bill text  and urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 302, the FAA  Reauthorization Act of 2018.
