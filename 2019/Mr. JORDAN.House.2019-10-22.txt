 Madam Speaker, what are the Democrats hiding? What are  they hiding? Trying to impeach the President of the United States 13  months before an election based on an anonymous whistleblower with no  first-hand knowledge, who has a bias against the President, who worked  with Joe Biden, who wrote a memo the day after the call. And he  described the call as ``frightening, scary,'' but then he waits 18 days  before he files the complaint. And who does he run off and see during  that 18-day timeframe? Adam Schiff, the guy who is running the secret  process in a bunker in the basement of the Capitol.   What are they hiding from the American people? Americans get  fairness. They understand it. And they instinctively know that this  secretive process is not fair. 435 Members of the House representing  over 300 million people in this country, and only one of them, Adam  Schiff, knows who the guy is who started this whole darn charade. Adam  Schiff is the only one who knows. Why don't the rest of us? Why don't,  more importantly, the 300 million people who we all get the privilege  of representing, why don't they know who the people are who started  this whole darn process that the American people see through?   Americans get fairness, and they know this is instinctively unfair.                            ____________________
