 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 10 minutes.    Mr. President, first, I commend my colleague from  Kansas for his remarkable commitment to this Nation and to those who  serve this Nation. And he is always there at the Honor Flights for  World War II, the Honor Flights of those who served in Korea, of those  who served in Vietnam, and those who served in the Global War  [[Page S7361]]  on Terror. His leadership is commendable, and people from both sides of  the aisle look up to him and appreciate the work he does on his  committees and his commitment to the veterans who serve this Nation.   So I thank the distinguished Senator from Kansas for his ongoing  commitment, and it is with appreciation and admiration and respect I  follow his speech to thank him for the commitment and the comments  about what happened in Afghanistan because just this very weekend, on  Saturday, the Governor of Wyoming and I stood with over 1,000 people in  the cold in Wyoming as we honored the life of Rylee McCollum, who was  one of those 13 who was killed in Kabul at the airport on that fateful  day in Afghanistan, merely 2 months ago. And with us also was Rylee's  wife GiGi and the baby that was born after Rylee had been killed--the  baby who will never know her father, who will always know his story,  and will always know that he was an American hero.    Madam President, I rise today to honor Dr. Kristaps  Keggi. Dr. Keggi is the epitome of the American dream. He was born in  Riga, Latvia, and survived World War II as a child. He escaped  communism on a refugee ship to immigrate to the United States. When he  landed on the docks of Manhattan, he would go on to finish high school  and attend college and medical school. He graduated from Yale  University in 1955 and from Yale University School of Medicine in 1959.   Eight years after he arrived in the U.S., he raised his right hand  and volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army. He joined the U.S. Army  Medical Service and Medical Corps. Dr. Keggi served as the orthopedic  surgery chief in the Third Mobile Army Surgical Hospital--MASH--in  Vietnam from September 1965 to June 1966. This was the first MASH unit  stood up and the first to deploy to Vietnam. The 3rd MASH supported the  173rd Airborne Brigade, the 1st and 25th Infantry Divisions, and  countless other units. He left the Army with the rank of captain. He is  a life member of the Veterans of Foreign of Wars.   Dr. Keggi's service did not stop after Vietnam. His battlefield  experience sharpened his skills. He would go on to train generations of  orthopedic surgeons and win worldwide acclaim for orthopedic education  and innovation. I credit much of my success as an orthopedic surgeon  and in life to training under Dr. Keggi.   Dr. Keggi is the founder and the president of the Keggi Orthopedic  Foundation and Orthopedic Exchange Program between the United States  and the former Soviet Republics. This program has fostered hundreds of  fellows in exchanges in Latvia and Russia. He even mentored the former  President of Latvia who was a fellow orthopedic surgeon.   He holds memberships in many scholarly societies such as American  Orthopedic Association, American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons,  American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, Society for Arthritic  Joint Surgery, and Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, just to  highlight a few.   He has published over 135 scholarly articles on orthopedic medical  treatments. He was the senior author of the seminal American Academy of  Orthopedic Surgeons Instructional Course on ``Early Care of Severe War  Wounds'' on how battlefield wounds should be treated. He pioneered and  popularized the less invasive anterior surgical approach used for total  hip replacement. Dr. Keggi has been recognized by Best Doctors in  America starting in 1996. He was named in America's Top Surgeons in  2009 through 2017.   Dr. Keggi has volunteered for many charitable endeavors and has been  recognized globally for his contributions to medical science and  humanity. He was honored by his hometown of Waterbury, CT, and the  Waterbury Veterans Memorial Committee for his lifetime of service  working with and treating patients with the wounds of war. In 2020, Dr.  Keggi was inducted into the Connecticut Veterans Hall of Fame.   Dr. Keggi's service embodies everything our country stands for. Every  opportunity he has been given in the U.S., he has given back in full.  My wife Bobbi and I thank him today for his life of service to our  military, our veterans, and our Nation.                            ____________________
