 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill.   The Family Farmer Relief Act of 2019 brings urgently needed help to a  critical link in America's economy and a vital part of American  community life, the family farmer.   In 2005, Congress permanently enacted chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy  Code. Chapter 12 is specially designed to help family farmers  reorganize their debts in time of need and keep their farms going. In  the years since, chapter 12 and its streamlined procedures have worked  well.   There has, however, been one problem. As time has passed, the cost of  running a family farm have rapidly increased; the ceiling on chapter  12, on how much debt a family farm can reorganize, has lagged behind.  Especially with the advent of modern, high-tech farming equipment, the  chapter 12 ceiling is no longer high enough to let many farms with  typical amounts of debt go into chapter 12.   The Family Farmer Relief Act of 2019 fixes this problem. It raises  the ceiling from the old, roughly $4.5 million limit to a more  reasonable $10 million limit. This means that more family farmers will  be able to successfully reorganize when they need to, to the benefit of  the economy and local communities across the land.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill. I urge my  colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I yield  back the balance of my time.
