 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to complete my remarks before the scheduled vote.    Madam President, I am fortunate enough to live in  Baltimore, and I say that because I can commute every night to home,  which is a real pleasure, to be able to be with my family in the  evening. My wife Myrna and I normally take a morning walk before I  start the day, and I can get the morning report from my neighbors as to  what is on their minds.   So, this morning, you might be surprised to learn that the major  topic of discussion was the Brood X, also known as the cicadas. These  are the cicadas that appear every 17 years. Now, I must tell you, that  became our subject because we were all trying to avoid stepping on them  as we were walking.   Most of us would describe world events of the past calendar year as  unprecedented, and this characterization is not wrong. For public  health, for the economy, and for our democracy, the year 2021 has  indeed brought us challenges previously unimaginable. However, 2021  also marks a predictably predictable natural phenomenon: the emergence  of what is known as the 17-year cicadas. Reliably, every 17 years,  these insects emerge in the Mid-Atlantic in droves. People greet their  visits with equal amounts of scorn and excitement. Some of that is  depending upon age.   I hope that we can use this 17-year marker to celebrate the  scientific contributions of an unappreciated Marylander and reflect  more broadly on the history of the relationship between humans and the  natural environment in the Mid-Atlantic, especially the Chesapeake Bay.   Maryland sees the highest concentration of cicadas on the east coast.  Scientists estimate that in some places, we have more than 25 or 30  cicadas per square foot or more than 1 million per acre. In addition to  this astonishing quantity, male cicadas will perform a mating song  that, in large groups, can reach the same decibel level as a lawnmower.   The cicadas' visits last only a matter of weeks for the purpose of  mating, molting, and laying eggs that will eventually burrow into the  ground and repeat the process in another 17 years.   In the words of prominent Maryland scientist Benjamin Banneker, ``If  their lives are short, they are merry,'' noting that ``they still  continue on singing till they die.''   Benjamin Banneker's original handwritten document describing the  cicadas in 1800 is at the Maryland Center for History and Culture in  Baltimore. He accurately predicted the next 17-year cycles. Over the  course of his life, he witnessed four 17-year cycles of cicadas.  Benjamin Banneker may have  [[Page S2768]]  been the first scientist to observe and record the 17-year lifecycle of  cicadas.   Banneker was born in 1731. His father, Robert Bannaky, was a formerly  enslaved Black man. His mother Mary was a free woman of mixed racial  heritage.   Banneker demonstrated a keen interest in the sciences after his  maternal grandmother taught him to read and write, and he continued his  education at a Quaker schoolhouse in Baltimore County. He quickly  excelled in the area of mathematics and astronomy and is now considered  one of the first African-American intellects to gain widespread fame.   He is probably best known for authorizing a series of commercially  successful farmers' almanacs that predicted weather and tidal patterns  for farmers and fishermen. Banneker also predicted lunar and solar  eclipses, contributed to surveying the land for the U.S. Capitol in  Washington, DC, and reportedly built the first domestically produced  wooden clock in the country.   In addition to his contributions to science and agriculture, Banneker  advocated for abolition in a series of letters he exchanged with  President Thomas Jefferson.   Mainstream historical narratives have largely excluded Banneker's  accomplishments as a prominent Black intellect in the early days of our  Nation. As we consider the enormous interest in the arrival of cicadas,  it is appropriate that we acknowledge Banneker's early leading role in  predicting the 17-year cycle.   There are few historical artifacts from Banneker's home in Maryland,  which burned down shortly after his death. Fortunately, we have the  Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum in Catonsville, MD, which  Baltimore County administers. The park tells the story of his  remarkable life and the impact the natural environment of the  Chesapeake Bay had in sparking his intellectual curiosity.   Maryland Governor Larry Hogan issued a proclamation declaring May and  June 2021 as Maryland Magicicada Months to recognize the return of the  17-year periodical cicadas and to generate public awareness about this  phenomena.   Fortunately, cicadas' buzz is worse than their bite. Cicadas do not  chew, bite, or sting, so they are not a threat to humans, pets,  animals, or most plants.   The unit of time marked by the arrival of the periodic cicadas in the  region is a useful interval to observe how the local environment has  changed over time.   Two years after the last emergence of cicadas in 2006 was the first  year the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science's  report card was released. The habitat health values were generally poor  overall in 2006, with a dramatic reduction in bay grasses. In 2019, the  overall score for Chesapeake Bay was a C-minus. This means the bay is  in moderate health and is slightly improving over time. For its first  ever score, the Chesapeake Bay scored B-minus. That means the larger  watershed is in good health.   The path to success for Chesapeake Bay's restoration remains steep  and is only becoming more challenging due to the harmful effects of  climate change. Warmer and wetter weather conditions work against  progress on removing pollutants and creating habitats conducive to  population regrowth. The Chesapeake Bay Clean Water Blueprint set forth  a timeline for the six watershed jurisdictions that end in 2025.   Now more than ever, we need State, local, and Federal partners  working in tandem to meet these goals. The Chesapeake Bay Program will  play a central role in that effort, bringing various Federal Agencies,  State and local governments, and nonprofit organizations together to  meet these goals.   A 17-year review of progress for the Chesapeake Bay should energize  the community to work hard to meet our goals. In order to do so, we  need the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to play its role as the  referee for the Chesapeake Bay Program. The success of the effort  depends on the stringent enforcement of statewide pollution reduction  plans by the EPA.   As we consider the next arrival of cicadas in the area in 2038, it is  impossible not to look ahead to the climate goals the Biden  administration has enumerated. By 2030, President Biden has pledged  that the United States should have reduced economy-wide net greenhouse  gas pollution by 50 to 52 percent. This goal is also referred to as the  nationally determined contribution, which is formally submitted to  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. President Biden  made this announcement during the Leaders Summit on Climate, which  serves to demonstrate the return of the United States to leadership on  climate issues.   The natural environment is probably one of the most obvious markers  of the passage of time and provides an appropriate moment of  reflection. Seasonal changes, growing trees and crops, and even the  arrival of the cicadas can push us to acknowledge where we have met our  objectives and where we have fallen short on our goals. In terms of our  local and global environmental restoration goals, we have a lot of work  to do before 2037.                           Tribute to Louise Foster    Madam President, as we reflect on change, I would like to take this  opportunity to congratulate a member of my personal staff, Louise  Foster, on her matriculation at Columbia University School of  International and Public Affairs this fall.   ``Weezie,'' as everyone who knows her calls her, has spent the last 3  years providing outstanding public service in my Washington, DC,  office, first as a staff assistant on the frontline of constituent  service and now as a legislative aide, applying science to  environmental and infrastructure policy.   While my staff and I will miss her, we wish her the very best of luck  and a little cicada magic in her academic pursuits.   With that, I yield the floor.                              Amendment No. 1517
