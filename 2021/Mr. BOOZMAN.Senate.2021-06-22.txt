 Madam President, I rise today to recognize  Baptist Health of Arkansas's centennial--a significant and commendable  milestone.   Today, Arkansans are gathering to celebrate this institution and its  staff that have been dedicated to providing exceptional faith-based  healthcare to its patients, strengthening communities through  compassionate service, and continuously responding to the ever-changing  health needs of Arkansans.   On February 16, 1921, the Arkansas Baptist State Convention  incorporated Baptist State Hospital to ensure Arkansans had access to  quality, faith-  [[Page S4693]]  based healthcare. Baptist Health started with a mere 70 beds and in  just 1 year more than tripled that number, administering care to more  than 300 patients. The hospital's humble beginnings show the diligence  of the men and women who, through intense devotion, made this  organization what it is today.   The dedication of Baptist Health's providers is a testament to this  healing ministry's service and commitment to its patients. For 100  years patients from across the State, Nation and world have relied on  the hospital's incredible doctors, nurses and staff to perform  lifesaving treatments and surgeries.   This institution has served the State of Arkansas in numerous ways,  from creating thousands of jobs to supporting the State economy and  saving the lives of countless patients. Baptist Health has created  reliable medical service across the State and helped many medical  professionals in their educations and careers.   Baptist Health has been a leader in medical advancement in Arkansas,  and its community of medical professionals have made tremendous  sacrifices to serve and care for patients. Their dedication has been  apparent during the COVID-19 public health crisis. This devotion to its  mission has made Baptist Health Arkansas's largest and most  comprehensive not-for profit healthcare organization. From the doctors  and nurses to the office workers and maintenance staff, each member of  the team demonstrates a passion for helping and healing.   Congratulations to Baptist Health on 100 years of service and  dedication to helping Arkansans live long and healthy lives. I look  forward to its continued excellence in healthcare for our State for  many more years.                            ____________________
