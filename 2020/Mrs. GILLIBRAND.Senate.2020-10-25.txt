 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    I rise today to speak about the future of the  Supreme Court, the future of our country, and the responsibility this  body has to the people of our Nation.   It seems that my Republican colleagues have lost sight of what the  people of our States have sent us here to do. They sent us here to  raise their voices, represent their interests, and provide them with  the help they need.   The American people are truly struggling, and they are calling upon  us to provide them with real relief during this public health and  economic crisis. That should be our No. 1 priority.   Eight million Americans have fallen into poverty during this  pandemic, including an outsized number of people of color and children.  The proportion of American children who sometimes do not have enough to  eat is now 14 times higher than it was last year. Parents are now  joining food lines for food banks because they cannot feed their  children. Cases of COVID are on the rise as we head toward our third  peak. Small businesses and their employees don't see a rebound on the  horizon. People are sick. They are struggling and scared about the  future.   For months, my fellow Democrats and I have been calling for a vote on  the relief package the House put forward to address these concerns, and  we have been met with silence. Then, after dragging their feet,  Republicans put forward a totally inadequate $500 billion package that  puts the needs of big businesses ahead of working families. What is  worse is that they know it has absolutely no chance of becoming law.  Their only aim is to score political points, all the while the American  people keep suffering.   The weeks we should have dedicated to negotiating a real relief  package have instead been spent rushing through the confirmation of a  Supreme Court Justice. The hypocrisy is truly stunning. The same people  who denied Merrick Garland a hearing months before an election are now  trying to ram this process through while an election is already  happening. Millions of ballots have already been cast. Millions of  Americans are already voting. Their futures are on the line. They  should have a say in this outcome.   We know why Republicans are rushing. They are rushing because they  know it is their last chance to impose a very extreme conservative view  on this country. They are rushing because they see a clock ticking  toward November, when the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether  129 million Americans with preexisting conditions will continue to have  access to affordable healthcare. They are rushing to seat Judge Barrett  in time for her to rule on that case--a case that could strip millions  of Americans of healthcare in the middle of a pandemic, at the very  moment they need it the most. It is simply inhumane.   The Affordable Care Act is a matter of life or death. I recently  spoke to a New Yorker named Allie Marotta, who has been living with  type 1 diabetes since 2006. Last December, she turned 26 and aged off  her parents' insurance. Because her work is contract-based, she  couldn't enroll with an employer. She made too much to qualify for  Medicaid but not enough to afford $400 monthly premiums. She was  uninsured from December to March and had to ration her insulin, putting  her life at risk. It was only when the pandemic started and she lost  all of her income that she was able to qualify for the essential plan  in New York's ACA marketplace and access her life-sustaining  medication. If the ACA is repealed, Allie will have nowhere to turn.   She is not alone. My friend Kyle lives with Down syndrome. His father  Bill has multiple preexisting conditions. Right now, Bill works part  time in order to help Kyle, who needs to be with somebody 24/7. They  are worried about cuts to Medicaid, which could affect the job-coaching  Kyle receives at the pizza parlor where he works, and about the repeal  of the ACA, which provides them the only care they can afford.   Rushing to seat this nominee means rushing to put Allie's life and  Kyle's life and millions of Americans in danger. My colleagues are  putting them all at risk only to further a very conservative agenda. It  is extreme.   Their agenda is to seat a nominee who has called Roe v. Wade  ``barbaric,'' when nearly 8 in 10 Americans believe that it is a  fundamental, human, and civil right for women to make decisions about  their bodies, including when or if or under what circumstances they  will have children; a nominee who referred to sexual orientation as a  preference--language that is not just outdated but truly harmful when  two in three Americans believe love is love, believe in marriage  equality, believe in the right to marry the person they love; a nominee  who refused to admit climate change is settled science and not a  controversial issue, when 99 percent of scientists and 81 percent of  Americans believe that humans are drivers of global warming.   So whose views does she represent? Certainly not those of the people  who sent us here. They believe in access to reproductive care. They  believe in equal rights for the LGBTQ community. They believe in  science. They believe that this seat should be filled by the next  President and confirmed by the next Senate. They have made it clear and  don't want the process of a lifetime appointment rushed.   This is the wrong judge for this seat, and this is the wrong process  for a lifetime appointment. It is hypocritical. It is dangerous. It is  not what the American people want.   I ask my colleagues to stop ignoring the people who sent us here and  to remember that it is our job to look out for their best interests--no  one else's. If we don't do that, we don't have the right to be here at  all.   I also want to express my condolences to the families and loved ones  who have experienced the human toll of the coronavirus pandemic. Over  220,000 Americans have died, and millions of others have been changed  forever. I am going to read some of the names of the people we have  lost. The  [[Page S6531]]  families of these individuals have given permission for their names to  be read on the Senate floor, adding them and their stories to the  Congressional Record:   Mark Anthony Urquiza, Paul Osterman, Frederick Harold Quinn, Richard  Rosenberg, Charles Mahoney, Felix Chidinma Oruh, Margaret R. Hogan,  Mahmooda Shaheen, Alan Kaplan, William W. Boyd, Breda C. Meadows, Jose  Morales Ramirez, David Benfield, John A. Alexiades, Michael F. Hughes,  Bob McDonald, Richard Proia, Rashonne Smith, Jose ``Joe'' Ramirez,  Steve Petras, Sr., Fareeda Kadwani, Jean Yettito, Abby Spitzer, Robert  ``Bobby'' McCoskey, Jose A. Matias, Erick B. Chavez, Anastasia  Koiveroglou, Shafqat Rasul Khan, Lynette Scullen and Joan Scullen,  Marue Santini, Buck McKinney, Christina Danielo, Cal Schoenfeld, Gregg  Pappadake, Sarah ``Sally'' Bielen, Rolando Castillo, Nais Coque, David  Tashman, Joseph LoBianco, Ramash Quasba, Edward Alonzo.   I would also like to share some concerns of the people of New York  over what a future without the Affordable Care Act would look like.   While my colleagues try to rush this confirmation so Judge Barrett  can be seated in time to rule on a case that could cause millions of  Americans to lose access to their healthcare, I think it is important  that we remember how that case will affect the people we are here to  serve.   In New York, there are more than 8 million people with preexisting  conditions who could face higher costs, fewer benefits, and more  trouble finding the coverage they need if the ACA is repealed. There  are more than 3 million people who could be denied coverage altogether  over preexisting conditions that are deemed uninsurable. There are more  than 470,000 people who have been diagnosed with COVID, each of whom  could find themselves paying higher premiums for worse coverage.   My mailbox has been flooded with letters from New Yorkers who are  cancer survivors and parents and people with disabilities who are all  worried about their families not being able to access the care that  they need. Working to take away their care, especially in the middle of  a pandemic, is inhumane.   Jane from West Islip wrote:         As a cancer survivor, I am very concerned about healthcare       and pre-existing conditions. We're facing a healthcare       meltdown. This next Justice could be the deciding vote that       determines whether health care for tens of millions of       people, protections for pre-existing conditions, and other       provisions of the ACA that benefit almost everyone, will stay       or go. Judge Barrett's documented hostility towards the ACA       disqualifies her from a lifetime appointment to the Supreme       Court. A vote for Judge Barrett is a vote to end healthcare.       Oppose her nomination.    Jane is not alone in her concerns.   Candice from Brooklyn wrote:         I am writing to urge you to oppose the nomination of Judge       Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. I am worried that       Judge Barrett's statements on the Affordable Care Act mean       that, if confirmed, she would vote to overturn the ACA.       Millions of Americans with disabilities rely on the ACA to       protect our right to healthcare. If the ACA is overturned,       especially during a pandemic, millions of lives could be at       risk.    This is a concern I have heard over and over and over and over again.   Meredith from New York City wrote to me about Stacy Staggs, the  mother of two young children who both have complex medical needs and  disabilities, who shared powerful testimony during the Supreme Court  confirmation hearings.   Meredith wrote:         When she spoke, she spoke for me. The ACA and disability       rights are at stake. This confirmation should wait until       after the American people have chosen who should pick the       next justice.    Parents across the State are also worried about what the Court with  Justice Barrett would mean for their children.   Susan from Amherst wrote to me about her daughter. She wrote:         My daughter is an amazing young woman--and a lesbian--and       an individual with preexisting conditions. Her depression has       worsened because she sees what a confirmation of Amy Coney       Barrett's confirmation would mean to her and many of her       friends. Even Pope Francis believes members of the LGBTQ+       community deserve to be part of a family and should be able       to participate in civil unions. Please help! She needs to       have hope! The rush to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the       Supreme Court is concerning. Not only have Senators not had       enough time to duly vet her, but we are in the middle of a       highly consequential election in which millions have already       cast their ballots. Further, Judge Barrett's LGBTQ rights       record suggests she cannot be an impartial jurist on these       matters. I'm deeply concerned about the future of rights for       the LGBTQ community.    These letters also send dire reminders of what life was like for too  many New Yorkers before the Affordable Care Act--a history we should  never repeat.   Jan from Ridgewood wrote:         I am 61 years old and have been self-employed for most of       my working life. This circumstance has made me a healthcare       voter! For decades I thought I was the only one complaining       about impossibly high health care costs. The cheapest plan       that I could find had a monthly premium of $692. For me as an       individual, with my husband--[who was] also self-employed--      and daughter it was about 1,250. After my divorce, I went       job-hunting for health insurance. I was willing to work for       free if I could be put on a health insurance plan. I didn't       find any.        The ACA put an end to that demeaning search. My income       fluctuates, so my premium goes up-and-down, but it has never       been as expensive as it was before ObamaCare. There is ample       evidence to suggest that Judge Barrett would overturn the       Affordable Care Act. Confirming such a justice during what is       perhaps the worst public health crisis in American history,       and while the Senate refuses to act to address the       coronavirus economic and health crisis, is unconscionable.    Let me say that again: Healthcare is so important that she was  willing to work for free just to have it. That is what is on the line  here.   Repealing the ACA would also mean an end to the rules preventing  insurance companies from charging women higher premiums than men and  requiring them to cover essential health benefits for women. That means  women would not only have to pay more, but it would also be harder for  the more than 4 million New York women who are covered by private  insurance to find coverage for maternity care, contraception, and cost- free screenings for breast cancer, cervical cancer, and bone density.  It would return us to the days when uninsured women could be denied  coverage altogether if they are pregnant or have a health problem.   It would also put our older adults at risk. Striking down the ACA  would reopen the prescription drug coverage cap--the so-called doughnut  hole--and could leave nearly 350,000 seniors in our State paying  thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs for the medications they  need.   Thomas is one of those seniors. He writes:         The price for the family insurance is high and with our       present administration will go higher and millions of       Americans will not be able to have insurance. And this is the       time it is needed with the lack of the virus control. Many       Americans are out of work and will never be able to get a job       that paid as much as the previous job. . . . Many Americans       have died because the administration would not treat the       virus when it was starting. Many homes now have less people       bringing in money to pay bills because of this. The       administration has no plan to replace ObamaCare. . . . And       with the second and third round of virus and flu, many more       may die. . . . Seniors are on a fixed income and seldom get       any breaks when it comes to bills. Part D of Medicare       prescriptions really went up this year. At the end of the       year, we fall in the doughnut hole and have to pay two to       three or more times for our medicine than we were paying. And       then at the beginning of the year, we must pay the deductible       which, on the average, is 400 plus dollars. But remember we       are on a fixed income, so that means going without something       else. Again, a zero-deductible plan does not cover much       unless you pay above 70 dollars a month. Do not expect the       average American to have much extra money. A lot of people       live on Social Security alone, and the present administration       wants to stop that income.    The American people do not want to lose their healthcare, not in the  middle of a pandemic, not ever, and they certainly don't believe we  should be prioritizing this nomination over providing them with real  relief.   Christine from Beacon wrote:         I find it appalling and horrific that instead of a humane       relief bill for the people who have lost family members,       jobs, homes, the stability of their children's shelter, food       security and education--not to mention the social cost of       interrupting normal childhood social development and just the       terrible grief and fear [people are dealing with] . . . that       instead of working on a relief bill, we have another judge       infuriatingly and unfairly jammed in to the court. The       Supreme Court! My god . . . the lack of respect and audacity       of beginning this process. There is wrong and right. And to       quote a great patriot: ``This is America. And here, right       matters.''   [[Page S6532]]     Christine is right. Doing the right thing for the American people  matters. It is actually our job. New Yorkers and people across this  country who have lost their jobs and their employer-based healthcare  are calling on the Senate to provide them with the relief they need to  survive this health and economic crisis.   Instead, the Republicans are pouring salt in their wounds by rushing  this process in order to eliminate the Medicaid expansions and  marketplaces these newly jobless Americans have turned to for coverage.  Overturning the ACA would immediately end the Medicaid coverage nearly  1.9 million beneficiaries in New York are relying on.   These stories I have shared represent the fears and concerns of the  people who sent us here to represent them. They are people with  debilitating illnesses, parents who are worried about sick children,  adults who are worried about elderly parents, and young men and women  who live with conditions like diabetes and are already struggling to  find insurance that will help them access the insulin they need.   They are struggling, and it is our job to get them the help they  need. The American people oppose this nomination. They are watching,  and one way or another, they will be heard.   I would like to read from an article in the New York Times by Reed  Abelson and Abby Goodnough, entitled: ``If the Supreme Court Ends  ObamaCare, Here's What It Would Mean.''   ``The Affordable Care Act touches the lives of most Americans, and  its abolition could have a significant effect on many millions more  people than those who get their health coverage through it.   What would happen if the Supreme Court struck down the Affordable  Care Act?   The fate of the sprawling, decade-old health law known as Obamacare  was already in question, with the high court expected to hear arguments  a week after the presidential election in the latest case seeking to  overturn it. But now, the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  increases the possibility that the court could abolish it, even as  millions of people are losing job-based health coverage during the  coronavirus pandemic.   A federal judge in Texas invalidated the entire law in 2018. The  Trump administration, which had initially supported eliminating only  some parts of the law, then changed its position and agreed with the  judge's ruling. Earlier this year the Supreme Court agreed to take the  case.   Mr. Trump has vowed to replace Justice Ginsburg, a stalwart defender  of the law, before the election. If he is successful in placing a sixth  conservative on the court, its new composition could provide the  necessary five votes to uphold the Texas decision.   Many millions more people would be affected by such a ruling than  those who rely on the law for health insurance. Its many provisions  touch the lives of most Americans, from nursing mothers to people who  eat at chain restaurants.   Here are some potential consequences, based on estimates by various  groups.                                133 Million
