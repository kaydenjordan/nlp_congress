 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last night, the Senate approved  legislation to extended the Paycheck Protection Program, better known  as PPP, through August 8, while we continue bipartisan negotiations on  a bill to provide additional assistance to our small businesses that  have been especially hard hit by COVID-19 mitigation measures.   I very much hope that the House of Representatives will act quickly  to extend this important lifeline for our small employers, as new PPP  loans cannot be issued until the bill that passed the Senate last night  is enacted and signed into law, even though approximately $130 billion  remains available for the program.   Let me, again, commend my partners in this endeavor, Senators Marco  Rubio, Ben Cardin, and Jeanne Shaheen, for their continued work on this  vital program.   Back in March, the four of us formed a small business task force. We  looked at ways that we could help our small employers and their  employees survive this pandemic. We put forth a bold plan, the Paycheck  Protection Program, to help small employers and their employees. Our  concept was straightforward: provide forgivable loans to small  employers to help them maintain that vital connection with their  employees, so that both could rebound and thrive once the pandemic  passes.   In some cases, that meant that a small business could retain an  employee who, otherwise, would have been laid off. In others, it has  meant that the small business could recall workers who had already been  laid off. And in yet other cases, it allowed employers to continue to  send paychecks to employees who had been furloughed so that we could  keep that link between employers and their employees, so that when the  reopening occurred, they could be reunited quickly and the business  could get up and running much more rapidly.   The response to this program has been phenomenal. Since its launch in  early April, it has provided $518 billion in forgivable loans to 4.8  million small employers across the Nation.   According to an ongoing U.S. Census Survey, nearly three out of every  four small business respondents reported that they had received  assistance under the PPP program. In Maine, nearly 27,000 small  businesses have received forgivable loans, totaling more than $2.2  billion. Just to give you an idea of how much of a stimulus that is,  that is equal to almost half of the entire State budget. That works out  to an average loan size of $83,400, which translates into a small  business with approximately seven employees. All told, this program is  helping to sustain nearly 200,000 jobs in the State of Maine.    As Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin testified last month:         The [Paycheck Protection Program] is supporting the       employment of approximately 50 million workers and more than       75 percent of small business payroll in all 50 states. This       is an extraordinary achievement.    It is, indeed. It has made such a difference to our small employers.  It has kept our small businesses afloat, prevented them from giving up  and shuttering their doors forever, and provided paychecks to their  employees.   When we first drafted this program in early March, we did not know  how long government-ordered closures would last. In fact, most of them  had not even gone into effect at the time that we drafted the law. We  also did not know how severe the impacts of these government-ordered  closures would be. We did not know how long the pandemic would last.  How I wish that we could announce today that COVID-19 had been  conquered; that America's small businesses were flourishing once again;  and that the millions of jobs that they provide had been fully  restored. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and we have a long road  ahead of us.   According to a survey released last week by NFIB, an organization  that is dedicated to providing a voice for America's small businesses,  half of its members anticipate needing additional financial support in  the next 12 months.   I fear that, if Congress fails to act, despite our good work to date,  millions of our small businesses will be put at risk, and millions of  jobs will be lost.   A case study of how the pandemic has threatened the viability of  small businesses can be found in Maine's tourism sector. Tourism is one  of our State's largest economic sectors. It supports 110,000 jobs. That  is one out of every six jobs in our State. In 2018, total tourism  expenditures exceeded $6.2 billion. That is $7 million per day.   In late March, there was the expectation that the 2020 tourism season  would certainly be lower than the norm but active enough for the  tourism businesses to survive. But, as the Fourth of July draws closer,  near empty hotels, inns, B&Bs, and restaurants portend a long-lasting  disaster, as many of our  [[Page S4094]]  State's seasonal businesses rely on the busy summer season and fall  season to pay their major bills for the year, including their mortgage  and property taxes, not to mention their all-important employees.   Two weeks ago, a Maine innkeeper in York County told me that her inn  would normally have a 94-percent occupancy rate at this point in the  summer. She currently has an occupancy rate of 6 percent.   As one observer put it, the word ``Vacationland,'' which appears on  our license plates in Maine, might well be replaced with ``Vacancy  Land.''   I have heard from so many hotel owners throughout Maine, and their  stories all have a familiar theme: Reservations made months ago for  July and August are being canceled, and cancelations for the fall are  also starting to come in. In addition to putting hotel staff at risk of  losing their jobs, or having their hours cut drastically, or not being  hired in the first place, the vendors that supply these establishments  are losing sales. Local retailers and restaurants are losing summer  customers. Planned improvements and expansions are being postponed,  causing harm for local tradespeople.   I talked to a restaurant owner who operates a wonderful restaurant in  Portland. Right now, she has to depend on outside seating and lives in  fear of a bad storm, where people won't be able to eat outside. Only  slowly is Maine allowing in-restaurant eating to resume in the most  populous parts of our State. All of us understand that we have to put  the health of people first, but these restaurant owners are getting  desperate, and they are trying very hard to comply with all the CDC  regulations.   There is no doubt that similar disruptions are occurring across the  country. That is why it is so important that we reach bipartisan  agreement to allow those small businesses that have been especially  hard hit by the pandemic to receive an additional forgivable loan. As  we continue our bipartisan negotiations on such a plan, I have come to  the floor to outline some of my own priorities for a second Paycheck  Protection Program loan.   First, I do believe that we will achieve bipartisan agreement to  allow the hardest hit small business employers--those who have seen  their revenues decline by 50 percent or more in any quarter this year  compared to the same quarter last year--to receive an additional PPP  loan. This is absolutely essential to the ability of these businesses  to survive as the fight against COVID-19 continues   Second, because we must stretch the $130 billion that remains in the  PPP funds as far as we possibly can, I support generally limiting  eligibility to entities that have 300, rather than 500 or fewer,  employees with a special provision for seasonal employers.   Third, I believe that we need to expand forgivable PPP expenses in  some commonsense ways. For example, we should allow forgiveness for  supplier costs and investments in facility modifications and personal  protective equipment that employers are buying to protect their  employees and their customers, such as plexiglass shields, patio  installations for outdoor dining, masks, gloves--that kind of  equipment. It is especially important to restaurants facing dining  restrictions and those struggling to get the high-quality food supply  that they need. We should also clarify that employer-provided group  health benefits are included in forgivable payroll costs.   Fourth, we should extend the PPP to small 501(c)(6) organizations  that are not lobby organizations. I am talking about local chambers of  commerce, business leagues, economic development associations, and  boards of trade, which are doing a great job but are struggling to  themselves survive.   Fifth, we should clarify in statute that forgivable loan funds can be  spent through December 31 and allow borrowers to apply for loan  forgiveness, at the time of their choosing, after 8 weeks from loan  origination.   Finally, to ensure transparency in the PPP loan program, we should  require the Small Business Administration to comply with data and  information requests from the Government Accountability Office or  Federal inspectors general within 15 days.   There are many other ideas that the four of us who are members of the  Small Business Task Force are taking a look at, but today, I just  wanted to outline for my colleagues some ideas that I am particularly  interested in including in this bill.   As the shutdowns have grown longer, it has become clear that millions  of small employers need additional help if they are to keep their heads  above water and survive. It also has been clear that many of these  employers must make substantial investments to modify their operations,  to protect their employees and customers, to mitigate the spread of the  COVID virus.   Most of all, we need to always keep in mind that we are talking about  employees. It is the small businesses of our country that employ the  majority of the people who are working.   We are close to reaching a bipartisan agreement, and I know we are  going to be working very hard over the recess to do so. I also know  that, for small businesses that are struggling, such an agreement  cannot come soon enough.   Again, I want to thank my colleagues--Senator Marco Rubio, Senator  Ben Cardin, Senator Jeanne Shaheen--for their dedication and good-faith  efforts to reach an agreement.   I yield the floor.
