 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the impending  government shutdown.   Since 1980, there have been at least 14 times when the government was  shut down. All of them were initiated by the Republicans. The last  major one in 2018 cost our country $3 billion in lost economic  activity.   Now, Speaker McCarthy has the country on a collision course with  another one. Even the Senate Republicans have a bipartisan bill to help  prevent a shutdown, but Speaker McCarthy will not even consider it.   This shutdown will stop paychecks for millions of Americans. It will  stop law enforcement from preventing fentanyl from entering our  communities, and it will make our borders weaker.   I do not know what the Republicans think that they will win with a  government shutdown, but I do know that it is American people who will  lose, and voters will remember this action in the future.
