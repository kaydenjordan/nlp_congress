 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, it has been 19 days today--19 days--since  the House of Representatives impeached the President of the United  States. It has been 19 days since we were told that it was urgent that  President Trump be impeached and removed from office. It was urgent for  the safety of the country. It was urgent for national security. It was  urgent to protect the Constitution of the United States. It was urgent;  it had to be done now. The articles had to be rushed through. The rules  had to be violated. There couldn't be due process. It was urgent.   Where are we now? Nineteen days later, the Speaker of the House has  [[Page S26]]  still not transmitted the articles to this body for a trial, has still  not appointed managers for a trial, has still not exhibited the  articles before this body for a trial.   We now have the longest delay in American history in providing notice  to this body and actually moving forward with a trial, and now I think  we have a better sense of what was urgent. What was urgent was  fulfilling the partisan vendetta that the Speaker of the House and the  Democrats have against this President. What was urgent was overturning  the results of an election that they have never accepted. That is what  was urgent.   But now--now that it is time to actually try the case--well, now the  Speaker and the Democrats aren't so sure. In fact, now they don't seem  to want a trial. Now, when it is time to put up or shut up, actually  put the evidence forward to be judged, Speaker Pelosi is saying that  she may withhold the articles indefinitely and prevent this body  indefinitely from carrying out its constitutional responsibilities-- after, of course, a bipartisan coalition in the House of  Representatives voted against impeachment.   I think we can probably see, the longer we wait, why the Speaker is  so reluctant now to have a trial. It was a purely partisan process in  the House. She had Democrats abandon her and vote with Republicans in a  bipartisan coalition against impeachment. The articles don't even  allege a crime. This was the first time in American history in the  impeachment of a President in which no crime was even alleged in the  articles, no evidence of a crime even presented. No wonder she doesn't  want to have a trial. No wonder she is now sitting on the articles and  will not permit a Senate trial to begin.   Well, here is the problem with that: The Constitution of the United  States is really clear. The House has the power to impeach. They have  done that. But the Senate--and the Senate alone--has the power to try.   The Constitution, article I, says that the Senate has the sole power  to try impeachment cases, to adjudicate what has happened in the House,  to examine the facts, and to render a judgment of some sort. Now the  House Speaker is attempting to prevent the Senate from carrying out its  constitutional responsibilities, its constitutional prerogative.   All of this division and rancor--all of this bitterness that she has  put the country through now for months on end--she apparently wants to  continue indefinitely and deny this body its constitutional  responsibility to conduct a trial.   It has been 19 days. It could be 90 days. It could be 190 days. There  is nothing that will stop the Speaker from sitting on these articles  indefinitely. They could persist into the President's second term, if  and when he is reelected. That is the situation we are now facing.   If Americans are sick of this impeachment saga, this partisan circus  now, just wait until we are still sitting here in October or January of  next year or January of the year following or who knows when without a  trial, without adjudication, without any resolution. That is why it is  time for this body to act.   It is time for the Senate to act to preserve the Constitution's  separation of powers, to preserve the Constitution's guarantees--the  right to due process, the right for the President to be heard, the  right for the American people to have these Articles of Impeachment  adjudicated, resolved, as the Constitution commits to and provides for.  That is why today I am introducing a resolution to update the Senate's  rules to account for this unprecedented attempt by the Speaker of the  House to delay, to deny, to obstruct a trial in the U.S. Senate.   Let's be clear. This has never been done before. It has not even been  thought of before. Nobody had thought, before Speaker Pelosi launched  this gambit 19 days ago, that the House could sit on Articles of  Impeachment indefinitely in order to stop a Senate trial.   If the Constitution is going to remain in effect, if the Senate is  going to have the power, as the Constitution provides, to try cases, if  the President is going to get his day in court, if the American people  are going to have the ability to have this issue resolved, to see the  facts, to get a verdict, the Senate has to act.   Today I am proposing new rules in the U.S. Senate that will set a  time limit on the actions of the House. It will give the House Speaker  25 days from the date that the articles are adopted and published to  transmit those articles here to the Senate, to exhibit them as the  House rules and Senate rules currently speak of and anticipate, and if  that is not done, if in 25 days the House Speaker has not acted so that  the Senate is able to move forward with a trial, then, under my  resolution and the change in the rules that I propose today, the Senate  would be able to introduce a motion to dismiss these articles for lack  of prosecution.   In the real world, when a prosecutor brings a case but refuses to try  it, the court has the ability and the defendant has the right--a  constitutional right, I might add--to have those indictments, those  charges, dismissed. That is precisely the action that I am proposing  today.   It is time to update the Senate's rules to account for this  unprecedented attempt at obstruction, at denial, at delay. It is time  for the Senate to act.   The House has a simple choice in front of it--or it should. That  choice is to send the Articles of Impeachment to this body to be tried  before this body, to exhibit the evidence that it has to make the case  that it can, however poor that case may be, but to make the case that  it can and to allow the American people the right to have this  resolution achieved, the right to have the evidence tried, the right to  have the verdict rendered.   It is time for the Senate to act to ensure that the constitutional  balance of power, the constitutional separation of powers, and the  basic functioning of this government of our Republic are able to go  forward. This is a matter of great urgency. There is nothing more  serious than an attempt to overturn the results of a democratic  election and to remove from office a sitting President, and that is  exactly what is happening now.   It is imperative that we act. The country deserves it. It is  imperative for future Congresses and for the future of the country that  the Constitution not be subverted in this rush by Speaker Pelosi and  House Democrats to remove this President from office without evidence,  on no basis, and solely for political purposes. We must defend the  Constitution, and we must act now to do so.                            ____________________
