 Madam President, this past weekend, we lost a brave  and uncommonly fearless American.   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg represented many things to many people.  For some, her work was the gold standard of legal advocacy. For others,  her arguments proved to be intellectual flashpoints, sparking  opportunities to think critically about what we believe and why we  believe it. But for each and every one of us, she served as living  proof that the status quo is often much more fragile than it appears.   So today, I think I speak for so many Tennesseans when I say we are  thankful beyond measure for that enduring legacy and the standard that  she set as she broke barriers and crashed through glass ceilings,  opening opportunities for women. I hope that I am as effective as she  in increasing opportunities for women each and every day.                            ____________________     Madam President, last week marked another  Constitution Day celebration. It could not have come at a better time  because, for just one little moment, it helped us pause and contemplate  two very important things.   First, we took time to think about those values that our Founders  knew. They knew that these values were essential to the establishment  of a model republic.   Second, we remembered the progress we have made in deciding for  ourselves how the passage of time changes or does not change what we  can do to make that ``more perfect Union'' even more so.   Free speech, petition, and protest, the right to defend ourselves,  the right to cast a vote--these are the freedoms that unite us in times  of turmoil, whether we find ourselves in the midst of all-out war or  just a particularly contentious election year.   I would argue that how a nation reacts to that turmoil says more  about its foundation than it does about who controls the news cycle on  any given day.   Divisive voices are hard at work in this country, and they are doing  their very best to convince our friends, families, and neighbors that  our foundation is weak and that our founding principles are no longer  good enough. I find that very sad.   They want us to believe that America as we know it is suddenly  irredeemable, that it just can't be safe.   You might ask yourself: Why are they saying all of this in spite of  hundreds of years and millions of Americans proving the exact opposite  is true?   Here is what I think. They say it because they want us to give up.  They want our neighbors, our families, and our friends to give up, call  it quits; our best days are behind us. We have all heard them say this.  They say: Throw the Constitution in the trash. Rewrite it. Start over.  And after you throw the Constitution in the trash, then let's reimagine  the world's greatest democracy through our very own destructive lenses  of socialism, critical theory, and political correctness. That is what  they say.   As I am sure we have all seen, they have come up with some fairly  persuasive methods to try to get their way. But I believe that, in the  end, these efforts will all be in vain because when push comes to  shove, we, the American people, always manage to remember where we have  come from and to remember who we are.   It is interesting. I think somehow we Americans always find our way  home, back to those first principles. Indeed, I pray that continues.   Our Founders saw what tyranny really looked like. They saw it up  close and personal because they had to live through it. They knew  exactly--exactly--what would happen if they put the fate of the  Republic in the hands of men alone. So what did they do to give that  insurance policy, if you will, that democracy and a democratic republic  would continue and would stand? They drafted a Constitution,  recognizing  [[Page S5751]]  that our rights are a gift from God and that these rights are not a  product of government action or they are not subject to the whims of a  mob.   They were also forward thinking. They gave us everything we need to  improve upon their work.   I think it is important to remember we have done just that. Over the  course of more than two centuries, we have built a nation that is  freer, more equal, and, yes, striving every day to be that ``more  perfect Union,'' not because outside forces compel us to do so but  because we, as Americans, chose to make it that way.   When I see that a friend or a neighborhood has forgotten this, I like  to remind them that two of the most emotional and powerful words in the  English language are ``remember'' and ``imagine.''   I tell them: Stop for just a moment. Close your eyes and remember  what you really love about this country. Remember the special moments.  Remember what your parents and your grandparents have told you about  love of country. Remember the sacrifices they have made. And, now, just  imagine: What would your children and grandkids accomplish? What would  they accomplish if they, too, are allowed to grow up in a place where  liberty and justice is for all, where they are allowed to dream these  big dreams and then dream up a way to make those dreams come true?  These are things that are valued above all else.   Of course, as we look at our past and we remember, we look at the  future, and we know that in finding common ground--when we find common  ground--we see potential, and potential gives us hope. I like to say  that hope is staking a claim on an action, on a goal that you are going  to achieve.   So it is my fervent hope that we will continue to stand on our  constitutional principles and that we will defend the foundation of  this Nation that has given so many Americans the opportunity to make  these big dreams come true   I yield the floor.
