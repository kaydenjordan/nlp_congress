 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  recipient of the 1 millionth Child Development Associate--CDA-- credential. Jada Vargas is an Arizonan who is dedicated to serving her  community as an early childhood educator, and I am very pleased to  recognize her achievement.   Jada lives in Whiteriver, AZ, and is a member of White Mountain  Apache Tribe. She also serves on the White Mountain Apache Youth  Council. A recent high school graduate, Jada said she realized she  wanted to become an early childhood educator after a career and  technical education course that allowed her to work in a childcare  center at her high school. Now, she is headed to college to study  education--and, with her CDA, already has a leg up.   Early exposure to the early childhood landscape was clearly critical  for Jada as she thought about her next steps after high school. And it  couldn't have come at a more needed time. The childcare industry, which  already standing on unsteady legs, took a heavy hit from the COVID-19  pandemic. We asked early childhood educators to be heroes as so many  worked to keep their doors open so parents could do essential work.  Early in my time in the Senate, I voted to pass the American Rescue  Plan, which provided $39 billion in support for childcare.   I hear from Arizonans that this funding was transformative, that  childcare assistance was critical to keeping their doors open and  lights on to serve families. Today, the funding provided through  childcare stabilization grants has expired, yet challenges remain in  finding and retaining early childhood educators. The market is still  broken. Too many children remain stuck on waiting lists without the  essential early education that we know makes a long-term difference.   Research tells us that if a student can't read well by the time they  are in the third grade, they are more likely to drop out of high  school. That has an impact on our productivity, our economy, and on our  military. Early childhood educators like Jada are often the  [[Page S5637]]  ones who are helping children develop the skills to become readers,  preparing them for the years of education that lay ahead.   This is a worthwhile investment. High-quality childcare is imperative  to strong communities, and I am committed to working with my colleagues  to provide long-term stability and support to this industry. Part of  that is finding ways to encourage more folks to dedicate their lives to  the next generation--and as a CDA holder, Jada is part of that  solution. She wants to return home once she finishes her education to,  as she puts it, be a light to the children in her community. We are  grateful to her for her hard work and dedication to the children and  families she will serve as a CDA holder, and I hope to see many more  Arizonans follow in her path.                            ____________________     Mr. President, a great privilege of my job as a  U.S. Senator is having the opportunity to meet young people who are  eager to serve.
