 Mr. President, last week, we voted on a judge who felt it  necessary to sign up for a lifetime membership with a political  organization in order to get his nomination forwarded back before this  body.   The judge we voted on last week became a lifetime member of the NRA  in between his appointment by President Obama and, then, his  appointment by President Trump--a signal, apparently, to the new  Republican White House that he would align with their interests and  views on issues related to the regulation of firearms in this country.   We are going to see a parade of very interesting choices for the  Federal judiciary come through this body, and they are going to be  moved in rapid succession, as they are this week. I have been told that  never before have we taken four votes on appellate nominees in a single  week. Of course, that stands in contrast with the Republican Senate  that refused to give even a hearing to one Supreme Court Justice over  the entirety of 2016. I think it is worth noting that this body can  move fast when it wants to, and yet we watched a Supreme Court seat be  stolen by this Senate from a Democratic President who, by  constitutional right, had the ability to make that appointment.   I bring up the lifetime membership in the NRA because it is  increasingly clear that you have to signal a level of extremism on  issues like firearms in order to get your name brought before this  body. That signal is wildly out of step with where the American public  is on many of these issues.   I have come to the floor over the course of the last 4 years every  few weeks in order to talk about the fact that there is no other  country in the world where 80 to 90 people every single day die from  guns. The numbers are just absolutely stunning. Some 2,800 people a  month die from guns, and 33,000 a year. The majority of those are  suicides, but there are record numbers of homicides and accidental  shootings in this country. Americans by and large don't accept this  rate of slaughter. Americans want us to change our laws, and they don't  want a judiciary that is going to stand in the way of Congress's  ability to follow the wishes of our constituents.   I have been coming down to the floor to tell the story of the  victims. My hope is that, although the data hasn't moved this  Congress--90 percent of Americans want stronger gun laws--the data  incontrovertibly shows that in places that have universal background  checks or laws requiring you to get local permits before you buy a gun,  there are less gun crimes.   Maybe if the data doesn't move my colleagues, the story of the  victims will. Deon Rodney was shot on October 14 of this year, just a  few weeks ago. He was working at Just Right Cutz, where he was a  barber, in Bridgeport, CT. He was the 22nd homicide victim in  Bridgeport this year.   He had just finished cutting a young boy's hair in a chair when a  masked gunman chased somebody else into the barbershop. Police said  Deon was protecting the young boy, shielding the young boy from this  intruder who came running in. He jumped out of his chair to try to get  in between the boy sitting in the barber's chair and the gunman, and  the gunman shot him.   The owner of the barber shop said:         Deon had just finished his haircut and the boy was getting       ready to go outside when the gunman came in. He saved       everyone in the barbershop.    Deon was 31 years old. He left behind his wife, his mother, plenty of  other family members, and an 8-year-old daughter.   Speaking about their daughter, Deon's wife said:         He loved her endlessly, unconditionally.    His mother said:         Deon is a part of me. He was my son, but he was also my       friend.    His cousin said:         I know that everyone is recognizing his heroism now, but he       was always like this. Always a role model and always willing       to give. Always willing to go out of his way to help a       stranger. Nothing has changed all these years. I guess I'm       glad that the masses can now see this.    The owner of the barbershop went on to say of Deon:         He's dead because of these people running around with guns.    There are guns everywhere you look in cities like Bridgeport, New  Haven, Hartford, New York or Chicago. People say: Why is that? Why are  there all these guns--many of them, if not most of them, illegal guns-- if you have strong gun laws in places like New York, Illinois, and  Connecticut? The reason is that gun trafficking doesn't recognize State  boundaries, and the guns used to commit crimes in places like  Connecticut come from outside of Connecticut.   A comprehensive, groundbreaking survey of gun crimes in New York City  found that 75 percent of the guns that are used to commit crimes in New  York City come from outside of New York State. They come from States  with looser gun laws, where you as a criminal can easily buy a gun  without having to prove you are a responsible gun owner.   How do all these illegal guns get into Bridgeport such that somebody  can turn a corner and walk into a barbershop with a weapon in their  hand? It is because criminals with criminal records go into gun shows  in States that don't require background checks at those forums, buy up  dozens of weapons, load them into their cars, and then drive up to  States with tougher gun laws and sell them on the black market.   Congress willingly allows this to happen because we have not moved  our mandatory system of background checks to the places in which gun  purchases are made today. Data is a little bit hard to pin down, but  anywhere from 25 to 40 percent of gun sales today don't involve a  background check. You can understand why. Sales have migrated to  online. They have migrated to gun shows. They have gone to places where  background checks aren't required.   I mentioned what the data tells us when it comes to background  checks. The data tells us background checks save lives. Here is one  slice of the data. In States that have universal background check laws,  47 percent fewer women get shot by an intimate partner than States  without universal background check laws. That is because, in the heat  of passion, domestic abusers often go to get a weapon and use it to  perpetuate a domestic violence crime. You can't do that if you have a  domestic violence history in a State with a universal background check  law because wherever you go, you are going to be prohibited from buying  that weapon.   Since November of 1998, more than 2.4 million gun sales to prohibited  purchasers have been prevented because of background checks; 2\1/2\  million people who were criminals or who were addicts or who were  seriously mentally ill were stopped from buying guns because of our  background check laws. Because we now have at least one-quarter of all  sales happening without background checks, that means there are  hundreds of thousands of criminals,  [[Page S6892]]  hundreds of thousands of people with serious mental illness who are  able to buy guns. It is not surprising that 90 percent of Americans, 90  percent of gun owners, 90 percent of Democrats, and 90 percent of  Republicans support expanded background checks.   I would argue there is not another issue out there in American  politics today that enjoys 90 percent support amongst Republicans and  Democrats. Senator Durbin corrected me the other day and said the  latest survey states that the number is actually 94 percent support  from Republicans and Democrats. The only slice of the American  electorate that you can get under 90 percent support of background  checks is NRA members. NRA members support universal background checks  at a 75-percent clip. Background checks save lives, they are supported  by the vast majority of the American public, and yet we can't get it  done.   This month, I, along with a couple dozen cosponsors, introduced a new  version of legislation allowing for background checks to occur in every  commercial sale that is conducted in this country, with commonsense  exceptions, making sure that when you are gifting a firearm to a family  member or you are loaning a gun to a friend who wants to take it to go  hunting, you don't have to conduct a background check under those  circumstances, but if it is a traditional arm's-length sale, then you  have to go through a process, which normally takes 10 minutes in order  to prove you are not a criminal. Again, this proposal is supported by  90 percent of Americans. It is time we recognize that it is directly  connected to this epidemic of gun violence that plagues the country.   Let me close by making another argument to you. I know a lot of my  Republican friends talk a lot on this floor and on the cable news shows  about the threat of terrorism to this country. When the terrorists  decided to use planes as their weapon of choice to attack our country,  we changed the way our law protects us from attacks by airplanes. We  made sure we screened individuals before they got on these planes to  make sure they don't have weapons or bomb-making material that could  ultimately threaten the rest of us. We now all take off our shoes every  time we get on an airplane because we recognized that we needed to  change our laws to understand that these planes were being used to  attack American citizens.   These terrorist groups have recognized that it is now pretty hard to  get somebody with a weapon or an explosive device on a plane so they  are now directing would-be attackers to a different forum. An issue of  Rumiyah, which is Isis's propaganda magazine, encouraged recruits in  the United States to take advantage of our loose gun laws. It  specifically told people go to gun shows where you will not have to  present identification or submit to background checks in order to buy  military-style weapons that you can use to kill dozens of Americans.  ISIS and al-Qaida are telling their potential recruits in the United  States to go to gun shows so they don't have to submit themselves to a  background check and so there is no paper trail of the gun they are  buying in order to kill Americans.   Why wouldn't we adjust our laws to recognize that the new weapon of  choice of terrorists is not an airplane, but it is today a tactical  weapon bought outside of the background check system. I have a million  more reasons why we should do what 90 percent of the American people  want, and someday maybe we will get there.   So 33,000 people a year, 2,800 a month, 93 a day--that is a rate of  gun violence that is not twice that of other industrialized nations. It  is not 5 times, it is not 10 times, it is 20 times higher than the rate  of gun violence in other industrialized countries in this world. It is  not because we have more people who are mentally ill, and it is not  because we spend less money on law enforcement. It is, by and large,  because we have a set of gun laws that allow for illegal guns,  dangerous weapons to flow into the hands of very dangerous people.   I hope my Republican colleagues will take a look at the new  background checks legislation I have introduced with many of my  colleagues, and we can finally get to a place that 90 percent of our  constituents want us to be.   I yield the floor.
