 Mr. Speaker, yesterday's New York Times  carried a story headlined ``Scandals and Investigations, but Few  Arrests, for Air Marshals Program.''   In fact, in the most recent 10-year period that was studied, 148 air  marshals were arrested; and throughout the history of this program,  there have been many more air marshals arrested than there have been  arrests made by air marshals. Yet, over the last 10 years, the Congress  has appropriated well over $8 billion for this needless, useless  program. At least 250 air marshals have been terminated for misconduct  and over 400 more have resigned or retired during conduct  investigations.   This has to be about the easiest job in the country today. All these  marshals do is fly back and forth, back and forth, on airplanes,  usually or often in first class. The New York Times' story said the  program ``is in such disarray that it does little to deter terrorists,  many of its employees say.''   The story also said alcohol abuse is so rampant that the TSA has had  to monitor whether the armed guards show up for their shifts sober.   Mr. Speaker, yet, we are going to give this needless, useless program  another $800 million this year. Ridiculous.                            ____________________
