 Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.   The Senate is considering S. Amdt. 3695, a ``minibus'' spending  measure covering programs within the jurisdiction of the Senate  Appropriations Subcommittees on Defense and Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education, and Related Agencies. The defense portion of this  amendment includes provisions designated as overseas contingency  operations funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA.  These provisions provide $67,914 million in revised security budget  authority and $37,285 million in outlays for fiscal year 2019. The  inclusion of the overseas contingency operations designations with  these provisions makes this spending eligible for an adjustment under  the Congressional Budget Act.   The amendment also includes provisions designated as program  integrity spending pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(B), section  251(b)(2)(C), and section 251(b)(2)(E) of BBEDCA. CBO estimates these  provisions will increase budget authority by $1,897 million and outlays  by $1,573 million in fiscal year 2019. The budget authority from these  provisions is categorized as nonsecurity spending.   Accordingly, I am increasing the fiscal year 2019 budgetary aggregate  by $69,464 million in budget authority and $38,556 million in outlays.  Further, I am revising the budget authority allocations to the  Committee on Appropriations by increasing revised security budget  authority by $67,914 million, revised nonsecurity budget authority by  $1,897 million, and outlays by $38,858 million in fiscal year 2019.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES  (Pursuant to Sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                        $ in millions                             2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority.......................................    3,548,015     Outlays................................................    3,508,052 Adjustments:     Budget Authority.......................................       69,464     Outlays................................................       38,556 Revised Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority.......................................    3,617,479     Outlays................................................    3,546,608 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   [[Page S5690]]    REVISION TO SPENDING ALLOCATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR                             FISCAL YEAR 2019  (Pursuant to Sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                     $ in millions                             2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Allocation:     Revised Security Discretionary Budget Authority..            647,921     Revised Nonsecurity Category Discretionary Budget            597,000      Authority.......................................
