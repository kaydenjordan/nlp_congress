 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa for the time  today to talk about this important legislation.  [[Page H1416]]    Mr. Speaker, I want to speak on behalf of the Political Appointee  Burrowing Prevention Act. This important legislation addresses a  problem affecting our Federal workforce.   Our Federal civil service hiring process is supposed to be a  competitive, merit-based system where the best and brightest  individuals are considered based on their qualifications and ability to  do their job, not because of their political connections. However, we  have seen a concerning trend where excepted service employees,  specifically political appointees, are converted into high-paying,  lifelong civil service positions, bypassing the normal competitive  hiring process.   This process, also known as ``burrowing,'' defeats the purpose of  having a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service. In fact, the  Government Accountability Office reports that the Obama administration  converted 78 political appointments into career positions, while the  Bush administration allowed 135 political appointees to burrow into  career positions.   This trend raises significant concerns that individuals who were not  chosen based solely on their merits may, at best, not be the most  qualified candidate for the job, or, at worst, may not be willing to  properly execute the law under a new administration.                                time  1530    Political appointees are supposed to serve their appointing  President's agenda for a temporary period of time. Part of their duty  to the Nation is to know when it is time to step down from their  position of power.   Congress must act to ensure this principle is upheld and to protect  the independence of our merit-based civil service. That is why I, along  with my friend and colleague, Representative Ted Lieu, have offered an  equitable solution to ensure this problem is stopped in its tracks.   Our bill, the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act, places a  2-year ban on political appointees being hired for any job in the civil  service after they depart a political position.   Additionally, the bill ensures that after the 2-year ban is  completed, the head of the agency seeking to employ the individual must  submit a written request to OPM detailing why hiring a former appointee  is necessary to the agency's mission.   Furthermore, OPM is instructed to deny the application unless the  agency head can prove why it is necessary to hire this individual  instead of an applicant from the merit-based hiring pool.   This commonsense bill ensures that our Federal workforce is filled  with career civil servants who are the most qualified, not the most  politically connected.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  legislation that ensures our Federal workforce is being selected by  merit, not by political patronage.
