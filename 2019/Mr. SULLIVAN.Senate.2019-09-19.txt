 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is that time of the week--the end of  the week in the Senate--when I come to the floor and recognize someone  special in the great State of Alaska, someone who is doing something  important for their community, for the State, for the country. It is  the highlight of my week, and I know it is for our pages.   We have some new pages here. It is commonly recognized as the  favorite speech of the week for the pages because they get to hear  stories about real people, particularly people in Alaska.   You will hear a lot of these speeches as you are here working hard in  the Senate.   We are glad the new pages are here.   As you know, my State is certainly one of the most interesting,  imagined States in the whole country. By the way, people watching in  the Gallery--my friend Scott Lee is up there--watching on TV, come up  to Alaska. You will love it. I guarantee you, it will be the trip of a  lifetime. No one comes to Alaska and is disappointed.   I like to talk about Alaska on the Senate floor. People see a lot of  what is going on in the State on the nature channels and the adventure  channels. There is a story about Alaska on cable TV, it seems like,  daily, almost hourly. Not nearly enough of these stories focus on the  people who live there--independent, patriotic, generous men, women,  and, yes, kids, children, who call Alaska home.   Today, I want to recognize 13-year-old Alaina Vik, who lives in Eagle  River, AK. That is a beautiful community, about 15 miles north of  Anchorage.    Alaina is a young woman with a big heart. She lives with her mother,  Amy, who owns her own real estate company, and her father, Curtis, who  is an Alaska State trooper. He is someone I know well because he and I  served together with the very outstanding Marine Corps Reserve unit  based in Alaska, Echo Company, 4th Recon Battalion.   Trooper Vik, semper fi.   To you and Amy, great job on raising such an exceptional daughter.   Why is she so exceptional? Let's get into what Alaina has done for  us. But, first, let me talk a little bit about what is going on in  Alaska because I always like to update what is happening in this  speech.   I was home for the whole month of August--actually, almost 5 weeks. I  did a week of my own on Marine Corps Reserve duty. It was great to be  home. I got to travel all over the State. When I say ``travel all  over,'' we are talking hundreds, if not thousands, of miles, literally,  between communities. There was a lot going on.   Unfortunately, as it happens in so many summers in Alaska, fires were  taking their toll, but the weather was amazing, with beautiful blue  skies. For the most part, the sun was out. It was perfect for fishing,  hiking, and camping--all the things that so many people in Alaska who  come to visit and live here do in the summer.   Now we are heading into the fall. Leaves are starting to turn. It is  moose hunting season. The snow isn't far away for most of the State. In  some parts of the State, it is actually already on the ground.   Some might say that winter is coming, but I think it is too soon.  Winter is coming, but not just yet. I will let you know when that  happens.   School has started, and Alaina Vik has entered eighth grade. Her  favorite subject is art. Like so many Alaskans, she has been busy. What  has she been busy doing? Why are we honoring this young Alaskan who is  doing a lot for our State?   First, as a Girl Scout in Troop 690, under the amazing leadership of  the troop leader, Mrs. Melissa Jones, Alaina sold more cookies than any  other Girl Scout in the entire State of Alaska--more than 5,000 boxes.  That is amazing; isn't it?   I love Girl Scout cookies. I think they are the best in the country,  but 5,000 boxes in one State is pretty darn impressive.   What is her secret? She said: ``My mom told me to go out almost every  day to sell cookies, to talk to people and to interest them in buying  the cookies.''   Her older brother, Kyle, who, by the way, is an Eagle Scout--you  could see what a high-achieving family this is--also helped coach his  sister and helped take her out to sell cookies.   Alaina said: ``I'm a really hard worker when it comes to Girl Scout  cookies.'' Obviously, she is--5,000 boxes.   Selling cookies just wasn't good enough for her. She wanted to do  more for her Girl Scout project. So she took her passion to the next  level, using her selling skills to help others and focusing on the men  and women in our military, particularly those who are deployed.   In Alaska, we proudly boast of having the record of more vets per  capita than any State in the country. So this is something that a lot  of our communities can get behind. She and her fellow Girl Scouts began  to send our deployed military members Girl Scout cookies. She got the  idea when the father of one of the members of her Girl Scout troop was  deployed. Her troop wanted to make sure he felt remembered on his  deployment.   All told, in 2017, she was able to donate 800 boxes to our troops,  some of whom are deployed in Kuwait and Qatar.   She didn't stop there. As I have often said, we live in one of the  most patriotic States in the country. Alaina Vik is just one more bit  of proof of that. She wanted to do more for the men and women in  uniform. She said:         They're fighting for us. They're protecting us. They       deserved to be appreciated [and remembered] and honored.    This is a 13-year-old girl. Remember, she is also the daughter of a  recon marine.   With the help of her mother, Amy, and her father, Curtis, and her two  younger brothers, she expanded her effort into what is now called  Operation Sweet Support. You could find that on Facebook. In addition  to just cookies, she is also sending snacks, pencils, duct tape, and  toys. Who doesn't need a toy or duct tape when they are deployed? You  can use it for everything.   When the news got out about this project, she started to receive  donations from all over the community in Eagle River and all over  Alaska. So far this year, through this project, she has sent out over  98 care packages to Alaskan troops who are deployed overseas,  particularly in Kosovo and Kuwait. She is aiming to send out 75 more by  the end of the year--one 13-year-old girl in the great State of Alaska.   She puts a personalized handwritten note into each of the boxes  thanking them. ``This is my way of saying thank you,'' one of her notes  reads.   Here is another one:         You are amazing and appreciated and loved. Thank you for       your service.   [[Page S5596]]     That is another note from Alaina to our service men and women  deployed overseas.   She gets notes back, of course. One wrote:         Thank you for everything you've done for us. Please keep       supporting the troops [and sending cookies].    Our military members love cookies. They say it makes a big  difference.   Someone also sent her an American flag that was flown overseas in  appreciation of the cookies, as well as a unit coin, a military coin,  sent to Alaina by our appreciative troops. ``It was amazing,'' she  said, when she got this.   As someone who has been deployed myself, away from family and  friends, I know what it means to get such care packages. It means the  world. It means that people back home are remembering what you are  doing.   Alaina, thank you for your great work supporting our troops, for the  example you are setting for all the young men and women, not just in  Alaska but America.   Amy and Curtis, thanks for raising such a wonderful daughter.   Alaina, keep up the great work. Congratulations, once again, on being  our Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ariel  Hasse, an intern in my office, be granted floor privileges through  September 27, 2019.
