 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in  favor of my commonsense legislation, H. Con. Res. 3. I am really proud  that this bill has been included among our very first bills that will  pass in this Congress.   For Chairman Nadler, or Ranking Member Nadler now, I am happy to say,  to stand here and suggest that this does not fulfill the will of the  American people or is somehow not the right thing to do is absurd.   This resolution is very simple, and its language is clear. It  condemns the attacks that have been committed against pro-life  facilities, groups, and churches in the wake of the leak of the Dobbs  opinion and the subsequent decision. It also calls upon the Biden  administration to take action now to bring the perpetrators to justice.   Who could be opposed to that?   In recent years, there has been an alarming trend of more and more  attacks on pro-life organizations and individuals. In the wake of the  Dobbs decision, the problem became much worse. We have seen a  significant increase in targeted violence against places and people who  provide care for pregnant women and their unborn children.   Here are just a few of the more than 100 incidents that have taken  place just in the last several months:   May 5, last year, a Catholic church and school in Armada, Michigan,  was vandalized with satanic symbols and messages calling for the death  of Republicans.   May 8, the Oregon Right to Life office was firebombed.   May 26, seven high school students in New Jersey were suspended after  physically assaulting another student holding a pro-life sign.   June 26, a pro-abortion extremist was charged with attempted murder  in Los Angeles.   July 7, Sacramento, a pregnancy care center was threatened by a man  with a machete.   September 24, in Lake Odessa, Michigan, an elderly pro-life volunteer  was shot while canvassing door to door to discuss an abortion ballot  proposal.   January of this year, just several days ago, a pro-life billboard was  defaced with the words ``kill them kids'' in Portland, Oregon.   This last one that I wanted to mention is personal to me. On July 11,  pro-abortion activists vandalized the Women's New Life Clinic in Baton  Rouge, Louisiana. They spray-painted anti-life messages on the walls.  Being located right next to the abortion provider in Baton Rouge at the  time, the largest in our State, this clinic has offered hope to  countless pregnant women by counseling them on all of their options and  not pushing them to abort their unborn children, as the clinics do.   I am proud to call many of the leaders of that clinic in Baton Rouge  personal friends. We have to stand for them and stand against violence,  vandalism, personal threats, and intimidation.   Nationwide, there are over 2,700 pregnancy care centers providing  essential services in all 50 States. They serve millions of women every  year. They have over 10,000 medical professionals supporting them. They  do not deserve the treatment they have endured, and they certainly  deserve that this Congress condemn the violence committed against them.   Since there has been so little accountability for the leaked draft  Dobbs opinion and the ensuing violence and intimidation against pro- lifers that have followed, we are making the position of Congress clear  today. We condemn violence, property damage, threats, and intimidation  tactics, and these clear violations of Federal and State laws must be  prosecuted.   We have the opportunity before us today to start to push back against  the mob that has targeted the groups and individuals that care for  women and their unborn children. Republicans are ready to act. I am so  proud that over  [[Page H172]]  100--I think nearly 130--Republicans so far have cosponsored this.   It will pass, and it should, and it will be a shame if our Democratic  colleagues do not join us in this condemnation of violence. The  question is, will they?   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  resolution.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   Once again, House Republicans are eager to stand for the most  vulnerable among us, the unborn. We are the party of life, and we are  proud of it.   There is no difference between an infant born alive after a failed  abortion and an infant born into the arms of loving parents. Those two  babies deserve to be treated with the same level of excellent medical  care.   Yet, abortionists have demonstrated a lack of interest in preserving  the lives of babies who enter the world alive and supposedly under  their care.   We know what happens in these clinics. By way of just one example,  lifenews.com reports that an abortion provider in Minnesota was  recently asked by a woman 22 weeks pregnant and considering an abortion  what that provider would do if her baby were taken out while his heart  was still beating. The abortion provider responded: ``We don't tell  women this . . . but if we was to proceed with the abortion and the  baby was to come out still alive . . . most likely, we will break the  baby's neck.''   That is chilling and barbaric, but our Democratic colleagues will not  admit that. They will vote against it today. Watch the board. It will  be shocking, and it will be true.   The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would make it a  Federal crime for abortionists to kill or fail to provide care to  babies who survive abortions.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of our colleagues to support this  critical legislation. As was said, it should pass unanimously, but it  won't.                                time  1445
