 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise awareness about an  issue that is important to our Nation and essential to my district.  Strawberry growers in Plant City, Florida, are under attack.   For years Mexico has spent millions subsidizing their strawberry  production. This has allowed them to export strawberries at a cost our  local growers cannot compete with. Consequently, imports of Mexican  strawberries have increased by approximately 80 percent since 2010.  Furthermore, current trade agreements don't allow seasonal growers to  bring antidumping claims. This means our growers are left with a right  against unlawful dumping but no means of enforcing it.   Plant City, Florida, is known as the Winter Strawberry Capital of the  World and produces more than 85 percent of all the winter strawberries  grown here in our Nation. It is imperative for Congress to correct the  situation and pass legislation that gives our growers the protections  that they need and deserve.                            ____________________
