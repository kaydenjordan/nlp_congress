 Mr. Speaker, it is Monday morning, and the Federal  Government is open for business. We came just hours away from a  shutdown this weekend, with 209 House Democrats and 125 House  Republicans voting to put people over politics.   A government shutdown would have been a disaster for the American  people, and I am glad Democrats and reasonable Republicans were able to  come together to get a short-term funding package through the House,  the Senate, and onto the President's desk with just hours to spare.   This short-term funding package includes an extension of FAA  authorization, funding for flood insurance programs, and $16 billion  for disaster relief. Most importantly, it will keep the lights on for  the over 6,500 Federal employees in North Carolina's 13th District.   Looking ahead, this short-term funding package gives us more time to  come together, find common ground, and pass bipartisan spending bills  for the full year.   For Democrats, that means funding for Ukraine. Our support for  Ukraine cannot waver. I wish we didn't have to spend any money in  Ukraine, but if Vladimir Putin wins, we will have to spend a thousand  times more trying to contain an aggressive and emboldened Russia around  the globe. If we abandon Ukraine, Russia will win. Putin will win.  Support for Ukraine is in our national interest, Mr. Speaker.   For Republicans, that means securing the border and taking up  immigration reform. As a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus and a  member of the New Democrat Coalition's Immigration and Border Security  Task Force, I remain focused and committed to working across the aisle  to secure our border and advance comprehensive immigration reform.   I believe that the best path forward is through the Bipartisan Keep  America Open Act that I have cosponsored and is being led by the  Problem Solvers Caucus. This legislation upholds the top-line numbers  agreed to in the bipartisan budget agreement. It includes funding for  Ukraine, which is desperately needed. It includes title 42 reform  legislation that I helped introduce with a bipartisan group of Members  earlier this year that will help secure the southern border while  giving us more time to enact meaningful, long-term reforms to our  overburdened immigration system. It also includes bipartisan reforms to  increase transparency and address long-term spending, an area where I  agree with my Republican colleagues.   The path to 218 votes on the budget won't come from the far left or  the far right. It comes from the center, with proposals just like this  one. The reality is that we have only 44 days to get this done, or we  are right back to where we started over the weekend.   We never should have been in this situation in the first place. A  short-term CR is a Band-Aid on a long-term problem. That is why I have  introduced the bipartisan No Budget, No Pay Act. My bill would withhold  Members' pay if both Houses don't agree to a concurrent budget  resolution by April 15 for the fiscal year starting October 1, or if  [[Page H4936]]  both Houses haven't passed all the regular appropriations bills by  September 30 for the fiscal year starting October 1.   We could have been in a situation this morning where our entire  Federal Government workforce was getting no pay, but Members of  Congress still would have been getting their paychecks, and that is  wrong. This bill will incentivize Congress to get it done and prevent  future government shutdowns. This brinkmanship is no good for our  economy.   I came to Congress to get things done. I will continue to set aside  the noise, find common ground wherever it exists, and deliver for the  people of North Carolina's 13th District.                            ____________________
