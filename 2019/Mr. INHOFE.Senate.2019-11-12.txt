 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  recognized as in morning business for such time as I use.    Madam President, I am here today to talk about an  important vote that I took 19 years ago, a vote about free trade from  China. Now, you might say it is a little out of character, coming down  to the floor and talking about free trade and China, because normally I  am down here talking about how China is investing in their military at  unprecedented rates or how they are passing us up in terms of our  military, which we saw in the last administration.   The reality is that when it comes to China--which is entirely  controlled by a tyrannical Communist party--you cannot separate their  trade behavior from their military like you can in a democratic  government. China asserts its power both economically and militarily to  the detriment of the free world.   So 19 years ago, I came down to the Senate floor and took a stand  against the tyrannical regime in China. The vote was on whether or not  to allow the Chinese Government normalized trade relationships with the  United States that would pave the way for China to join the World Trade  Organization.   At that time, it was not popular--it was not popular for any Member  of the Senate who stood in the way of free trade agreements, much less  a Republican. But as I saw it then, the vote did much more than open up  trade. It granted favors to an authoritarian regime, despite their  openly predatory actions, without demanding concessions in return. My  colleagues claimed that opening China to free trade would cause China  to change their behavior. Clearly, that did not happen, but I will get  to that in a minute.   Filled with the false hope and empty promises, the trade agreement  sailed through the Senate, 83 to 15, and was signed by then-President  Clinton. Now, I am the only one of those 15 ``no'' votes still serving  in the United States Senate. Today, 19 years later, we have seen the  reality of what I thought would happen. At the time, I said--and I am  quoting from my speech 19 years ago--``We cannot allow the pursuit of  dollars to blind us to certain realities about the ruling communist  regime in China, including''--keep in mind, I am going to read all  eight of these that I had mentioned 19 years ago--``repeated threats  against the United States and Taiwan''--still going on today; ``massive  military modernization and buildup''--still going on; ``proliferation  of dangerous weapons to rogue states. Theft of U.S. nuclear secrets''-- still going on; ``demonstrated strategy to exploit commercial  relationships to acquire advanced military technology,'' that is still  going on today; ``attempts to corrupt the U.S. political system.  Violation of international agreements. Brutal repression of  dissidents.'' We know that is happening.   I continued: ``To ignore these actions in the belief that they can be  separated from what we do in our trading relationship is dangerously  misguided. China's trade surpluses are helping to finance the regime's  military buildup and aggressive foreign policy, while strengthening its  hold on economic and political power.''   I do not take any pride in being right, because the outcome has been  devastating for the American workers. China has stolen our technology  and personnel secrets and taken millions of U.S. jobs over the past two  decades. The facts today show it.   Let's go through quickly a few of what we predicted two decades ago  and see where we are today. First, the threats against the United  States and Taiwan, that is pretty clear. Just look at China's reaction  to the recent routine arms sale to Taiwan of tanks and Stinger  missiles. Keep in mind, China has known since 1979 that we sell arms to  Taiwan to aid in their self-defense. Everyone knows that.   They threatened that they were prepared to go to war to defend their  ``unity and territorial integrity''--over a routine arms sale. In the  past year alone, Beijing has frequently threatened to use force against  any who opposed the Communist Party's designs on Taiwan, so despite  free trade, China has not stopped their threatening behavior toward the  United States and Taiwan.   Secondly, massive military modernization and buildup. We know that is  still going on. It is obvious to everyone that China has not changed  their behavior on this because of free trade. It has emboldened them.  China has become more aggressive as our free trade system has  subsidized their economy.   Some key facts: Over the last decade, the Chinese Government has  grown their military spending--look at the chart when I read this--has  grown their  [[Page S6502]]  military spending by 83 percent. That is over the last decade.  Meanwhile, during the last 5 years of the Obama administration, we  decreased our military spending by 25 percent. We decreased our  military spending while China had increased theirs by 83 percent.   That is why, today, China is able to build ships at a faster rate  than we are and is on pace to surpass the number of vessels by 2030.  That is why China is investing heavily in cyber capabilities, aviation,  artillery, and hypersonic weapons--hypersonic weapons, the most  sophisticated new weapons they have, the weapons that move at five  times the speed of sound. Actually, before the Obama administration, we  were ahead of both China and Russia. At the end of that administration,  we are behind them, and we are catching up now. Each capability, if not  superior to ours, has the potential to do us significant harm.   In 2018, I visited our allies in Southeast Asia, where I saw the  Chinese military buildup in the South China Sea for myself.   You remember the islands they created. This is not taking over  territory; it is creating territory because those islands weren't  there. They have islands in the South China Sea. The Chinese, at last  count, I believe, were at seven islands. When you go in and look at it,  you become convinced they are preparing for a world war III.   China, prior to that time--this is only 3 years ago--had always done  their military in their home territory. It has always been in China  until they went in Djibouti--that is the northern part of Africa--and  they started their own activity there. Now they are all the way down to  Tanzania, in that part of the world.   The Department of Defense official expects the Chinese to open more  bases, too, in the Middle East, in China, in Southeast Asia, and in the  Pacific. They are all strategically important locations.   When I talked to our allies in the Pacific, they are concerned, and  many are beginning to hedge their bets because they see what China is  doing. We are talking about the South China Sea. We are talking about  our own allies who have historically been our allies. All of a sudden,  they are starting to have second thoughts. They are seeing what China  is doing, but they don't see us doing anything. After 8 years of  President Obama's weak leadership, it is getting more difficult for us  to prove to them that we are actually interested in standing up to  China's aggression.   Third, the theft of U.S. secrets--we know about that. There is an old  saying: What China doesn't have, it steals. That is even more apparent  today than it was in 2000. China is still actively pursuing and  stealing some of our most valuable military secrets. Just last year,  China hacked a Navy contractor and stole massive amounts of classified  data. That practice isn't new, but it is still having serious impacts  on our ability to get ahead of China's militarily.   We are seeing an alarming rise in how China steals industrial  secrets. They do it out in the open--for example, by forcing any  American business that wants to operate in China to form a partnership  with a Chinese business. They have been doing that for a long period of  time, and we have been going along with it. Sadly, these partnerships  are nothing more than a way for the Chinese Communist Party to access  and steal proprietary ideas and technology.   They also do it in nefarious ways--through exploiting educational  relationships on college campuses or stealing biomedical research  during the peer-review process.   This is no small thing. One in five American companies has been a  victim of Chinese intellectual property theft. That matters because  nearly 80 percent of our economy is based on intangibles--the very  things the Chinese are stealing.   It is safe to say that this is another area where the regime in  Beijing has been emboldened by free trade at the expense of American  innovation and economic growth.   China hasn't changed its position on exploiting commercial  relationships either. For the past two decades, China has taken  advantage of countries--weaponizing their debt and working to control  ports, infrastructure, and other territory, posing a very real threat  to U.S. interests. There is no place where this is more apparent than  in Africa, where I keep hearing: ``America will tell you what you need;  China will build it for you.'' Of course, they don't follow through and  talk about how they use all Chinese resources to do this. They use  Chinese labor. But it is of no value to Africa.   I have been to Africa probably more than any other Member, as I have  been very active in that area and have seen some of the threats that  face us on that continent, and I have seen the Chinese debt trap hobble  more promising governments.   But it goes far beyond the developing world and extends right into  our own backyard. Just look at the recent issue with the NBA, where the  general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted a message in support of  the Hong Kong protesters. The backlash was swift. China stopped airing  Rockets games or streaming them online, and their online retailers  pulled merchandise from online stores.   We have also seen U.S. hotels, aviation companies--even the Gap-- being forced to edit and self-censor to remove any reference that even  tangentially refers to Taiwan, Tibet, or Hong Kong not being a part of  the People's Republic China, all to appease the Communist Party. The  jewelry company Tiffany was pressured to remove an advertisement of a  woman covering her eye because images of a protester in Hong Kong with  a wounded eye got international attention.   We live in a democracy, and we don't dictate to private businesses  what they should or should not do. This is not the case in China. Yet,  if we continue down the road of self-censorship, the party's demands  will escalate, and it will be harder and harder to exercise freedom of  expression.   Fourth, lastly, brutal repression of dissidents--that was true 19  years ago, and it is true today. More than anything, I would like to  say this was an area where free trade had forced the Chinese Communist  Party to change its behavior. That is what we were all told would  happen, but it didn't happen. We know it is not true.    We all know about the atrocities that are going on in Xinjiang  Province, where the government is forcing a Muslim minority into  concentration camps, although they call them reeducation centers. We  all know what is going on in Hong Kong, where Beijing is repressing a  democratic demonstration with brutal tactics. I remember being in Hong  Kong at the time China reasserted what they call their leadership,  their ownership, to Hong Kong. It has been on and off all these years.  Right now, that effort--disagreement is still taking place.   Outside of the areas that, despite China's best efforts, have  attracted international attention, we still know about the atrocities  the Chinese Communist Party quietly inflicts on journalists and  Christian minorities in house churches and in communities across China  every day.   I have just painted a very bleak picture of U.S.-China relations and  how unrestricted trade didn't force the ruling party in Beijing to  change its behavior, but the good news is, help is finally on the way.  After the trade deal was enacted--I am talking about President Trump's  trade deal--I kept speaking out against the Chinese Communist Party,  calling attention to their human rights abuses, their military buildup,  their manipulative trade tactics, and their economic bullying. I pushed  every President until now to stand up to the economic powerhouse before  it was too late and they outmatched us. I tried that with Republicans  and Democrats alike, and it didn't work.   Now we have the first President since 2000 to take China seriously.  President Trump is clear-eyed about the regime in Beijing. He knows  that our trade relations have been unfair and imbalanced, and he  understands that we need real and permanent fixes in order to have any  long-term stability. This is something that has been going on for a  long period of time, and he is now changing this. He is getting  criticized, obviously.   I have to say this: It hurts our farmers in the State of Oklahoma.  However, I would say that they are very understanding that someone is  finally willing to take on China.  [[Page S6503]]    He has effectively applied tariffs, both to punish the Chinese  Government for its manipulative trade practices and also to support  critical industries in the United States.   The result: China's economy has slowed to its lowest point since  1992--and that is if you believe their official numbers. These are  their numbers. It has slowed down their economy. That has not happened  before.   The economic pressure brought them to the table, ready to make a real  deal--one that is fair and accountable. So far, we have gotten phase  1--a preliminary first deal--and the outcome is good for farmers in  Oklahoma and across the country. For the first time, China has agreed  to purchase $40 billion to $50 billion worth of American agricultural  goods. That would be the highest level since 2012. That is a good  start.   The fight against China's economic manipulation and influence is not  over. It can't just be limited to shrinking the trade deficit through  greater purchases of American goods. Future parts of any agreement need  to be sure to address the concerns that Presidents of both parties  neglected for decades, including theft of intellectual property and  industrial secrets, forced technology transfer, reciprocal access to  markets, and subsidies to China's state-owned enterprises.   All of this needs to be placed into the proper context of the  Communist Party's ambitions on the world stage: to rewrite the rules of  the international system, to make the world safe for authorities to  suppress democracy and abuse human rights, and to achieve global  military superiority by midcentury.   President Trump's stand against China on trade has provoked a lot of  discussion about our competition with China. We have to remember that  this is not a competition against China but a competition for  influence--the kind of influence that decides what kind of world our  kids and grandkids are going to live in. Next week, my wife and I will  be celebrating our 60th wedding anniversary. We have 20 kids and  grandkids. They are the ones who will be living in that world I just  described.   In this competition, we can't afford to be naive. The Chinese  Communist Party has a very different version of the world it would like  to create, so even as we keep talking about the tariffs, we have to  remember that our values are still America's most precious commodity.  It is our values--free people and truly free markets--that must guide  us in the competition ahead.   Every part of this speech I gave on the Senate floor 19 years ago has  become a reality, and President Trump knows this. Maybe we better  listen to him.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I rise to offer a tribute to Nancy  J. Fletcher, a long-serving chief executive of a respected national  trade association whose leadership has benefited Oklahoma and the  Nation.   Nancy Fletcher led the Outdoor Advertising Association of America,  now known as the Out of Home Advertising Association of America, for  nearly 30 years as president and CEO.   An attorney, Ms. Fletcher shares my deep respect for property rights,  as spelled out in the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment: private  property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.   Ahead of Ms. Fletcher's retirement, I recall some of her important  contributions to the Nation and to Oklahoma. After the terrorist  attacks on September 11, 2001, Ms. Fletcher and her colleagues in the  industry immediately posted messages of national unity and resolve.   During her long leadership, technology changed all types of media,  including out of home media. As some billboards were converted to  digital electronic displays, Ms. Fletcher pioneered partnerships with  law enforcement, emergency managers, and the National Center for  Missing & Exploited Children. These partnerships, including with the  National Weather Center in Norman, have had positive benefits for  communicating emergency services, featuring tip lines to locate  fugitives and share information to help missing children return home.   Please join me in extending congratulations to Nancy Fletcher for her  successful leadership of the Outdoor Advertising Association of America  and her contributions to the public good.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1865, which was received  from the House.
