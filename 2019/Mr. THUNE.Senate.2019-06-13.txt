 Madam President, last week I came to the floor to discuss  the agriculture economy.   While the broader economy is thriving, our Nation's farmers and  ranchers are struggling. A combination of low commodity prices,  protracted trade disputes, natural disasters, and weather-related  issues have meant a tough few years for farmers. Nationwide, net farm  income is about half of what it was in 2013.  [[Page S3456]]    One of the biggest things we can do in Washington to help our  Nation's farmers and ranchers is to negotiate favorable trade deals  that expand existing and open new foreign markets for American  agricultural products. That is why I have been pushing for a speedy  conclusion to the various trade agreements that our country is  currently negotiating.   I strongly support the effort the administration has been making to  secure more favorable export markets for American products. We have  made real progress in negotiations. Now we need to wrap up the various  agreements we are discussing as soon as possible so that we can get  farmers and ranchers certainty about what international markets are  going to look like.   Of course, there is one agreement that has already been wrapped up-- the United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement. This is a hugely  important agreement that will boost almost every sector of the American  economy, from automotive manufacturing to digital services, to dairy  farming. It will create 176,000 new jobs and increase wages for  workers.   Passing this agreement is a big priority for the ag industry. Mexico  and Canada are huge importers of American agricultural products. The  United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will preserve and expand American  farmers' access to these key markets.   More than 950 food and agriculture companies and groups sent a letter  to Congress, urging its passage. In my home State of South Dakota,  Mexico and Canada are the No. 1 and No. 2 customers for our agriculture  exports. Maintaining and expanding South Dakota farmers' access to  these markets are critical.   I am particularly pleased with the improvement that the United  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement makes for U.S. dairy producers. Dairy is  an important and rapidly growing industry in South Dakota. If you drive  the I-29 corridor north of Brookings, you can see firsthand the massive  dairy expansion that we have experienced in South Dakota over the past  few years.   The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will preserve the U.S.  dairy farmers' role as a key dairy supplier to Mexico, and it will  substantially expand market access in Canada, where U.S. dairy sales  have been restricted.   The U.S. International Trade Commission estimates the agreement will  boost U.S. dairy exports by more than $277 million.   The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement also makes targeted  improvements for U.S. poultry, egg, and wheat producers. Wheat is  another important South Dakota product, and I look forward to the boost  this agreement will give South Dakota wheat growers.   As I said earlier, one of the most important things we can do to help  the struggling agriculture economy is to negotiate favorable trade  agreements for U.S. producers and open new markets for American  agricultural products. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is ready to go,  and Republicans in Congress are ready to pass it. Now Speaker Pelosi  needs to indicate her willingness to take up this agreement in the near  future.   This agreement will provide certainty for American producers and  expand market access for a vast array of American goods and services.  It is a win for our economy and a win for American workers. We should  pass this agreement as soon as possible.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander).
