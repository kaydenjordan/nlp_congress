 Mr. Speaker, we are just having some discussion  about the order of bills. Thank you so very much for your indulgence.   I want to ask if the ranking member has any additional speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First of all, let me thank Congressman Raskin for the diligent work  that he has done on the Judiciary Committee, as a whole, but  particularly his assistance today for those of us who were flying in.   This is a particularly important bill because I have just had the  opportunity to visit with corrections officers  [[Page H3942]]  in a correction center in New York. It was both an informational  opportunity and tour of the facility, but also, it was enormously  instructive.   First, I want to honor Lieutenant Osvaldo Albarati, correctional  officer in the Self-Protection Act, and I want to thank the author of  the legislation. It is clear that this is a very important addition to  both respecting, and, as well, protecting correctional officers. It is  a bipartisan, commonsense bill, as has been indicated, and specifically  provides for Federal Bureau of Prisons correctional officers to carry  personal firearms for protection as they commute to and from their  jobs.   Listening to these correctional officers, sitting down with them, you  know that there is a passion for their work. You also know that they  want those who are incarcerated to do well, to restore their lives, to  be rehabilitated.   So there is a mutual desire for a betterment of society, and I  believe that this is important in as much as the story of Lieutenant  Albarati is a sad one, for he was ambushed and murdered as he drove  home from his job at a Bureau detention center, and he was specifically  targeted for the work he did at the institution.   So this is an important way of honoring him, but also recognizing,  which we often don't take note in this week of saluting our law  enforcement officers. Sometimes we do not acknowledge the correctional  officers all throughout the Nation, and as well, those who are in State  and local government. I want to acknowledge them today as part of law  enforcement and to indicate that this is an important component to  making sure they are safe and that they go home safely to their  families.   I do want to say that I appreciate those correctional officers that  met with me to discuss how to improve the correctional institution, the  need for staffing, and the commitment that we will work together,  getting information from them, and as well, providing the resources  that they need.   Let me make this final point: that our correctional officers are in  all jurisdictions. Some are in urban centers, some in rural areas. And  so this legislation, obviously, will be guided by the appropriate laws  that deal with the carrying of weapons in their jurisdiction. But the  important point is that we provide them with a place to store those  weapons so that they are safe within the laws of their particular area  going to and fro. I think that is the least we can do.   And I rise to support this legislation and to indicate that there are  those of us who believe in real gun safety legislation, with no  undermining of the Second Amendment, that can clearly see the  correctness, if you will, and the rightness, if you will, of a  commonsense approach to protecting individuals who are set to protect  us or to do a law enforcement position.   And for that reason, let me thank the author of the legislation, let  me salute law enforcement officers this week, and take note of saluting  the late Lieutenant Albarati, and all of those correctional officers,  and ask our colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 613, the ``Lieutenant Osvaldo  Albarati Correctional Officer Self-Protection Act of 2017.''   I support this bipartisan, commonsense bill, which will facilitate  the ability of Federal Bureau of Prisons correctional officers to carry  personal firearms for protection as they commute to and from their  jobs.   H.R. 613 would allow the Bureau's correctional officers to protect  themselves, if necessary, without jeopardizing the safety and security  of the facilities in which they work.   Currently, Bureau of Prisons correctional officers are authorized to  carry concealed firearms for self-protection while off duty under the  Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act. This bill would not alter this  existing privilege.   Instead, because there currently is no mechanism to allow these  correctional officers to store firearms they might carry during their  commutes to and from Bureau of Prison facilities, they are precluded  from bringing their personal firearms onto the premises of these  facilities and are, in effect, thereby precluded from carrying firearms  for personal protection as they travel to and from work.   To address this issue, H.R. 613 would require the Bureau of Prisons  to allow properly qualified correctional officers to bring personal  firearms onto the premises of Bureau facilities in a manner that  minimizes any possible security or safety risks.   The Bureau would be required to either provide correctional officers  with a secure storage area for their firearms--located outside the  secure perimeter--or allow the officers to store their firearms in  vehicle lockboxes approved by the Bureau.   Without question, correctional officers perform an essential function  within our criminal justice system. And, we depend on them to ensure  Bureau facilities are safe, secure, and managed efficiently.   For some correctional officers, the inability to carry a firearm to  and from work could leave them vulnerable to those who might seek to do  them harm.   In fact, this bill is named in honor of Lieutenant Osvaldo Albarati,  a Bureau officer who was ambushed and murdered as he drove home from  his job at a Bureau detention center. Lieutenant Albarati was  specifically targeted for the work he did at the institution. So in  honor of him and all other officers, this legislation is put forth,  which will help prevent future lethal attacks on these officers.   Accordingly, I commend my colleagues and others for bringing this  important measure forward and encourage my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as we all know, this is the week that we take a special  moment to honor those who put on the uniform to provide safety and  security for the civilian population here in the United States called  police persons, law enforcement, sheriffs, constables, and Federal  officers. It is to recognize the importance, in a society of laws, to  have individuals willing to sacrifice and to put the uniform on without  question of their safety or security but, as well, be reminded of the  responsibilities of adhering to the Constitution of the United States.  That is, by and large, the mantra, the standards utilized by law  enforcement officers across the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H. Res. 285, a resolution expressing  the sense of the House that Congress and the President should empower  the creation of police and community alliances. I might put a few  balloons in celebration because many of us remember those beautiful  pictures of a little child holding the hand of an individual with a law  enforcement uniform on.   This resolution seeks to enhance and improve collaboration between  the law enforcement community and the public. I salute that. It is  fitting that we have this resolution during National Police Week where  families gather to mourn, but, as well, to celebrate, where officers  come to be acknowledged by their nation, and where we acknowledge the  brave men and women who give so much of themselves to keep us safe.   I support thoughtful measures that provide mechanisms to enhance  resources that will allow our law enforcement officers to serve their  communities effectively. That is why I hope to introduce, with a number  of my colleagues, the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act, which  creates and provides a distinctive medallion, as one of its provisions,  to be issued to the survivors of law enforcement officers killed in the  line of duty or memorialized on the National Law Enforcement Officers  Memorial.   Remember, the family is very much a part of the service that these  individuals give, and I meet them all the time, sometimes under  conditions that I wish I did not, but I also know how much they  contribute to the community.   The Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act also takes a  comprehensive approach to help foster healthy relationships between law  enforcement and communities by implementing best practices focused on  effective training and deescalation, recruitment, hiring, and  oversight. I think those are elements that can be very important to  protecting our law enforcement and our community.   Our country was founded on some fundamental principles; among those  is the rule of law. But the rule of law depends on the ability of the  public to trust law enforcement, conversely, on the capacity of law  enforcement to carry out their work while preserving the rights of  those whom we serve.   The best combination is, as this resolution intends, strong community  police relations, working together, because there are enough bad guys  that the help of the community can certainly help our law enforcement  officers. For those strained relations that have occurred at different  periods over the last couple of years, we want to, in particular, be  able to work to give resources and training--as I said, best practices  of deescalation--and also to help recruit in diverse communities to be  able to provide that good working relationship with law enforcement all  throughout.   We have seen diversity in law enforcement. In Texas, of course, we  have a number of layered law enforcement from police, to sheriffs, to  constables, to the Texas State rangers. All of these individuals give  opportunities for young people to participate in the law enforcement  arena on the local level.   In an effort to address these concerns last November, I, along with a  bipartisan group of legislators, hosted a briefing with the American  Psychological Association, titled, ``Improving Police-Community  Relations: Psychological Perspectives.'' The briefing explored how  improving relations between law enforcement and communities of color  can reduce violence between police and the public.   One of the speakers discussed the psychological implications of  policies that have, to my appreciation, been stopped and not utilized,  such as stop-and-frisk, that was facing a number of communities  differently from others.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Taylor and the cosponsors of H. Res. 285  for bringing it forward because we can always find ways on a two-way  street. That is what this resolution talks  [[Page H3944]]  about, a two-way street. I look forward to creating that two-way street  with the passage of this resolution and to including in the discussions  different aspects of different and unique communities in our Nation.   We are richly diverse: communities of color, those with different  languages, new status immigrants, and communities of different economic  levels. Dialogue generates peace, so I ask my colleagues to support  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the author of the legislation and the  cosponsors, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 3\1/2\  minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell),  well known for his commitment to first responders throughout the  Nation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) and  the Law Enforcement Caucus, Mr. Reichert, and I pay tribute to his  service. Certainly, Mr. Pascrell has been on the front lines for a very  long time, and I have been delighted to join him, first, when we were  on the Homeland Security Committee and then continuing on the caucuses  that deal with our first responders across the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, let me indicate to my colleagues that I also rise in  support of H. Res. 285, and to thank Mr. Pascrell, Mr. Taylor, and to  also reinforce what I hope will be a worthy discussion going forward on  the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act, which has a wide range of  civil rights groups and police groups who are already beginning to  support us.   This resolution has been introduced before, and we were lucky enough  to get a number of good cosponsors of organizations who believe in our  community-police cooperation.   I happen to come from Houston, where our first African-American  police chief was Lee Brown, who is known as the father of community- oriented policing, which is the premise, I believe, of this resolution,  getting to know your officers, engaging with your officers, and finding  a way to empower both police and community working together.   The Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act, which I look forward to  working with the ranking member of the full committee and ranking  member of the subcommittee and the chairman of the full committee and  the chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland  Security, and Investigations, deals with accreditation, deals with  development programs that are helpful to law enforcement, processes to  address questions raised, and as well the medallion for the family  members' collection of data, and, what I like, the professional  training funding that will come about for additional professional  training that many of the departments would long for and welcomed when  we began to discuss it.   So H. Res. 285 is a very important statement being made that I hope  that all of the Members will join, too, and that is that we need good  police-community relations. We need to develop and empower the creation  of police and community alliances.   We do it in Houston, Texas. We have layered officers. Most people  have never heard of constables. We have them in Texas. The rangers, we  still have the rangers with historic history. We have our police in the  different cities and counties and small towns, and then we have the  deputy sheriffs and sheriffs in our counties all throughout. Many of  these organizations do public service and barbecues. Certainly we all  gather together when we have a person fallen in duty, and as well we  continue to work when there is a tragedy dealing with a civilian as  well.   We must do everything we can to improve the relationship between law  enforcement and the communities we serve. Research shows that in order  to succeed, we must expend the resources needed to improve  communication and collaboration between law enforcement and the public.   There will be many officers up this week. We should see all of them  and engage in a friendly and welcoming way. We should reinforce the  value of having a Nation of laws and those who enforce it, that we are  also neighbors, and that we should look forward to increased community- police interaction and relationships.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this resolution and let  us work together for good in a Nation as great as America is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me, from the beginning, acknowledge the ranking  member for being on the floor on these important bills during this  police and law enforcement week in commemoration. This week is one of  the weeks that, over the years, all of us as Members have enjoyed the  most, seeing a lot of our law enforcement representatives from our  hometown jurisdiction and just seeing them from all over the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4854, the Justice Served Act  of 2018. I thank my colleague, Mr. Pascrell, my fellow Texan, Judge  Carter, and other Members for bringing this forward.   This legislation would help ensure that prosecutors have the  resources to go after perpetrators of violent crimes, specifically  those who have been identified by DNA evidence. I want to just say that  again, Mr. Speaker, violent crimes, which leave in their wake either  the bloody loss of life or some victim that is ruined for life because  of the viciousness of the crime, some of them children, families, the  elderly.   This is a very important element of law enforcement, the fair  investigation of crimes and bringing forward the perpetrator in a fair  and just and constitutional manner. To do so, they need tools. Congress  has appropriated over $100 million per year for the last decade to  reduce the DNA backlogs and improve crime laboratory capacity.   The Justice Served Act of 2018 does something unique. It capitalizes  on these investments by allowing a portion of the Debbie Smith Grant  Program to be allocated to prosecute perpetrators of violent crimes.   Mr. Goodlatte is right. I remember meeting Ms. Smith and the tragedy  that she faced, but also the way in which she wanted to commit to  making life better for many others. I thanked her for that as she  appeared before our committee in years past.   According to FBI data, over 1 million people were victims of violent  crimes nationwide in 2016. And in many of these cases, especially cases  involving sexual violence, DNA evidence is a crucial component of  prosecuting the perpetrators.   The Judiciary Committee is about to begin its effort of reauthorizing  the Violence Against Women Act, which my office has worked extensively  with other Members who previously had great commitment to this  legislation. We look forward to a bipartisan initiative.   We know that in the elements of sex crimes and domestic violence, the  DNA kits are extremely important, among other evidence that can be  found. Prosecutors often, however, face large caseloads and lack  the resources to properly ensure that violent crimes are adjudicated in  a timely manner, even when a suspect has been identified through DNA  evidence.    H.R. 4854, the Justice Served Act of 2018, encourages a resolution of  this problem by providing additional resources, none to take away from  the important work of the purpose of the act, but to add these  additional resources as are available through this legislation.  Prosecutors need to investigate, solve, and close these cases. Give  them those resources to do so.   Remember, investigating, solving, and closing have the component of  making sure that we do justice as well. This includes additional  funding for the prosecution of cold cases where new forensic technology  has identified a suspect.   It is important to note that the need for additional funding is not  the only problem that impacts prosecutors' ability to deal with  perpetrators of violent crimes. According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest  National Network, RAINN, the overwhelming backlog of untested DNA  evidence is currently one of the biggest obstacles to prosecuting  perpetrators of sexual violence. Based on public reports, at least  100,000 rape kits sit untested in evidence rooms, warehouses, and the  like. These rape kits often contain DNA evidence collected through a  sexual assault forensic exam, a medical process where evidence is  collected from a victim's body or clothes.                                time  1645    This evidence is a crucial factor in achieving justice, and it is  vital that prosecutors have this evidence.   So this legislation, the Debbie Smith Act, was passed to alleviate my  comments that I just previously made, and it has been enacted since  2004, and it has made a great impact, but now we have the opportunity  to use some of those resources to help move along some of these violent  cases and to assist prosecutors, again, in the fair adjudication, the  just adjudication, to bring justice to those who have suffered a  violent criminal act, lost their life, and certainly enhanced the  justice system.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4854, the ``Justice Served Act  of 2018'' and thank my colleague, Mr. Pascrell and other Members for  bringing this forward. This legislation would help ensure that  prosecutors have the resources to go after perpetrators of violent  crimes, specifically those who have been identified by DNA evidence.   Congress has appropriated over $100 million per year for the last  decade, to reduce the DNA backlogs and improve crime laboratory  capacity. The ``Justice Served Act of 2018'' capitalizes on these  investments by allowing a portion of the Debbie Smith grant program to  be allocated to prosecute perpetrators of violent crimes.   According to FBI data, over a million people were victims of violent  crimes nationwide, in 2016. In many of these cases, especially cases  involving sexual violence, DNA evidence is a crucial component of  prosecuting the perpetrators.   Prosecutors, however, often face large caseloads and lack the  resources to properly ensure that violent crimes are adjudicated in a  timely manner, even when a suspect has been identified through DNA  evidence.   H.R. 4854 the ``Justice Served Act of 2018'' encourages the  resolution of this problem by providing additional resources  prosecutors need to investigate, solve and close these cases. This  includes additional funding for the prosecution of cold cases where new  forensic technology has identified a suspect.   It is important to note that the need for additional funding is not  the only problem that impacts prosecutors' ability to hold perpetrators  of violent crimes accountable. According to the Rape, Abuse, & Incest  National Network, (RAINN), the overwhelming backlog of untested DNA  evidence is currently one of the biggest obstacles to prosecuting  perpetrators of sexual violence.  [[Page H3947]]    Based on public reports, at least 100,000 rape kits have sat,  untested, in evidence rooms, warehouses, and the like. These rape kits  often contain DNA evidence collected through a sexual assault forensic  exam, a medical process where evidence is collected from a victim's  body or clothes. This evidence is a crucial factor in achieving justice  and it is vital that prosecutors have this evidence.   In order to address the backlog, Congress passed the ``Debbie Smith  Act.'' The Debbie Smith Act provides crucial funding to support public  crime laboratories' work to build capacity and process DNA evidence  including evidence collected in rape kits.   Since its enactment in 2004, the Debbie Smith Act has been renewed  twice with overwhelming bipartisan support. This funding has  significantly decreased the backlog of untested DNA evidence.   The problem, however, continues to persist because of the  overwhelming amount of evidence that needs to be analyzed. For example,  in 2016, the Harris County Institute of Forensic Science, in Houston,  received over 3,000 cases to be reviewed. Despite receiving federal  grants, this lab continues to face difficulties in analyzing all the  evidence in a timely manner. We in Congress need to make sure that we  are allocating enough resources to ensure that these labs are able to  meet the demand.   Victims of violent crimes, especially victims of sexual violence,  have the right to have their cases resolved as quickly as possible.  They need to be able to move on, knowing that they are safe from the  person who hurt them.   It is therefore important that Congress continue to support efforts  to ensure that states and local government have the resources to test  and analyze DNA evidence and that prosecutors have the resources to go  after these suspects. For these reasons I support this bill, and I  encourage my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), who has worked without ceasing on  legislation that will help our law enforcement officers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pascrell for making that commitment that the  resources under the Debbie Smith Act will still be viable and ready to  be used for those sexual assault, sexual violence victims as this  legislation was intended, but a provision in the bill allows the  resources to also keep in line that nothing will undermine the  investigation of sexual assault cases, sexual violence cases, but it  allows the hand of justice to move on further for those who are the  victims of violent crimes and to ensure that perpetrators of violent  crimes are prosecuted as quickly as possible, again, under the equal  and balanced hand of justice.   So H.R. 4845, the Justice Served Act of 2018, provides funding to  State and local prosecutors to help them tackle the backlog of violent  crime cases, including cold cases, where suspects have been identified  through DNA evidence.   Certainly, there may be some overlap. I want to make it very clear to  our victims of sex crimes, domestic violence, and other crimes dealing  with those particular issues, that these dollars are enhanced dollars  to be able to do the violent crimes.   While it is important that State and local prosecutors have the  resources they need, it is also important that Congress remain vigilant  and continue to support efforts to clear the backlogs of untested and  unanalyzed DNA evidence, including rape kits.   The backlog in many jurisdictions is enormous. This was our intent,  to move forward, to provide justice to those who have suffered, some  have lost their life.   So in the spirit of expanding justice to ensure that justice is for  all, I rise to support this legislation in keeping with its initial  purpose, to solve the backlog of DNA kits, and now to be able to assist  in the solving and bringing to justice the perpetrators of violent  crimes.   Mr. Speaker, I again ask my colleagues to support the underlying  legislation, I thank the sponsors of it, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
