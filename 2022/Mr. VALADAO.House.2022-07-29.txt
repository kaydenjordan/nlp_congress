 Madam Chair, my constituents have faced drought  conditions for years. Communities throughout the Central Valley and the  entire American West are running out of water for daily use in homes,  businesses, and agriculture production. Farmers are being forced to  fallow their fields and dry out their orchards, and hundreds of  thousands of acres will be unable to be planted again this year.   Instead of coming to the table to work on real solutions that would  give families and farmers in my community the water they desperately  need to survive, the majority has decided they would rather play  politics with the most critical resource in the valley.   Apparently, passing political messaging bills to check a box is more  important to my Democratic colleagues than trying to save the  livelihood of thousands of valley farmers trying to put food on the  tables of Americans across the country.   This bill is completely silent on the desperate need for enhanced  water storage infrastructure to better prepare us during wet years. It  does not cut red tape, decrease time delays, or address increased  project costs due to redundant requirements under NEPA.   The bottom line is this bill is bad policy and bad for the Central  Valley. My colleagues don't seem to understand that the fewer  agriculture products the Central Valley produces, the worse off our own  domestic food supply will be. Reduced ag means more of a reliance on  other nations for our food, which is an issue for national security.   We must do better to address the severe drought we are suffering  through in the American West.  [[Page H7430]]    The WIIN Act, which passed with bipartisan support under President  Obama in 2016, provided real relief to valley farmers by increasing  operational flexibility of the Central Valley Project and the  California State Water Project. It also authorized millions of dollars  for important water infrastructure projects to improve the Friant-Kern  Canal, the Delta-Mendota Canal, and the California Aqueduct.   The WIIN Act was critical to ensuring that valley families in rural  communities across the United States have clean, reliable water. We  made great progress because of this legislation. Unfortunately,  authorities under the WIIN Act expired in 2021.   This is why I introduced the RENEW WIIN Act, to extend storage and  operation provisions of the WIIN Act and authorize funds for critical  water storage projects.   Over three quarters of the Democrats in this House supported these  positions in 2016. But this week, they refused to include my bill in  this so-called drought relief package. They are blocking an actual  solution to the crisis in the name of environmental justice.   Madam Chair, where is the justice in letting thousands of valley  farmers lose their livelihoods because they cannot get something as  basic as water?   If this drought bill was truly about solving the water crisis in the  West, the House majority would include the RENEW WIIN Act in this  package instead of actively blocking its consideration.   Madam Chair, I am once again urging the House majority to consider  this legislation that will bring water to the people in my community  doing everything possible to survive this terrible drought.   Madam Chair, I urge the Democrat majority to stop playing politics  with the resource that the entire country is so reliant on.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record the text of the amendment.         At the end of division A, insert the following:       SEC. 303.
