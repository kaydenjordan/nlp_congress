 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Bill Shipp and recognize his decades of political journalism and  service to Georgians.   A newsman for the Atlanta Journal Constitution and his own  independent publication, Bill Shipp was like the Google of Georgia  politics, infinitely knowledgeable about all happenings within the  State at a time well before the internet even existed.   Throughout his storied career, Shipp used his knowledge to cover  everything from the civil rights movement to the space age and the  Republican revolution.   His ability to keep Georgians informed and hold politicians  accountable started at the young age of 20 when he served as managing  editor of UGA's Red & Black newspaper.   It was in that position as editor that Shipp advocated fearlessly for  the integration of UGA's law school, wielding his voice to do good.   The loss of Mr. Shipp marks the end of an era, and I will miss his  sharp quips, witty remarks, and comprehensive coverage throughout  Georgia.
