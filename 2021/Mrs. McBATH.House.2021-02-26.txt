 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the American  Rescue Plan Act. This week, we hit another tragic milestone, and our  Nation has now lost over half a million people to this virus. It is  difficult to comprehend the sheer magnitude of those we have lost, but  we cannot become numb to the sorrow so many now feel. Each person  leaves behind their story of life, love, and humanity. Each human being  leaves behind a family grieving the loss of a parent, a sibling, or a  spouse.   This is why we must pass the American Rescue Plan, a bill that  accelerated our ability to deliver lifesaving vaccines and put an end  to this pandemic, a bill that invests in our schools allowing our  children and teachers to safely return to in-person learning, and a  bill that provides vital economic relief to American families who need  our support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to vote ``yes.''                            ____________________
