 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor the  sacrifice of West Virginia's veterans and to welcome them to Washington  DC, as a part of the Always Free Honor Flight. West Virginia has a  proud tradition of military service, and I am privileged to be able to  recognize these brave men and women who put their lives on the line to  preserve our freedoms during our Nation's most critical hours of need.   The Always Free Honor Flight program, run by the Denver Foundation,  is dedicated to bringing our veterans to Washington, DC, to thank them  for their bravery and selflessness. As a daughter of a World War II  veteran, this is something that is very close to my heart, and I am so  thankful for the folks at Always Free Honor Flight who have dedicated  their time to making sure our veterans feel our immense gratitude and  pride. This year, we have the privilege of being joined by 25 veterans,  including veterans from World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.   These courageous individuals embody the very best of our Nation's  values and have endeavored, through unimaginable hardship and danger,  to ensure that all Americans may continue to live in the freedom and  safety that we all cherish. Their courage, through some of the greatest  conflicts of the 20th century, will not go unnoticed, and we must  strive to show our appreciation every day.   On this Always Free Honor Flight, we will be joined by two World War  II veterans: Storekeeper Second Class William ``Ray'' Calvin Sexton,  USN, Tazewell, VA; and Motor Machinist's Mate Third Class Marion Grey  Noel, USN, Roanoke, VA.   In addition to our World War II veterans, we will also be joined by  Korean  [[Page S3063]]  war veteran Gerald Marreese Richmond, North Tazewell, VA; and two  veterans who served in both the Korean and Vietnam wars: Johnie Lewis  Gordon, Sr., USA, Princeton, WV; and MSgt Reese Williamson Moore, USAF,  Bluefield, WV.   The Vietnam veterans participating are Samuel ``Sam'' J. Connor, USN,  Princeton, WV; CPL William ``Bill'' Cox, USA, Bluefield, WV; Sergeant  Marion ``Mario'' E. Deskins, USAF, Iaeger, WV; CPL Donald R. Dinger,  USMC, Bluefield, WV; SGT James ``Jim'' W. England, USA, Bluefield, VA;  Jackie W. Estep, USMC, Yukon, WV; SPC Carl A. Lane, USA, Pineville, WV;  Sergeant Marshal G. Mann, USAF, Princeton, WV; SGT Owen C. Neff, USA,  Summersville, WV; PO3 Donald ``Donnie'' W. Noel, USN, Salem, VA; CPL  Raymond C. Palmer, USA, Mabscott, WV; SGT Ronald Pennington, USA,  Princeton, WV; PFC Jackson Phillip Thompson, USA, Bluefield, WV; SPC  Larry Malone Saunders, USA, Madison, WV; PO1 Alan Brett Sexton, USN,  Princeton, WV; SPC James Buck Tunnell, USA, Bandy, VA; CPL Ricky D.  Williams, USMC, Beckley, WV; and CPT Jerry Sheffield, USA, Lavelette,  WV.   Other veterans include PFC Willis Lee Helmandollar, USA, Rocky Gap,  VA; and SrA Grover C. White, Jr., USAF, Princeton, WV.   This year, we are also proud of the ROTC cadets serving as escorts  for our veterans, including Jacob Aaron Krabbe, Montcalm High School,  Princeton, WV; Miaha Thompson, Montcalm High School, Rock, WV; and  Lamont Devon Johnson, Bluefield High School, Bluefield, WV.   These young cadets are proof of West Virginia's continuing tradition  of military service and are the next generation of brave men and women  that serve our country with bravery and pride.   A great debt of gratitude is also owed to Dreama Denver, president of  the Denver Foundation and Little Buddy Radio. These nonprofit  organizations, which were founded by Dreama and her husband, Bob  Denver, established the Always Free Honor Flight Network in West  Virginia.   I am so proud of the service and sense of duty that defines West  Virginians and, indeed, all Americans. We all benefit from their  selflessness and courage, and one of the most sacred tasks we hold is  properly honoring the dedication of our veterans. In bringing them  together with the powerful monuments that recognize their sacrifice, we  can express our unyielding gratitude while demonstrating our lasting  commitment to preserving their memory. One of the greatest honors of  serving in the U.S. Senate is representing citizens who have given so  much to their country. I take seriously the duty of ensuring that their  sacrifice is honored with the same steadfast conviction with which they  defended the rights and freedoms of every American. Today I ask my  colleagues to join me in welcoming and thanking these exceptional West  Virginia veterans.                            ____________________
