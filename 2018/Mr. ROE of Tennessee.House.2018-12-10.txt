This legislation is a  prenegotiated, bipartisan package of bills that we have worked out with  the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. The amended version of the  bill contains 23 sections, many of which originated in the 80-plus  veterans bills that the House passed in the 115th Congress.   Though S. 2248, as amended, reflects just a fraction of our  collective efforts, as we were unable to come to an agreement with the  Senate on several outstanding issues, it, nonetheless, contains many  important provisions that we can all be pleased to support.   For example, one provision of the bill would make schools ineligible  for GI Bill tuition payments if they place penalties or burdens on  students due to the Department of Veterans Affairs' inability to pay  the GI Bill payments to schools on time. This provision was championed  by Vice Chairman Bilirakis, and I thank him for his advocacy.   There are several provisions in the bill that make improvements to  the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act that protect deployed  servicemembers from commercial penalties, which they can occur as a  result of their service.   The bill also includes provisions that would improve burial benefits  for servicemembers, veterans, and their families; expand eligibility  for a successful homeless veteran job training program; authorize  funding for VA construction projects; and provide critical oversight of  government purchase cards and the development of VA's new electronic  health record.   Mr. Speaker, before yielding back, I will take a moment to say that  serving as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee has been an  immense honor to me, and I am grateful to all of those who put their  trust and faith in me to fulfill this role for Congress.   I thank a number of individuals who have been instrumental in this  committee's success during the 115th Congress.   First, I thank Ranking Member Walz, the newly elected Governor of the  very cold State of Minnesota; my subcommittee chairmen and ranking  members; and the members of the committee. Without their continued hard  work and involvement, none of this congressional success in the  veterans area would have been realized. Many members on our committee  had numerous other duties but never, ever neglected the Veterans'  Affairs Committee.   I thank the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee chairman, Senator  Isakson, and Ranking Member Jon Tester for their hard work, and I look  forward to working with them in the next Congress.  [[Page H9799]]                                     time  1700    I am also grateful to the House leadership on both sides of the  aisle, but particularly Speaker Paul Ryan, Leader McCarthy, Whip  Steve  Scalise, and Cathy McMorris Rodgers. Leadership support for this  committee was unwavering and ensured that veterans' matters received  the time and attention they so richly deserve.   Finally, I want to thank all Members of the House of Representatives  who strive, day in and day out, to do right by America's veterans. With  Members' support, we have helped enact landmark legislation this  Congress, including: The VA MISSION Act, the Forever GI Bill, the VA  Accountability Act, appeals reform, and many, many other smaller, yet  impactful pieces of legislation which Americans, and especially  veterans, can be proud of.   The bipartisan nature of this committee is unique in Congress, and it  is nothing less than what our veterans deserve. I look forward to  serving as ranking Republican member of the committee next Congress and  continuing our work with soon-to-be Chairman Mark Takano.   I urge my colleagues to support S. 2248, as amended, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), vice chair of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee and one of the most fierce advocates for our veterans in this  Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), my good friend, and chairman of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation, and a retired Marine Corps  lieutenant general.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup), my good friend, who currently serves and has  served on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee as the Health  Subcommittee chair. He also serves on the House Armed Services  Committee, Intel Committee, and is a colonel in the reserves    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik), my good friend and fellow  member of the Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to encourage all Members to support S.  2248, as amended.   As I close, I thank both the Republican and Democratic members of the  committee and of the full House for the incredible work that they have  done. This committee is an example of how Congress should work. We put  our partisanship aside at the door and we think about one thing: what  is good for America's veterans and their families.   You heard today how Members on both sides of the aisle have gone home  and listened to their constituents and come back with great ideas.  Often, the great ideas don't emanate from here; they emanate from the  citizens of this country. I thank them and the 20 million or so  surviving veterans in this country for their incredible service. We  will never get it all straight up here, but I can assure you that we  are trying our very best to do what is right.   I congratulate Mr. Takano in his elevation to the chairmanship. I  know we have worked very closely together through the last several  years--not just the last 2 years, but the last several years. He will  do a great job as chairman, and I look forward to serving.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take  from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 3946) to name the Department of  Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in Statesboro,  Georgia, the ``Ray Hendrix Veterans Clinic'', with the Senate  amendments thereto, and concur in the Senate amendments.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
