 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, my good friend, for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, what is happening with the appropriations bills is  unprecedented. After passing four appropriations bills earlier this  year, we are now considering the remaining eight appropriations bills  this week in 2 days. That means that we are debating the funding for  roughly two-thirds of discretionary Federal spending bills in just over  4 days.   Has any Member here really had the time to read all 1,035 pages of  these eight bills? Better yet, has anyone had time to read nearly all  the thousand amendments and determine what the impact of each one would  be?   This is the appropriations process we are talking about; the process  that used to take us days and weeks and was perfectly open so that all  Members of the House were able to propose amendments on the floor.  These are the bills that fund programs that impact the life of every  American every single day.   But we are not giving them any serious consideration they deserve,  and the minority has been virtually, literally, I would say, shut out  of the process altogether.   When the majority took control of Congress and the White House, they  promised regular order. They have not only broken that promise, they  have shattered it and stomped on it. Speaker Ryan is the only speaker  in the history of tracking statistics to never have had a truly open  rule.   An open rule would allow any Member to offer an amendment that  complies with the standing rules of the House and the Budget Act. Not a  single one. A bad process, I believe, will lead to a bad product, and  these bills are no exception. They are full of provisions that would do  real harm to millions of Americans.    Inside these bills, the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, passed in  the wake of the biggest recession since the Great Depression, would be  tattered. The biggest banks still in control of the people who got us  in trouble in the first place would be allowed to run roughshod over  the economy again, paving the way for another Great Recession or worse.   Try as we could to find out what would be the substitute for Dodd- Frank to prevent them from doing that again, there is no answer they  would be able to do it. Under Dodd-Frank, we have had a record-setting  streak of more than 80 consecutive months of private sector job growth.  Mr. Speaker, this growth didn't come despite this law; it came because  of it.   There is also language here that would ramp up the majority's assault  on women's health; provisions that would zero out funding for Title X,  the Nation's only Federal program devoted to family planning. More than  4 million women depend on it for access to contraception.   The bills would also eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, which  serves 2.5 million women and men every year. It is relied on not just  for contraception, but for services like breast cancer screenings,  wellness visits, and STI testing.   The bills would be truly destructive if they ever became law. They  don't appear to have the necessary votes to pass the Senate, since  there are not 60 Senators willing to vote for this legislation, and  that would make one wonder why are we even going through this charade,  because we have only 9 legislative days left in the month of September.  During those 9 days, we need to raise the debt ceiling to pay the bills  we have already incurred, to fund the government for the following  year, to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program; the  Perkins Loan Program, which many low-income students rely on for their  college education; and, very importantly, the Federal Aviation  Administration. All of those expire on September 30.   We also need to address the National Flood Insurance Program, which,  on its current course, faces a shortfall of more than $25 billion. And  that will expire at the end of this month. We all know the horror of  going through Hurricane Harvey, and now Irma, and with two more, as I  understand it, starting their aim at us in the Atlantic.   If we are going to do all of this, we have to get back to the orderly  and thoughtful process. Congress can't wait for a disaster to always be  at its doorstep before acting. We need to abandon legislation by chaos  or emergency, which we often do for something that we could have done  by scheduling.   Two-thirds of the discretionary spending bills considered in a single  week is absurd and irresponsible, and I would doubt has ever taken  place before in the House of Representatives. It is time we took  control of the House and got back to regular order, which we talk about  all the time, but hardly anybody remembers. We hope for a better day,  and we hope for it soon.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Rosen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Rosen).    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I  will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream  Act, this bipartisan, bicameral legislation. We have thousands of young  people who are Americans in every way except on paper.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Carbajal) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a distinguished member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York has 16 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California  an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California  an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   I am really very fond of my colleague over there, and I appreciate  his wonderful sunshine attitude.   The fact is we have never seen anything like what we are going  through now. Twice, in just the last few months, one amendment by Ms.  Lee, to finally get an AUMF so that we could authorize the wars that  seem to be going on forever in the name of the United States of America  was voted on in committee, passed in committee, and should have been in  the bill. Lo and behold, it disappeared. I don't think we ever did  anything like that to my knowledge, and if we did, shame on us.   In this very bill today, there was, again, an amendment presented in  committee for the DACA people to be able to get jobs while they are  waiting with the Federal Government. I am paraphrasing that because I  never saw it, but that is my understanding of what that did. Once  again, it was presented at the committee, voted, passed, and should  have been in this bill. But before it got to Rules, just like Ms. Lee's  amendment, it just disappeared.   How can you run the Government of the United States by saying that  the people do their will through us? We are not sitting here to  represent ourselves and do what we want to do and take one from column  A and one from column B. We follow rules. That is what we are supposed  to do. We have to answer for that.   I want the people of the United States to know that what we are  talking about here today is probably not going anywhere. As far as we  know, it will not get past the Senate. Now, some miracle may happen.  Who knows? Or maybe the whole thing will disappear--I don't know--with  no explanation, by the way.   But we haven't really done anything here yet except what I would call  a crazy amalgamation of what the rules of the House wouldn't even come  close to allowing us to do. Any body, any Congress, any House of  Representatives, any legislature anywhere can do what they have to do  to get their budget ready if they throw it all in one mix and let one  committee, the Appropriations Committee, do it. The other committees  had no right to talk about it.   As I pointed out, again, the majority has really cut out the minority  completely. Do you think we knew before it got to Rules that those two  amendments that I talked about that were terribly important had  disappeared? We didn't know that until it was given to us.   Many times what we get at Rules are emergency meetings, which means  one thing: no committee action. We have decided we would like to do  this one this week, so let's call it an emergency.   Enough. Enough already. This is the premier legislative body in the  world. The hopes, the dreams, and the aspirations of all Americans lie  in this House. We do or we do not do what is in the best interests of  the people who sent us here. I promise you it is not in the best  interests to cut out all of the population of the United States--about  half, almost half. In fact, I believe numerically we got more votes  than the other side--just cut us out of the process.   I have already talked about no open rules. If you can't have an open  rule whereby you can talk about amendments, there is nothing else for  you to do. We are out of it because Democrats get very few amendments.  I don't think the Rules Committee people get hardly any at all, and  then we beg for some of the best ones we would like to be made into  order--never happens.   We are pretty discouraged. As a matter of fact, we were talking about  maybe we should stage a coup, but I know that is illegal and would not  work in the United States of America. So it was kind of a fleeting  thought brought about by pure frustration.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Scott had a wonderful amendment. He is the ranking  member on the Education and the Workforce Committee and is known  throughout the United States for the  [[Page H7111]]  work that he does, as is Barbara Lee, who is probably more well known  than almost any other Member of this House. To be treated that way, to  have to go back to her district and say, ``Well, we tried to do these  amendments''--enough already.    We can do it the right way. We used to. When I got here, it was  entirely different. The bipartisanship was strong. We all liked each  other. It was a pretty wonderful thing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott), whose amendments should have been allowed.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are really getting somewhere here. What my colleague  failed to say is, as far as I know and I imagine as far as he knows,  that no committee has ever sent a bill to the Rules Committee  completely taking away amendments that had passed in that committee and  were legitimately a part of that bill.   In just the last, let's say, 2 or 3 months, two amendments  legitimately passed by Democratic members in the proper committee  disappeared between that committee and the Rules Committee. If that is  not a violation of rules, I don't know how in the world you would ever  describe it.   Sure, we had a lot of open rules--I mentioned Paul Ryan has never had  one--which gave everybody an opportunity to do an amendment, all 435  us, if we chose to, but we don't. When you talk about something coming  to us from a committee, large bills sometimes don't come to us from  committees, but oftentimes they are written somewhere--we are not sure  where--but they come to us in an emergency procedure because they have  to get to the floor that week.   I am not just talking about improving. I am talking about following  the rules of procedure laid down by history, by circumstance, and by  geniuses. I am talking about not appropriating those in ways that say:  We just don't want that amendment on the list. Pretend it never  happened. Throw it in the garbage and maybe nobody will remember it.   We remember. We think that some amendments are a few things that  would really move the country forward, and we don't have a chance to  get them put in place simply because we are the minority. That is  absolutely wrong. It is undemocratic. It is hurtful to the institution  and hurtful to America.   We can do better. You and I should pledge right now to work on that.  I am game if you are.    I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.    Reclaiming my time, I don't want to see that anymore.  It is an embarrassment when I have to even get up to do my half of the  rule and talk about what awful things have happened to us. There are  more things that I need to talk about than that.   I think we should cut out the games and the cuteness and all the rest  of it and do our job.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Richmond).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   These bills don't have the support they need to pass the Senate. It  takes 60 votes to even bring them to the floor. That means that this  entire exercise this week has been an exercise in futility. All the  while, the clock is ticking and Congress has so much to do, as I have  elaborated several times this afternoon, over the next 9 legislative  days.   If this process has been good for anything, it is revealing just how  broken the legislative process has become under the majority's rule.   Legislation regularly comes to the House floor without any committee  consideration. It just goes to rules. The majority even rammed through  a healthcare repeal bill not long ago--I am sure everybody remembers  that--that would impact one-sixth of our entire economy without first-- what we need to do again in regular order--getting a score from the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.   They are very important. They tell us what cost and what impact it  would have on the budget and on the country. So that means we had no  idea of the impact of that bill on our markets or what it would cost  when voting for it.   The minority is routinely shut out of the process, often unable to  get so much as a vote on an amendment on the House floor. When Speaker  Ryan assumed the gavel, he promised to return to regular order and an  open process. We have been waiting a mighty long time. Every time we  offered an amendment to the bill before us in the Rules Committee, we  asked that the rule be open; again, giving all Members a chance to  affect that bill. Unanimously, we are voted against and we lose all  those votes 9-4. That means that both sides will not be able to affect  that bill and it means that regular order is as far away as it ever  was.   Here we are, less than a month away from the end of the fiscal year,  and we haven't passed a budget resolution through the House. We were  supposed to have a budget through the House, the Senate, and the  conference--the conference is necessary to reconcile the House and  Senate bills--by April 15.   We blew through the debt limit in March and still have not dealt with  that. We have yet to have a single open rule in the Rules Committee  under the Speaker's leadership. Believe me, I am sure that an awful lot  of Members of this House have something to say about what is going on.   It is no wonder that, according to the latest figures from Gallup, 79  percent of the public disapproves of how Congress is doing its job. No  wonder.   CBS News highlighted that it costs the taxpayers an estimated $24  million a week to operate the House of Representatives. They know that  they are not getting their money's worth.   They needed 60 votes to repeal and replace healthcare, when there was  no replacement in sight. I am not sure how to describe that as a  legislative proposal, but what it sounds like to me is a hoax. We are  going to fool you that we have really got a replacement here.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, the rule,  and the bill. I hope that my good colleague, Mr. Woodall, and I can  help fix this place to do a little better.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    The Rules Committee did not get together. The majority  of the Rules Committee got together. We had no action in that game  whatsoever.                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, just to speak on accuracy: don't say the  Rules Committee got together and went over those. Say the Rules  Committee majority got together and went over those. You know, that is  all I ask.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair  will reduce to 5-minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on  the question of adoption of the resolution.

A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Calvert and Chairman  Frelinghuysen for their commitment to the arts. I greatly appreciate  the subcommittee's efforts to fund the National Endowment for the Arts  and the National Endowment for the Humanities.   The NEA's mission is to strengthen the creative capacity of our  communities by providing all Americans with diverse opportunities for  arts participation. Of critical importance, the NEA has expanded their  reach to help servicemembers who have been diagnosed with TBI,  traumatic brain injury, and other psychological conditions. This new  partnership is critically important.   The NEA Creative Forces Military Healing Arts Network is a  collaboration with the Department of Defense which supports music,  writing, and visual art therapy at military care facilities. They are  finding that the best treatment for PTSD is yoga, which doesn't cost us  anything.   The Creative Forces program places the creative arts therapies at the  core of patient-centered care in military medical facilities and  invests in research on the impacts and benefits of these innovative  treatment methods. The cost-effective, noninvasive arts therapy of  those programs rank consistently in the top five ``helpful'' and ``wish  to continue'' programs on patient satisfaction surveys of the men and  women who have gone through the programs, and over 85 percent of  military patients said art therapy was helpful to their healing.   We may even be learning here that this might be the best thing, as  Mr. Lance was pointing out, for autistic children.   But throughout the art therapy programs and the work that they are  doing, our servicemen and -women are being able to transition away from  the basketful of prescription drugs that they carry around with them  and lived on and are rejoining their families and life. So when they  wheel out of that healing, that psychological skill-building, self- expression, and self-esteem that comes from these programs, that  obviously is certainly something that we need to continue.   As part of the NEA's mission to increase access to the arts for all  Americans, Creative Forces enables more servicemembers, veterans, and  military families to benefit from creative art therapies and community  arts activities.   NEA is so cheap it is surprising. For the small amount of money we  put into it, we would get about $9 billion back and many people who  have been employed. We don't do anything with a better return than the  money we spend for the arts.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, as the designee of Ranking Member Lowey, I  move to strike the last word.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Price).   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member  for yielding. I thank Chairman Calvert for engaging in this colloquy  with Mr. Lance and Ms. Slaughter and me.   We are highlighting the importance of the National Endowment for the  Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities and the importance  of robust funding for the work of those agencies. There is no more  efficient dollar spent in the entire Federal budget. I will say in a  minute what I mean by that.   I am very happy to be co-chairman, with Mr. Lance, of the  Congressional Humanities Caucus, to be a member of the Congressional  Arts Caucus, which Ms. Slaughter and others have led, and proud to  support the missions of these two agencies.   Federal support for the arts and the humanities affirms America's  rich and diverse cultural and artistic heritage. It really is an  investment in the quality of life of our people. I think we should see  it that way, and we need to  [[Page H7146]]  be steadfast in our support and our investment. It is one of the most  efficient we make, as I said. It leverages private, nonprofit, and  corporate dollars.   In 2015 alone, for example, Federal NEH museum grants leveraged $104  million in outside funding from only $33 million in Federal funds. That  is a pretty good return for the taxpayer.   They support millions of jobs, these endowments do, and the projects  they fund, hundreds of millions of dollars in direct economic activity,  and the American public loves them. Participation all over this  country, in communities large and small, rural and urban, is widespread  and enthusiastic.   So again, I thank the chairman for his attention to these important  lines in the budget. I hope we can bolster our commitment to the arts  and humanities and do even better as the appropriations process moves  forward.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I want to also commend the chairman and  working with the whole committee to make sure that the arts and  humanities receive the funding that they did.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I want to quickly thank the gentlewoman from the  great State of Minnesota, thank the gentleman from California, and just  very quickly say that I come with my amendments, but I also come just  to acknowledge the pending storm in Florida and Hurricane Harvey  because our arts communities were underwater, and they are still  underwater.   I offered amendments that deal with preservation of heritage areas,  urban reforestation, and the Smithsonian outreach. I thank my  colleagues for putting it in the en bloc.   But as I do so, I want to take note of, again, all of the debris and  be able to say that, in the course of hurricanes, historic entities are  impacted.   We are looking to establish an emancipation trail, and one of my most  important amendments is to ensure that there is national policy to  preserve, for public use, historic sites, buildings, and objects of  national significance for the inspiration and benefit of people of the  United States.   My community is looking for that emancipation trail, but it starts  from Galveston. We have not yet been able to assess whether any of  those historic markers and places were destroyed by Hurricane Harvey.  So the funding for the Interior Department and the aspects that come  under the Interior Department, the jurisdictional issue is very  important to us because we will have to look to see if our historic  entities have been preserved.   In the midst of debris and danger that our constituents face, this is  equally important, and it is equally important to restore the symphony,  to restore the ballet and our theater, all of them underwater in my  congressional district.   I hope, as we move forward, H.R. 3686, Hurricane Harvey supplemental  appropriation that we have filed that will embrace all of these issues,  will be considered.   I thank my colleagues for those amendments. And, again, in the course  of a storm, the history of people is jeopardized, and my amendments  deal with preserving the history of our people. Maybe, as we come out  of this, we will create the emancipation trail that is part of my  amendment.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                   Amendment No. 27 Offered by Mr. Langevin    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 27  printed in House Report 115-297.
