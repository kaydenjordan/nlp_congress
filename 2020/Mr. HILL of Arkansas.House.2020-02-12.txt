 Mr. Speaker, last week Venezuelan interim  President Juan Guaido was welcomed with  [[Page H1053]]  bipartisan support in this Chamber as President Trump's guest for the  State of the Union.   For years, Venezuela's united Socialist party has pushed a once  prosperous country towards desperate poverty and open tyranny.   The wrongful detention of the Citgo Six for more than 2 years  demonstrates the corrupt nature in which Maduro will do anything to  remain in power.   The United States and the Organization of American States should  institute greater pressure and tighten sanctions against the Maduro  regime and his cronies in order to support a return to a democratic  Venezuela.   I stand with President Guaido and the people of Venezuela and call on  Maduro to step down and release the Citgo Six and all political  prisoners or face greater sanctions.                 Honoring the Life and Legacy of Wilmer Plate     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of one of Arkansas's great veterans, Lieutenant Colonel Wilmer  Plate, who recently passed away at the age of 99.    Will was born in 1919 and began his long career of service shortly  after the start of World War II. Will led numerous missions during the  war as a commander of a 10-man crew in a B-24.   Following the end of World War II, Will continued his service for  more than three decades until his retirement from the Air Force as a  chief warrant officer 4 and shortly after as a lieutenant colonel in  the Air Force Reserve.   Lieutenant Colonel Plate continued to provide crucial insight into  World War II by publishing his memoir entitled, ``The Storm Clouds of  War: Reflections of a World War II Bomber Pilot.''   Will earned numerous medals and awards for his service, including,  among many others, the Purple Heart and the Distinguished Flying Cross.   Will was a true American patriot, one of which all Americans and  Arkansans can admire, and I extend my deepest respect, affection, and  prayers to his friends, family, and loved ones.                 Honoring the Life and Legacy of Forrest Wood     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of one of Arkansas's great outdoorsmen, Mr. Forrest Wood, who  recently passed away at the age of 87.   Born in Flippin, Arkansas, Forrest was considered a pioneer in the  fishing industry and the father of the modern bass boat.   He founded Ranger Boats, a bass boat company that he designed and  built principally for black bass fishing with his wife Nina. In 1968,  Forrest was instrumental in the formation of the bass fishing  tournament circuit.   As a long-time Arkansas game and fish commissioner, he was a strong  conservationist and devoted to Arkansas, the Natural State. Forrest was  awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Sport Fishing  Association of America and the BASS Federation. Forrest was also  inducted into the Arkansas Game and Fish Foundation Outdoor Hall of  Fame and the Arkansas Business Hall of Fame.   Forrest was an inspiration and friend to many across our State, and I  extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his friends, family, and  loved ones.                           Recognizing Ron Chastain     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Major  General Ron Chastain for recently being appointed as the civilian aide  to the secretary of the Army.   General Chastain was born in Paris, Arkansas, and was commissioned as  a second lieutenant in the Army Reserve upon graduation from the ROTC  program at Arkansas Tech University.   General Chastain's distinguished military service in the Arkansas  National Guard spanned nearly four decades, including service as  adjutant general and receiving Federal recognition as a major general  of the line in 2005.   General Chastain spent over 30 years working for the U.S. Department  of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency where he was responsible for the  administration of Federal farm programs at the county, district, and  State level.   General Chastain has received numerous awards and decorations  throughout his career, including the Army Distinguished Service Medal,  the Legion of Merit, and the Bronze Star.   I thank General Chastain for his decades of service to our Nation,  and I wish him well in his new position with the U.S. Army.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention  to a bill that I will be introducing this week.   My legislation allows the Secretary of the Treasury to waive voting  authority for the international financial institutions on a case-by- case basis.   The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund receive U.S.  funding and are subject to legislative oversight, which often dictates  by a mandate what projects and policies they can endorse.   For example, when the World Bank takes a vote to approve a lending  project, the United States may have to abstain or vote against it due  to the parameters put forward by a mandate from Congress. Even further,  Congress keeps adding to the mandates and has never tried to streamline  them, resulting in mandates that are antiquated and can actually  conflict with one another.   As a result, the Financial Services Committee has increasingly come  to a bipartisan consensus that new mandates should have waiver  authority and sunset clauses.   This legislation would allow the Treasury Secretary to waive a  mandate and be able to properly vote on a financing, subject to a  written report as to why to Congress. This means more flexibility to  pursue our national interests, but also strong accountability to  Congress.                            ____________________
