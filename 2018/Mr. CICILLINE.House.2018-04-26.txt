 Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the en bloc amendment,  which includes my amendment to H.R. 4. I thank the chairman and ranking  member for their work on this important bill, as well as the inclusion  of a section that would require airlines to provide consumers with a  one-page description of their rights as passengers.   My amendment will amend this section to ensure that passengers are  notified of what compensation airlines provide--including rebooking  options, refunds, meals, and lodging--if a passenger's flight is  diverted.   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for  including this and for their efforts, and urge adoption of this very  pro-consumer amendment.    Mr. Speaker, almost 2 years ago, Presidential  candidate Donald Trump said: ``We are going to win so much, you are  going to get tired of winning.''   It has been 16 months since Republicans took control of the White  House and Congress, and the only people who are winning are the wealthy  and well connected. The rest of America is getting a raw deal.   The Republicans have failed to make healthcare more affordable. They  have failed to invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. They  failed to lower the cost of living for working families, and they  failed to drain the swamp. The rigged system that they promised to tear  down is now bigger and stronger than ever before. The wealthy and well  connected are making out like bandits while working people are asked to  sacrifice more and more each day.   It doesn't have to be this way. Democrats are offering a better deal:  a better deal to deliver better jobs, better wages for a better future;  a better deal to raise incomes, lower the cost of living, and make sure  the economy works for all Americans, not just those at the very top.   Let's give the American people a better deal than the raw deal they  are getting from the Republicans.  [[Page H3692]]                                ____________________
