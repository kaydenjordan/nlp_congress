 Mr. Chairman, I rise today because I know climate  change is real, and its impacts are already here. In New Jersey, we  know those impacts all too well.   Superstorm Sandy sent an unprecedented storm surge up the Hudson and  the Hackensack Rivers that destroyed homes, businesses, police  departments, and critical infrastructure that our neighbors are still  digging out of this day.   These once-in-a-generation storms have a human toll. In 2017, the  destruction and failed response to Hurricane Maria by the Trump  Administration led to over 3,000 Americans dying--3,000.   The time for waiting is over. We need to act right now. Climate  scientists are in universal agreement. Our planet is warming, and it  will continue to inflict catastrophic devastation.   Military and intelligence experts have warned it is a national  security threat. You are no longer going to educate Americans to hide  their head in the sand.   We need to work together, one nation, as an international community.    The goals some have set above have been called overly ambitious. You  bet they are ambitious. These are big problems, and Americans tackle  big problems with big solutions.   Supporting H.R. 9 would do just that. It shows the world the United  States is committed to the Paris Agreement, that we are serious about  setting targets for carbon emissions reductions.   This agreement is the bare minimum we can do to prevent against the  impacts of climate change.   We need to be serious about getting this right, that we are serious  about preserving the world for our people, for our children, like my  grandchildren and their grandchildren, Mr. Chairman, because that is  who this is about.
