 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for  bipartisan legislation to begin Puerto Rico's transition to statehood.   There are over 3 million U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico, and over 5  million individuals of Puerto Rican heritage in the States. My Florida  district is home to more Puerto Ricans than any other district in the  country.   I care deeply about Puerto Rico because my constituents care deeply  about Puerto Rico. But every Member of Congress should care about  Puerto Ricans because they are our fellow citizens. We are part of the  same American family.   Puerto Rico has been a territory for 120 years. Its residents are  treated unequally under key Federal laws. This impairs economic  progress and quality of life, spurring migration to the mainland. And  even though Puerto Ricans serve in the military with distinction, they  cannot vote for their President and Commander-in-Chief. They have no  Senators, and have only one nonvoting delegate in the House.   The hard truth is that Puerto Rico's lack of political power too  often makes it an afterthought in Washington, as the Federal  Government's poor response to Hurricane Maria made painfully clear.   I support statehood because I support equality. The people of Puerto  Rico deserve the same rights and responsibilities as their fellow  citizens in Florida and every other State.   Puerto Rico has earned its star on the American flag.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bipartisan amendment, which I  am proud to colead with Congressman Barr of Kentucky and Congresswoman  Sinema and Congressman Biggs of Arizona. This amendment would increase  funding for the National Guard Counterdrug Program by $3 million and  reduce funding for the operation and maintenance defense-wide account  by a corresponding amount.   If the amendment is adopted, the House will provide $200 million in  budget authority for the National Guard Counterdrug Program, which is  approximately the amount that the National Guard Bureau indicates it  can execute on an annual basis.   My colleagues and I offered this amendment for a simple reason. We  believe the National Guard Counterdrug Program is important, that it is  effective, and, therefore, that it should continue to receive robust  funding. This is  [[Page H5807]]  especially true in light of the opioid epidemic that is harming so many  communities and tearing apart so many families throughout this country,  including in my district in central Florida and in Mr. Barr's district  in central and eastern Kentucky.   Under the program, the National Guard Bureau distributes the money it  receives from Congress to the National Guards in the States and the  territories using a funding allocation model that examines the nature  and scope of the drug problem in each jurisdiction. With this funding,  National Guards may provide many different forms of authorized  assistance to law enforcement agencies and community-based  organizations, including analytical, reconnoissance, and training  support.   This program is effective because it is targeted and tailored. Each  State uses its funding in a way that reflects the drug interdiction  priorities of its Governors, the capability of its National Guard, and  the needs of its law enforcement partners at the Federal, State, and  local levels.   For example, the Florida National Guard receives about $10 million a  year under this program, which it uses to reduce the supply of and  demand for illegal drugs in the State. Since 2014, support provided by  the Florida National Guard has been instrumental in over 2,000 arrests  and the seizure of nearly $14 billion in illicit drugs, property, and  cash. National Guards in other States have their own success stories as  well.   In conclusion, I hope my colleagues will support this bipartisan  amendment, which is vital to our Nation's effort to disrupt and  dismantle drug trafficking organizations and to protect our communities  and our children from drug-related violence.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's  support for this amendment, and I would just reiterate my view that the  National Guard Counterdrug Program is important. I would respectfully  ask my colleagues to support this amendment, which will help ensure  this program is fairly funded.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
