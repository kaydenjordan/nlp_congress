 Mr. Speaker, today's sorry's sequel is as phony as the  original Republican tax sham. It comes from an administration for whom  truth is a stranger, clocked in, by one analysis, at 7\1/2\ lies, on  the average, per day. But even for such an administration, this bill is  based on a true whopper.   Here we have it from the Executive Office of the President telling us  as his official administration policy that for every American family,  the average household income will be increased by at least $4,000,  annually. Yet today, fewer than 5 percent of American families have  gotten a dime increase in their income as a result of this bill. Truly,  a giant whopper.   But like the promise that Mexico would pay for the wall, that drug  companies would bring down their prices, all we have is more  misrepresentation today.    Corporate giants who got giant tax breaks gave them back  to some of their shareholders and their CEOs, but they didn't increase  wages for workers or give more than a handful any compensation as a  result of this.   Now, here on election eve, we have a proposal where they are telling  the American taxpayers: We promise relief in seven years, which is what  this bill does. Families can't put off rising healthcare costs or their  other needs for seven years.   But there is one American family who does really well out of this  bill. It is the family of Donald J. Trump. They got a special provision  written into the bill that this proposal freezes into permanent law  that gives them a tax windfall, most likely of millions of dollars.   That is what this bill was all about: helping Donald Trump, his  cronies, and allies, not helping the American people.   The first tax bill was a hit-and-run job. With this second bill,  Republicans back up and run over working families again. Democrats need  to take the wheel and help Americans get some money in their own  wallet.
