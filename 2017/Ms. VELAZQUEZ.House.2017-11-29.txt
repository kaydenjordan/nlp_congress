 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of a man whose  heroic legacy must never be forgotten.   At a time when the stakes could not have been higher, Rabbi  Weissmandl risked everything to save the Jewish people of Slovakia from  the horrors of the Nazi regime. Forming an underground organization  called the Working Group, Weissmandl led an effort to bribe German  officials, ultimately succeeding to delay mass deportations.   We cannot emphasize enough the great personal risk Rabbi Weissmandl  took on. Had he bribed the wrong official or approached a Hitler  supporter, he would have been killed. Yet, despite that real danger, he  persevered and demonstrated an unyielding determination to stop the  slaughter of the innocent.   In 1945, Weissmandl reached the shores of America, ultimately  settling in New York. Even after the war, he worked to improve  Holocaust survivors' lives by establishing the first Yeshiva campus in  America.   Mr. Speaker, Rabbi Weissmandl is truly a hero. At great personal risk  during the darkest of times, he helped those who were desperate. It is  only appropriate we honor him with the highest civilian honor, a  Congressional Gold Medal.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to  Weissmandl's legacy by cosponsoring H.R. 2740.                            ____________________
