 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for  yielding and for the amazing example that she is in her leadership to  our entire Congress.   Madam Speaker, of particular concern to myself and many of my  constituents in south Jersey is the Democrats' attempt to stuff their  tax and spend reconciliation bill, or as I like to call it, the big,  bad bill, with massive expansions to the IRS.   In order to pay for this monstrosity of a bill, Democrats are looking  to hire more than 87,000 IRS agents. This army of auditors have the  singular goal of spying on private transactions of millions of  Americans and our small businesses.   And it isn't the ultra-rich that they are going to be going after.  With a threshold of only $10,000 a year, nearly every American who has  a job will be targeted. This is despicable at best and anti-American at  its worst.   Biden administration policies are already leading the way to rampant  inflation and to job shortages. The last thing the American people need  is to  [[Page H6841]]  worry that their daily transactions will become the target of the IRS.  Unsurprisingly, this policy received near unanimous support from House  Democrats, despite the widespread backlash it received from the  American public.   Madam Speaker, I implore the Senate to strip this dangerous provision  before it ever become laws.
