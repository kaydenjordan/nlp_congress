 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of Imam  Tahir Kukiqi, a public servant and community leader who continues to be  denied fair consideration in his immigration process.   This summer, Imam Tahir received notice that USCIS intends to deport  him from the country he has called home and raised his family for  years. The loss of Imam Tahir would be a blow, not only to Staten  Island, but to all of New York City and the United States. He has  dedicated his life to uniting diverse communities in solidarity and  common understanding.   He hosts interfaith dialogues with mosques, synagogues, churches, and  temples all across New York State. He serves as the first Muslim  chaplain to the New York City Police Department and has worked to build  relationships between the Muslim community and law enforcement.   He has lived a life of public service and represents the best of what  it  [[Page H8607]]  means to be an American. He has overcome incredible diversity already.  Imam Tahir survived the war in Kosovo and built a life for himself and  his son, Adem, right here in America. He lost his wife and Adem's  mother some years ago, and now Citizenship and Immigration Services has  threatened to take away Adem's father as well.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to sit idly by while this  wonderful man, this public servant, is removed from our country. I urge  them to join me in insisting that USCIS give Imam Tahir a fair hearing  and grant him authorization to remain in this country.   God bless Imam Tahir, and God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
