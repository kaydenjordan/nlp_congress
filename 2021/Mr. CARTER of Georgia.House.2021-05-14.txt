 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Paul Charles Grassey of Savannah, Georgia, who passed away on  April 11 at the age of 97.   Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Paul joined the U.S. Air Force  and was assigned as a pilot in the Eighth Air Force. He flew more than  a dozen combat missions as a B-24 pilot.   Paul's most treasured purpose was discovered when he became involved  with the building, growth, and development of the National Museum of  the Mighty Eighth Air Force in Pooler, Georgia. He had a passion for  sharing his stories about the courage and the sacrifice of the people  he served with.   He loved to sing, and he led us often in patriotic songs.   In January of 2020, Paul was awarded the French Legion of Honor for  his service and role in helping to free France from Nazi occupation  during World War II.   I am thankful for the immense impact that Paul Grassey had on our  community, and I know his legacy will remain. We will all miss him very  much. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
