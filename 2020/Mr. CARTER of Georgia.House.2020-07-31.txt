 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  students of Georgia's First Congressional District who recently  graduated.   Social distancing due to the coronavirus led to most graduations  being canceled, but there have been virtual, drive-through, and in- person ceremonies throughout the summer. I am especially thankful for  the hardworking school administrators and teachers across the First  District who have made sure students receive the recognition they so  richly deserve.   For example, Effingham County's school administrators went above and  beyond in their efforts. They allowed for 380 high school seniors at  Effingham County High School and 360 at South Effingham County High  School to participate in a drive-through graduation that gave seniors  the opportunity to drive through the campus and jump out of their cars,  to have their photos taken, and receive their diplomas.   Although students across the country have had to endure the many  challenges which have come with this national pandemic and have been  held back from high school and college traditions like graduation  ceremonies, their resilience and perseverance will promise them success  and a bright future.                            ____________________
