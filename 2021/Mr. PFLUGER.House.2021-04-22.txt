 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  unconstitutional measure.   Our Founders debated the merits of statehood and a Federal District  and rightly concluded that no State should have supremacy over others  and enjoy considerable benefits and influence of also being our  national headquarters.   Our Founders got it right. This measure gets it wrong.   If D.C. surrenders the special status of our Federal District and  instead becomes one of 51 equals, why should it enjoy all the benefits  of also being the Federal District? Perhaps Federal agencies like the  Department of Energy or USDA should move to places like west Texas,  where we actually produce food and fuel for the Nation and beyond.   Ambitions on the political left to expand the Supreme Court and U.S.  Senate seats, eliminate the filibuster, and keep three electoral votes  for occupants of the White House, all while controlling our election  law are about one thing: more power for them.   Oppose this unconstitutional measure.
