 Mr. Speaker, I received a letter recently from Paul  Rozinsky of Richardson, Texas. Paul is 81 and uses Medicare Advantage.  He has type 2 diabetes.   In his letter, he says that there are two identical versions of  insulin; one is  [[Page H3465]]  $140 and the other is $24.88, made on a special contract for Walmart.  Paul can't get access to the cheaper drug because it isn't on the  insurer's drug list.   He wrote to his insurer about an exception to his tiered pricing so  that he could qualify for the cheaper version. They rejected it with a  note, saying: ``We apologize for the inconvenience.''   That is unacceptable and far too common. In fact, one in four  patients with diabetes are rationing their insulin because of higher  costs.   We must do better for Paul and millions like him who need access to  cheaper medicines. This Congress must act and sign into legislation law  that lowers costs and simplifies the process so it is easy to use.   Access to healthcare shouldn't be a partisan issue. I call on my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together and get  something done this year to address the cost of prescription drugs.                            ____________________
