 Mr. Speaker, yesterday before the climate summit at the  U.N., tens of thousands of people marched.   I want them to know that some of us in this building hear you, we see  you, and we understand your demand for urgent action.   We have seen in my State the wildfires in California. We have seen  the flooding in New Hampshire and Vermont. We have seen the hottest  summers recorded, and we have seen the smoke-filled air.   We need this President to declare a climate emergency. We need to  stop the export of our oil to other countries.   We need to stop subsidizing fossil fuel companies. We need this  President to keep his promise of no new drilling on public lands. That  means no to the Willow project.   We need to stand with the UAW workers who are building EVs to make  sure they have a fair wage.   Thank you to Gen-Z for Change. Thank you to Sunrise. Thank you to  Climate Defiance. Thank you to all of the groups who are marching.                            ____________________
