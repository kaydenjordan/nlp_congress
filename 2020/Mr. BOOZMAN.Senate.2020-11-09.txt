 Madam President, I rise today to honor  Fayetteville Police Department Corporal Seay-Peter Floyd and Officer  Natalie Eucce for being awarded the Attorney General's Award for  Distinguished Service in Policing by the U.S. Department of Justice.   This is a well-deserved honor for their dedication, sacrifice, and  bravery they demonstrated on December 7, 2019, when a gunman, armed  with 100 rounds of ammunition, targeted law enforcement. Tragically,  Fayetteville Police Officer Stephen Carr was killed while sitting in a  patrol vehicle in the police station's parking lot. Corporal Floyd  courageously pursued the suspect and  [[Page S6624]]  fired in order to stop the assailant. Officer Eucce joined in the  pursuit and also fired her weapon. If not for their quick response,  there could have been other victims.   This prestigious award is given to State and local law enforcement  officers who personify excellence while protecting others. Only 23  members of the law enforcement community from across the country earned  this honor this year. Corporal Floyd and Officer Eucce are the first  Arkansans to receive this award.   Throughout their careers, Corporal Floyd and Officer Eucce have  responded to calls for help while not knowing what challenges they will  face. They are heroic public servants who courageously face danger head  on. It takes a special person to put their life on the line every day  to safeguard the public. Corporal Floyd and Officer Eucce represent the  men and women who make a difference in our communities. I applaud their  service and commitment to safety and the rule of law and congratulate  them for receiving the fourth annual Attorney General's Award for  Distinguished Service in Policing.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to congratulate the  Ozark Media Arts Festival on 10 years of success and recognize the  pathway it is creating from education to employment in the multimedia  industry in Arkansas and throughout the region.   More than 8,000 students have participated in OMAF, helping these  young minds make connections with others who have similar passions in  filmmaking, broadcast journalism, production, photography, and other  media platforms that keep citizens informed and entertained. The  festival allows participants to explore their interests and learn from  industry professionals on how to further develop their talents.   OMAF provides a venue for students to showcase their abilities, learn  new skills, and compete against the brightest up-and-comers in their  field of interest. The recognition that comes with earning the top spot  in the competitions hosted by the festival is certainly something to be  proud of, and the enthusiasm shared amongst all participants who put  their creativity on display is what continues to make the Ozark Media  Arts Festival a success and a place for students to foster  relationships that will help them transition their skills from an  educational setting to the communications industry.   The festival truly is investing in the future of the multimedia  industry in the region. It is a good one-stop-shop for high schoolers  to learn more about the programs offered at colleges and universities  and other programs where they can continue to hone their skills. Just  as importantly, it provides a valuable networking opportunity with  potential employers and demonstrates how they can turn their passion  into a future career.   It was a pleasure to participate in a virtual panel discussion for  the 2020 festival as educators, industry leaders, and policymakers and  talk about the importance of communication and how technology continues  to shape how we get information and stay connected with each other.   Congratulations to Ozark Media Arts Festival on a decade of  accomplishments and encouraging multimedia education and building  relationships to help future generations of communicators realize their  dream of a career in the multimedia industry.                            ____________________
