 Mr. Speaker, I am here this evening joined by  colleagues from the Foreign Affairs Committee to discuss President  Trump's extreme, proposed cuts to the International Affairs Budget.   The President's budget proposal would reduce funding for the State  Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, what we  know as USAID, by nearly a third. The proposal would reduce overall  funding for the International Affairs Budget by $17.4 billion, or 31  percent.   This would be a devastating reduction. U.S. diplomats and development  experts work to shape a freer, more secure, and more prosperous world  while advancing U.S. interests abroad. They build relationships with  foreign counterparts and resolve disputes to preserve peace and reduce  the need for military action.   They also provide critical services to U.S. citizens living and  working overseas and screen people seeking visas to visit the United  States. This work would all be compromised by the administration's  funding cuts. These cuts could also undercut President Trump's  purported priorities.   For example, these reductions could interrupt the Bureau of  Counterterrorism and Countering Violent Extremism and U.S. efforts to  disrupt money laundering and terror financing. Funding could be slashed  for nonproliferation, counternarcotics, and consular affairs--efforts  specifically focused on protecting Americans from foreign threats.   This work overseas is always important, but it is especially  necessary now in this tumultuous time, when the United States faces  complex challenges around the world:   In Asia, we see increased tensions in the South China Sea and an  increasingly hostile North Korea.   In Africa, there is a devastating famine in East Africa, brutal civil  wars, as well as terrorist organizations like Boko Haram and al- Shabaab.   The refugee crisis stemming from unrest in the Middle East continues,  and we have just seen reports of more gas attacks on the Syrian people.   In South America, the people of Colombia have experienced devastating  floods that claimed more than 270 lives, a breakdown in the rule of law  in the Northern Triangle, and a government in Venezuela that has become  an oppressive dictatorship.   Even in Western Europe, we continue to combat terrorist threats from  organizations like ISIS, who 2 weeks ago inspired the attack in London.   These are challenging times for our world that require a fully funded  International Affairs Budget. But America's unilateral diplomatic and  development work is just one piece of our engagement overseas.   Following World War II, the United States helped lead the creation of  several multilateral organizations to foster peace and stability in the  world like the United Nations, NATO, and the World Bank. With its  budget proposal and heated rhetoric, the Trump administration is  threatening that architecture of peace and stability.   For example, the President recommends cutting funding for  multilateral development banks by $650 million over 3 years and capping  United Nations peacekeeping contributions to 25 percent of total  funding. These decisions will have a significant destabilizing impact  on the global order. If America retreats from the international stage,  other powers, like China, will step in to fill that void and exert  their influence. We cannot afford for that to happen.   That is why my colleagues and I are here tonight, to speak out  against the shortsighted, dangerous budget proposal and emphasize the  importance of the United States' diplomatic and development work.  [[Page H2687]]    And with that, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires).    Mr. Speaker, I should have mentioned, of course,  that Congressman Sires is the ranking member on the Western Hemisphere  Subcommittee on the Foreign Affairs Committee. His experience in that  region in particular is vast.   I am glad that you mentioned that this is really part of a larger  theme and a larger concern, because President Trump, in addition to  proposing to cut a lot of funds for diplomacy and development around  the world, has also shown a real hostility towards other nations,  including some of our best allies and friends around the world, and  that is of great concern.   For example, this issue with Mexico which you brought up, forcing  Mexico to pay for the wall and constructing this wall along the 2,000- mile border that we have between the United States and Mexico and  cutting aid if necessary, which he has threatened to do if Mexico won't  pay for it, I have said very clearly that that creates an opportunity  for China to step in or the Chinese President Xi Jinping to go into  Latin America, go into Mexico and offer to give Mexico whatever Donald  Trump takes away. That would strengthen China's hand in yet another  region of the world.   Of course, China is a big economic competitor of the United States,  and I relate to my Texas folks because Texas does an incredible amount  of trade with Mexico, and we have been very fortunate over the years  that Mexico buys a lot of our stuff. They buy a lot of our goods. But  they don't have to just buy that stuff from Texas or the United States,  generally. They could go buy it from Brazil. They could buy it from  China or somewhere else.   So thank you for mentioning that.    It has been a very thorny issue, as you can  imagine, especially in Texas. Both Republicans and Democrats have  expressed deep concern about building a wall and spending $20 billion  to $30 billion to do it, and that concern, I think, has reached the  U.S. Congress. I think that is part of why you see a reluctance on the  part of the Senate, for example, to move forward with this in their  appropriations bill, in their budget.   I yield to our ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Engel for all  of his years of work on behalf of the Nation on the Foreign Affairs  Committee.   I know you may have a busy schedule this evening. We have got about  12 minutes left, so I thought we would just have a discussion on some  of these issues. Stick with us if you can.    Mr. Speaker, Congressman Engel mentioned  maintaining the United States' position as a leader in the world and  not ceding that to another country, whether it is China or Russia, who  has been very aggressive, and it is not just maintaining a strong  defense.   I represent what is known as Military City, USA: San Antonio, Texas.  Once upon a time we had five military bases in San Antonio. We still  have Joint Base San Antonio, which is a large operation. So it is not  just about a strong defense, which we all support, but also about the  hard work of diplomacy and development.   The United States, who has been a leader for so long, if we back away  from our commitments, then we not only cede it to somebody else, but  there is a good chance that a lot of that work is not going to get  done, that the peoples in many nations around the world are going to  become poorer, more desperate; and from that, only bad things can  happen both for those peoples, but also for the neighboring countries,  for the United States, and for the world.   Thank you for lending your strong voice to support for the diplomatic  budget.   I yield to the gentleman from New York.    No, absolutely. And Congressman Sires, you  recall that during those months, then-Candidate Trump talked about  backing away from NATO; about allowing Germany, for example, to handle  the issues between Russia and the Baltic States; about allowing or  really forcing Japan and South Korea to go it alone or to develop even  their own nuclear weapons to combat the threat of North Korea, to deal  with China's aggressiveness in the South China Sea.   So the more we go down that road, not only do we abandon those  nations who have been friends for so long and allies and supporters for  so long in keeping the peace, but we also, in the long run, threaten  our own security.   I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.    The gentleman mentioned the Northern Triangle  countries of Central America. Especially over the last few years,  thousands of women and children who are fleeing very desperate  situations there, not only extreme poverty, but the threats of violence  by drug gangs, for example, have come to the Texas-Mexico border  seeking asylum.   Congress did, over the last few years, essentially, pass assistance  for these nations. And we understood that, look, if you allocate $600  million to three countries, that is not going to solve all of their  problems. Nobody is under that illusion. But it can go a long way in  being the seed funds to start to turn these things around and these  nations around.    I yield to the gentleman from New York.    Congressman Engel, you mentioned Ebola, for  example. Dallas, Texas, was the first American city to confront the  challenge and  [[Page H2691]]  the problem of Ebola. So I couldn't agree with you more.   It should also be said that if you take away this aid and you have  people becoming more desperate in nations around the world, they do  become more susceptible to being employed by, for example, drug  cartels, or being lured by terrorist organizations because these folks  are desperate and need to survive. So these rogue alternatives become  more attractive to them.   So it is important to point out that a lot of this development and a  lot of this aid also prevents some of these things from happening.   I yield to the gentleman from New York.    Absolutely. I will give Mr. Sires the last word.  I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
