 Madam Speaker, I rise today to deliver a message from my  district. It is a message I have heard in my townhalls and from my  neighbors throughout Burlington and Ocean Counties: Healthcare costs  are too high, and we need to act now.   That is why I am proud to introduce the SAVE Act. This is bipartisan  legislation that would help States establish State-based exchanges that  would increase access and drive down costs.   These are solutions that we know work. States with State-based  exchanges have higher enrollment rates and more affordable coverage.   Right now, there are a number of States that haven't set up their own  exchanges. That is tens of millions of people, including millions of  people throughout New Jersey, who stand to benefit.   It is time to listen to our constituents and help them save. I hope  Members will join me in acting and moving this legislation forward.                            ____________________
