 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   (The remarks of Mr. Flake pertaining to the introduction of S. 195  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about this  Friday's March for Life. This Friday, the National Mall and Capitol  campus will again be filled with men and women from every corner of the  country. Together, they will gather in celebration of the sanctity of  life and in solidarity for its protection. For 43 straight years, the  March for Life has given a powerful platform for average people to join  in the political discourse to influence Federal policy in support of  life.   That emphasis on the ability of a single person to bring about  historic  [[Page S417]]  change is the theme of this year's march. Now, this year's march is  called the Power of One. The March for Life uses the following quote  from the author J.R.R. Tolkien to encapsulate this theme: ``Even the  smallest person can change the course of history.''   This is a powerful message that we should all embrace. It reminds us  that from the young people marching on a cold January morning to the  unborn children whose futures are filled with unlimited potential, any  one of them has the power to be a positive force for good.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Mr. President, I rise to speak of legislation I am  introducing today--the Transportation Investment Recalibration to  Equality Act, or the TIRE Act. The TIRE Act would suspend the Davis- Bacon prevailing wage requirement on all transportation-related  infrastructure contracts. This would free up billions more in taxpayer  dollars to be spent on jobs and on projects.   For those who are not familiar, Davis-Bacon is a Depression-era law  that requires contractors on Federal construction projects to pay  workers no less than the so-called local prevailing wage. Now, since  its enactment over 80 years ago, the Department of Labor has been  unable to devise an effective system for determining prevailing wages.   In fact, a 2004 Department of Labor inspector general report revealed  that Federal wage reporting surveys, which are a key metric used to  determine prevailing wages, are fundamentally flawed. Of all the wage  report surveys reviewed by the IG, 100 percent contained flaws. Let me  say that again: 100 percent of all the surveys were flawed.   In addition, some of the wage surveys have not been updated since the  1980s. The bottom line is that every time Davis-Bacon applies to a  Federal project, less money is going to construction and more money is  going to meet onerous wage requirements. According to the Beacon Hill  Institute, Davis-Bacon forces taxpayers to pay 22 percent above the  market rate for labor on Federal infrastructure projects.   This is largely the result of disproportionate union participation in  flawed wage surveys that skew Federal decisionmaking. Now, despite  representing only 4 percent of the construction industry, unions are  able to leverage their clout with Federal bureaucrats to inflate more  than 60 percent of prevailing wages--talk about benefitting a few at  the expense of the many.   Here is some perspective on what it means in real dollars. In 2016,  the Federal Government spent $23 billion on Federal construction  projects, and 2.1 billion of these dollars was spent on above-rate  labor costs.   Again, $2.1 billion of the $23 billion spent was on above-market-rate  labor costs. This means that nearly 10 percent of all Federal  construction spending last year went to inflated contracts. Not only  does this translate into less construction funding going to actual  construction, but according to George Mason University, it results in  roughly 30,000 lost construction jobs.   So we lose both on the projects and the jobs that are created. More  broadly, it discriminates against small businesses that don't have the  resources to meet onerous Federal reporting and compliance  requirements. Now, while it may be well-intentioned, Davis-Bacon ends  up eliminating decent-paying construction jobs and hampering  infrastructure spending.   I have often talked to State and local officials who will say that if  you have two bridges across the same river, even if they are just 100  yards or 200 yards or a mile apart with the same underlying costs--or  what should be the same underlying costs--if there are Federal moneys  involved in one and no Federal moneys involved in the other, the one  with Federal moneys will cost significantly more, and a big portion of  that is because of Davis-Bacon requirements.   Now, in this body, we have to look for issues to bridge the partisan  divide. It turns out that one of these issues is bridges, roads, dams,  and other infrastructure projects. Fixing our Nation's crumbling  infrastructure is a top priority for many in Congress, and the new  administration has touted a large infrastructure package as one of its  agenda items.   However, despite the bipartisan consensus on both ends of  Pennsylvania Avenue for infrastructure investment, visions for the road  ahead actually diverge. With a projected pricetag north of $800 billion  for highways and bridges alone, every Federal dollar needs to be spent  as efficiently as possible.   The TIRE Act will return wage determinations for Federal  transportation projects where they belong, and that is the market.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Cruz):   S. 201. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure  that new wind turbines located near certain military installations are  ineligible for the renewable electricity production credit and the  energy credit; to the Committee on Finance.
