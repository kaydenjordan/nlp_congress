Mr. President, this morning the majority leader announced  that the Senate will soon take up a revised version of the FIRST STEP  Act, which will provide a number of long-needed reforms to our criminal  justice system.   I have long been a supporter of these reforms after I saw the  positive impact in my home State of Texas back in 2007. Then, in  response to a steadily growing prison population, Texas began enacting  reforms to reduce recidivism through programs like job training and  vocational education. This, of course, allows prisoners to spend their  time in prison preparing themselves for life outside of prison. The  results were pretty significant. We saw a reduction in both  incarceration and crime rates by double digits at the same time. Let me  say that again. We saw a reduction in both incarceration and crime  rates by double digits at the same time. Not only does this lead to  massive savings of taxpayer dollars, it is an investment in the men and  women who are committed to turning their lives around.   What we like to say is that Texas has long been known for being tough  on crime. But in 2007, we finally decided to be smart on crime, too,  recognizing that people who went to prison almost entirely got out of  prison at some point. The question is, How prepared were those who were  willing to work to turn their lives around for life on the outside?   For years, I tried to bring this successful Texas model to  Washington, DC, and now we have a piece of this legislation before us  that will take these reforms nationwide. More than 75 percent of the  bill we will be voting on is my prison reform legislation that I  originally introduced with Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.   The great thing about the laboratories of democracy known as the  States is that we can actually test some of our theories at the State  level to see whether they work. In the case of prison reform, when they  do work, we can then scale it up so it applies to the entire Nation.   Today, there are more than 180,000 inmates in the Federal criminal  justice system. The Federal Bureau of Prison's budget has doubled to  approximately $7 billion over the last decade. We have an opportunity  to save lives by reducing the crime rate for each of those prisoners  who does not recidivate when they get out of prison and conserve tax  dollars, as well as to create a criminal justice system that works for,  not against, the American people.   Let me be clear. This is not about letting people out of prison who  shouldn't be let out of prison; this is about people who have served  their time and are going to be leaving prison and making sure that they  at least have available to them some of the tools they need in order to  transform their own lives. I am not so naive as to think that every  person will take advantage of that opportunity, but we know from  experience at the State level that there is a significant percentage of  offenders who will take advantage of the opportunity to turn their  lives around. That is why I was proud to work with the White House and  my colleagues here in Congress--especially, as I mentioned, Senator  Whitehouse and Congressman Doug Collins in the House of  Representatives--to advance these reforms.   Earlier this year, we passed the bill out of the House with strong  bipartisan support, and I have worked with my colleagues here in the  Senate as the bill has changed and developed--and, I believe, for the  better. Unfortunately, some members of the law enforcement community  have raised concerns about the bill. Out of my respect for our law  enforcement organizations, I spoke with many of my Republican  colleagues about the bill. Originally, they said they were unable to  support it or were undecided because they wanted to make sure we were  doing everything we could to address the concerns raised by law  enforcement organizations. So we went to work trying to make  improvements in the bill, which I believe we succeeded in doing.   I want to express my gratitude to Senator Durbin, who is the  principal Democratic sponsor, Senator Lee, Senator Grassley, and others  who worked on this and say how much I appreciate their willingness to  try to get to yes and come up with something we can pass with strong  bipartisan support.   I also wanted to make sure we talked to the stakeholders--the police  officers who patrol the streets, the sheriffs who work in each of our  States and counties--about their concerns. I believe we have worked  hard and successfully to address many of them. I don't necessarily  believe all of them will agree with every single piece in this bill,  but I think, on the whole, it does balance the interests of our law  enforcement personnel with the needs of our society to better prepare  people so that when they come out of prison, they will not likely  repeat their mistakes, in every case that is possible.   As I say, I think we made some big improvements. The revised  legislation will keep dangerous and violent criminals who use guns to  commit crimes from being released from prison early. They will not be  eligible for any sort of earned time release. It will also limit the  amount of time that offenders can spend on supervised release and  ensure that the Bureau of Prisons will revoke prerelease custody for  offenders who violate the terms of their supervision.   I appreciate all of the work of our colleagues in the Senate who  chose to  [[Page S7417]]  roll up their sleeves and get to work rather than just complain about  what was or was not in the bill. I am proud to announce that I will  cosponsor this new and improved version of the bill, and I encourage  all of my colleagues to review it and hopefully join me in supporting  this legislation. I look forward to working with everybody in this  body, as well as our colleagues in the House, to get this bill over the  finish line.   I know, when we produce the bill in the House and the Senate,  President Trump will sign it. He has encouraged the majority leader,  Senator McConnell, to put this bill on the floor even in this short  window of time we have during the lameduck session, and the majority  leader has accommodated the President's request by saying that we will  address this before we go home for Christmas                            Funding the Government    Mr. President, on another matter, the clock is ticking, of course,  and we are quickly approaching the deadline to fund the Federal  Government. My Republican colleagues and I stand ready to advance our  remaining appropriations bills, but it really depends on what our  Democratic colleagues decide to do.   Seventy-five percent of the government is already funded through  bipartisan cooperation on the passage of appropriations bills, and that  is something we haven't done for a long time. But there is still  critical funding--particularly for the Department of Homeland Security,  for the FBI, and for the Department of Justice--that needs to be taken  care of before we break for the holidays.   Earlier today, we know that Democratic Leader Senator Schumer and  Minority Leader Pelosi met with President Trump to figure out whether  there is any room for agreement to resolve the dispute between them.  The question is, really, What is the appropriate amount of money in  this bill to fund border security? The President said he wants $5  billion. Senator Schumer has said $1.6 billion ought to be enough.  Obviously, there is a gap between them.   Some people have said: Well, we ought to just shut down the  government over this dispute. I don't see the wisdom in that because  when you shut down the government because you are unable to resolve a  dispute, when you reopen the government, usually what happens is that  same problem is staring you in the face. What we need to do is to work  together with the administration to come up with a solution rather than  resort to tactics like a government shutdown with all the complications  that involves. I don't think shutdowns play well for either Republicans  or Democrats, for the White House or the Congress.   The problem, it seems to me, is that our Democratic friends are  listening to some of the fringes of their own political party who are  now telling them: Don't do anything that President Trump wants.  Anything President Trump wants, the answer is no.   Well, that is more about politics than it is about doing our job as  legislators trying to solve problems.   It also appears that they seem to think that the continued status quo  along our border is good enough, and they are more than willing to  gamble with a partial government shutdown than work with the President  to ensure that our border is secure.   Somewhere along the way, our friends across the aisle have forgotten  that border security should be about protecting the American people  from the drugs that come across the border--90-plus percent of the  heroin consumed in the United States comes from Mexico--or the children  and women who are trafficked for sex or the migrants who come from  Central America, up through Mexico, and into the United States, and the  cartels charging roughly $8,000 a person. It is a huge moneymaking  business, but the people who are getting rich are the transnational  criminal organizations and drug cartels.   We have seen before what happens when the government shuts down. It  affects millions of people across the country and often yields no  different result. We have seen what happens when we fail to secure the  border. That is why we need to finish our work funding the government  and, by doing that, also recognize the importance of a secure border.  This should not be about partisan politics or listening to your  political base; this ought to be about doing our job. We had the  midterm elections; now is the time to govern.   Just a few weeks ago, our friends across the aisle wanted to magnify  the migrant crisis by focusing narrowly on the news coming out of  Tijuana, Mexico, across the border from San Diego. Some talked about  the crisis as if it were a one-off event, an isolated event.   They wanted us to look at this like we were looking through a soda  straw and ignore all of the context and the consequences of failing to  secure our border. They wanted to ignore how we find ourselves with  this humanitarian crisis in the first place.   The caravans of men, women, and children who left their homes in  Central America and made the long, dangerous journey to the United  States are sadly symptoms of a far greater problem. Our border has been  exploited for years, contributing to this crisis. That is why ensuring  additional resources for border security is an essential piece of the  puzzle.   My home State of Texas is on the frontline--1,200 miles of common  border with Mexico. Texas is home to many vibrant border communities  that greatly benefit from having some of the busiest land ports in the  country, across which legitimate trade and commerce travels. As I said,  we are also on the front row of the many challenges that come along  with an unsecured border when it comes to public safety.   Yesterday I talked about some of those challenges: striking a balance  between a secure border and a completely closed border. A secure border  maintains the flow of legitimate goods and services while deterring  cartels from shuttling illegal contraband across our borders. A closed  border would cut off trade and commerce that is the lifeblood of our  economy, which brings me to another challenge--something that I think  in Washington there is simply not enough awareness of; that is, the  cartels, gangs, and the transnational criminal organizations that get  rich exploiting our porous borders.   Some like to think of these organizations as a ``them, not us''  problem because they have taken control over large parts of Central  America and even Mexico, but the business of these groups does not stay  there. What happens in Central America, what happens in Mexico does not  stay in Central America and Mexico. It comes flooding across our  borders.   These gangs and cartels are very shrewd and adapt to changing  circumstances. They found, the more our borders and ports of entry are  clogged with migrants and migrant families, the easier it is to traffic  people, drugs, and contraband into the United States. That has a  reciprocal effect, too, causing legitimate trade, travel, and commerce  to slow significantly at our ports of entry.   It is not only exploitation of our border that poses a threat, it is  the violence and the instability caused by the cartels and gangs. That  makes it not just a border security issue but a national security issue  as well.   My friend and fellow Texan, Representative Henry Cuellar--a true blue  dog Democrat, as he says--has a great saying for how we should think  about this. He likes to say that border security starts in Central  America and ends at our border. I think that is exactly right. In other  words, you don't mount a goal line defense at a football game. You  actually start contesting the game farther down the field. In this  case, the game needs to be contested in the places where these migrants  and the drugs emanate, from where they start.   We are going to have to work more closely in partnership with Mexico  and other Central American governments to address the violence these  groups spread by restoring public trust in law enforcement and  stabilizing the economy and these countries.   I spoke with my friend, the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein.  She represents a border State. She and I have partnered on a number of  national security law enforcement matters. She said she was interested  in working together in a bipartisan way to address the challenges  presented by Central America and Mexico. I said: Absolutely. Sign me  up.   Representing a border State, as you might suspect, I make it a point  to talk to those who live and work in our  [[Page S7418]]  border communities. It is a unique part of the United States. I like to  say, the concept that people in Washington, DC, have about the borders  has been learned from movies and novels; it is not from talking to  people or visiting with the communities along the border. That is not a  criticism. That is just a fact of life.   When I hear from people like Manny Padilla, who is the Border  Patrol's sector chief for the Rio Grande Valley, I can better  understand how much is required to maintain situational awareness and  operational control of the border, not to mention personal safety of  the Border Patrol, who more and more are frequently assaulted with  rocks and other makeshift weapons that endanger their safety and their  lives.   For those who may not be at the border every day, it is hard to grasp  the range of topography across the 1,200-mile border that Texas shares  with Mexico. It can be hard to imagine how many resources are actually  needed. In some places, there are high mountains and cliffs and others,  there is thick brush. In the urban areas that surround our ports of  entry, there is plenty of opportunity to race across the border and  blend in, never to be heard from again.   There will be places where physical infrastructure will make the most  sense. In some places, technology or personnel is more effective than a  fence. The point is, the border security is complex. Better enforcement  of our border will require a combination of infrastructure, technology,  and personnel. That begins with ensuring we have the resources we need  to implement a border enforcement strategy. That is what this issue is  all about--the discussion Ms. Pelosi, Senator Schumer, and President  Trump had today.   My question for our Democratic colleagues is, Why will you not help  us secure the border? Are you satisfied with the status quo of drugs  coming across the border through these transnational criminal  organizations? Are you satisfied with the status quo of these  caravans--thousands of migrants from Central America trying to storm  our ports of entry and literally closing them down so legitimate trade  and commerce cannot occur?   Securing our border and protecting our country should not be a  partisan issue; it is something we ought to be able to work out and  agree on. We know the challenges our friend Senator Schumer has--the  Democratic leader on the other side. He has a cadre of people  auditioning for the Presidential nomination in 2020, and they are  trying to outdo each other in their impending runs for President. I  think, in many ways, his hands are tied. Like every leader, he has to  decide when to say yes and when to say no to the people in your  conference.   Minority Leader Pelosi has a delicate task of trying to cajole her  new and emboldened Members of the far-left wing of her caucus. They are  both trying to fend off outside groups that think that even talking to  President Trump on this issue may mean it will be subject for the next  attack or perhaps a primary campaign. I don't envy the spot they are  in, but it is a game of political chicken, and they are playing it  among themselves.   The reality is, President Trump is in the White House, and our  Democratic colleagues need to work with him and us to try to move the  country forward, to try solve these problems, as hard as they may be.  The American people are the losers when their elected officials decide  their political image and their political aspirations matter more than  the people they represent in their respective States.   As I said, so far, the Congress has worked together in a bipartisan  manner to pass roughly 75 percent of the government funding. We  shouldn't let that bipartisan spirit fail us now. Finishing our work  and securing our border shouldn't be an occasion to turn the end of the  year into a political sideshow. I think the American people do not need  any more sideshows and circuses in Washington, DC. They want results,  and they want us to own up to our responsibility and do our duty.   Border security is an issue where we should be able to find common  ground, and funding the government is, of course, one of our most basic  responsibilities. The point should be made that we have already found  common ground on many of these issues before. Several of our colleagues  on the other side who are still serving in this Chamber, including  Senator Schumer, supported passage of the Secure Fence Act in 2006. How  that is different from what President Trump is requesting now is lost  on me, when they agreed that 700 miles of border should be secured by a  fence.   I should also note that the Secure Fence Act was also supported by  then-Senators Obama, Biden, and Clinton. This should not be a partisan  issue. I hope all of our colleagues will choose to get to work, roll up  our sleeves, and do our duty. Not only do we have the chance to fund  the government and keep the lights on but we also have a chance to put  ourselves that much closer to a secure border and helping end the  migrant crisis.   I yield the floor.
