 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  oppose the previous question.   If we defeat the previous question, Republicans will amend the rule  to include the repeal of the medical device tax.   The medical device tax takes effect on January 1, 2020, unless  Congress acts. Time is of the essence. Yet, my friends across the aisle  continue to waste our time and energy and, more importantly, clock time  that we need to stop this tax from going into effect.   This is a bipartisan bill with 253 of us cosponsoring it. All I am  asking is that the 253 cosponsors get an opportunity before this  expires to say stop this, stop the wheels from grinding. Let's do  something that counts for our fellow Americans, for senior citizens who  are the recipients of a lot of these medical device implants.   It brings quality of life. Oftentimes, it brings the extension of  very important quality of life to seniors. It is less time in  hospitals. It has been proven--back up on people's feet to engage back  in the workforce and their part of the American Dream.   Instead of having nothing happening in a bipartisan way, as our  fellow Americans are watching what is happening in this House, if 253  of us agree on this today, we can stop this onerous tax. We can stop  costing healthcare and the exorbitant amount of increases sent back  down to all of our constituents.   This is a big deal in the State of Indiana, where I come from. What  we do in the State of Indiana with 300 medical device manufacturing  companies supporting nearly 55,000 good-paying jobs--nationally, the  industry directly employs over half a million people.                                time  1315    It is no understatement to say that thousands of jobs are at stake if  the medical device tax comes back in 26 days. When the tax was in  effect for the 3 years of 2012 to 2015, industry lost almost 30,000  jobs nationwide, according to government data.   Madam Speaker, we should be focusing on important, urgent, bipartisan  issues like this. We can do something together to make our constituents  and to make our Nation better.  [[Page H9271]]    I urge my colleagues to support this important bill. Twenty-six days  to go. We can work together. Over 250 of us are cosponsoring this  legislation.   I ask, on behalf of every citizen, everybody working in the medical  device industry, and for the sake of our own economy, let's do  something that makes sense for this country.
