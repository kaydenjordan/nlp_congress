 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my first Mental Health  Monday.   There are 731,000 adults in Oregon who have a mental health  condition. These 731,000 of our friends, neighbors, colleagues, and  family members are struggling, and we in Congress have an obligation to  find solutions to their struggles.   That is why I am dedicating my Mondays to mental health. For too  long, we have allowed stigma to shame people into silence, and that  silence has cost lives. It is my hope that, by raising awareness, we  can make strides in care, treatment, and recovery for those struggling  with their mental health.   Today is also the first Monday of Black History Month, so I would be  remiss not to acknowledge the troubling disparity in mental health care  for the Black community. Lack of access to culturally responsive care  makes treatment inaccessible to too many Black and Brown individuals.  Congress must work to bridge that gap.   Mr. Speaker, I hope you will join me for future Mental Health Mondays  as we work to break new ground on this very important issue.                            ____________________
