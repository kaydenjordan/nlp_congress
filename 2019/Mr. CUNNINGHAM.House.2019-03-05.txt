 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 1381,  the Burn Pit Registry Enhancement Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Representative Raul Ruiz and  Representative Brad Wenstrup, for all their hard work on this bill and  for their leadership as co-chairs of the Bipartisan Congressional Burn  Pits Caucus.    As the Members of this body are aware, one of the many perils our men  and women in uniform face overseas is the threat of toxic exposure from  burn pits. To dispose of their waste, servicemembers in Iraq and  Afghanistan tossed every variety of waste into massive pits to be set  on fire, not knowing the harmful chemicals they were likely breathing  in as a result.   Even today, we still do not fully understand all the risks associated  with exposure to burn pits. That is why Congress established a  voluntary registry for veterans who served in the vicinity of burn pits  to document their experience and to learn more about ongoing studies.   The data from this registry further enables doctors and the VA to  better study the health impacts of burn pit exposure and to develop  lifesaving treatments.   H.R. 1381 would strengthen this registry by allowing the families of  deceased veterans to update the registry with the veterans' causes of  death. This added data will give medical researchers a more complete  picture of the effects of toxic burn pit exposures and bring us closer  to giving veterans the answers and the treatment that they deserve.   As a member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased  to support H.R. 1381, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to pass this commonsense and pragmatic bipartisan bill.
