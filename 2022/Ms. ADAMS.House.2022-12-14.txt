 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two outstanding North  Carolinians and my colleagues retiring from the U.S. House of  Representatives, the Honorable G. K. Butterfield for 18 years of  service and the Honorable   David Price for 34 years. These gentlemen  have given a total of 52 years of service to our State and Nation for  which we are indeed grateful.   True statesmen, Representatives Butterfield and Price have been  invaluable Members of Congress and they have served with incredible  distinction. They are well-respected, admired, loved by colleagues here  in Congress, and revered by citizens back home. They each have made  their life's work all about service.   Having known each of them for a very long time, I have appreciated  the opportunity to learn from them and to work with each of them in  North Carolina and here in Congress. Service has been their legacy as  it is the rent we pay for living on this Earth.   Together, these incredible Members have kept their rent fully paid up  throughout their careers and in North Carolina and in this Congress.   Both scholars and men of enormous intellect, Price and Butterfield  have been leaders in their communities, and they have used their  expertise on and off Capitol Hill to interrupt injustice and ignorance.  [[Page H9737]]    Our resident historian, G. K. Butterfield, who served on the Energy  and Commerce Committee, worked as a civil rights lawyer, a trial judge,  a superior court judge, and served in the North Carolina Supreme Court.   Retired teacher and distinguished professor,   David Price, led  numerous congressional missions abroad during his three decades on the  Hill, and he has been influential in his committee work on the  Appropriations Committee.   Both have been personal mentors and friends to me, and impactful  advisers who I will truly miss.   I thank Congressman Price and Congressman Butterfield for their  friendship and for their service. I wish them and their families  Godspeed as they retire and take on the next chapter in their lives.   God bless you. Please know that our Nation is much better off, and  you have certainly made it much better than you found it. God bless  you.                            ____________________
