 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to  Organize Act of 2019.   Big Labor is in a panic over plummeting union membership. Union  bosses could self-correct and increase transparency and accountability  to serve workers better, or dedicate more resources to union  organizing, rather than attempting to organize less than one-tenth of 1  percent of eligible employees, as they did in 2018.   Instead, the largest federation of labor unions in America spends  more than three times as much money on political activities as it does  on its stated purpose of organizing and representing workers. And they  are resorting to their usual arm-twisting and intimidation tactics by  demanding Democrats pass the PRO Act.   Before I get into the many, many failings of this bill, I want to  correct the Democrats' false narrative that the decline in union  membership is hurting workers.   Americans are benefiting from a booming economy, thanks to Republican  tax and regulatory reforms. Despite Democrats' false claims, wages are  rising fastest for lower- and middle-income workers. Unemployment is at  a 50-year low, and millions of jobs have been created since President  Trump took office.   In fact, millions of poor Americans continue to move into the middle  class, and millions in the middle class are moving into the ranks of  the wealthy. The substantial economic mobility many Americans are  experiencing should be celebrated.   Instead, Democrats are trying to claim falsely that the economy isn't  working for average Americans, and the only way to fix it is to expand  enforced unionism through coercive, socialist schemes like the PRO Act.   Let's also remember that Federal law already protects the rights of  employees to organize, and Republicans respect that right. Any reforms  to U.S. labor laws should help workers, not union bosses.   The PRO Act will require employers to hand over workers' private,  personal information to union organizers, without workers having any  say in the matter. This would make it even easier for union organizers  to target, harass and intimidate workers.   It would also overturn all State right-to-work laws. These are laws  that allow workers to decide for themselves whether to join a union and  pay dues. If the PRO Act becomes law, workers will be forced to take  money from their paychecks and give it to labor unions, even if they  don't want to be represented by a union.   This provision is astonishing since we know that from 2010 to 2018,  unions spent $1.6 billion in members' dues on hundreds of left-wing  groups, without first receiving consent from workers to do so.   The PRO Act will also undermine workers' rights to vote by secret  ballot. This is hypocrisy at its worst, or best. House Democrats elect  their own leaders by secret ballot, and Democrats held up the USMCA  trade deal to guarantee workers in Mexico had the right to a secret  ballot. Yet, they are willing to deprive American workers of that same  protection.   Among the PRO Act's most harmful provisions is the incorporation of  California's newly-enacted, overly broad, and confusing definition of  employee, which will deprive millions of Americans of the opportunity  to work independently and start their own businesses.   Bottom line, there are over 50 harmful provisions in this bill that  are bad for workers, job creators, and the U.S. economy.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H880]]                                     time  1545     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker).

Mr. Chair, I have to say that saying that  this is the most antiworker President ever in the country is just  pretty far off the mark. And we are, on our side of the aisle, I  believe, the most proworker people in the Congress.   American workers have the right to organize, and Republicans support  that right. This bill is not needed to protect those rights.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, among the PRO Act's most harmful provisions is the ABC  test to determine employee status. Like many of the Democrats' worst  ideas, the ABC test was enacted in California in a law known as AB5 and  is already causing pain since going into effect on January 1 of this  year.   Last week, hundreds rallied to repeal the law. One worker said: ``I  worked years to gain my skill as an American Sign Language interpreter.  It was my goal since I was 9 years old. After AB5, I lost all three of  my agencies. The dream I worked for is lost. I can't provide for my  family, and thousands of California deaf won't be serviced.''  [[Page H891]]    One artistic director at last week's rally summed it up for the Chico  Enterprise-Record: ``We are not stupid. We do not need to be saved from  ourselves. We can negotiate our own contracts. AB5 is insulting.''   Mr. Chair, this is the reaction of California workers who are being  harmed by a section that will be in this piece of legislation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Chair, for nearly 80 years, Federal labor law has struck a  careful balance among the rights of employers, employees, and unions,  resulting in a growing economy and greater prosperity. But the  Democrats are seeking to upend that balance and radically tilt the  playing field in favor of unions and against workers and small  businesses.   We now have additional proof about the motivations of House Democrats  for advancing this radical special interest legislation. It comes from  Democrats' most feared, Big Labor union boss, Richard Trumka, President  of the AFL-CIO, who said the following yesterday:         Those who would oppose, delay, or derail this legislation,       do not ask us, do not ask the labor movement for a dollar or       a door knock. We won't be coming.    That truly says it all. The PRO Act is all about serving the  interests of union bosses at the expense of workers and business  owners.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the PRO  Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is little more than an attempt to  protect the few well-connected interests that received a carveout from  the California Democrats' disastrous Assembly Bill 5, but it is a fig  leaf meant to provide cover for vulnerable Democrat Members.   AB-5 redefined California's wage and hour laws to expand the  definition of ``employee'' using the same language found in the PRO  Act, but with dozens of industries exempted from the onerous standard  that has placed tens of thousands of jobs at risk.   If the PRO Act becomes law, workers could find themselves in a  confusing scenario where they are classified differently under State  wage and hour law and Federal labor law.   Democrats will draw a distinction between Federal labor relations law  and State wage and labor laws, but, in reality, the distinction means  little to businesses that will be hit with costly new and confusing  employment regulations and to the workers whose jobs are put at risk as  a result.                                time  1700    Moreover, once all workers are deemed employees for collective  bargaining purposes, as required by the PRO Act, they will become  subject to union organizing. Once unionized, the collective bargaining  agreement would govern their wages and benefits, even if State law  still considers them an independent contractor.   Essentially, if unions have their way, this fig leaf amendment will  accomplish nothing in the way of preserving a worker's independent  contractor status under State law.   The only winners in this scheme will be the unions and trial lawyers,  whom Democrats always seem to find a way to benefit, no matter the  issue.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   It is very interesting that our colleagues have talked about unions  providing the middle class better jobs and benefits. It is very  interesting to look at the declining rate of union membership and see  the increasing salaries, number of jobs being created in the  [[Page H899]]  country, benefits, and all positive things happening, record  unemployment, record wage increases. That is going along with declining  union participation.   Mr. Chairman, the PRO Act is one of the most antiworker, anti-small  business bills to be considered by Congress in decades, and this  amendment makes it worse.   The PRO Act is a liberal Democrat wish list designed to enrich and  empower union bosses and trial lawyers at the expense of rank-and-file  workers and small businesses.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to defeat this misleading,  unworkable, and misguided amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, Americans have a reasonable  expectation of privacy. In the modern economy, this means deciding for  themselves whether to share their personal information.   At an Education and Labor Committee hearing on this bill last year,  AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka testified that unions need workers'  personal information so that they can solicit them anyplace you can get  them, including at their home.   As we know from previous testimony, these are not always friendly  visits. In many instances, they are intended to exert pressure on  workers to support the union.   The PRO Act requires that business owners provide employees' home  addresses, home phone numbers, cell phone numbers, personal email  address, and more to union bosses, which will promote union harassment  of employees at home or in public. This is outrageous and unacceptable.   Moreover, there are no safeguards for how workers' personal  information might be used or misused. For one, the information could be  used by unions for unwanted political campaigning, solicitation, or  worse. The PRO Act contains no protections or restrictions on how this  information will be used and no repercussions if unions allow it to  fall into the wrong hands.   We have seen countless examples of private companies and government  agencies subjected to hacks and leaks that allow private, personal  information to fall into the wrong hands. The last thing American  workers need is for self-interested union bosses to have that  information and for hackers and scammers to gain access as well.   Many Members of Congress know firsthand the risks associated with  having their personal information distributed. My amendment provides  basic privacy protections to the workers we represent so that, while  they are free to organize together, they are just as free to protect  their valuable personal information.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Chair, my amendment addresses just one radical component of the  PRO Act by preserving workers' privacy, ensuring that they can protect  their own personal information and decide for themselves whether they  wish to share it with the union.   Importantly, the amendment does not restrict unions from receiving  any information at all; rather, the workers can decide for themselves  which one piece of contact information they wish to share. And the  union is free to gather the rest directly from workers without the  employer acting as a middleman.   Like with every other provision of the PRO Act, Democrats claim that  invading workers' privacy is about leveling the playing field; but,  time and again, polling has shown that workers prefer choice, privacy,  and control within the unions that claim to represent them.   The PRO Act is an affront to all of these basic concepts, none of its  provisions more so than the requirement that employers share employees'  personal information with union organizers against the employees' will.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this commonsense  amendment that will put workers, not union bosses, in control of their  own private, personal information, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   This amendment is designed to short-circuit the union election  process drastically by micromanaging the National Labor Relations  Board.   The goal of this amendment is to rush the election process in order  to deprive workers of the opportunity to weigh the pros and cons of  unionization, and employers of the adequate time to prepare for union  election.   Rushing union elections simply tilts the playing field against both  workers, who deserve the benefit of hearing both sides, and  businessowners who should have the right to make their case to their  workforce about unionization.   Unions often begin organizing campaigns weeks, or even months, before  employers are made aware, creating a scenario in which workers are  hearing only one side of the issue prior to a union election.   When an election petition is filed, employers, and particularly small  employers, must seek counsel and attempt to understand complex matters  of labor law within an unreasonably short time period. This amendment  seeks to impose an unfair and unnecessary ambush election scheme  through a change in the law.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Chairman, the PRO Act is one of the most antiworker and antismall  business bills to be considered by Congress in decades. It is a liberal  Democrat wish list designed to enrich and empower union bosses and  trial lawyers at the expense of rank-and-file workers and small  businesses, and this amendment makes it worse.   The largest federation of unions in America spends more than three  times as much money on politics as it does on its stated purpose of  organizing and representing workers. And unions attempted to organize  less than one-tenth of 1 percent of eligible workers in 2018, so it  should come as no surprise that union membership in the United States  is plummeting.   Yet, rather than correct their own wrongdoing and increase their  ranks by serving workers better, unions are demanding that Congress  enact this sweeping, radical bill that tilts the playing field  aggressively in their favor, against workers and small businesses.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this antiworker, pro-union boss  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   This amendment is a weak attempt to lend lip service to employee  privacy, but it fails to reduce the PRO Act's invasion of workers'  personal lives. Simply because this amendment says the bill shall not  be construed to affect employee privacy does not make it so.   This amendment will not affect the PRO Act's mandate forcing  employers to share employees' home addresses, home phone numbers, cell  phone numbers, personal email addresses, and more with union organizers  without giving workers any say in the matter or ensuring that their  personal information is protected.   The PRO Act's provision is an invasion of privacy, and empty rhetoric  in this fig leaf amendment does nothing to fix this harmful mandate.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Chairman, the PRO Act is one of the most antiworker and anti- small business bills to be considered by Congress in decades. It is a  liberal Democrat wish list designed to enrich and empower union bosses  and trial lawyers at the expense of rank-and-file workers in small  businesses, and this amendment does nothing to change that.   My colleagues keep saying that the Trump administration is supporting  many bad rules put in place in 2014; however, that is misleading. The  administration has not completed its work on modifying or changing  some of those rules.    Unions attempted to organize less than one-tenth of 1 percent of  eligible workers in 2018, so it should come as no surprise that union  membership in the United States is plummeting. Yet, rather than correct  their own wrongdoing and increase their ranks by serving workers better  or going out and actually doing the job that unions are supposed to do,  unions are demanding that Congress enact this sweeping, radical bill  that tilts the playing field aggressively in their favor against  workers and small businesses.  [[Page H903]]    This amendment does nothing to lessen the harm this bill will inflict  on American workers in the form of violating their privacy, providing  their personal information to union organizers without allowing workers  the choice to refuse.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   The biggest problem with our Federal labor laws today is inadequate  protection of workers' rights within the labor organizations that  represent them. This amendment would make that problem worse. Workers  should not be forced into a union with which they do not wish to  associate.   The existing process for workers to remove a union is too limited and  burdensome as it is. Workers face tremendous one-sided barriers to a  decertification election that they do not face in a certification  election.   Worse, more than 90 percent of workers represented by a union today  have never voted for that union to represent them.   Let me repeat that. More than 90 percent of workers represented by a  union  [[Page H905]]  today have never voted for that union to represent them.   Democrats oppose legislation that would allow workers to vote  periodically on the union in their workplace, and this amendment would  make it even more difficult for workers to have an opportunity to vote,  even after clearing all of the existing unnecessary hurdles.   This amendment would make the PRO Act even more antiworker than it  already is.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Chairman, union membership is plummeting because American workers  have realized that they don't need the unions. We are seeing such a  prosperous economy. And as I said, union membership declining is  correlated with the fact that our economy is booming for the middle  class.   The PRO Act, Mr. Chairman, is one of the most antiworker and anti- small business bills to be considered by Congress in decades. It is a  liberal Democrat wish list designed to enrich and empower union bosses  and trial lawyers at the expense of rank-and-file workers and small  businesses.   The largest federation of unions in America spends more than three  times as much money on politics as it does on its stated purpose of  organizing and representing workers.   With this bill, the unions are trying to take a shortcut. They have  decided it is better to just focus on getting Democrats to do their  work for them.   Unions attempted to organize less than one-tenth of 1 percent of  eligible workers in 2018, so it should come as no surprise that union  membership in the United States is plummeting, along with the great  economy that we have.   Yet, rather than correct their own wrongdoing and increase their  ranks by serving workers better, unions are demanding their allies in  Congress enact this sweeping, radical bill that includes over 50  harmful provisions, including those which eliminate workers' privacy,  forces workers to pay a labor union against their will, subjects  workers and small businesses to direct union harassment, and will kill  thousands of small businesses and good-paying jobs.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this antiworker, pro-union  boss amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.   The Acting Chair. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   This amendment will open Pandora's box. Sectoral bargaining which  would apply a single one-size-fits-all contract to every employee in  every business across a particular industry in the United States would  be an unmitigated disaster for American small businesses. It would rob  small business owners and workers alike of the freedom to negotiate  their own contracts.   Every business is different. One-size-fits-all union contracts  applied across an entire industry throughout the United States would  saddle small businesses with labor and employment costs that do not  work for their particular business and that they may not be able to  afford.   Similarly, employees would be forced to accept wages, benefits, and  other terms and conditions of employment that they had no say in  determining, and that may not work for their individual situations.                                time  1815    Collective bargaining agreements already force workers into one-size- fits-all contracts, but currently, in the United States, they are at  least confined within the walls of one business at a time.   Sectoral bargaining is a flawed and economically stifling policy used  in other countries, and one we should not be importing into the United  States. It would likely expand union contracts to hundreds of thousands  of additional employees, to the detriment of every worker hoping for  more individualized wages and benefits.   The absence of sectoral bargaining has allowed America's spirit of  freedom and innovation to drive unrivaled economic growth and  prosperity. Congress should not entertain importing the socialist  method of collective bargaining from other countries. Look at our  economy, especially compared to socialist European economies. It is  booming; they are stagnant.   The United States Congress does not need to import the worst economic  ideas from other countries with weaker economies, but socialist  Democrats insist on doing so. Sectoral bargaining is one such proposal  that we should not entertain.   Madam Chairman, I have seen some interesting amendments in my time in  the Congress, in this Chamber, but I have to say, this is the most  bizarre amendment that I believe I have ever seen. I urge my colleagues  to defeat the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment, although I plan to vote in favor of the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment is little  more than a recognition from the Democrats that the PRO Act is truly a  union boss wish list that strips rights away from workers, increases  the coercive power of union bosses, and will make union corruption like  we are seeing at the United Auto Workers Union even likelier.   It is ironic that Democrats have chosen to offer whistleblower  protection for illegal union activities as an amendment to the PRO Act  after years of opposing more transparency and accountability for union  leaders when the Republicans were in the majority.   Last Congress, Congressman Francis Rooney offered not one, but two  bills with whistleblower protections for union corruption. Both bills  had zero Democrat cosponsors. This attempt to provide Democrat Members  with a talking point is too little too late and does nothing to address  the PRO Act's overwhelming problems.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, Democrats bemoan that  plummeting union membership does not reflect workers' actual opinion of  unions. But NLRB decisions and so-called conservative attacks are not  the reason workers have voluntarily chosen to leave unions behind.   Democrats and their friends in Big Labor refuse to acknowledge that  millions of workers are simply disenchanted with union representation  and that union leaders have lost the trust of their members.   We need not look any further than the ongoing corruption scandal at  United Auto Workers in which several high-ranking union officials have  already been convicted of a litany of crimes, including embezzlement,  misuse of workers' union dues on lavish personal expenses, money  laundering, tax fraud, and accepting bribes in violation of Federal  labor law.   Two former UAW vice presidents have been charged. The last two UAW  presidents have been formally implicated in a racketeering scheme of  more than $1.5 million, and the current UAW president is under  investigation for receiving bribes and kickbacks.    The UAW is now at risk of being placed under Federal oversight under  the Racketeering Influence and Corruption Organization Act, or RICO.  That is why I have sent not one, not two, but three letters requesting  a public hearing by the Committee on Education and Labor to examine  this widening corruption scandal.   It should come as no surprise that the UAW, long one of the largest  unions in the country and a major benefactor of the Democrat party,  lost 35,000 members in 2018, and the overall union membership fell  again in 2019 to just 6.2 percent.   Rather than increase transparency and accountability to serve workers  better, over the past decade unions successfully lobbied the Obama  administration to roll back transparency requirements and are now  calling on their political allies in Congress to pass the radical,  coercive H.R. 2474 as a bailout.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Democrats believe one-size-fits-all union contracts are good for  workers in the modern economy and that forcing these workers to pay  hundreds of dollars per year to left-wing political organizations is  the only way to guarantee wage growth, combat inequality, and  strengthen the middle class. But the last 3 years and beyond have made  clear that nothing could be further from the truth.   Wages are not stagnant, and to claim they are is a blatant lie. Wages  have grown by 3 percent each of the last 2 years. Moreover, the Federal  Reserve Bank of Atlanta reported the pay for the bottom 25 percent of  workers rose 4.5 percent from a year earlier, compared to 2.9 percent  for the top 25 percent, meaning wages are rising faster for rank-and- file workers than for their bosses.   Over the first 3 years of the Trump presidency, wages for the bottom  10 percent of earners over age 25 rose an average of 5.9 percent per  year compared to 2.4 percent during President Obama's second term.  Wages for the middle two quartiles have also grown faster under  President Trump than during President Obama's second term.   Overall, the typical American household earns over $1,000 more per  month today, adjusted for inflation, than it did in 1975. The union  membership rate today is less than half of what it was in 1975.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I believe that I am in  opposition, do I not have the right to close?    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time  I have remaining?    Madam Chair, I am prepared to close, and  I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, the PRO Act is one of the most antiworker and anti-small  business bills to be considered by Congress in decades, and this  amendment does not change that.   The PRO Act is a liberal Democrat wish list designed to enrich and  empower union bosses and trial lawyers at the expense of rank-and-file  workers and small businesses.   While I will support the amendment by the gentlewoman from Texas, we  will still oppose the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, despite my affection for the gentleman offering it.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Chair, while this amendment appears to make arbitrary changes  to union election procedures, make no mistake: It is part of Democrats'  and union bosses' ongoing efforts to rush the union election process at  the expense of American workers by requiring that National Labor  Relation Board, NLRB, regional directors transmit the notice of  election at the same time as the direction of election.   This amendment should actually be called the ambush elections  amendment, as it would worsen the already harmful impacts of the Obama  NLRB's ambush election rule, which shortened the timeline for union  elections from a median of 38 days to as few as 11 days.   This amendment would reduce the timeline even more, increasing the  unfair advantage for labor unions that the Obama NLRB created and which  the PRO Act makes Federal law.   The unfairly condensed timeline required by this amendment--in which  employers are expected to obtain counsel, understand complex matters of  labor law, and effectively communicate with their employees--infringes  on an employer's right to due process and is antithetical to the NLRB's  promise of a fair and robust election process.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1900     Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Americans continue to enjoy substantial economic mobility, despite  Democrat claims that the decline in union membership has led to a  permanent upper class. Millions of poor Americans continue to move into  the middle class and millions in the middle class are moving into the  ranks of the wealthy, a group heavily criticized by the Democrats'  class-warfare politics.   In inflation-adjusted 2018 dollars, from 1967 to 2018, the portion of  U.S. households earning less than $35,000 a year fell by 25 percent.   The portion earning between $35,000 and $100,000, the middle class,  fell by 22 percent, from 53.8 percent to 41 percent of the country. But  it did not fall because the middle class is worse off.   The ranks of the poor and middle class are shrinking as the ranks of  the wealthy and upper middle class are growing. From 1967 to 2018, the  portion of U.S. households making more than $100,000 rose from 9  percent to more than 30 percent of the country.   In 1967, nearly 25 percent of workers belonged to a union. In 2018,  that number was just 10.5 percent. That means that while the union  membership rate fell by more than half, the share of American  households earning six-figure incomes--that is more than 100,000--more  than tripled.   And, yes, contrary to another popular Democrat claim, throughout most  of the country, these wage gains are outpacing the cost of living.   No one can argue with this good news, yet, in an attempt to score  political points and bail out their allies in Big Labor, Democrats  claim that the economy isn't working for the poor and the middle class.   As lawmakers, we can always do more to increase opportunities for  people to achieve the American Dream. But to suggest the economy isn't  working for average Americans, and the way to fix it is to expand  forced unionism through coercive socialist schemes like H.R. 2474, is  flatly untrue.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Madam Chair, again, I really respect my colleague from California,  and he knows that.   However, it is not the unions who have created the middle class in  this country. What has created the middle class in this country is  freedom, the capitalistic society, the rule of law, our Judeo-Christian  beliefs. We are the most prosperous, most successful country in the  world, and it is because of those things.   Did unions help at one time? Yes, they did. But they have outgrown  their usefulness. We don't need to force unionism on the American  people. We need to preserve their freedom and do everything that we  can. That is what grows this country and makes it great.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment imposes yet  another unnecessary and harmful requirement on employers as they  prepare for a union election; and this new mandate will be imposed on  business owners who will have already lost numerous employer rights  because of other provisions in the PRO Act.   During the Obama administration, the National Labor Relations Board  drastically changed its union election procedures, adding dozens of new  requirements and restrictions on employers in an effort to short- circuit the union election process and increase union membership.   On top of this, the PRO Act makes over 50 changes to existing labor  law, adding a litany of burdensome constraints that will harm  employers, particularly small employers who do not have infinite time  and resources to respond to a union organizing drive.   Unions often begin organizing campaigns weeks, or even months before  employers are made aware; creating a scenario in which workers are only  hearing one side of the issue prior to a union election.   When an election petition is filed, employers have only a few days to  prepare their case, depriving them of their rights to due process and  all parties of their right to a fair and robust election process. This  amendment would further burden employers and tilt the playing field in  favor of union bosses.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Democrats insist that the PRO Act expands workers' rights. But, in  reality, this bill coerces workers and undermines their rights in order  to increase the wealth and power of union bosses. Unions have a long  and sordid history of harassing and intimidating workers into  supporting them, and this bill makes it worse.   For example, in 2013, Ms. Marlene Felter, a medical records coder in  California, testified that union organizers ``were calling them on  their cell phones, coming to their homes, stalking them, harassing them  . . . to convince them to sign union cards.''   In 2017, one Minnesota personal care attendant, who chose not to  provide her full name, described her experience with an SEIU union  organizer for a Forbes.com piece: ``The woman identified herself as a  SEIU representative,  [[Page H917]]  and asked if they could talk for a few minutes. Holly said she didn't  have time right now, but the woman persisted, placing herself between  Holly and the front of the door and repeatedly asking her how she  intended to vote in the upcoming union election.   ``Holly became frightened; arms full of groceries, she could hear her  patient becoming agitated and distressed inside, and here was this  strange woman blocking her way and demanding to know how she would  `vote.' Holly finally extricated herself and entered her home, slamming  the door behind her. But that wasn't the end of things. Over the next  weeks and months, she received multiple calls and visits from the  union.''                                time  1915    The author of the piece asked Holly how she would characterize the  nature of these calls and visits. ``Stalking, absolutely,'' said Holly.  ``They wouldn't leave me alone.''   Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, testified before our  committee in May 2019 that unions need workers' personal information  because ``it is essential in order to be able to communicate with them.  . . . You may have to meet with them at a grocery store, anyplace else  where you can get them. The most efficient place and the best place for  them to be able to talk is in their home setting, at their home, so  that you can have a real conversation with them.''   The PRO Act's own supporters admit unions will harass workers at  their own homes, at work, and at the grocery store, yet Democrats claim  this bill expands and protects workers' rights.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment and ``no'' on  the underlying bill.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment    Madam Chair, again, I have respect for  the gentlewoman on this, but I have to respectfully oppose this  amendment, which is intended to tilt the playing field even further  against workers and in favor of union bosses, more so than the  underlying bill already does.   By requiring union elections to be held as early as practicable,  union bosses will have an unfair advantage because it deprives workers  of adequate opportunity to hear from their employer about potential  risks of unionization.   The PRO Act codifies the Obama NLRB's ambush election rule, which  shortened the time before a union election takes place from a median of  38 days to as few as 11 days. This amendment would further reduce that  time, increasing union bosses' advantage.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   My colleague and I agree that workers should be protected. There is  absolutely no disagreement between Democrats and Republicans on that,  but we believe that the existing law is sufficient both for protecting  the right to organize as well as protecting workers.   Democrats bemoan attacks on the right to organize, but the right to  organize has not changed in more than 70 years. Unions have simply  abandoned their stated purpose of organizing workers and are trying to  take a shortcut through the Congress.   NLRB data shows that the number of representation petitions filed by  unions with the NLRB fell from 5,000 in 1997 to fewer than 1,600 in  fiscal year 2018, the fewest in over 75 years. Let me repeat that. The  number of representation petitions filed by unions with the NLRB fell  from 5,000 in 1997 to fewer than 1,600 in fiscal year 2018, the fewest  in over 75 years.   In fiscal year 2018, there were more than 110 million private-sector  employees available for organizing under the National Labor Relations  Act, but the number of employees who actually petitioned for union  representation was just 73,000. That means that unions sought to  represent less than one one-tenth of 1 percent of potential new  [[Page H918]]  members in this country in fiscal year 2018, yet Democrats blame  falling unionization on conservatives.   This lack of attention to organizing is reflected in unions'  financial priorities, as well, and not just by UAW leaders spending  workers' dues on cigar parties and golf. The AFL-CIO's 2018-2019 budget  dedicated less than one-tenth of the budget to organizing efforts.  The largest portion of the budget, more than 35 percent, was dedicated  to political activities.    In addition to spending massive sums on political activities, unions  also generously spent workers' dues, money intended for collective  bargaining representation, to advance political causes. From 2010  through 2018, unions sent more than $1.6 billion in union dues to  hundreds of leftwing advocacy organizations, including Planned  Parenthood, the Progressive Democrats of America, and the Center for  American Progress.   Much of this spending came amidst a Presidential cycle in which more  than 40 percent of union households voted for the Republican Donald J.  Trump for President, yet Democrats blame conservatives for plummeting  union membership. That is not the problem.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   This amendment changes nothing about the underlying bill and the pain  it will inflict on American workers and businesses. It is simply  another weak attempt to pay lip service to address one of the many  glaring flaws in the PRO Act.   The National Labor Relations Act, NLRA, already applies to nearly  every business in the country, and the PRO Act's harmful provisions  will also. This amendment does nothing to protect small business  entrepreneurs and independent contractors.   If adopted, small businesses will still be saddled with new costs and  mandates. They will still be forced to turn their employees' private  information over to union organizers. They will still be subject to  completely unrestricted union harassment even if they aren't the  subject of a union organizing campaign. They will still have their  rights throughout that process completely obliterated.   Independent contractors will still be at risk of being classified as  employees under the bill's onerous ABC test. The NLRA's existing  jurisdictional standards do not change that reality. The ABC test is  not about whether independent contractors are businesses covered by the  NLRA but, rather, whether they are employees covered by the act.   This amendment does nothing to change the fact that millions of  independent contractors will be classified as employees against their  will and, as a result, will have their livelihoods put at risk by  socialist Democrats in Washington.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1930     Madam Chair, I enter into the Record the  Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 2474.                     Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 2474--Protecting the Right to Organize Act--Rep. Scott, D-VA, and                               218 cosponsors         The Administration opposes H.R. 2474, the Protecting the       Right to Organize Act. The Administration supports the rights       of workers to freely join a union. In fact, under President       Trump, on average over 250,000 more Americans are members of       a private-sector union than under President Obama. This       growth has been driven, in part, by the tremendous strength       of the Trump economy. The Administration is willing to work       with Congress to strengthen protections for union members.       Unfortunately, H.R. 2474 contains provisions that would kill       jobs, violate workers' privacy, restrict freedom of       association, and roll back the Administration's successful       deregulatory agenda.        H.R. 2474 would hurt workers in several ways. First, the       bill would kill jobs and destroy the gig economy. It appears       to cut and paste the core provisions of California's       controversial AB 5, which severely restricts self-employment.       AB 5 is actively threatening the existence of both the       franchise business sector and the gig economy in California.       It would be a serious mistake for Congress to impose this       flawed job-killing policy on the entire country.       Additionally, H.R. 2474's job-killing effects could be even       greater, as it would empower third-party arbitrators to       impose collective bargaining agreements. Involuntary       contracts that do not work for employees or their employers       could force layoffs or even bankruptcies--ultimately, harming       workers.        Second, H.R. 2474 would violate workers' privacy. It would       require companies to give union organizers their employees'       home addresses, personal phone numbers, and personal e-mail       addresses, and it also would allow unions to bypass secret-      ballot elections. Secret ballots protect workers from both       employer and union coercion, and the Administration believes       voting privacy should be protected.        Third, H.R. 2474 would also restrict workers' freedom of       association. It abolishes State right-to-work laws, and would       thereby make union dues compulsory nationwide. Additionally,       the bill would legalize ``secondary boycotts,'' which       Congress previously banned because they pressure workers to       join a particular union. And it would rush union elections,       depriving employees of time to make a considered choice. The       Administration is willing to discuss legislation clarifying       that unions do not need to represent workers who do not pay       dues. But it believes that workers' decisions to join and       support a union should be the product of choice, not       compulsion.        Finally, by imposing unnecessary and costly burdens on       American businesses, this bill would take the country in       precisely the opposite direction from the President's       successful deregulatory agenda, which has produced rising       blue-collar wages and record low unemployment. For example,       by expansively defining joint employer liability, the bill       would discourage investment and job creation and reduce       opportunities for workers.        If H.R. 2474 were presented to the President in its current       form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it.     Madam Chair, I would like to quote from a  part of the Statement of Administration Policy.   ``The administration opposes H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to  Organize Act. The administration supports the rights of workers to  freely join a union. In fact, under President Trump, on average, over  250,000 more Americans are members of a private-sector union than under  President Obama. This growth has been driven, in part, by the  tremendous strength of the Trump economy. The administration is willing  to work with Congress to strengthen protections for union members.  Unfortunately, H.R. 2474 contains provisions that would kill jobs,  violate workers' privacy, restrict freedom of association, and roll  back the administration's successful deregulatory agenda.''   ``Finally, by imposing unnecessary and costly burdens on American  businesses, this bill would take the country in precisely the opposite  direction from the President's successful deregulatory agenda, which  has produced rising blue-collar wages and record low unemployment.''   Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment, I oppose the underlying bill.  We need to keep this economy doing very well, and we need not to  support this piece of legislation which is unfair to American workers,  unfair to businesses, unfair to the American taxpayers.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment and a ``no'' vote  on the  [[Page H920]]  underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
