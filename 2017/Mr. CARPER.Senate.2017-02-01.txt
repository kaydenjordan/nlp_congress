 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this effort under  the Congressional Review Act to block implementation of the stream  protection rule.   CRA offers Congress an important tool, as we know, to consider  potentially egregious rules that are promulgated usually at the end of  Presidential terms. The stream protection rule, which we are  considering this evening, is not one of those.   I live in a State--Delaware--whose citizens can be adversely affected  by the upstream actions of others and border States whose citizens  could be compromised by the things we do.   I take it as a matter of faith that we should treat other people the  way we want to be treated. We call that the Golden Rule, and I know  that not everyone shares my passion for the Golden Rule, even though it  appears not just in my faith, those who happen to be Catholic or  Protestant, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist--it appears in all faiths,  the idea that we ought to treat other people the way we want to be  treated.   I also believe the Federal Government should act to protect citizens  from the harm of the actions that other citizens would do to them. This  stream protection rule is, I believe, one of those actions.   I am a native West Virginian. I was born in Beckley, WV, a coal  mining town in South Central West Virginia. I understand well the role  coal mining has played in supporting families in my native State and  communities there for longer than any of us can personally remember.   I also know that mining operations have had a devastating impact on  the lives of those who have endured compromised drinking water and  destroyed natural habitat, with a loss of the fish and wildlife that  define the fabric of my native State and all other States.   This rule has been a long time coming, as we have heard this evening.  Indeed, we are living with rules governing mining conduct that go back,  I believe, as far as 30 years. It is time for an upgrade, and I think  the rule before us is a sound, responsible, and carefully developed  answer to that need.   In what is becoming an art form in this country, there are myths-- some call them alternative facts--that are swirling around this rule.  As ranking member and the senior Democrat on the Environment and Public  Works Committee, I want to address a couple of them.   Some would attack this rule's provisions as redundant and  inconsistent with State obligations under the Clean Water Act. I am  also a former Governor and am keenly aware of the problems of  inefficient governance and avoided at all costs conflicts between State  agencies. It wasn't always easy, but we didn't need Federal actions to  compound those frictions. I am happy to say that the drafters of this  rule heard those concerns, and this rule promotes collaboration and  coordination between mining and environmental agencies and clarifies  their roles, preserving their authorities under the surface mining and  clean water laws.   Both the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers concurred with the final  rules, and in doing so, EPA said: ``We have concluded that nothing in  the Stream Protection Rule is inconsistent with the provisions of the  Clean Water Act and that the final rule does not inhibit the EPA's  Clean Water Act authority to require that surface mining activities  comply with all applicable provisions of the Clean Water Act,  particularly those provisions related to water quality.''   The EPA goes on to say: ``The final Stream Protection Rule  incorporates measures to limit duplication and avoid inconsistency in  the implementation of Surface Mining and Reclamation Act and Clean  Water Act programs, while supporting complementary, comprehensive, and  effective environmental reviews of proposed surface coal mining  operations.''   Some would say that the stream protection rule allows the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service to veto Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act  permits. That is not true. It is true that section 7 of the Endangered  Species Act does require the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and  Enforcement of the Department of the Interior to consult with the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service if any action ``may affect'' listed  terrestrial and freshwater species.   The stream protection rule allows permit applicants and regulatory  authorities to achieve ESA compliance in a variety of ways but does not  provide the Fish and Wildlife Service any veto authority over permits.  Indeed, this past year, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and  Enforcement and the Fish and Wildlife Service completed consultation  under the Endangered Species Act, resulting in what is known as the  2016 Biological Opinion. This new Biological Opinion smooths the way  for more efficient Endangered Species Act compliance, while providing  important protections to industry and State regulators regarding  possible impacts of mining operations on protected species.   I think it is important to note that if we kill this rule, that  protection for industry and State regulators will go away. Let me  repeat that. I think it is important to note that if we kill this rule,  that protection for industry and State regulators will go away, and  those players will have to resort to a more cumbersome case-by-case  review under the Endangered Species Act for all activities that might  affect protected species. That would be a shame for a struggling  industry.   For those and a host of other reasons my colleagues will offer today,  I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution.   I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield back my time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Georgia.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch
