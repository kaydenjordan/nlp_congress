 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to once again provide the Little Shell  Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana with the overdue Federal  recognition that they deserve.   The Little Shell Tribe began petitioning the Federal Government for  recognition in the 1930s, over 80 years ago.   Last year, the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians Restoration Act  passed this Chamber unanimously. It was the first time that a bill  providing Federal recognition to the Little Shell Tribe passed either  the House or the Senate. Following the passage in the House, however,  the uncontroversial bill hit a roadblock in the Senate.   Today, we again take up their worthy cause as we pass this bill.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop  for their continued support.   This Congress should provide the Little Shell Tribe with the Federal  recognition it deserves, particularly after its eight decades of  dedicated efforts. Hopefully, my colleagues in the Senate will  recognize the importance of this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill.
