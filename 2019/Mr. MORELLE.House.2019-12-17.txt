 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 765 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 765         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       1158) to authorize cyber incident response teams at the       Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, with       the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House,       without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered       by the chair of the Committee on Appropriations or her       designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment with       an amendment consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       116-43. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be       considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 1865)       to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint a coin in       commemoration of the opening of the National Law Enforcement       Museum in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes,       with the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the       House, without intervention of any point of order, a motion       offered by the chair of the Committee on Appropriations or       her designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment       with an amendment consisting of the text of Rules Committee       Print 116-44 modified by the amendment printed in the report       of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. The       Senate amendment and the motion shall be considered as read.       The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided       and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of       the Committee on Appropriations. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption       without intervening motion or demand for division of the       question.        Sec. 3.  The chair of the Committee on Appropriations may       insert in the Congressional Record not later than December       17, 2019, such material as she may deem explanatory of the       Senate amendments and the motions specified in the first two       sections of this resolution.        Sec. 4.  House Resolution 761 is hereby adopted.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.   Mr. Speaker, I would just take a moment, if I may, to thank the  gentleman from Oklahoma, the distinguished Mr. Cole. When I came to  Washington, I hoped to meet people who were professional, thoughtful,  dedicated, not only to this institution but to this country, and I am  grateful for his leadership and for his friendship.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 765, providing for consideration of  the Senate amendment to H.R. 1158, and the Senate amendment to H.R.  1865, which will fund the Federal Government through the fiscal year  2020.   For each measure, the rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee  on Appropriations. The rule also self-executes a manager's amendment  from Chairwoman Lowey to H.R. 1865.   The rule provides the chair of the Appropriations Committee with the  authority to insert into the Congressional Record such material as she  may deem explanatory of both Senate amendments not later than December  17, 2019.   Lastly, the rule adopts H. Res. 761, a bipartisan resolution that  permits individuals to be admitted to the Hall of the House in order to  obtain footage of the House in session for inclusion in the orientation  film to be shown to visitors at the Capitol Visitor Center.   Mr. Speaker, these two spending bills provide funding for the  entirety of government operations through the remainder of fiscal year  2020.   I am proud that Members of Congress from across the Nation have come  together to reach this bipartisan consensus, even in areas where we  disagree.   This deal provides certainty for millions of American families and  businesses that are all fearful of a government shutdown. It also  represents a tremendous investment in working families, our economy,  and our national security.   These bills provide protections for our representative democracy with  $425 million in support for election security to the various States and  $7.6 billion for the approaching 2020 census.   These appropriations also invest in our children's future, with  record funding for Head Start and Child Care & Development Block  Grants, as well as strong investments in nutrition assistance for  children and those in need.   We are also investing billions of dollars in renewable energy  alternatives, environmental protection, and conservation to work toward  a healthier planet for our children and our grandchildren.   We are providing a record level of investment in the health of every  American, including more than $41 billion for the National Institutes  of Health.   And, for the first time in more than 20 years, we have provided  research funding to address a major threat to public health: the gun  violence epidemic. This package includes $25 million for our public  health experts at the Centers for Disease Control and the National  Institutes of Health for firearm injury and mortality prevention  research.   It also provides $1.5 billion in investment in State-level response  to the opioid epidemic.   These measures fund community health centers through May 22 of next  year, ensuring they can continue their vital work across the Nation  while Congress works toward a long-term extension.   In addition to all this, these bills also include bipartisan measures  to provide additional mental health services, low-income home energy  assistance, increase the age to buy tobacco to 21 nationwide, increase  competition in the prescription drug market, and more.   As the representative for Rochester, New York, I am grateful for  Congress' ongoing, strong bipartisan support of $565 million for the  Inertial Confinement Fusion program, including at least $80 million for  the University of Rochester's Laboratory for Laser Energetics, or LLE,  which is located in my district.   This funding will allow the LLE to continue to cement its place as a  world-class institution and leader in cutting-edge scientific research.   Mr. Speaker, with these successes in mind, I am proud to speak in  support of this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me  in supporting its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, there is a saying in Albany when things go  on for a while that everything has been said but not by everybody.  Apparently, maybe everything has been said, and apparently, everybody  doesn't feel the need to weigh in.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my friend, the late, great Governor of New York, Mario  Cuomo, once said, ``We campaign in poetry and govern in prose,'' and I  think he foresaw days like today when we come together in the spirit of  compromise to accomplish great things for our communities and for the  country.   I want to thank my colleagues for their support and Mr. Cole's  support of both Consolidated Appropriations Acts, and I especially  thank Chairwoman Lowey, Ranking Member Granger, and all of the Members  on the Appropriations Committee, including the distinguished gentleman  from Oklahoma, for their tireless work in reaching this bipartisan  compromise.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote on  the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 765         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to consideration in the House of the bill       (H.R. 1869) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to       restore incentives for investments in qualified improvement       property. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking minority       member of the Committee on Ways and Means; and (2) one motion       to recommit.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1869.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
