 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor the  life of my friend, Pastor David Baker of Belton, Missouri.   On November 29, Pastor Baker went to be with the Lord--a loss for us,  but a gain for Heaven.   This last August marked his 39th year as senior pastor of the First  Baptist Church of Belton, Missouri, and 37 years from his founding of  Heartland Christian Schools. Through these two ministries, more than  6,000 people accepted Christ and over 2,000 people were baptized; truly  remarkable.   Mr. Speaker, Pastor David Baker had a tremendous impact on countless  lives and was a leader in the community. He was respected for his  knowledge as a Bible scholar, his kind heart, his love for others, and  his willingness to share what God's Word says about the issues of the  day. He was not afraid to take a stand for what is right and good,  which is refreshing in today's world.   Most of all, Pastor David Baker was a wonderful husband and ministry  partner to his wife, Claire, and a loving father to his three  children--Brian, Brett, and Brooke--and to his nine grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, Pastor Baker will be deeply missed, but I know his  legacy will live on in the thousands of lives he touched and influenced  for eternity. I am thankful for his friendship through the years and I  am grateful for the positive impact he made on our community and this  Nation.                      Honoring the Life of Ron Ditzfeld     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Mr. Ron Ditzfeld, a beloved business leader, philanthropist, and a  true pillar in the Sedalia community.   Ron Ditzfeld was born and raised in Sedalia, Missouri. His parents,  Jon and Bernice, founded Ditzfeld Transfer, Incorporated, in 1960, with  two straight trucks. In 1968, Ron Ditzfeld and his brother, Donnie,  began working for the family business. In 1996, Ron took over as the  President of Ditzfeld Transfer, Inc. Today, Ditzfeld Transfer, Inc.,  has more than 80 employees and provides trucking services, bus  transportation, container services across the United States, trash  pickup services, and provides warehouse and distribution services.   Ron also served two years in the U.S. Army at Fort Bragg in North  Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, Ron was not only a beacon in the business community, he  also was very active in the community serving on the board of several  organizations, such as the State Fair Community College Foundation, CHS  Cooperative Workshop, and Sedalia Airport.   His civic involvement includes the State Fair Foundation, the  Economic Development Sedalia-Pettis County, Daum Museum of Contemporary  Art at State Fair Community College, Sacred Heart Foundation, Child  Safe of Central Missouri, Sedalia Bomber baseball, JROTC, and local/ national disaster relief efforts.   Ron was dedicated to his community and he lent a hand whenever he  could. Ron was even known to drive the Smith-Cotton High School JROTC  and Team SCREAM robotics team to national competitions through Ditzfeld  Transfer, Inc.'s charter services.   Ron will be dearly missed by his friends, family, and community.  Please join me in honoring Ron Ditzfeld, whose legacy will continue to  impact countless lives for many generations to come.                       Honoring the Life of Hope Lecci     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember the  life of Hope Lecci, a dedicated reporter at the Sedalia Democrat, who  passed away just days from writing the news articles about the passing  of community leader, Ron Ditzfeld.   Hope began her career, not as a journalist, but as a teacher of  English and history at Smithton School District, where she influenced  countless students and future leaders, including our current State  representative, Brad Pollitt.   Mr. Speaker, Hope was respected and revered by all who knew her. She  was professional, kind, and loving to those around her, dedicated to  her family and her faith. I enjoyed getting to know her and interacting  with her as a journalist. She was always fair and dedicated to ensuring  every quote was accurate and the topic was thoroughly covered. I am  sorry she will no longer be covering news in the area, but I know she  is rejoicing and receiving her heavenly reward.   Mr. Speaker, may her example inspire all of us to be our best in our  professions and in our interactions with others.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference  report to accompany H.R. 6395, the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.   I am grateful that this bill bears the name of a public servant who  has fought tirelessly throughout his 26 years in Congress for our men  and women in uniform, and whose steadfast and wise leadership has made  such a difference. This legislation is a fitting tribute to his  enduring legacy.   As ranking member of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, I  am pleased this conference agreement builds on the progress we have  made in rebuilding military readiness after years of deferred  modernization.   Through targeted oversight, this agreement will set the right  conditions to ensure needed capabilities required for the national  defense strategy and credible deterrence are delivered in a timely  manner to maintain our competitive edge against Russia and China.   A few examples of these critical capabilities include funding for 12  F-15EX aircraft; an additional $1.2 billion for  [[Page H6923]]  F-35 Joint Strike Fighters for a total of 93 F-35 aircraft; funding for  24 F-18 Super Hornets to include an additional $28 million for advance  procurement; strong support for the Army's identified big six  modernization priorities, such as future vertical lift and long-range  precision fires; an additional $104 million for Army Ammunition Plant  modernization; and an additional $150 million for National Guard and  Reserve Component Equipment modernization.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to, again, thank Ranking Member  Thornberry for his leadership, thank Chairman Adam Smith for his  steadfast and fair handling of the committee and this vital bill, and  thank our subcommittee chairman,   Donald Norcross, for his spirit of  bipartisanship.   In addition, this conference report wouldn't be possible without the  hard work and dedication of the entire subcommittee staff, and I thank  them all.   The NDAA has always been a product of bipartisan consensus, whose  purpose has always been to support our troops and to protect American  national security.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this bill and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6395 for the 60th year in a  row.
