 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Miller for  yielding.   I want to talk about faith. What is faith? Thankfully, the Bible  contains a clear definition in Hebrews 11:1. It says: Now faith is the  assurance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.   So faith is trusting in something you cannot explicitly prove. Trust  is actually relying on the fact that something is true. This biblical  definition of faith doesn't only apply to salvation, which is God's  gift to us, but to the rest of our Christian life. We are to believe  what the Bible says and we are to obey it. That is called living by  faith.   We are to believe the promises of God, we are to agree with the truth  of God's word, and we are to be transformed by it. Hebrews 11:6 says:  Because without faith, it is impossible to please God. Without faith,  we cannot be saved. Without faith, the Christian life cannot be what  God intends it to be. Without faith, I wouldn't be standing in this  Chamber today representing the precious people of the First District of  Tennessee. Without faith, I wouldn't be able to share a hopeful message  with this great Nation that if God be for us, who shall be against us?   Faith knows that no matter what the situation is in our life or  someone else's life that the Lord is working within that situation for  their good and His glory. Perfect faith is simply taking God at His  word.
