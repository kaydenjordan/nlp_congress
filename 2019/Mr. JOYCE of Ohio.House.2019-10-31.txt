 Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I  rise to honor the life and service of U.S. Army Sergeant Thomas Cole  Walker of Conneaut, Ohio.   Sergeant Walker, who enlisted after graduating from Conneaut High  School in 2016, was tragically killed on October 20 during a training  exercise at Fort Stewart.   Just 22 years old, he had been awarded the Army Good Conduct Medal,  the National Defense Service Medal, the Korea Defense Service Medal,  and the Army Service Ribbon.   His dedication to protecting this Nation was nothing short of heroic  and serves as an inspiration to us all. But Sergeant Walker was more  than a patriot. He was also a son, a brother, and a husband. His loss  is felt by many.   Madam Speaker, please join me in extending condolences to the  friends, fellow soldiers, and family of Sergeant Walker, especially his  wife, Taylor; his brother, Jared; his sisters Payton, Whitney, and  Wendy; and his father, Thomas.  [[Page H8682]]    I pray that the outpouring of support from the Conneaut community  will help ease their sorrow during this difficult time. I know this  entire Chamber joins me in thanking Sergeant Walker for his service,  honoring his life, and praying for his family.                            ____________________
