 Mr. President, in the final days of the Obama  administration's second term, with all eyes focused on the President- elect, the temptation to try to take a dramatic action to seal a  cherished policy legacy must have been almost irresistible. So it  proved for President Obama on December 23, 2016, when he betrayed  decades of robust bipartisan American support for Israel at the United  Nations by abstaining from a completely biased resolution that condemns  our close friend and ally Israel and condemns all the so-called  settlement activity, defined as any construction in any territory won  by Israel in the Six-Day War.   U.S. policy for decades has been to stand up for Israel at the United  Nations, a hot bed of anti-Semitism that discriminately condemns Israel  more than any country in the world, particularly when resolutions are  being offered up that are outrageously biased, that attempt to  predetermine the outcome of negotiations, that prejudge the basis for  negotiations, or that try to dictate terms to Israel.   We have seen this pattern of appealing to the United Nations from the  Obama administration over and over with disastrous deals--the nuclear  deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as the U.N. Convention  on Climate Change, two international agreements that significantly  threaten the security and prosperity of the United States. Both of them  should have been submitted to this body, the Senate, as treaties.   But the President chose instead to try to impose them through the  United Nations because he knew that they would never be ratified by the  Senate, even when this Senate had a Democratic majority. So the Obama  administration's strategy, instead, has been to curb American power by  subjugating our national interests to the globalist agenda of the U.N.,  a policy that he is now attempting to extend to Israel.   Here are some of the main problems with UNSC Resolution 2334. First,  it is an attack on Israeli sovereignty, as it falsely defines as  illegal under international law building activity within Israel's own  borders, which should be an internal Israeli issue. The historical  connection of the Jewish people to the land of Israel did not begin in  1967.   Let us not forget that the Six-Day War was a defensive war fought  almost 50 years ago by the Jewish state against the Palestinians and  their Arab enablers, who were gathering in a concerted effort to wipe  Israel off the map. Against all odds, Israel won quickly and decisively  and the map was redrawn to ensure that Israel was not endangered by its  own borders, the weakness of which Israel's enemies had attempted to  exploit.   Of course, the defeated party, the Palestinians, have not accepted  this outcome. Israel has time and again invited them to negotiate a  resolution--just one that involves Israel's continued existence as a  Jewish state, something that the Palestinian Authority has over and  over refused to acknowledge or accept.   Therein lies the bottom line for Israeli security. The pre-1967 lines  proved indefensible. So rather than, as the Obama administration, treat  them as some sort of gold standard, Israel's security interest has  deemed them intolerable and any resolution to this issue should not be  dictated by the United States or the United Nations but rather should  be negotiated and decided upon directly by the sovereign nation of  Israel and by the Palestinians.   Secondly, the resolution falsely claims that Israel's sovereignty  over the eastern part of Jerusalem and areas that it controls after the  Six-Day War, including Judea and Samaria, are supposedly ``occupied  Palestinian territory''. This is nothing short of absurd. What that  means is that, under the terms of the United Nations resolution that  the Obama administration acquiesced to--indeed, there are considerable  reports that the Obama administration, President Obama, and John Kerry  actively encouraged and facilitated it--the Jewish Quarter, the Old  City of Jerusalem, is illegal and illegitimate and not justifiably a  part of Israel. Under the terms of that resolution, the location of  holy sites for the Jewish people, including the most important holy  site, the Temple Mount, is illegal and illegitimate to be a part of  Israel. Under the terms of the resolution, the Western Wall, where Jews  from all over the world go to pray, is deemed ``occupied Palestinian  territory,'' illegal and illegitimate.   It is more than a little ironic that President Obama went to the  Western Wall to place a yarmulke there, pretending to show respect to  Israel, and yet his administration, in an outgoing act of contempt,  declares the Western Wall not part of the nation of Israel.   This couldn't be further from the truth. It was also an affront to  Jews around the world that the resolution was adopted on the eve of  Hanukkah. For 8 days, Jews lit candles all over the world to remember  the miracle that happened there, and to commemorate the heroic battle  fought by the Maccabees that liberated Jerusalem and restored their  right to worship freely and the rededication of the Temple in  Jerusalem. How ironic it is that on the eve of a celebration liberating  Jerusalem and rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem, the Obama  administration and the United Nations would declare that Jerusalem and  the Temple are not legitimately part of Israel.  [[Page S96]]    How disgraceful--the United States should be not be facilitating the  adoption of a resolution that at its core attempts to distort and  rewrite recent history as well as the historical connection of the  Jewish people to the land of Israel that goes back thousands of years.   Third, the resolution will also help fuel the Palestinian diplomatic,  economic, and legal warfare campaign against Israel, particularly  because of its provision that calls on states to make a distinction in  their dealings with Israel between pre-1967 Israel and Israel beyond  the 1967 lines, encouraging boycotts, divestments, and sanctions  against Israel and potentially leading to Israelis and Americans being  brought in front of the International Criminal Court.   Palestinian leaders are already promising to use this resolution to  push the International Criminal Court to launch a formal investigation  against Israel.   That was not an unintended consequence of this action. That was  precisely the intent of the United Nations and the Obama  administration--to facilitate assaults on the nation of Israel.   Yet even after this disgraceful United Nations resolution, it was  clear that the administration was not yet done, with Secretary of State  John Kerry delivering just days later a truly shameful speech attacking  Israel. His speech, very much like Kerry's 2014 remarks likening Israel  to an apartheid state, will only enflame rising anti-Semitism in  Europe. It will encourage the mullahs, who hate Israel and hate  America, and it will further facilitate ``lawfare,'' the growing  assaults on Israel through transnational legal fora.   President Obama and John Kerry's actions were designed to secure a  legacy, and in that, they have succeeded. History will record and the  world will note that Barack Obama and John Kerry are relentless enemies  of Israel.   Kerry's speech drew a stunning moral equivalence between our great  friend and ally Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which is  currently formed by a ``unity'' government with the vicious terrorists  of Hamas.   Secretary Kerry declared the Hamas regime and Gaza ``radical'' in the  same way that he declared the duly elected Government of Israel  ``extreme.'' That moral equivalence is false, and it is a lie.   The IDF, defending the people of Israel, protecting people, and  keeping them safe, is not the same moral equivalent of terrorists who  strap bombs to their bodies and seek to murder innocent women and  children.   Kerry declared the vicious terrorism sponsored by Hamas equal to the  Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and he equated Israel's  celebration of its birth with the Palestinian description of this event  as the ``disaster.''   Unlike Barack Obama and John Kerry, I do not consider the existence  and creation of Israel to be a disaster, and the Government of the  United States should not be suggesting such a thing.   Kerry's speech attempted to lay out a historic and seismic shift  toward the delegitimization of our ally Israel. It is a sign of their  radicalism and refusal to defend American interests that Obama and  Kerry chose to attack the only inclusive democracy in the Middle East-- a strong, steadfast ally of America--while simultaneously turning a  blind eye to the Islamic terrorism that grows daily.   Unfortunately, President Obama still has 2 weeks left in his  Presidency, and he may not yet be done betraying Israel.   Next week, on Sunday, January 15, France is convening a conference  with 70 other nations designed to serve as an extension of the U.N.  resolution and the Kerry speech--an all-out assault on Israel. I am  deeply concerned that what is decided at this conference will be used  to try to further impose parameters or even audaciously to recognize a  so-called independent Palestinian state through another Security  Council resolution. The Security Council is scheduled to meet on  January 17--conveniently, 3 days before Obama and Kerry leave office.   Let me speak a moment to our friends and allies across the globe.   When the President of the United States, when the administration of  the United States attempts to encourage you to support their positions  in the United Nations, that can be highly persuasive. It has been an  arena, a forum that Barack Obama has flourished in, even as he has  shown condescension and contempt for the Congress of the United States  and the people of the United States.   But to our friends and allies, let me remind you: The Obama  administration is coming to an end on January 20. If you desire to  continue being a friend to America, if you desire a continued close  working relationship with America, then I call upon our allies: Do not  join in attacking Israel on January 15 in France or on January 17 at  the Security Council.   The new administration--President-Elect Trump--has loudly condemned  the U.N. resolution and the Obama administration's complicity in its  passage.   I would encourage our friends and allies not even to attend the  January 15 conference, or, if they do choose to attend, to oppose and  stand up and speak out against any further attempts to attack or  undermine or delegitimize America or Israel.   I want to commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  offering resolutions to repudiate this administration for their actions  of the last few weeks. It says something when you see Republicans and  Democrats in Congress coming together, united to say: This action by  the Obama administration is beyond the pale.   Let me underscore again to our friends and allies, to our  Ambassadors, to heads of state, to friendships and relationships that  we value so much: Listen to the bipartisan consensus of Congress, and  do not go along with the bitter, clinging radicalism of the Obama  administration, attempting to lash out and strike out at Israel with  their last breath in office.   As commendable as these resolutions are, I believe the Senate and the  Congress need to go further--that we need to take concrete steps so  that there will be repercussions and consequences for the United  Nations and the Palestinians for their behavior. That is why I am  working with my colleague Senator Lindsey Graham on introducing  legislation, along with other Members of this body, designed to cut the  funding to the United Nations--designed to cut U.S. taxpayer funding  going to the U.N.--unless and until they repeal this disgraceful anti- Israel resolution.   We know, previously, that one way to get the U.N.'s attention is to  cut off their money. We know from the failure of other U.N.  organizations to recognize so-called Palestine as a member-state after  American tax dollars were withheld from UNESCO for doing so in 2011  that the U.N. over and over values its pocketbook over its leftist  values.   However unintentionally, President Obama's misguided foreign policy  has led to an unprecedented rapprochement between Israel and America's  Arab allies, such as Egypt, Jordan, and the UAE. We have also seen  hopeful signs of shifting positions at the United Nations, as countries  such as Brazil, Mexico, Italy, and Australia have recently signaled  that they may no longer vote reflexively in favor of the Palestinians.   Great Britain, although it voted for the resolution, has recently  demonstrated an unprecedented degree of support for the Jewish state.   These changes represent a significant opportunity for the United  States to bolster one of our most important allies, an opportunity we  can preserve for the President-elect by not letting Mr. Obama squander  it on the way out the door.   America should be leading the charge at the United Nations and around  the world to rally burgeoning support for Israel, not trying to stab  the Jewish state in the back.   Just over a week ago, I spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.  I told the Prime Minister that, despite the disgraceful actions of the  United Nations, America stands resolutely with the nation of Israel,  that the American people stand with Israel, and that I believe there is  a very real possibility that the extreme and radical actions of Obama  and Kerry will, in fact, backfire.   It is not accidental that they waited until after the election to do  this. They could have tried to do that this summer, but Obama and Kerry  knew well that the American people do not support their attempting to  attack Israel. So they waited until after the election.  [[Page S97]]  They waited until they were on their way out the door.   Kerry, in his speech, said Israel cannot be both democratic and  Jewish--one or the other, but not both.   This is an inanity that is deemed profound only in Marxist faculty  lounges.   Israel is Jewish, it is democratic, and it is and should remain both.  I believe that by revealing just how extreme they are, by removing the  fake mask of support for Israel that Obama and Kerry have chosen to do  in the last several weeks, it will help to galvanize support in this  body and across the world for our friend and ally, the nation of  Israel.   Israel is not only our friend and ally, but it is a partner of the  United States. That alliance benefits the vital national security  interest of America. Israel's military benefits the national security  of the United States of America. The Israeli intelligence services  benefit the United States of America. Israel's steadfastness against  radical Islamic terrorism, which has declared war on both Israel and  America, benefits the national security interests of this country.   It is Israel--the thriving, one and only Jewish state--that stands on  the frontlines for America and, more broadly, Western civilization  against the global threats we face. Our commitment to Israel must be  restored and strengthened. I look forward to taking action with my  colleagues--I hope on both sides of the aisle--in the near future to  repudiate Obama's shameful attack on Israel, to repudiate the United  Nations' efforts to undermine Israel, and to reaffirm America's strong  and unshakable friendship and support for the nation of Israel.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.                               Amendment No. 1                  (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)
