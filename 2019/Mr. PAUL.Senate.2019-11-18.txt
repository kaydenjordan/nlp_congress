 Mr. President, Jennifer Beck Walker has used her  career to show that perseverance, dedication, and a strong work ethic  can not only lead to success but make positive change in communities.  In 1987, Jennifer became an intern at the Purchase Area Development  District in Mayfield, KY. Over the years, she worked up through the  ranks in various roles, married her husband Eric, and had 2 sons, Wyatt  and Aidan. Jennifer was named the executive director of the PADD in  2008 and her commitment to the growth and development of the region has  been unsurpassed. Today, I congratulate Jennifer on her retirement and  send my best wishes for her future.                            ____________________
