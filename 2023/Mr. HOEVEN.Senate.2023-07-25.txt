 Mr. President, I rise today and join my colleague Senator  Cramer to pay tribute to a truly exceptional young man, Fargo Police  Officer Jake Wallin.   Tomorrow, the Fargo community will gather to honor Officer Wallin,  who was tragically killed in the line of duty on July 14. The Senate's  debate on the National Defense Authorization Act prevents both myself  and Senator Cramer from being there in person. So we wanted to do what  we could to pay our respects here to Officer Wallin on the Senate  floor.   As a member of the Minnesota National Guard, he served both in  Afghanistan and in Iraq. His platoon captain had this to say of Officer  Wallin:         Jake was that individual that you could always trust. Any       time that you asked him to step up or do anything, there was       no hesitation.    That dedication to service continued after his deployments to the  Middle East. Following his time overseas, Jake made his home in Fargo,  ND. He graduated from the Fargo Police Academy and joined the Fargo  Police Department because, as he put it, ``I've always wanted to work  in some sort of position that had purpose behind my job. Police officer  is always what came to me.''   Jake had only been on the job since April, but his impact on the  community will not be forgotten. Police Chief Zibolski said that, even  in his final moments, he was thinking of his fellow officers and trying  to save the lives of those fellow officers.   My wife Mikey and I send our sincerest condolences also to his  parents Jeff and Amy, his brother Brady, his fiancee Winter, and all of  Jake's loved ones.   At the same time, we continue to pray for his fellow officers,  especially Officers Andrew Dotas and Tyler Hawes, who were injured in  the ambush. They were both shot as well. We are also grateful to  Officer Zach Robinson, who was able to put an end to this horrific  incident and whose bravery will never be forgotten. These peace  officers have a long road to recovery and will continue to be in our  prayers.   This tragic event is a reminder of the dangers our law enforcement  officials face each and every day and of the enormous debt we owe them  and their families for the sacrifices they make to keep our communities  safe. We are truly grateful to our peace officers--all of them--whether  they are in North Dakota or anywhere across this amazing country. We  truly value them. We owe them so much, and we are truly grateful to all  of them.   Particularly, we honor Officer Jake Wallin for making the ultimate  sacrifice on our behalf. May God bless him and his family.   I yield the floor.
