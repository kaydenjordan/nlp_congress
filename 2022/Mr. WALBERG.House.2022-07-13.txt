 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Maxine  Randall of Hillsdale, Michigan, who recently passed away at the age of  92.   After graduating from North Adams High School in 1948, Max played for  the Fort Wayne Daisies of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball  League, which was founded during World War II.   During her 6 years in the league, Max was named as an all-star five  times and compiled 116 wins--fifth in league history.   Decades later, the women's baseball league that Max starred in served  as a catalyst for the hit movie ``A League of Their Own.''   Following her pro baseball career, Max worked at Jonesville Products  for many years, where she met her late husband, Bob.   As one relative described her, Max was ``salt, grit, and a baseball  mitt.''   We send our condolences to the Randall family, and we celebrate an  inspirational life lived to the fullest.                            ____________________
