 Madam Speaker, as we mark the beginning of Women's  History Month and International Women's Day, I rise today to celebrate  the recent renaming of the iconic Farnsworth House to the Edith  Farnsworth House.   Located in Plano, Illinois, the home designed by Mies van der Rohe  was commissioned by Dr. Edith Farnsworth in 1945 and today is a  National Historical Landmark and considered a masterpiece of modern  architecture.   I am proud that this piece of architectural history is located in the  14th District of Illinois and that the National Trust for Historic  Preservation is elevating the role of women throughout history by  renaming and rededicating the house for the woman who commissioned it.   Too often, women's roles in history are overlooked and forgotten.  That is why the National Trust's efforts through the Where Women Make  History project to recognize places across  [[Page H1337]]  the country where women have changed their communities is so important,  not only to elevate more of our history and celebrate women's  contributions to it, but to inspire the next generation of artists and  change-makers.   The Edith Farnsworth House is a cultural gem of the 14th District of  Illinois that would not have been possible without the vision and  commitment of Dr. Edith Farnsworth. I am proud to see this landmark  rededicated in her name so that her legacy can be appreciated for  generations to come.                            ____________________
