 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   I have been working for the last dozen years to make the transition  to Federal immigration policy in the Marianas as least difficult as  possible.   In 2018, with Chairman   Rob Bishop's essential help, we protected  the rights of U.S. workers against the unfair competition from foreign  workers in the Marianas' economy with Public Law 115-218.   Last year, President Trump signed Public Law 116-24 and helped us  convert about 1,000 people living under administrative parole into  residents with a permanent legal status in the Marianas only, not  eligible for any public charge at all.   Just last week, the administration issued the necessary guidance to  allow those 1,000 people to begin the application process, and I am  very grateful to the President and to everyone at USCIS and the  Department of Homeland Security for their support.   Today's bill, H.R. 560, continues this work of smoothing over the  rough places in the application of national immigration law to my  isolated district.   H.R. 560 provides the same permanent status--in the Marianas only-- that President Trump approved for parolees in June. This time, we want  to give stability to a small group of investors who were in the  Marianas even before Federal immigration. They have been holding on  with short-term visas ever since, never certain from year to year about  their business investments.                                time  1300    We want to give the same certainty to a group of long-term workers-- some of whom have been in the Marianas for 40 years--and to the  businesses that employ them.   The Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on H.R. 560 last  February. Our Republican Governor, the Honorable Ralph Torres,  testified in favor of the bill. The Trump administration did not take a  position, but their witness said: ``Without a sustained labor force,  projected investment in the CNMI likely will wither.''   Well, we can do something to avoid that consequence by passing H.R.  560. Again, this bill is Marianas only. It has bipartisan support.  Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop are both cosponsors, for  which I am grateful.   Madam Speaker, I ask all Members now to vote in favor.
