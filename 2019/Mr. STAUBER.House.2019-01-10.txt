 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the State of  Missouri for her leadership. It is a privilege to stand here on this  important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the pressing issue of border security.  Across our southern border, we have thousands of miles of unprotected  terrain where weapons, human trafficking victims, and drugs are easily  smuggled into this country every single day.   Believe it or not, the drugs that are crossing our southern border  even make their way to the most northern communities in my great State  of Minnesota. Just last year, more than two dozen people were arrested  for their involvement in a large heroin trafficking network that  brought drugs to St. Louis County, where my family, friends, and  constituents live. This is unacceptable.   During my 23 years as a law enforcement officer, I worked tirelessly  to keep illegal drugs off the streets and out of the hands of our young  children. I have given too many death notifications to unsuspecting  parents. The pain and anguish of each family will never be forgotten.   Mr. Speaker, it is high time we recognize that our porous borders are  intrinsically tied to the drug crisis, the rise in human trafficking,  and illegal immigration in this country. I urge the Democratic  leadership to put partisan politics aside so we can finally work  together and secure our borders. The health and safety of the American  people are depending on it, and doing nothing is no longer an option.
