 Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of these important  pieces of legislation.   The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the challenges that working  families have always faced in the American economy: that the economy is  not structured around the needs of working families and that the  solutions that do exist, like childcare, are not sufficiently funded.   As such, our Nation's lack of support for affordable childcare forces  many working families to make an impossible choice: either go to work  to support your family to put a roof over their head, food on their  table, or clothes on their backs, or not in order to stay at home to  make sure that they are safe and well taken care of.   Unfortunately, parents don't face an even playing field when it comes  to childcare. For example, Latino and Asian children are most likely to  have a lack of childcare options in their communities and face long  waits and long lines to get a spot.   Despite the fact that quality childcare is a cost-effective way to  reduce poverty, funding for childcare is simply not enough. I am proud  to support this important piece of legislation and these two pieces of  legislation. It is a way forward, and I look forward to voting on it  later today.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  doing this Special Order hour to remember the life of John Lewis.    He called other people ``brother.'' He called me ``young brother,''  so I guess I was the little guy.   He was such an amazing man. He had a huge character. He was a civil  rights giant who amplified the voices of a generation. His commitment  to dismantling hatred and oppression in whatever its form was something  that inspired generations, and it is something that we all know that we  stand on his shoulders on for our own fights for greater equality in  this country.   His strength and resolve, showcased during the Nashville sit-in  movement, the Freedom Riders, and the March on Washington gave us the  momentum to carry on through adversity and taught us what it means to  get into some ``good trouble.''   And those who knew John and marched with him, whether it was to  protest the detention of immigrant children, as I did a few years ago,  or to speak out against racial injustice, always felt a little bit more  hopeful when he was around. It created that little bit of a ripple of  hope from person to person when he was marching with you.   I believe he also created a little bit of a ripple of change in every  single person he met that transformed and empowered communities and for  future generations still unborn. That is the kind of legacy he left.   But I also got to see him as just a humble person, a regular person.  And I noticed when we would walk from the Ways and Means Committee room  back here to vote, I would always kind of walk with him, and people  would come up and ask for a photograph, you know, school children and  adults alike. And they would get around him and, you know, I was pushed  aside, and I took the phone and I was proud to take the photographs. He  would always say: Hi, I am John Lewis. What is your name and where are  you from? And he took that moment to make it about them, not about him.   Imagine if we were all like that, where we just paused a little bit  and took the moment to make it about the other person, the other party,  the other State, the other person from a different country. Imagine  what this country would be like. It would be a lot better. It would be  a lot more hopeful and would create that ripple of change that we all  desire.   I know John is getting up to the pearly gates of Heaven with Saint  Peter, who is the guardian of those gates, and John is going to say:  Hi, I am John Lewis, nice to meet you.                                time  2100
