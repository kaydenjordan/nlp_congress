 Mr. President, today I rise to honor and pay  tribute to my friend, neighbor, and mentor Tom Johnson, who passed away  on June 8, 2020, after a 6-year fight with cancer.   Tom served as the Hennepin County attorney for 12 years, and after I  took over as county attorney years later, I would often turn to him for  advice. Tom was always willing to help and to offer his wisdom, humor,  and always patient kindness.   It is only fitting that Tom was working up until his final days as to  how to improve the lives of others by proposing ideas on criminal  justice reform. In fact, just 1 week before he  [[Page S2957]]  died, Tom attended a virtual board meeting of the Minnesota Justice  Research Center, which he founded and which was dedicated to pursuing  fair treatment for those in the criminal justice system.   Tom was a groundbreaking leader on criminal justice reform for  decades and a fierce advocate for ending the racial disparities that  have plagued our judicial system. Last Christmas, Tom wrote his own  obituary, in which he said that nothing had given him more satisfaction  than ``calling attention to the unacceptable racial disparities in the  justice system and their cost to society.''   His voice and wisdom on these issues will be deeply missed in this  moment as we try to end systemic racism in our country with systemic  change.   Put simply, Tom always did good, from his critical work on domestic  abuse, to his focus on race and justice, to his principled stand  against the death penalty. He simply loved public service.   Tom was elected to the Minneapolis City Council at just 28 years old,  and he once wrote that he used to wander around city hall thinking ``If  the public only knew how little I know.'' But despite, or perhaps,  because of his humility, Tom got things done.   Tom fought for truth-in-housing inspections and campaign finance  disclosures and for a prohibition of discrimination based on sexual  orientation. He founded CornerHouse, an advocacy center for child  victims of sexual abuse.   Tom was a tireless advocate and champion for all Minnesotans, but  none gave him more joy than his beloved family, including his wife  Victoria and his children Jill, Ben, Hunter, and Kayla. He was so proud  of all they had achieved--and rightfully so.   When reflecting on his legacy to the Star Tribune in 2015, Tom  suggested that many of today's problems could be solved if people just  worked harder at getting to know people from different races and  cultures. As he told the paper, things like ``socializing after work.  Asking how things are going and really listening to the answer. Helping  a young person make the connections that lead to a first job,'' were  the keys.   We would all be wise to honor Tom's legacy by heeding that  advice.                            ____________________
