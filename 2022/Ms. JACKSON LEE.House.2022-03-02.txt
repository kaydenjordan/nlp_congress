 Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished friend for  yielding.   I rise enthusiastically joining the President and joining our  chairman in pushing the Honoring our PACT Act and just remind the  underlying amendment by Mr. Bost, one-half of 1 percent, do we in this  time, do our veterans, do our soldiers deserve half treatment?   I don't think so.   The Jackson Lee amendment adds to this legislation. It would add a  report on the feasibility of modifying the individual longitudinal  exposure record system used to register toxic exposure of military  personnel to include members of the National Guard who are deployed in  the United States in connection with a natural disaster without regard  to duty status and may record information regarding a suspected  exposure by the National Guard to toxic substances while they are in  the midst of their rescues.   We know and we thank the House Veterans' Affairs Committee for  recognizing and working with my staff that the National Guard is  involved in toxic matters on home side. They collaborate with and  support civilian authorities and traditional first responders, they are  called in as a helpmate. They serve to strengthen and expand local  disaster response while the emergency services of a State or locale may  have robust plans to deal with unexpected, sometimes disasters strike  that overwhelm their resources.   Let me just show you, Mr. Speaker, they are involved in the work.  This is an important amendment, and I ask my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, Chairman McGovern, thank you for this opportunity to  discuss briefly three Jackson Lee Amendment #13, to H.R. 3967, the  Honoring our PACT Act.   The PACT Act provides much needed attention to the issue of toxic  exposure of military service personnel when it occurs during  deployment.   Jackson Lee Amendment #13 would add a report on the feasibility of  modifying the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record System used to  register toxic exposure of military personnel, to include members of  the National Guard who are deployed in the United States in connection  with a natural disaster, without regard to duty status may record  information regarding a suspected exposure by the National Guard to  toxic substances during such deployment.   I thank the House Committee on Veterans Affairs for working with my  staff on this Jackson Lee Amendment to H.R. 3967.   The National Guard collaborates with and supports civilian  authorities and traditional first responders in their efforts to  respond to emergencies and disasters.   They serve to strengthen and expand the local disaster response  capacity.   While the emergency services of a state or locale may have robust  plans to deal with the unexpected, sometimes disasters strike that  overwhelm their resources and manpower.   During these times the National Guard can play a vital role in saving  lives, stemming suffering and protecting property.   This amendment is important because of the conditions that can exist  during manmade or natural disasters that may expose National Guard  members to toxic substances.   National Guard service personnel provide vital services before,  during and following disasters that require that they come into contact  with flood waters, wildfires and other disasters that by their nature  would breach containment, manufacturing, and storage facilities for  toxic substances that would pose a risk to people.   I recall the flood waters of Hurricane Harvey and the hundreds of  refineries, small and large chemical processing facilities, and storage  facilities that were impacted by flood waters.   Some of these impacts included the risk of explosions due to the loss  of containment caused by a loss of electricity or the encroachment of  flood waters.   As was the case when two explosions shook the Arkema chemical  facility that resulted in a fire because the temperature required to  safely store chemicals was lost due to a power outage caused by  Hurricane Harvey flooding.   Many chemical facilities are located in low-lying coastal areas and  vulnerable to damage from hurricanes, flooding, and erosion, which are  increasing with climate change.   Extreme weather can trigger industrial disasters, including  explosions, fires, and major chemical releases, as well as chronic  chemical leakage into air, water, and soil.   Researchers identified 872 highly hazardous chemical facilities  within 50 miles of the hurricane-prone U.S. Gulf Coast.   Coastal areas are also densely populated and would be where National  Guard would be deployed to evacuate and assist residents in advance of,  during and following the landfall of a Hurricane.   There are approximately 4,374,000 people, 1,717 schools, and 98  medical facilities within 1.5 miles of the facilities according to the  Milken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University,  which collected survey data.   The Jackson Lee amendment would provide a report to inform the  Committee on Veterans Affairs of the importance of including toxic  exposure data on National Guard personnel who are exposed to toxic  substances when deployed in response to disasters.   In 2021, following Hurricane Ida's landfall in an analysis by the  Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) of the New Orleans area revealed  that 138 industrial facilities in and around the city--some of which  use electricity  [[Page H1245]]  to contain hazardous chemicals--were potentially without power, putting  facility workers and nearby civilians at enormous risk.   Flood waters, smoke from wildfires, and earthquakes have impacts on  facilities, businesses, and research facilities that are safe until  they are compromised by the impact of a natural or manmade disaster.   I urge the Committee to make in order the Jackson Lee Amendment to  H.R. 3967.   Thank you.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, and  I rise enthusiastically to support H. Res. 956 and as well to make  mention of H. Res. 943 that was introduced by myself and   Steve Cohen  on February 25.   Let me salute this resolution that is bipartisan that immediately  calls on a ceasefire by Putin. This is Putin's war. H. Res. 943 has  been affirmed by its call for the shutting down of our airways to  Russian carriers, and that has been done.   But the real point is that we are now standing firmly for democracy  and the fight of individual grandmothers and young people and  individual Ukrainians with their bare hands and with their weapons that  have been given to fight for democracy. But the real question that we  are also standing for, and thank you for the United Nations vote, is  that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal who is killing children.   Mitka, a parliamentarian that I met at the OSCE of which we were a  part of meeting in Lithuania and Vienna, talking to the soldiers that  were on the border of Belarus and Lithuania--thank you to those  soldiers that are now placed, almost 100,000 U.S. soldiers--is that  Putin is killing without cause. He is killing grandmothers. He is  killing children. Can we tolerate this bloodshed? No, we will not. And  we will stand with this resolution to demand that democracy stands in  the region and that we denounce his actions.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 956, a  resolution condemning the unprovoked aggression and invasion ordered by  Vladimir Putin, the authoritarian head of the Russian Federation  against the sovereign nation of Ukraine and supporting the right of the  people of Ukraine to freely determine their future, including their  country's relationship with other nations and international  organizations, without interference, intimidation, or coercion by other  countries.  [[Page H1252]]     I thank the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs,  Congressman Meeks of New York, for introducing this bipartisan  resolution and urge all Members to support it to show the solidarity of  the people of the United States with the people of Ukraine.    Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution because it calls upon and  commends the Biden Administration to honor and abide by the commitments  undertaken by the United States pursuant to Article 5 of the North  Atlantic Treaty, signed at Washington, District of Columbia, on April  4, 1949, and entered into force on August 24, 1949.    The resolution also commits this body to the promotion and  protection of democratic values, transparent and accountable government  institutions, and support for needed economic structural reforms in  Ukraine, including in the fiscal, energy, pension, and banking sectors,  among others.    The resolution also calls upon and commends the Biden Administration  for assembling and working with an international coalition of the  world's leading nations to ensure that all nations refuse to recognize  the illegal invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation and to ensure  that the Russian Federation is held accountable and sustain maximum  economic damage from the imposition of sanctions as a consequence of  its utter disregard for international law and norms.    I am particularly pleased that the Biden Administration has adopted  the recommendation advanced in H. Res. 943, a resolution I introduced  on February 25, 2002 condemning this unprovoked attack by the Russian  Federation, to ban all Russian airlines, including Aeroflot, from  entering the airspace of the United States or landing on its soil.    The United States is strongly committed to the sovereignty,  independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine.    The United States strongly supports efforts to assist Ukraine to  defend its territory against military aggression by the Russian  Federation and by separatist and paramilitary forces.    Ukraine was the second-most populous and powerful of the fifteen  republics of the former and disintegrated Union of Soviet Socialist  Republics and the hub of the union's agricultural production, defense  industries, and military arsenal.    In the three decades since gaining its independence, Ukraine has  sought to forge its own path as a sovereign state and sought closer  economic, social, and political ties with the free market and  democratic nations of the West.    Since 2013, the Russian Federation has undertaken a campaign of  political, economic, and military aggression against Ukraine, including  the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, a civilian airliner,  by Russian-backed Ukrainian separatists using a Russian-made missile  taking the lives of all 298 innocent persons on board.    In February 2014, the military of the Russia Federation, without  merit or cause, invaded the eastern part of the free and independent  country of Ukraine, including the Crimean Peninsula, and backed a  separatist insurgency in the Donbass region in eastern Ukraine, where  fighting has killed over 14,000 people.    The United States, a strategic ally of Ukraine, reacted swiftly to  the Russian invasion, condemning the military action in strong and  bipartisan fashion, and providing military, humanitarian, and non- military financial assistance to the determined but beleaguered nation  of Ukraine, which since 2014 has totaled approximately $1.5 billion.    On September 14, 2014, the House of Representatives adopted H. Res.  726, a resolution supporting the right of the people of Ukraine to  freely determine their future, including their country's relationship  with other nations and international organizations, without  interference, intimidation, or coercion by other countries, and  committed itself to solidarity with the people of Ukraine.    Interference and unprovoked aggressions by the Russia Federation  ordered and led by Vladimir Putin continued unabated, including the  mobilization and stationing of 150,000 Russian troops surrounding  Ukraine and armed forces positioned in Belarus to attack Ukraine from  the north, including war planes and offensive missile systems, and the  movement of Russian naval vessels in the Black Sea to Ukraine's south,  including amphibious assault ships, missile cruisers, and submarines,  and the positioning of blood and medical equipment into position on  their border.    Vladimir Putin sought authorization from the Russian parliament to  use military force outside of Russian territory by staging a fraudulent  on-camera meeting of his Security Council to grandstand for the Russian  public and by recognizing sovereign Ukrainian territory as so-called  independent republics in clear violation, again, of international law,  all of which was intended to set the stage for further pretexts and  further provocations by Russia Federation to make further aggressions  against Ukraine by military action.    Vladimir Putin rejected every good-faith effort the United States  and its allies and partners made to address mutual security concerns  through dialogue to avoid needless conflict and avert human suffering.    On February 23, 2022, the Russia Federation military, at the  direction of Vladimir Putin, began a premeditated brutal assault on the  people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without  necessity, making outlandish, false, and baseless claims that Ukraine  was about to invade and launch a war against Russia and that Ukraine  was prepared to use chemical weapons, and that Ukraine had committed a  genocide.    These actions were taken by Vladimir Putin at the very moment that  the United Nations Security Council was meeting to stand up for  Ukraine's sovereignty to stave off invasion, culminating in missile  strikes on historic cities across Ukraine, followed by air raids and  the invasion of Russian tanks and troops.    Mr. Speaker, through this resolution the United States strongly  condemns and opposes the unprovoked invasion and egregious act of  aggression against sovereign state of Ukraine by the Russian  Federation, the most provocative and destabilizing act of foreign  aggression since the 1938 invasion of the Sudetenland by the Third  Reich led by Adolph Hitler.    I ask all members to join me in voting for H. Res. 956 to support  the right of the people of Ukraine to freely determine their future,  including their country's relationship with other nations and  international organizations, without interference, intimidation, or  coercion by other countries.    Madam Speaker, last evening the President of the  United States was strong, and he was clear to stay away from divisive  rhetoric. But do my friends on the other side of the aisle realize that  anything that has not been accomplished is because they have been  obstructionists?   The Wall Street Journal says that the President and his American  Rescue Plan has led to less damage, and it is the biggest and best  recovery, at least in the past 50 years. It has had the least economic  impact in terms of long-term unemployment, weak label markers,  inexperienced workers, evictions and foreclosures. President Biden's  American Rescue Plan has led to less of that than any recovery in the  last 50 years.   We know that in Ukraine it is a disaster. People are dying. It is  Putin's war, but the President has brought NATO together.   And, yes, if we could pass Build Back Better, which they have  obstructed, we would be able to have childcare for all of America.   So I wanted to just, for this one moment, get on the floor to say in  all that they have said, why don't they take the call of the President?  Let's unify and stand for the American people. Stop complaining, and  let's get to work. President Biden called us to work as a strong  America.                            ____________________
