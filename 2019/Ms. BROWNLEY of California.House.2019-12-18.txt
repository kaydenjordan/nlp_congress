 Madam Speaker, as the chair of the  Women's Veterans Task Force, I see, every single day, the immense  sacrifice our women veterans and all of our Nation's veterans have made  in service to our country, in service to our Commander in Chief, our  Constitution, to protect our democracy, and for every single man,  woman, and child in our country.   When the President of the United States used $400 million meant to  protect our national security in order to cheat in our elections, he  not only abused his power, he turned his back on the sacrifices our  veterans and their families have made for all that we hold so dear.  That abuse of power is reprehensible, and it is exactly what  impeachment was designed to prevent.   We have a solemn duty to protect our Constitution, to protect our  democracy, and to honor all those who have laid their lives on the line  for these United States of America.
