 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for roll  call vote No. 62, confirmation of the nomination of Travis Greaves to  be a judge for the U.S. Tax Court. As I did on cloture, had I been  present for the vote, I would have voted yea.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
