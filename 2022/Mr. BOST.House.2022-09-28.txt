 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the service of one  of my staffers on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.   Ms. Samantha Gonzalez has dedicated over 10 years of her career to  our Nation's veterans, their families, and their survivors. She started  on the committee as an intern and has worked her way up to being the  communications director and senior health policy adviser.   Samantha helped craft messages and advance a number of bills  supporting veterans and their families--notably, the Choice and VA  MISSION Acts, the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health  Care Improvement Act, the PACT Act, and so many more landmark pieces of  legislation.   There is no doubt that the entire veteran community is better off  because of her tireless work on their behalf.   I thank Samantha for her commitment to America's veterans, and wish  her the best of luck in her next adventure. She will be missed.                 national suicide prevention awareness month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind everyone that while  National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month is concluding, we cannot  afford to lower our guard. It dismays me that still so many veterans  take their lives every day.   In 2020, approximately 16 veterans died by suicide daily, another  year with more than 6,000 veteran suicide deaths. We must stay  vigilant.   It took an incredible amount of work to get the Staff Sergeant Parker  Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program passed in legislation  through Congress. I am pleased that the first grants were awarded just  last week.   Now, 80 community-based organizations in 43 States, D.C., and  American Samoa will receive funding to provide or coordinate suicide  prevention services for veterans and their families where and when they  need it.   Many veterans either cannot or will not access the VA, but their  community knows how to find them, how to get them out of isolation and  out of trouble and get them the care that can save their lives and  offer them a future of hope. I am excited to see just what these grants  can do.                    celebrating the life of richard martin     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Richard  Martin, a good friend and great man who passed suddenly this week.   You get to know people very closely in stressful conditions. Well,  many of you know that I was a professional firefighter, and Richard  always had my back.   Richard and I both served on the Murphysboro Fire Department. Richard  served with the department for 32 years, from 1984 until 2016. During  that time, he was a member of the Firefighters Pension Board and served  as the treasurer and president of the Murphysboro Firefighters Local  3042.   Never fully retiring, he went on to become the southern district's  legislative representative for the Associated Fire Fighters of  Illinois.   Richard was dedicated to his family, his friends, his career of  service, our hometown, Murphysboro, and the community. Our prayers are  with his family, including daughter Olivia and sons Eli and Zeke during  this difficult time.   He was a close friend. He will be missed tremendously. His ability to  teach others the art of fighting fire and doing it safely and the  number of lives that he saved and the amount of property he saved will  not be forgotten.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the AUTO for Veterans Act,  as amended.   This bill would help severely disabled service-connected veterans  purchase and adapt a vehicle 10 years after they purchased their first  one. Current law only provides veterans with the funds for one vehicle  during their lifetime. We all know that the life of a car is not  infinite. Maybe my father didn't, but most people do.   For too long, disabled veterans have had to drive vehicles that have  logged hundreds of thousands of miles. This bill would help a deserving  population with the safe and reliable transportation they need. I am  also pleased that this bill is fully offset.   The underlying bill is very similar to H.R. 1361, the AUTO for  Veterans Act, which was introduced this Congress and last by our  colleague, Congressman Meuser. While I would have preferred that we  consider his version today, this bill will help many disabled veterans,  and it has my full support.   I thank the PVA and the DAV for their continued advocacy for this  proposal.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I reluctantly support this bill.   Food insecurity is an issue that impacts thousands of veterans every  year. Veterans continue to suffer from skyrocketing food prices caused  by the economic mistakes of the Biden administration.   While I support bringing more attention to veteran hunger, I am  skeptical that this bill is the correct solution. The bill before us  today would try to address these issues by creating a new office of  food security at the VA. The VA has also already told us that they were  working to set up an office at the VHA dedicated to food insecurity.   I look forward to working with our colleagues in the Senate to modify  the language in this bill to match the Department's efforts.   That said, I am pleased by the changes that were made today to  improve on the text. All considered, I reluctantly urge all of my  colleagues to support the bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in reluctant support of the Expanding  Home Loans for Guard and Reservists Act. Last Congress, my bill, H.R.  7445, proposed expanding VA home loan benefits to members of the  National Guard who have served on Active Duty or full-time guard duty.   Congressman Ryan's bill would expand the home loan benefit to members  of the National Guard that are on Federal Active Duty orders for  training. Unfortunately, this policy is being rushed in an election  year gimmick.   Unlike other bills we are considering today, this bill has not had  the benefit of legislative hearings, and I would have liked to have  heard the views of the VA and other stakeholders. A hearing would have  allowed us to understand the impact this legislation could have on the  mortgage markets. It would also have provided insight on the effect  this bill could have on recruitment of National Guard Active Forces.   That said, I do not want to stand in the way of legislation that can  help members of the National Guard, and I reluctantly urge all my  colleagues to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5918, as amended. This  bill would close a financial loophole affecting many servicemembers.   Last Congress, I was proud to support General Bergman's efforts to  responsibly sunset the Montgomery GI Bill, and today I am pleased to  support Congressman Banks' bill to ensure that those servicemembers who  paid into the program are repaid.   Under current law, servicemembers who switch from Montgomery to the  Post-9/11 GI Bill would lose about $1,200 they paid into the program,  if they exhausted their benefits while still on Active Duty. Veterans  who exhaust their benefits already receive the $1,200 back. This bill  would fix this loophole and treat servicemembers and veterans equally.   Servicemembers earned the benefits and should not be shortchanged  just because they are still on Active Duty. This bill would include a  short-term extension of the VA home loan funding fees to fully offset  the cost of this bill.   Madam Speaker, I thank the American Legion for bringing this problem  to our attention, and I also thank Congressman Banks for introducing  this important bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7589, the REMOVE Copays Act.  As its name suggests, this bill would remove copayments from every  veteran's first three mental health outpatient visits for each calendar  year.   I am pleased to support the REMOVE Copays Act today, and I hope it  will encourage veterans to take better care of their mental health.  September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, and according to the  most recent data from the VA, the amount of veterans who died by  suicide decreased from 2019 to 2020.   That is encouraging news. However, at least one non-VA study suggests  that VA is undercounting the number of veterans who die by suicide by  as much as 2.4 times. I fear that VA's data still has not accounted for  the negative effects of COVID lockdowns, isolation, and illness.   Regardless, as long as veterans continue to take their own lives, we  have important work to do. Suicide is not just a mental health issue.  Improving mental health has a critical role to play in stopping suicide  once and for all.   I am grateful to Chairman Takano for his introduction of this bill,  and I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting it today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support  the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in reluctant opposition to S. 1198, the  Solid Start Act of 2021. The Solid Start program was created by  President Trump in 2019 to better support veterans as they transition  out of the military.   I know firsthand that leaving the military can be tough. When I left  the military as a young marine, the only TAP program that I got was a  tap on the back and a ``see ya later.''   I am glad that things have improved a lot since then. The Solid Start  program has helped improve servicemembers' transitions even more.   I am a real big fan of the Solid Start program. The STRONG Act, my  bill with Chairman Takano, includes identical language to this bill and  would permanently authorize the Solid Start Program. The STRONG Act  passed the House in June with my full support.   However, earlier this month, Secretary McDonough announced that VA  would begin providing abortions. I believe it is not only immoral, but  it is also illegal. Congress prohibited VA providing abortions in 1992.  Congress has never repealed that prohibition. Just so you know, it has  never been superseded.   Secretary McDonough has claimed that he is taking this action in  defense of women's health, setting aside the fact that abortion is not  healthcare. By making that claim, the Secretary has made it clear that  he views women's health as one and the same with abortion.   Madam Speaker, this bill would require VA to provide women veterans  with, ``information that is tailored to their specific healthcare and  benefit needs.''   We have offered if they would remove that language to just say  ``veterans,'' that would not include information about abortion, given  the Secretary's views, that is unacceptable to me and to many others.   Our democracy is based on the rule of law, and I wish the Secretary  would follow the law, especially when it is a matter of life and death.  If he did, I would fully support this bill just like I did in June,  before the VA's new illegal rule.   Instead, I regret that I must oppose it today, and I urge my  colleagues to oppose the bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  because I would like to take this time to respond to a few things that  were not said correctly.   One, no one has said anything about a lawsuit, especially from the  ranking member.   Two, the Hyde amendment says: rape, incest, life of the mother. When  you put life and health of the mother, then it expands what can be  distorted and where we are at, and it opens to the point of long-term  abortion, and that has actually been verified by the VA.   There is not a whole list there that we want to remove. We want it to  say: If we believe that men and women are all veterans and should be  considered, then they should be advised as veterans.   But by putting that particular language in at this time after the  administration has violated the law of 1962--now the chairman said  there is another law, but if you look at that law, that law never goes  directly to abortion. And if it was directed towards abortion, then  they would have put it in the law. They would have put it in the law.  They wouldn't have made that broad statement. That is why it is a  misinterpretation of the VA.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me tell you, Madam Speaker, if I may, the question is not on  rape, incest, or life of the mother. It is on health, which could then  go to mental health which could spin off to late-term abortions.   This is a very personal issue to a lot of people, and I am sure it is  to everyone on both sides of the aisle. But I have to question who in  this room has ever held a child who has been born after 25 weeks in the  womb? I have. I held one granddaughter who died in the womb and one who  died in my arms after she was out of the womb.   What the VA has done with this rule by tweaking it, they think it is  for the right reasons--right or wrong--which you consider, rape,  incest, life of the mother, it is not. It is rape, incest, life and  health of the mother, which will allow for those late-term abortions.   Madam Speaker, that is life. Our Constitution is very clear. It is  very clear: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, the first  being life.                                time  2045    You can't, if you have ever held a child like that when they died in  your arms, say that is not life.   Unfortunately, it is not us that is making the decision. It is  political. It is the Biden administration, Madam Speaker, and they have  done it through taking the VA.   Anybody that can question me on my support of veterans is out of  their mind. I have served. My father served. My grandfather served. My  son served. My grandson served. And guess what? As of last week, my  granddaughter is now in Navy boot camp.   I will stand for the veterans, but I will not stand for the death of  children regardless of who this administration is or what they believe  is a good political move.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I think it is important to realize that DOD actually  follows the Hyde amendment, which is rape, incest, and the life of the  mother, which is exactly what the chairman just quoted.   What the VA does is rape, incest, and life and health, including  mental health, of the mother, which can be a claim that maybe I am  under stress, all of these things. That is why we need clarification.  Not only do we need clarification, but we need to follow the law.   The argument that the other law allows the VA Secretary to make these  decisions, it never mentioned abortion in there. I think that would  have done that.   Madam Speaker, I am encouraging my Members to vote ``no'' on this  bill. I would love to be able to vote on this bill when we get this  problem straightened out. I believe our veterans deserve to have the  other benefits that are here and available in the bill.   As everybody knows, I did vote for it in the other form before the VA  stepped down this path.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8510, as amended.   Following the access scandal of 2014, Congress enacted the VA  Accountability Act. The Accountability Act is meant to make it easier  for VA to hold bad employees responsible for their actions. The law  also created a new VA office intended to protect whistleblowers and  conduct investigations.   Unfortunately, this office has never lived up to the standard that  whistleblowers deserve. In 2021, 80 percent of the OAWP recommendations  for discipline were ignored by the VA. It is time to refocus their  mission.   H.R. 8510, as amended, would require VA employees with complaints to  be referred to the Office of Special Counsel. The OSC is an independent  office which has the authority to receive, manage, and investigate  allegations of whistleblower retaliation at the VA.   The OSC has a respected history of conducting objective  investigations. As such, I am convinced that the OSC will do a better  job of holding senior VA employees accountable than the OAWP.   This bill was drafted with valuable input from stakeholders and  enjoys broad support.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased that Congressman Pappas and Congressman  Mann have come together to author this important bipartisan proposal,  and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Mann), my good friend, who has worked so hard on this  issue.    Madam Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2794, the Supporting  Families of the Fallen Act.   I thank Senator Tuberville and Congressman Roy for leading this  effort in the Senate and the House, respectively.   This bill makes much-needed updates to the coverage amounts for the  Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance and the Veterans' Group Life  Insurance program.   Specifically, this bill would allow VA to raise the max payment for  both programs from $400,000 to $500,000. An additional $100,000 would  make it easier for surviving spouses to keep a roof over their family's  head and food on the table following the loss of their loved one.   As many of you know, VA's life insurance programs may be the only  affordable option available to servicemembers and veterans. This is  because some veterans may not be eligible for private life insurance  due to the added risk of military service or because they have a  service-connected disability, like PTSD or cancer.   When we send our military into harm's way, VA insurance programs  provide them and their families with financial security. However, the  max rate of $400,000, which was established in 2005, does not meet the  needs of today's survivors.   Since 2005, American families have seen the cost of living  continuously rise. This is especially true right now due to historic  inflation under the Biden administration.  [[Page H8193]]    This bill would provide families with insurance coverage that will  better meet their needs. S. 2794 builds on our Nation's promises to  care for the families of those lost in service to our country.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
