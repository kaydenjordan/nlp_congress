 Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of Representative  Mick Mulvaney to serve as Director of the Office of Management &  Budget, OMB. Representative Mulvaney's radical views regarding the  fundamental role of government in our society make him philosophically  ill-suited to run OMB. I will list a number of those views.   Social Security--In May 2009, Representative Mulvaney was a member of  the South Carolina State Senate and voted to declare that Social  Security is unconstitutional. He also wants to raise the retirement age  to 70. Raising the retirement age to 70 would cut earned benefits by  nearly 20 percent for all beneficiaries. With all the challenges people  have saving for retirement, the last thing we should do is raise the  Social Security retirement age.   Medicare--Representative Mulvaney is on record advocating enormous  cuts to Medicare and is a proponent of Speaker Ryan's preferred  ``premium support,'' i.e., voucher, concept for Medicare. ``Premium  support'' is a euphemism for privatizing Medicare. Representative  Mulvaney said on Fox News, in April, 2011. ``We have to end Medicare as  we know it.'' And he indicated that he wants to raise the eligibility  age to 67.   Medicare guarantees comprehensive health insurance coverage for  almost 50 million Americans. Only 2 percent of elderly Americans are  uninsured; nearly 50 percent were before Medicare was signed into law.   Debt ceiling--Representative Mulvaney appears willing to jeopardize  the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. He claims that  breeching the debt ceiling would not automatically trigger a default on  Treasury debt; he calls such concern ``a fabricated crisis.''  Representative Mulvaney believes the Treasury would be able to  ``prioritize'' payments and avoid a default.   His ``pay China first'' policy is contrary to the opinion of several  recent Treasury Secretaries, would be impossible to execute from a  logistical standpoint, and is based on a 1985 Government Accountability  Office report the agency has since walked away from. The Treasury  Department lacks legal authority to establish ``priorities'' with  respect to paying the Nation's obligations. Each law obligating funds  and authorizing expenditures stands on an equal footing, so the  Department has to make payments on obligations as they come due.   Debt limit brinksmanship is expensive. According to the Bipartisan  Policy Center, the 10-year cost to taxpayers of the 2011 debt limit  standoff was $18.9 billion because of the increased interest rates on  U.S. securities issued in 2011. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's  downgraded the long-term credit rating of the U.S. government for the  first time in history, from AAA to AA+.   Government shutdowns--Representative Mulvaney believes that shutting  [[Page S1228]]  down the Federal Government is an acceptable way to do business. He  stated on CNN that shutting down the government over funding the  Affordable Care Act was ``worth it'' in October 2013 and embraces the  term ``shutdown caucus.'' In a September 2015 Atlantic article, he  argued that shutting down the government is important becauset it is  what ``the base of the (Republican) party wants.''   Standard & Poor's determined that the October 2013 government  shutdown cost $24 billion.   Federal workers--Representative Mulvaney has sponsored numerous bills  attacking the Federal workforce, including many that freeze Federal  workers' pay. Federal workers have already ``contributed'' over $180  billion to deficit reduction through pay freezes and other measures. He  has sponsored the Federal Workforce Reduction Through Attrition Act,  the most recent version of which caps the Federal workforce at 90  percent of its current level. A previous version would have mandated  that ``agencies do not appoint'' for 3 years ``more than one employee  for every three employees retiring or otherwise separating from  government service.''   Women's reproductive health--in September 2015, Representative  Mulvaney spearheaded a letter signed by 38 House Republicans--all men-- opposing any legislation to fund the government that also continues to  fund Planned Parenthood. In an August 2015 email to the Washington  Post, Representative Mulvaney wrote that, if the Congress were to shut  down the Federal Government over Planned Parenthood funding, ``so be  it.''   Science and climate change--in a Facebook post from last September,  quoted in Vox, Representative Mulvaney questioned the need for  government funded research ``at all'' in the context of doubting the  scientific consensus that the Zika virus causes microcephaly.   Representative Mulvaney disputes the overwhelming scientific  consensus on climate change. During the Budget Committee's nomination  hearing, when Senator Kaine asked Representative Mulvaney about human- caused climate change, Representative Mulvaney replied, ``I challenge  the premise of your fact.''   The Union of Concerned Scientists opposes Representative Mulvaney's  nomination, writing:         He has backed legislation to change the regulatory process       in ways that would give an even stronger influence to       industry, increase political interference and undermine       science-based decision-making .  .  . Too often, the voices       of people who will be hurt the most by rolling back science-      based safeguards are drowned out by industries. The next OMB       director needs to enact science-based laws in a timely       manner, with a focus on ensuring benefits for all Americans.    Not surprisingly, Koch Industries has been a primary donor to  Representative Mulvaney's campaigns and his PAC.   Regulations--Representative Mulvaney's voting record has been hostile  to regulatory efforts to improve health, safety, and consumer  protections. This is especially alarming because as OMB Director,  Representative Mulvaney will oversee the Office of Information and  Regulatory Affairs. Representative Mulvaney has voted to curtail  regulations regarding debit cards, medical devices, public swimming  pools, excessive executive compensation, consumer financial protection,  energy exploration, investment advisers, mortgage lenders, and so on.   House Republican budget plans--the last time House Republicans  brought a full budget resolution to the House floor, Representative  Mulvaney voted against it because it wasn't extreme enough. He  supported the Republican Study Committee, RSC, budget instead.  Provisions of the most recent version of the RSC budget include: No. 1,  a 10-year $261 billion cut to Social Security by cutting cost-of-living  adjustments, COLAs, increasing the retirement age to 70, and  ``increasing means-testing''; No. 2, $662 billion in cuts to Medicare  by changing the program into a ``premium support'' model, i.e.,  ``voucher-izing,'' increasing the eligibility age, and phasing in  means-testing; No. 3, $1.6 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and the  Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, which would be combined into  one block grant program; No. 4, $925 billion in savings by repealing  the Affordable Care Act exchanges; and No. 5, $2.2 trillion in cuts to  undefined ``other mandatory'' spending. Notably, the budget would not  raise one dime in new revenue from the Nation's wealthiest individuals  and largest corporations.   ``Nannygate''--Representative Mulvaney failed to pay FICA and Federal  and State unemployment taxes on a household employee for the years 2000  to 2004. Representative Mulvaney admitted that the nanny in question  worked full time--40 hours a week--for 4 to 5 years.   Representative Mulvaney said that he didn't believe he owed payroll  and unemployment insurance taxes on his nanny because ``she simply  helped [my wife] with the children. We considered her a babysitter.''  This is despite the fact that, as the owner of several small  businesses, he knew to pay these taxes for his other full-time  employees.   As a State Senator in South Carolina, Representative Mulvaney  sponsored the following three bills: No. 1, to prohibit candidates from  the ballot for the State legislature if they had not paid all Federal  and State income taxes over the past 10 years; No. 2, to prohibit  candidates from the ballot for State office if they had not paid all  Federal and State income taxes over the past 10 years; and No. 3, to  prohibit the governor from appointing anyone who had not paid all  Federal and State income taxes over the past 10 years.   Representative Mulvaney voted for H.R. 1563, Federal Employee Tax  Accountability Act of 2015, which authorizes ``the head of an agency to  take personnel actions against an agency employee who willfully failed  to file a required tax return or willfully understated federal tax  liability.'' It is worth noting here that Federal workers have a lower  percentage of tax noncompliance than the general public--a 3.1 percent  delinquency rate versus 8.7 percent. And Representative Mulvaney  sponsored the Spending Reduction Act of 2011, which would have made  people with ``seriously delinquent tax debts'' ineligible for Federal  employment.   Representative Mulvaney is the wrong choice to run the OMB,    Mr. President, I take this time to explain to my  colleagues why I will be opposing the nomination of Scott Pruitt, the  attorney general of Oklahoma, to be the next Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency.   I first want to start by saying I had an opportunity to visit with  Attorney General Pruitt. He is a person who wants to serve our country,  and we very much appreciate that. He has a distinguished career in  public service, and we appreciate his willingness to continue to serve  at the national level.   My reason for opposing his nomination is that he has opposed most of  the missions of the Environmental Protection Agency as the attorney  general of Oklahoma. He has filed numerous lawsuits that would  compromise the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to  protect our environment.   I come to this debate acknowledging that there are national  responsibilities to protect our environment. The United States must  also be engaged in global leadership as it relates to our environment.  The people of Maryland want clean air. The people of Maryland want  clean water. No State can guarantee to its citizens that its air will  be clean or that its water will be safe. These issues go well beyond  State boundaries. They go beyond national boundaries. It is for that  reason that we need an Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency who will lead our Nation both in the appropriate controls and  regulations to protect our air and water but also work for our country  in regard to the global efforts to protect our environment for future  generations.   Let me talk about the issue of climate change. Climate change is one  of the greatest threats of our times. We know that this year, according  to NASA--they looked at the temperature rise in 2016 and found it to be  the hottest year ever recorded. We know something is happening in  regard to global climate change. It is affecting so many different  areas. We have eroding shorelines that our constituents see. We have  major military installations located along our coast that are at risk  as a result of rising sea levels from ice melt. We have populations  that are at risk in the United States.   Let me give one example, if I might. Smith Island, MD, is a very  proud community. It is a community that historically has been one of  the strongest in regard to watermen and dealing with the fruits of the  Chesapeake Bay. It is a proud community, and it is in danger of  disappearing because we have sea level rises resulting from ice melting  from climate change. We know there is a problem developing that we need  to deal with. It is affecting our economy.   In my State of Maryland, the seafood industry is concerned about the  future of the blue crab crop. They know that juvenile crabs need sea  grass in order to be able to be protected and mature into full-blown  blue crabs. With water becoming warmer, the future of sea grass is  challenged, putting the blue crab at risk.   That is just one example. There are many more examples I can give  about how it is affecting the economy of my State. It is affecting our  ability to enjoy our environment, the recreation itself, and it is  certainly providing a real risk in regard to the real estate. We have  some very nice real estate located right on the coast or on barrier  islands that is at risk of being lost as a result of climate change. We  see more and more major weather events occur on a much more regular  basis, causing billions of dollars of damage and putting lives at risk.   We know climate change is here. It is happening. The science is  pretty clear. When we asked Attorney General Pruitt his view about the  science of climate change, his answer was ``far from settled.''   The science is well understood. What we do here on Earth--the release  of carbon emissions--is causing an abnormal warming of our climate.  There are activities that we can do to reduce that effect on our  climate. We know that. That is what science tells us. We know we can  affect the adverse impacts of climate change if we take action. That is  what scientists are telling us.   The world came together on this issue in COP21. I was proud to head a  delegation of 10 Members of the U.S. Senate as we went to Paris to make  it clear to the international community that the United States wanted  to be part of a global solution to climate change. Not any one country  can reverse the trendline that we are on that is catastrophic; we need  all nations to do everything they can to reduce the impact of climate  change by reducing their carbon and greenhouse emissions. That is what  the global community needs to do, but we have been unable to get the  global community for all countries to live up to their  responsibilities.   Under President Obama and our leadership, we were able to get the  world community--over 190 nations--to come together in Paris, in COP21,  for every nation to take responsibility to reduce their carbon  emissions so that we all can benefit from that effort.   I am concerned as to whether Mr. Pruitt, if confirmed as the EPA  Administrator, will continue that U.S. leadership. He has not been at  all committed to U.S. programs on dealing with climate change, let  alone our international responsibilities to lead other countries to do  what they need to do. I will give one example. Part of our way of  showing the international community that we are serious about the  climate issue was the powerplant rule issued under the Obama  administration. Attorney General Pruitt joined a group in opposing that  powerplant rule through filing suit against the implementation of that  particular law.   We need someone who is going to lead on this effort in America and  understand that we have responsibilities to lead the international  community. We are at great risk from the impact of climate change, and  that needs to be understood and recognized by the leader of the  Environmental Protection Agency. I am not convinced Attorney General  Pruitt would do that.   I want to talk a little bit about clean air. Maryland has taken  pretty aggressive steps to improve the air quality from emissions  within the geographical boundary of the State of Maryland. That is what  every State should do. But here is the challenge: Maryland is downwind  from many other States' emissions, so we are seeing days in which our  air quality is below what it should be, not because we haven't taken  action but because we don't have a national policy to protect our clean  air.   The health of Marylanders depends on the Federal Government being  aggressive in guaranteeing that all citizens of this country--that  steps are taken to protect the air they breathe. I can tell you the  number of children who have asthma who suffer when the air quality is  not what it should be. It is not only wrong from the point of  [[Page S1257]]  view that we have an obligation to our children to make sure we give  them the healthiest air to breathe, it is also costing our economy  because every day that child stays home, a parent cannot go to work.  The child loses their time in school; they are being disadvantaged. If  they have to take a day off from summer camp, the parent has to stay  home, and it is wasting resources in this country.   For many reasons, we need an Administrator of the EPA who is  committed to a national effort to make sure the air we breathe is clean  and healthy.   Likewise with clean water. Some of us remember when the Cuyahoga  River caught fire in 1969. We know that pollution was so bad, you  literally could set our rivers afire. We took steps. And it was not  partisan--Democrats and Republicans came together with the Clean Water  Act. We recognized that the Federal Government has the responsibility  to protect the quality of our water so that we have safe, clean water  in America.   I think we have been working to improve the Clean Water Act  consistently on a nonpartisan basis, but now we have Supreme Court  decisions that challenge what water the Federal Government can  regulate. Congress has not taken steps to clarify that. The  administration took efforts to try to clarify that under the waters of  the United States, only to see a Court action to put that on hold in  which Mr. Pruitt joined as the attorney general of Oklahoma, once again  slowing down our effort to protect the clean waters of America.   I have spoken numerous times on the floor of the Congress about the  Chesapeake Bay and how proud I am to be a Senator from Maryland, one of  the six States that are in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, along with the  District of Columbia.   We know that the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure. It has been  so designated by many Presidents of the United States. It is the latest  estuary in our hemisphere. The watershed contains 64,000 square miles,  has over 11,000 miles of shoreline, and 17 million people live in the  Chesapeake Bay watershed--150 major rivers, $1 trillion to our economy.  It is part of the heritage of my State and our region. We are proud  that it is part of our life. It is part of why people like to live in  this region. They know the Chesapeake Bay makes their life so much more  enriched and so much more valuable.   The Chesapeake Bay is in trouble. I could talk about it from a  technical point of view. It doesn't flush itself as quickly as other  water bodies. The historic oyster population is not what it has been.  We have to, therefore, make special efforts to clean up the Chesapeake  Bay. Over 30 years ago, almost 40 years now, while I was in the State  legislature, when I was speaker of the house, I worked with Governor  Harry Hughes, and we developed a State program to deal with the  Chesapeake Bay.   We did it the right way. We started at the local levels. We got all  the stakeholders together: the farmers, the developers, the local  governments, the private sector, our local governments, the State  government. We worked with Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania is where  the Susquehanna River flows, and that produces most of the fresh water  that goes into the Chesapeake Bay. We worked with Delaware, Virginia,  New York, and West Virginia, and we developed the Chesapeake Bay  Program that is worked from the local level up. We get together to  determine what is reasonable: What does science tell us we can do?   We have all the stakeholders sitting around the table as we develop  these plans. They all sign up. Our farmers recognize that clean water  will make their agriculture more profitable. They recognize that.  Developers understand that we need a clean Chesapeake Bay as part of  our ability to develop profitable real estate in our community. These  are not inconsistent. A serene environment, clean agriculture, a strong  agriculture, a strong economy are all hand in hand together.   It is not a choice between one or the other. We recognize that. That  is why the Chesapeake Bay Program has never been partisan in Maryland.  We have had Democratic and Republican Governors who supported the  Chesapeake Bay Program. We have had legislators lead this effort from  both parties. Senator Mac Mathias, who served as the U.S. Senator from  Maryland, was the champion of bringing the Federal Government into the  Chesapeake Bay Program. The program is working. It is making the bay  safer today, but we still have a long way to go.   We enforce it through the TMDL, the Total Maximum Daily Loads, so we  can monitor that we are making the progress we said we could make,  based upon best science. And that is what the local stakeholders have  signed up for.   When we did our TMDL's, it was challenged. It was challenged in the  courts. Mr. Pruitt was one of those who brought a challenge against the  TMDL Program in Maryland. I am thankful that the Third Circuit upheld  the legal right of the TMDL, and the Supreme Court affirmed that  decision by the Third Circuit. So we won the legal case.   But it troubles me that a program that is from the ground up, from  the local governments up, in which the Federal government is a  partner--why it would be challenged when it was supported by the local  communities. To me, that case should never have been challenged.   We need the Federal Government to continue to participate with us.  The Chesapeake Bay Program is supported through the farm bill, through  the Water Resources Development Act, through the Clean Water Act, and  through annual appropriations. So we need continued support at the  Federal level for the Chesapeake Bay Program. And we need a champion in  the Environmental Protection Agency that will help us in that regard.   I want to talk briefly about the Safe Drinking Water Act. Safe  drinking water is critically important. We know that in recent years,  we have found too much lead in drinking water. We all know, of course,  the story of Flint, MI. I could take you to Baltimore where our schools  have to cut off their water fountains because of the unsafe levels of  lead in the drinking water, if they were permitted to drink from the  water fountains.   We can tell you about so many communities in the Nation that have a  desperate need to clean up their safe drinking water so that we can  protect our children from lead poisoning. I hope my colleagues  understand that there is no safe level of lead in the blood. It robs  children of their future. It poisons them. I think most people are  familiar with the Freddie Gray tragedy in Baltimore. Freddie Gray was a  victim of lead poisoning when he was young.   We owe it to our children to make sure we do everything we can so  they are not exposed to lead. I asked questions about that during the  confirmation hearing of Mr. Pruitt. The answers were less than  acceptable and showed his lack of real information about the dangers of  lead.   Every Congress should look at their responsibility to build on the  record, to leave a cleaner and safer environment for the next  generation. The EPA Administrator should be committed to that goal. I  do not believe Mr. Pruitt will be that type of leader. For that reason,  I will vote against his confirmation.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I yield the remaining time I have to  Senator Schumer.    Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate Black History  Month, a time to honor and reflect on the many achievements and  sacrifices of African Americans throughout our Nation's history.   This February, we highlight the titans of African-American history.  We honor the culture-shifting accomplishments of civil rights icons  such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Dr. Dorothy Height, and our  esteemed colleague, Congressman John Lewis.   As the senior Senator from Maryland, I would be remiss if I didn't  also honor Harriet Tubman, Thurgood Marshall, and--perhaps one of the  greatest Marylanders in our long history--Frederick Douglass. There are  some out there who may not know it, but Douglass was born in Maryland  around 1818. He learned to read and write in Baltimore before escaping  slavery. Despite unknowable hardship and systemic discrimination, he  went on to become one of the most influential writers, orators,  publishers, and abolitionists of his time. Though Douglass fiercely and  vocally opposed slavery, he would want us to remember that he stood for  the rights of all Americans, regardless of race, color, religion,  gender, or national origin. These views--revolutionary for the time-- gained him increasing prominence, leading to 1872, when Victoria  Woodhull chose him as her Vice Presidential nominee.   Frederick Douglass was the first Black American ever to hold that  title. His legacy continues to make Maryland proud.   While we take time to recognize Frederick Douglass and others this  month, we must also celebrate the countless men and women whose names  and heroism will never grace the history books. Let us never forget all  of those who suffered discrimination in silence, who endured civil  rights abuses without recognition, who sat-in and stood up to  oppression without accolade. We should use this month to lift up their  memories and to recommit to the causes of justice and equality for  which they also fought so diligently.   In particular, we should honor the Black teachers who taught  generations of children in the dark, against the odds and sometimes the  law, with little more than old, secondhand books and makeshift  buildings. We honor the businessowners who laid the foundations of the  Black community in places like Baltimore, Harlem, Chicago, Washington,  DC, and Tulsa. We honor the civil rights movement foot soldiers who  rejected subservience and embraced rebellion by marching in the streets  of Selma and Birmingham. We honor the factory workers who left the  South behind with hopes of a brighter  [[Page S1297]]  future, only to struggle in Northern cities for pennies.   For too long, Black Americans' rich and vibrant history has been  ignored or obscured by the specter of prejudice. But today, and for the  rest of the month, in classrooms and cities across our Nation, we will  shine a spotlight on that history.   We will vow to honor it here, now, in the present and in the future,  through protecting both the legacy of civil rights and the Americans  who are counting on us to uphold them. As lawmakers and as leaders, it  is our duty to fight on their behalf. It is our duty to pass laws that  will protect all Americans, support all Americans, and defend all  Americans, especially those who have been victims of institutional and  systemic prejudice.   That is why I introduced the End Racial Profiling Act in 2011. It is  incumbent upon every Member in this Chamber to be an advocate for the  men and women of color who are singled out every day simply because of  their skin color and appearance. These individuals are your  constituents. They are my constituents. They are our fellow Americans.   They deserve our commitment and an attention span that lasts longer  than 1 month a year.   Discriminatory profiling based on race--or religion or gender  identity, nation of origin, sexual orientation--has no place in our  society. It is un-American; it is also counterproductive. Racial  profiling doesn't keep us safer. To the contrary: it breeds hostility  and distrust, and it turns communities against law enforcement and  against each other. It wastes resources that our law enforcement  agencies can't afford to spend. And the more time we waste targeting  Americans because of their race or religion, the less time we are  devoting to those who are actually committing crimes or trying to harm  us.   My End Racial Profiling Act, which I plan to reintroduce this week,  would eliminate this harmful practice and instead offer resources for  more police training, mandate greater accountability, and offer  recourse for Americans who have been unduly profiled.   Our duty to African Americans does not end there. That is why, as  ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I intend to  introduce the National Security Diversity and Inclusion Workforce Act,  which would codify and build upon President Obama's efforts to  diversify our national security workforce. Having a workforce that  looks like America is not just good personnel policy, it is also a  national security imperative.   Our diversity is one of the strongest assets that the United States  has. It allows us to connect and work with different communities and  countries across the globe; it helps us to foster the relationships we  need to fight terrorism across the globe. And having a diverse set of  backgrounds, skills, knowledge, perspectives, and experiences  contributes to better national security decisionmaking. We should lead  the world and protect our homeland not just by preaching pluralism and  tolerance, but by practicing it.   While we embark on that mission, we should take with us the words of  Frederick Douglass: ``If there is no struggle, there is no progress.''  Everyone in this body has a responsibility to be part of the struggle  and, through it, to be part of progress. Everyone in this body has a  responsibility to embrace struggle, even when it occurs right here on  this floor, if it is in the name of progress.   I am talking about protecting the Voting Rights Act. The right to  vote is fundamental to every democracy. Every vote counts and must be  counted fairly.   I am talking about ending the senseless and discriminatory practice  of racial profiling. It is painful that, in 2017, we still need to  explain that Americans should not be considered suspects or targets  because of the color of their skin.   I am talking about criminal justice reform--and prioritizing criminal  justice reform in this Congress.   I am talking about recognizing the incredible contributions of  Frederick Douglass, Dorothy Height, Harriet Tubman, Katherine Johnson,  Mae Jemison, and others in our public school curricula.   Many Americans would not even recognize their names, and that is a  tragic failure on our part to honor Black history.   I am talking about not just talking, but committing to these causes  through actions around our States and through legislation right here in  this Chamber. Whether through passing my End Racial Profiling Act or my  National Security Diversity and Inclusion Workforce Act or any other  bills introduced by my colleagues, Black History Month reminds us that  we can and must do more. Let us begin by remembering that Black history  is American history. Their story is our story. When we celebrate Black  pioneers and activists and inventors and artists, we celebrate the  diversity and the strength of character that are the reasons we are  here today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to shine a spotlight on the  dire security and humanitarian situation in northeastern Nigeria and  the Lake Chad basin, precipitated by Boko Haram, and to urge the new  administration to organize quickly to address it. Nigeria has been  referred to as one of the anchor states of sub-Saharan Africa and our  bilateral relationship is one of our most important on the continent.  It is the most populous country on the continent. It has the biggest  economy. It has contributed troops to regional and U.N. peacekeeping  missions for decades and is a major oil-producing country. Nigeria's  population is forecast to grow to 400 million by 2050, overtaking the  United States and becoming the world's third most populous country.  Nigeria's political and economic influence in the region is difficult  to overstate, and it will only increase as the population and economy  grow.   That is why I joined Senator Corker in writing to President Obama  urging high-level engagement with Nigeria in the wake of the 2015  elections, elections which, while perhaps not perfect, turned out to be  a positive story of respect for democracy in the region. For the first  time in the nation's history, there was a peaceful transition of power  between opposing political parties. Though people feared the worst,  Nigerians proved they can be leaders on the continent and in the world.  However, for Nigeria to fully realize its enormous promise, it must  deal with a range of challenges from rampant corruption, to insecurity  and intercommunal violence in the Niger Delta and the Middle Belt,  tensions in the southeast, and most immediately the continuing threat  Boko Haram poses in northeastern Nigeria and other countries in the  Lake Chad basin. It is critical that we help with these efforts.   Since 2010, Boko Haram has devastated northeastern Nigeria. According  to the 2016 Global Terrorism Index, Boko Haram has the chilling  distinction of being among the deadliest terrorist groups in history,  with the second highest death toll from attacks out of all terrorist  groups since 2000. In recent years, its attacks have spread to  Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. The group, which pledged allegiance to ISIS  in 2015 and now calls itself the Islamic State West Africa Province,  has killed almost 16,000 people. Thousands of others have died as a  result of clashes between the military and Boko Haram. The terrorist  group has kidnapped thousands, including nearly 300 girls from Chibok  in April 2014. The whereabouts of almost 200 of the girls remains  unknown.   Countries in the Lake Chad basin are experiencing what U.N. officials  and aid workers have called a forgotten crisis as a result of the  terrorist group's activities. Nearly 2 million people have been  displaced in Nigeria alone. Two hundred thousand Nigerians have fled  across borders as refugees. Eight-and-a-half million people in  northeast Nigeria are in need of humanitarian assistance. Nearly 2  million people are estimated to be at risk for starvation. Continued  insecurity has prevented aid workers from reaching some areas, so the  actual needs may be even greater. Last November, Doctors Without  Borders expressed fears that malnutrition could wipe out the under-5  population in parts of Nigeria's Borno state.   In his 2015 inaugural address, President Muhammadu Buhari cited Boko  [[Page S1298]]  Haram as the most pressing issue facing his administration, and to his  credit, he has taken some action. The command center for counter Boko  Haram operations has been relocated to Maiduguri, and Nigerians are  coordinating military action with other countries in the Lake Chad  basin. However, despite the Nigerian Government's claims, Boko Haram  has not been largely defeated, and attacks continue. Just last month,  the Nigerian military warned of a horrifying new tactic: women suicide  bombers carrying babies in order to evade detection.   The reports of continued attacks are profoundly disturbing. As  tempting as it is to focus on a military solution, we must be very wary  of falling into the trap of thinking that the scourge of Boko Haram can  be overcome through military means alone. It is critical that we  continue to encourage and support the Nigerian Government's use of all  of all available tools to counter violent extremism in the northeast.  The Obama administration engaged former President Goodluck Jonathan on  the need to develop a holistic civilian-security focused  counterterrorism strategy, one that addresses legitimate political and  economic grievances in affected communities, but that approach was  never fully embraced.   There has been movement towards a countering violent extremism  approach under President Buhari's leadership, and we should continue to  encourage Nigerians to do more. One of the most important ways to  engender the trust of the population is to provide access to justice  for human rights abuses by security forces. After nearly 2 years in  office, Buhari has yet to keep commitments to do so. The government  created a human rights desk for the national army last year, which I  welcome, but the establishment of the desk in and of itself is not  enough. The military has made very serious mistakes for which it must  be held accountable.   In mid-2015, Amnesty International released a report alleging that  the deaths of 8,000 civilians are attributable to the Nigerian military  in northeast Nigeria. The report calls for the investigation of  specific military commanders who are alleged to have had knowledge of  torture, extrajudicial killings, and arbitrary detentions in  overcrowded facilities that lead to thousands of deaths. Buhari said he  would launch an investigation. However, we have yet to see any one  prosecuted, tried, or convicted. The results of a commission of  judicial inquiry into the massacre of more than 300 people in the  northern city of Zaria in December 2015 were made public last year. The  inquiry found that the deaths were a result of excessive force on the  part of the Nigerian army. To date, there has been no action on the  part of the federal government to hold abusive security forces  accountable. Impunity for human rights abuses serves to undermine all  of the work we are doing to counter violent extremism.   In addition to widespread allegations of extrajudicial killings,  there are accusations that the military has stolen humanitarian  supplies and sexually exploited and abused those living in camps for  internally displaced. And many of those freed from Boko Haram have been  kept in internment camps for indefinite amounts of time, subject to a  screening process that appears inconsistent and is not transparent.  Internally displaced persons have reported that the military and local  militia take men and boys seeking refuge in camps for screening and  they are never seen again. All of these actions have a deleterious  effect on efforts to win the hearts and minds of the communities of the  northeast, a critical objective to any strategy to defeat Boko Haram.   Military impunity is why I remain leery of the proposed sale of Super  Tucano fighter aircraft to Nigeria. Now is not the time for the United  States to focus on the provision of aircraft and heavy munitions,  especially in the wake of the Nigerian Airforce's bombing of a camp for  IDPs last month that may have killed up to 200 innocent people and  injured many more. Make no mistake. I support security assistance  provided in compliance with the Leahy laws. But I support assistance  that will have an actual impact on the Nigerian military's  effectiveness. Lack of airpower or munitions are not its problem. The  real impediments to success include poor command and control,  insufficient air to ground coordination, impunity for human rights  abuses, and little to no experience working with local communities and  humanitarian partners. Addressing those issues could have an enormous  impact on the ground.   To help Nigeria respond to the challenges in the northeast, I urge  the new administration to take three steps immediately. First, increase  our overall humanitarian assistance budget. The administration should  ensure that the President's budget request for fiscal year 2018  provides increased baseline funding for all foreign assistance  programs. Such funding is currently 30 percent lower than it was in  fiscal year 2010, and it is critical that we return baseline funding to  a normal and sustainable level following several years of inadequate  requests. An approach that erodes baseline funding while temporarily  substituting emergency funds is not workable if the United States wants  to continue to set an example in the world. An increase in the budget  will enable us to make a significant pledge at the February 24 donors  conference in Oslo. We have been generous, but the scale of the  emergency demands that we--and our partners--do more. The United States  has always led the international response to emergencies such as these,  and we must continue to do so. But we can't get blood from a rock.  There is no way we can provide adequate money to help the traumatized  people in Nigeria and other countries of the Lake Chad basin unless we  ensure that the budget for humanitarian assistance is robust without  relying on transient funding like OCO. I encourage the administration  to continue to inform Congress of the status of the humanitarian  response, so that we can work as a unified government to help the  people of Nigeria overcome the destruction left in the wake of Boko  Haram.   Nor can we afford a draconian cut to our contributions to  international organizations. The World Food Program, WFP, is just  beginning to scale up its operations in northeastern Nigeria. But it is  under enormous strain. In December, the organization was forced to cut  the amount of food it is providing to people in the Central African  Republic due to insufficient resources. In fact, funding for CAR is so  scarce that in 2016 it was able to give aid to less than a third the  number of people it aimed to support. A new drought in Ethiopia has  left 5.6 million people in urgent need of assistance according to  authorities. The U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Somalia, Peter de  Clercq, warned earlier this month that, without a massive scale up in  assistance, parts of Somalia may face famine. Needs in South Sudan  continue to rise, with warnings of famine on the horizon. Slashing  funding to WFP would be incredibly unwise, as would deep cuts to UNFPA.  Women have suffered enormously in this conflict. UNFPA is on the ground  supporting mechanisms to both prevent and respond to gender-based  violence and care for pregnant women and newborns. We cannot let the  specific needs of women and girls go unmet.   Second, the new administration must work with career experts to surge  our capacity on the ground. The administration needs to make clear that  the current hiring freeze will not affect lifesaving efforts here or  abroad, and Embassy Abuja should approve USAID's request to station  additional humanitarian experts at post as quickly as possible. We need  experienced people working with the Nigerian Government and the  international community to coordinate more effective aid delivery. I  applaud the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, for  dispatching a disaster assistance response team, DART, to Nigeria in  November to support government of Nigeria-led efforts to reduce food  insecurity in the Boko Haram-affected regions of the country's  northeast. The country has not faced a humanitarian emergency like this  in a generation. National and state emergency management agencies are  overtaxed, have little familiarity with providing a large-scale aid  response, and are not accustomed to working with the U.N. in this  manner. Our aid professionals can help. Let me be clear; Nigeria must  continue to do its part. It is imperative that  [[Page S1299]]  President Buhari set a positive cooperative tone with the international  community. However, there is no question that we must continue our  robust humanitarian response.   Finally, we must get smart about our security assistance. Agreeing to  sell planes with more sophisticated targeting systems that will not be  on the ground for 2 more years will not fix what is broken with respect  to the Nigerian military's response in the north. Right now--today--we  and our international partners should redouble our efforts to work with  the Nigerians to develop a list of short-term interventions and a long- term plan to address issues related to military professionalism,  accountability, improved command and control, more effective  communication between and within services, strategic planning,  logistics, and auditing. The strategic governance initiative is a step  in the right direction, but we must take action that will translate  into results in the field as quickly as possible.   The situation in Nigeria is urgent. Few Americans are aware of the  importance of Nigeria to the United States or the degree of suffering  in northeastern Nigeria, but those of us who are policymakers cannot  afford to drop the ball on our support of Nigeria's fight against Boko  Haram or for those suffering in the Lake Chad basin. I recognize that  it seems to some people that we are being called on to do more now  internationally than ever. But we can do this. We are the Nation that  conceived the Marshall Plan, worked with allies to execute the Berlin  Airlift, and more recently, developed and implemented PEPFAR. We are up  to the task. And we are not alone. Where America leads, our partners  will follow. And I strongly encourage them to do so. Failure to  redouble our efforts in these areas could mean that ISIS will gain a  foothold in West Africa for a generation.   I thank my colleagues.                            ____________________
