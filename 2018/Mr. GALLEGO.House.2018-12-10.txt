 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5513. This bill authorizes an  equal value land exchange between the U.S. Forest Service and San  Bernardino County.   The exchange would allow the county to build a resource conservation  and recovery facility adjacent to the current transfer station. The  Forest Service would receive an undeveloped parcel currently surrounded  by the San Bernardino National Forest.   H.R. 5513 is supported by the nearby city of Big Bear, by the Friends  of Big  [[Page H9775]]  Bear Valley, and by the local chapter of the Sierra Club.   I thank my colleague, Representative Cook, for working to address  some of our concerns with earlier drafts of this bill. Thanks to his  efforts, we have ensured this exchange will be subject to existing law,  that it will preserve critical and occupied habitat for endangered  species, and that the exchange will have minimal impacts on the Pacific  Crest National Scenic Trail.   H.R. 5513 demonstrates how a collaborative process can meet the  interests of local stakeholders, while protecting the integrity of our  environment and public lands.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this piece of  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6108, which authorizes  additional funding for the Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program.   This program has a long track record of efficiently and cost- effectively preserving battlefield sites from the American Revolution,  the Civil War, and the War of 1812.   By utilizing public-private funding matches, through which Federal  contributions are leveraged with private sector funds, the program  maximizes the preservation impact of every dollar spent. It is critical  that we extend this grant matching program because many of these  historic battlefield sites lack permanent protection and are under  threat from encroaching development. If we don't act swiftly, we could  soon lose access to sites of significant historical importance.   By extending additional funding to this program, and by allowing a  portion of this new funding to go towards educational and interpretive  upgrades at these sites, we ensure that future generations of Americans  will always remember the sacrifices made to preserve our Nation.   Unfortunately, I worry that this legislation, as important as it is  for preserving our Nation's history, rings somewhat hollow.   We need to recognize that the grant program H.R. 6108 extends is  funded through the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which expired in  September for the second time this Congress.   At our committee's hearing on H.R. 6108, our distinguished witness  from the American Battlefield Trust recognized that this proposal  doesn't hold water unless LWCF is reauthorized.   Mr. Speaker, while I rise in support of H.R. 6108, I also urge my  colleagues to support the permanent reauthorization of LWCF.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes a special resource study of the  George W. Bush Childhood Home to determine the significance of the site  and the feasibility of designating it as a unit of the National Park  Service. The home in Midland, Texas, is where George W. Bush lived for  4 years between the ages of 5 and 9, and not coincidentally, it is also  where George H.W. Bush lived at the beginning of his political career.   The structure is listed in the National Register of Historic Places  and currently operates as a museum. I support the proposed study to  consider designating this site a unit of the National Park Service and  determine the appropriate management to ensure its preservation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to  honor the contributions and war efforts made by American cities during  World War II, including the work by these cities to preserve this  history.   This bill honors the history of our Nation and enshrines the efforts  made by American cities that were integral to our success in World War  II.   For example, Wilmington, North Carolina, constructed 243 cargo  vessels, served as a base for all five military branches, hosted German  prisoners of war, and dispatched thousands of soldiers to fight.   Current efforts to preserve this history include landmarks such as  the Battleship North Carolina and the Hannah Block Historic USO  Building. This will give the Secretary the authority to validate these  contributions, along with those of countless other cities that  contributed to the war effort.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Rouzer for his work on this bill,  and I am happy to voice my support of it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill provides a number of benefits for the  territories of the United States: Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,  Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana  Islands. It adds them to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act,  allowing them to begin developing offshore wind in their waters, a  potentially crucial source of new clean energy for their residents. It  sets up a system by which the territories receive a share of the  revenue generated by any new offshore wind development.   Currently, our territories rely primarily on imported diesel for  generating electricity, putting them at high risk of supply disruptions  and forcing  [[Page H9780]]  residents there to pay some of the highest electricity rates anywhere  in the country, particularly when oil prices spike.   As hurricanes and extreme weather events continue to challenge the  energy security of these territories, developing offshore wind will  make for more resilient communities, decrease dependency on fossil  fuels, and potentially bring electricity prices down significantly.   However, because the territories are currently not covered by the  Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, there is no legal mechanism for  putting wind turbines in the waters off their coastlines. This bill  fixes this longstanding unfairness, offers them a share of any revenues  generated by offshore wind, and also protects their coastlines by  leaving them off of the offshore oil and gas leasing process.   Additionally, some of the revenues generated by this bill are  allocated to the Coral Reef Conservation Program, preserving,  sustaining, and restoring the condition of coral reef ecosystems that,  in many cases, are crucial for the environment and tourism economy of  these same territories.   H.R. 6665 is a commonsense bill for the growth and success of U.S.  territories and the environment, while also providing new sources of  clean, carbon-free energy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we talk a lot about leveling the playing field when it  comes to economic development on Tribal lands. Passage of S. 245, the  Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act Amendments  of 2017, will help achieve that goal in the area of energy development.   Tribes have stated for years that the many Federal laws governing the  development of Tribal energy resources are complex and often lead to  significant costs, delays, and uncertainties for all parties. This  tends to discourage development of Tribal trust energy resources and  drive development investments to private or non-Tribal lands, resulting  in Tribes losing out on much-needed revenue and jobs.   S. 245 will provide Tribes with greater control and flexibility in  developing and managing both their traditional and renewable energy  resources, so I am happy to support this bill today. But this is just a  start.   In the next Congress, I hope we can work together to pass legislation  that addresses the other disparities that hinder Tribal economic  development as well as incentivize renewable energy development on  Tribal lands.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, based on recent conversations with the Committee on  Energy and Commerce Democratic staff, I would also like to note that  the Senate has included an amendment to the Federal Power Act in this  bill that contains the definition of the term ``Indian Tribe'' for the  purposes of section 7(a) of the act. The intent of the Senate seems to  be to ensure that Alaska Natives are included within that term.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, currently and  historically has interpreted the term ``Indian Tribe'' in the Federal  Power Act to include Alaska Native villages or regional or village  corporations. Explicitly including this reference in the amended  section 7(a) should in no way be interpreted to exclude Alaska Native  villages or regional or village corporations within the meaning of the  term ``Indian Tribe'' elsewhere in this act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium,  composed of 18 Native communities, is one of the oldest and largest  Native-run health organizations in the Nation. The consortium operates  the Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital in Sitka, Alaska, which serves as a regional  hospital for people throughout southeast Alaska.   At 67 years old, the Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital is the oldest facility in  Alaska and one of the oldest in the Nation. As such, it is in dire need  of updates and repairs.   However, the title to the hospital is currently held by the Indian  Health Service. In order to obtain the financing necessary to  facilitate the renovations, it is necessary for the consortium to hold  unencumbered warranty title to the land. S. 825 will convey the land to  the consortium by warranty title to ensure that the process moves  forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 2511 directs NOAA to coordinate the use and data  collection of unmanned maritime systems, including with the Navy. In  addition, this bill directs NOAA to regularly assess how these  technologies can be used to support NOAA's missions.   Unmanned maritime systems are exciting new technologies that are  remotely operated or autonomous vehicles used to collect data for  seafloor mapping, atmospheric conditions, wave heights, water  temperature, salinity, and carbon dioxide content. They can even be  used to study marine mammals and help with fishery management.   This is an important bill that embraces 21st century technology to  address the increasing challenges and needs facing our oceans today.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I commend Senators Wicker and  Schatz and Congressmen Palazzo and Panetta for their work on this  bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of  this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
