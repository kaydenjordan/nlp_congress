 Mr. Chair, my amendment to H.R. 7780 would establish  that parents have the right to be informed of any mental health-related  issues with their children. In other words, schools may not hide  critical information from parents.   Before my colleagues say this isn't necessary or this isn't needed,  just open social media. You will find examples of teachers and school  personnel bragging about how they covertly discuss transgender issues  with their students, regardless of their accordance with schools or  State laws.   I think it is disappointing that it has come to this, that on the  House floor, we have to make an affirmative case for parents' rights.  Yet, here we are.   School officials and personnel are not the parents. School officials  and personnel have no right to ignore a parent's decision on what they  think is best for their child.   This amendment protects both parents and students. It would ensure  that parents are never excluded from their children's health  conversations and that teachers and administrators can't make these  decisions unilaterally.   If you want to protect children, believe in families and support  hardworking parents, then you must agree with us and support our motion  to recommit.   Every mother and father in this Chamber should want to know what is  happening with their children. Every one of us has the right to know  what a person is telling our child.   If we adopt the motion to recommit, we will instruct the Committee on  Education and Labor to consider my amendment, H.R. 7780, to protect  parents' rights.   I include in the Record the text of the amendment.        Add at the end the following:                        TITLE VIII--PARENTAL RIGHTS       SEC. 801. PARENTAL CONSENT AND NOTICE OF PARENTAL RIGHTS.         (a) Informed Parental Consent.--A covered grantee shall       ensure that each parent of a child served by such grantee--        (1) receives the notice of parental rights described in       subsection (b); and        (2) provides informed written consent before the grantee       offers or provides any mental health or other social and       emotional services to the parent's child.  [[Page H8239]]         (b) Notice of Parental Rights.--A covered grantee shall       provide to each parent of a child served by the grantee       written notice of any mental health or other social and       emotional services that may be offered to the child by such       grantee, including--        (1) mental health assessments;        (2) counseling for individual students or group sessions;        (3) any group or individual session related to the child's       or other children's sexual orientation or gender identity;        (4) clubs or other after school activities related to       mental health or other social and emotional learning;        (5) curriculum used to discuss social and emotional       learning or other mental health needs;        (6) books made available to students for discussion of       social and emotional or mental health needs;        (7) interventions utilized by staff to address students'       mental health or other social and emotional needs; and        (8) any evaluations or data collection used to assess       students' individual or school wide mental health or other       social and emotional needs.        (c) Covered Grantee Defined.--In this section, the term       ``covered grantee'' means any entity receiving funds under       title I, II, III, or IV, including a State educational       agency, local educational agency, or Head Start grantee.     Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment  so we can provide the assurance to parents that they have the right to  protect their children.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
