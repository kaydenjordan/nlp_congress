 I thank the chairman.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the Regulatory  Accountability Act.   This bill represents a monumental opportunity for the American  people. After 8 years of one new crushing regulatory burden after  another, the time has come to finally free the American people and  create a new future for our economy.   In 2017, regulatory burdens are at record levels. One recent analysis  by the American Action Forum puts the cumulative paperwork burden on  the American people at 11.5 billion hours.   How could any small business person or entrepreneur survive in the  face of this monstrous web of regulation?   The short answer is that they cannot.   It is a fact seen across my district as I have talked to workers  covering every industry or occupation imaginable. When I ask  businessowners about their concerns, first and foremost, the greatest  hardship they face is the burden of Federal regulation and red tape.  Funds, which otherwise could be invested in new employees, training, or  equipment, must be dedicated to the demands of faceless bureaucrats in  D.C. This applies to plumbers as well as to farmers, manufacturers to  home builders. The list of those affected is long and varied.   The simple truth is that the Obama administration's one-size-fits-all  regulatory agenda has been a disaster for the American Dream, and we  have seen over the past several months how disconnected it was from the  wants and needs of Americans across the country.   In Congress, however, we have heard their pleas and have taken action  in the early days of the 115th Congress. H.R. 5 is the third regulatory  reform bill we have considered in 2 weeks. It represents our brightest  opportunity to unleash innovation and investment so that American  businesses, big and small, can create new futures.    I am also grateful that H.R. 5 includes my bill, the REVIEW Act. The  REVIEW Act was featured as part of Speaker Ryan's A Better Way agenda  and passed the House on a bipartisan basis last fall. It represents a  simple premise: regulations should be narrowly tailored, and massive  regulations deserve full and thorough scrutiny.   The REVIEW Act would mandate a stay of any high-impact, billion- dollar regulation while judicial review is underway. Historically,  billion-dollar rules have been few and far between. In fact, only 26  have been put in place since 2006; but, in recent years, their  frequency has grown along with the unprecedented reach of the  regulatory state. In the past 8 years, an average of three per year  have been put in place.   Their significance, however, lies in their impact on our country.  These regulations are massive and have the potential to fundamentally  and irreversibly change entire industries. If, later, judicial review  finds the agency's reasoning to be legally unsound or contrary to the  intent of Congress, the  [[Page H330]]  compliance costs incurred--often meaning jobs that were lost--cannot be  undone. The REVIEW Act provides an important check on regulatory  largesse and is an important piece of this bill.   The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. It is  time for us all to take our country and the economy in the right  direction. The Regulatory Accountability Act provides the reforms that  are necessary to get us there.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Young of Iowa). The gentleman from Pennsylvania  is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Young of Iowa). The gentleman from Pennsylvania  is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, the gentlewoman's amendment would strike from  the bill the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and the core judicial  review provisions of the Regulatory Accountability Act. The resulting  legislation, rather than restore an adequate framework of checks and  balances against agency overreach and abuse, would perpetrate and  perpetuate features among the worst of our current, runaway regulatory  system. We cannot complete true regulatory reform without restoring to  the judicial branch the vigorous powers of judicial review the  amendment would strike.   In addition, the bill would exclude from title I's critical  rulemaking reforms all rules to reduce the incidence of cancer,  premature mortality, asthma attacks, and respiratory diseases in  children and seniors.   All of us support the reduction of morbidity and mortality among  children and seniors. Rules to advance these goals, done properly,  contribute substantially to our Nation's health and well-being, but the  bill does nothing to frustrate the effective achievement of those  goals. It simply assures the agencies issuing these types of rules--and  all agency rulemaking in general--will avoid unnecessary and  overreaching regulation and issue smarter, less costly regulation and  guidance when necessary.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on the Castor amendment to protect children's health, to  protect the health of our older neighbors. We value the air that we  breathe.   H.R. 5 would inject unnecessary barriers into the ability of our  environmental agencies--heck, all of the agencies of government--to  protect us.   When it comes to the final bill itself, if you believe in checks and  balances as a foundation of our constitutionally-based government, I  urge my colleagues to oppose the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Chairman, I believe in the Constitution just like  everyone else does, and primarily we, as congressmen and congresswomen,  have  [[Page H356]]  a responsibility to make the laws, not unelected bureaucrats who have  no experience in a lot of the areas where they are making these laws.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Cicilline    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9  printed in part A of House Report 115-2.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Fortenberry). The gentleman from Pennsylvania  is recognized for 5 minutes.    Like the previous amendment, the gentleman's amendment  would strike from the bill the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and  core judicial review provisions of the Regulatory Accountability Act.  Faced with a runaway administrative state, we must not gut the bill's  crucial reinforcements of judicial checks and balances against agency  overreach and abuse. For this reason alone, the amendment should be  rejected.   In addition, the bill would exclude from title I's long-needed  rulemaking reforms numerous types of food safety regulations. All of us  support food safety. But the bill does nothing to frustrate the  protection of food safety. In fact, it clearly calls upon regulatory  agencies to achieve their statutory objectives in this and all areas.  Beyond that, it simply ensures that agency rulemaking will avoid  unnecessary and overreaching regulations and produce smarter, less  costly regulation and guidance when necessary.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I respectfully disagree with my friend and  NATO member. We have traveled together.   A lot of the delay now is because of the agencies and how long they  take to make decisions. With the premise behind our bills combined,  agencies come  [[Page H357]]  up with an idea that they think will improve the quality of life, and  that is what they should be doing. But then they immediately send it to  us in the House, in Congress, and then we make the determination as to  whether it is good law or it is bad law and apply it that way. We  certainly have the time in the House, and I am sure the Senate has the  time, too, to address these matters quickly and not delay it as long as  the agency has been delaying making rules.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island  will be postponed.              Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10  printed in part A of House Report 115-2.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 36, strike line 10 and all that follows through page       37, line 9.        Page 38, strike line 11 and all that follows through page       39, line 12.        Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and conform the       table of contents accordingly):                   TITLE VII--EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES       SEC. 701. EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES.         This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not       apply in the case of a rule (as such term is defined in       section 551 of title 5, United States Code) pertaining to       significantly improving the employment, retention, and wages       of workforce participants, especially those with significant       barriers to employment, such as persons with disabilities or       limited English proficiency. The provisions of law amended by       this Act, as in effect on the day before the date of the       enactment of this Act, shall apply to such rules.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my  amendment to H.R. 5 which would exempt from the bill rules that improve  the employment retention and wages of workforce participants,  especially those with significant barriers to employment.   When President Obama took office in 2009, he inherited the worse  economic depression since the Great Depression. Since then, President  Obama's ``North Star'' on domestic policy has long been to make the  economy work for the middle class and for those fighting to join it.  Notwithstanding historic austerity levels and a Republican Congress  more interested in winning elections than putting Americans back to  work or increasing wages, President Obama has largely achieved this  goal, while rescuing the auto industry and signing tax cuts for middle  class persons, as opposed to just simply big business.   According to the leading economic data, private sector businesses  have created more than 15 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has  dropped well below 5 percent to the lowest point in nearly a decade,  wages are rising, and the poverty rate has dropped to the lowest point  since 1968. And more people have health insurance than ever before.   This has all occurred during an administration that is pro  environment, pro clean energy, pro workplace safety, pro medical care,  pro Medicare, pro Medicaid, pro Social Security. In fact, during this  time, our Nation has doubled its production of clean energy and reduced  carbon emissions faster than any other advanced nation.   Notwithstanding this progress, there is still much work to be done  for millions of Americans in every part of our country who are out of  work, underemployed, or have not seen significant wage growth  postrecession. But they should understand it was the Republicans who  caused that to happen by not wanting to work with the President and  members of the Democratic Party to make things better for working  people in this country.   Congress should be working tirelessly now across party lines to find  solutions to persistent unemployment and stagnant wages, such as a  public infrastructure investment agenda that will increase productivity  and domestic output while turning the page on our historic  underinvestment in our Nation's roads, bridges, and educational  institutions.   Unfortunately, this bill, H.R. 5, is not one of those solutions. The  Regulatory Accountability Act is nothing short of a train wreck for  critical public health and safety protections that ensure that our air  is clean, our water is pure, and that our workplace, vehicles, homes,  and consumer products are safe.   Freeing corporations from the costs of protecting Americans against  harmful activity is not the right path forward to increasing employment  and wages for all. It is a giveaway to the corporate sector that  supports them. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5  minutes.    This amendment would strike from the bill the Separation  of Powers Restoration Act and the essential judicial review provisions  of the Regulatory Accountability Act. It, too, should be rejected for  those reasons.   In addition, the bill would exclude from title I's rulemakings  reforms numerous types of rule related to employment and wages. But  once again, the bill does nothing to prevent good rules in these areas.  On the contrary, it would produce better rules, rules that are smarter  and less costly, freeing resources for job creation and higher wages. I  urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time  to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I applaud Mr. Johnson, the ranking  member of the subcommittee for his leadership on these issues, and the  ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Conyers, for his persistent  leadership, having gone over this bill any number of times. Let me  mention that Mr. Johnson's amendment is vital because it deals with  vulnerable workforce individuals, individuals with disabilities,  limited English proficiency, and other requirements. And I would beg to  differ with my good friend from Pennsylvania, 70 different elements of  criteria that you will put these regulations through, you are simply  trying to implode those who advocate for the rights of workers, unions,  and others. Therefore, I would question the viability of trying to  obstruct, helping these vulnerable workers. This is a very good  amendment.   Let me be very clear. Since 2010, U.S. businesses have added 15.6  million jobs. From 2014 to 2015, real median household income grew by  5.2 percent. We know that, as Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of  Economic Advisers notes, demographic changes in labor force  participation, primarily driven by a large increase in retirement by  baby boomers that began in 2008, has consistently weighed on employment  growth. It is quite different from when President Reagan was in. The  labor force participation rate is low because of these variables.                                time  1645    These regulations are not going to improve that participation. The  Obama recovery has been slower because, under Reagan, we realized the  baby boomers were in their prime. Now the baby boomers are retiring.   We need to provide opportunities for younger workers, minority  workers, workers with disabilities; and this, H.R. 5, with all of these  hoops that the regulation has to go through that are protecting or  empowering workers or increasing the opportunities for workers is  certainly going to thwart that growth.   You cannot deny that this administration has seen growth with  200,000-plus jobs per month over a series of  [[Page H358]]  years. I would argue that Mr. Johnson's amendment is a strong  amendment. It promotes job growth, and it gives opportunities to many  who are vulnerable in the workforce.   I ask my colleagues to support the Johnson amendment.   Mr. Chair, my Republican colleagues have made several statements  concerning economic activity that invite fact checks:   First, they argue that the labor force participation rate is  historically low, but as we all know, the labor force participation is  affected by both long term trends and short term policies. As Jason  Furman, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, notes,  ``demograpic changes in labor force participation--primarily driven by  a large increase in retirement by baby boomers that began in 2008--have  consistently weighed on employment growth.''   Second, they argue that the Obama recovery has been slower than the  economic recovery under the Reagan Administration. But this argument is  laughable. President Reagan's recovery benefited from the fact that  many baby boomers were in the prime working years while President  Obama's recovery has taken place in front of the backdrop of an aging  U.S. population. More importantly, the economic lows of the Reagan  Administration are not comparable to the mortgage-foreclosure crisis,  which resulted in higher unemployment than any other period since the  Great Depression.   Finally, despite many bald assertions, my Republican colleagues have  not satisfactorily explained how H.R. 5 will create a single job or  responded to President Obama's unimpeachable jobs record. In fact,  despite, strong economic headwinds and years of Republican  obstructionism during the majority of his presidency, the U.S. economy  is 11.5 percent larger than its peak before the 2008 economic crisis as  of the third quarter of 2016.   Since early 2010, U.S. businesses have added 15.6 million jobs.   From 2014 to 2015, real median household income grew by 5.2 percent,  the fastest annual growth on record, and the United States saw its  largest one-year drop in the poverty rate since the 1960s.   In closing, there is little evidence supporting my Republican  colleagues' claims and if there is any doubt that the H.R. 5 will  undermine workforce participation, my colleagues should support my  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chair, I simply would add that I ask my colleagues to  oppose this amendment.   As far as the jobs increase, or lack thereof, that my colleague  speaks of, we have had the slowest growth rate in jobs in the history  of this country. There are millions of people that are unemployed that  are not seeking unemployment benefits, and they are not taken into  consideration in the unemployment rate because it is much higher than  it is; and the mean family income is at a low as far back as 14 years  ago.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield?    I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman for his kindness.   Would the gentleman not count automation and technology as one of the  elements and, as well, the idea of the retiring of baby boomers as part  of the issue of growth? And can we not work together to question those  particular elements so that we can collectively and collaboratively  promote job growth?    Well, first of all, I would certainly enjoy working on  job growth with the gentlewoman. We have worked on issues in the past.   But the gentlewoman forgets about the technology that has created  jobs. People have to write those programs. People have to build that  hardware. They have to come up with very intense, very intricate ways  to make the machinery, continue updating the software. My daughter is a  software major in college, and the jobs there are abundantly available.   So the jobs are there, but what I am hearing from people in my  district and across the country is the regulations that have been  imposed, not only by this administration but other administrations as  well, are crushing particularly our small businesses.   So if we can step back and eliminate these job-crushing regulations  and take into consideration the economics involved, we are going to  create more jobs, we are going to protect people, and we are going to  protect the health of people.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will  be postponed.                     Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Ruiz    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11  printed in part A of House Report 115-2.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, like other carve-out amendments just  offered, this amendment would strike from the bill the Separation of  Powers Restoration Act and the essential judicial review protections of  the Regulatory Accountability Act. It should be rejected. We should not  be settling for weak judicial review that produces rubber stamps of  agency action. We should be voting for the strong judicial review  reform in the bill that prevents judicial rubber stamps.   Beyond that, the bill would exclude from title I's rulemaking reforms  children's toys and product safety rules. But again, the bill does  nothing to prevent good rules in these areas. It will produce better  rules, rules that are smarter and less costly, freeing resources for  job creation and higher wages. Smarter rules are precisely what we need  to protect children's health and safety, and more jobs and higher wages  are what are needed to help families provide for their children.  [[Page H359]]    I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, respectfully, the gentleman does not have  the market cornered on worrying about the safety of our children. I  think anybody in this room who has children has just as much concern  for our children.   What his amendment does is gut--it guts--regulations, and what our  amendments do--and the way we should be handling these as Congress  making any laws--will improve the quality of life and improve the  protections.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I certainly respect what my friend on the  other side of the aisle has to say, but, again, I respectfully  disagree.   Once again, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would strike  from the bill the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and the  essential judicial review provisions of the Regulatory Accountability  Act. That would have but one effect: to preserve the freedom to run  riot that Washington bureaucrats have enjoyed for decades  [[Page H360]]  as they have racked up roughly $2 trillion in regulatory burdens on the  American people.   The amendment also would exclude from title I's rulemaking reforms  workplace safety rules issued by OSHA or the Mine Safety and Health  Administration to reduce traumatic injury, cancer, or lung disease.   I would urge my colleagues to read the bill and listen more closely.  The bill does nothing to prevent good rules in these areas. It will  produce better rules, smarter rules, less costly rules. That will free  up resources for desperately needed job creation, meaning more workers  will have more safe workplaces in which to earn a living.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1700    Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment will preserve the ability of the  executive branch to promulgate rules, which will save lives and avoid  preventable deaths and disease. A vote for the amendment is a vote for  a safe workplace. I would hope that the amendment would be adopted and  save lives.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. Tonko    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13  printed in part A of House Report 115-2.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, one last time, my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle would strike from the bill the Separation of Powers  Restoration Act and the judicial review provisions of the Regulatory  Accountability Act. One last time, that attempt should be rejected.  [[Page H361]]    We need a strong judiciary, not a supine one, to stand up to agency  overreach and abuse and protect the liberty and property of the America  from the long hands of Washington's restless bureaucrats.   The amendment also would exclude from title I's rulemaking reforms  rules issued under the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st  Century Act. Chemical safety is important to all of us. Congress worked  hard on chemical safety legislation. But it is smarter regulations,  supported by sounder science, at less cost that will best produce  chemical safety under that act. That is precisely the kind of  regulation that will happen once the 21st century rulemaking reforms in  the Regulatory Accountability Act become law.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, this bill's bold reforms deliver the heart  of the regulatory reform this Nation desperately needs; and I cannot  overstate how desperately we need it because, after 8 years of the  Obama administration's blowout administrative state, what do we have?   We have an economy that for 8 straight years has failed to produce  enough good, new, full-time jobs to sustain growth and restore dignity  to the unemployed. We have 92 million Americans outside the workforce,  a level not seen since the Carter years. We have nearly $2 trillion of  American wealth commandeered each year to be spent as Washington  bureaucrats demand, through runaway regulation--$2 trillion. This is  more money than the GDP of all but eight countries in the world.   We do not need a regulatory state that is that size; we need a  regulatory system that is cut down to size. And lest we ever forget, we  need a regulatory system that never again allows  [[Page H371]]  a runaway executive branch to do what the Obama administration did: use  a pen and a phone to undertake an end run around Congress and force on  the American people job-crushing policies that their elected  representatives in Congress never supported.   This motion to recommit turns a blind eye to all of that. It says to  the runaway administrative state: Keep on running as fast as you can;  we don't care. It says to the American people: Sit down and be quiet.  Washington bureaucrats are your betters, and you need to just keep  doing what they tell you to do.   Well, the hardworking taxpayers have spoken and yanked the boots of  unelected bureaucrats off the throats of hardworking Americans. Enough  is enough. Support this bill. Reject this motion to recommit. Show the  American people that they come first, not bureaucrats in Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
