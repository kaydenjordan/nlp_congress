 Mr. Speaker, in America, when we call the fire  department or enroll our children in school, we do not expect a  government official to say to us: ``I need you to do us a favor,  though.'' Why would we tolerate a President using his awesome power to  make foreign policy, when the safety of our country is at stake, not  for the people, but for himself?   I will vote to impeach today because President Trump did just that  when he shook down a foreign country to criminally investigate his  political rival.   If we fail to say that this was wrong, then any President will be  free to ask a foreign power--be it Russia, China, or Iran--to help him  hurt his political enemies at home, and every foreign tyrant and  kleptocrat will know that America's foreign policy can be bought by  doing our President a political favor.   If you believe that our highest duty is to protect America, then  search your conscience and ask: Do you want our future Presidents to  behave as this one has done?   Do not whisper in the shadows of the Capitol that you disapprove and  then defend that conduct here today. Do your duty. Keep your oath.  Defend your country, as will I.
