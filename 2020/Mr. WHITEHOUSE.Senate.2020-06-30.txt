 Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the  problem for which Senator Casey asked unanimous consent, which is of  the terrible plague of deaths in nursing homes across the country.   We just heard the chairman say that he is not sure what the air  traffic controllers have to do with his proposal on school safety. I am  not sure what his proposal on school safety has to do with nursing  homes. We came here to talk about nursing homes.   There are over 30,000 residents of nursing homes in this country who  have been killed by the COVID virus. If Senator Casey's numbers are  accurate, that is another 20,000 of stats. It is one in four deaths  from COVID-19 in the United States. Out of the 1.3 million Americans  residing in nursing or intermediate care settings, 30,000-plus have  passed away, and in some States, it is much worse.   Senator Hassan is here from New Hampshire, and she will talk about  her State. Senator Casey is here from Pennsylvania.   In Rhode Island, 60 percent of our deaths have occurred in long-term  care facilities. I know it is not just us but that it is going on  around the country. One in five nursing homes nationwide has reported a  COVID-related death, and as the disease explodes across parts of  California, explodes across Florida, and explodes across Arizona, you  know that this disease will have many more opportunities to attack many  more Americans in many more nursing homes.   So our bill is a really sensible one: resources to nursing homes for  staffing, for testing, for personal protective equipment, to support  the expense of doing sensible things like cohorting--putting the COVID  patients together to help contain the spread of the illness--and having  surge teams available for the really dread situation in which the COVID  sweeps through a facility with such ferocity that you can't get people  to come and work there because they all have to be isolated and  quarantined. You need special measures, special equipment, specially  trained people--folks beyond the ordinary employee base of the  facility--to come in and deal with that explosion, with things like  just best practices--identifying them, promulgating them--practices  that will keep residents and staff safe.   I am very disappointed that our Nursing Home COVID-19 Protection and  Prevention Act has been objected to by the Senate majority. If the  majority's notion is that we are doing so well that we can ignore this,  that all we need to do is take a very close look at the funding that  has already gone out, and that this is another victory we can declare-- mission accomplished; we are doing a wonderful job, Brownie; this is  great--no, not with 30,000 fatalities and climbing.   I yield the floor    Madam President, I rise today to recognize former  Congressman Ron Machtley from Rhode Island on his last day as president  of Bryant University. President Machtley has led Bryant for almost a  quarter century. During that time, he shepherded Bryant's transition  from a regionally focused business college to a university that  prepares students to succeed in a global economy.   A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Ron began his career in Active  Duty with the Navy and retired from the U.S. Naval Reserves in 1995  with the rank of captain. He practiced law for a time before winning  election to the U.S. House of Representatives. After leaving Congress,  Machtley stepped into the role of president at Bryant University, where  he has served for the past 24 years.   Bryant University was founded in Smithfield, RI, in 1863, in the  middle of the Civil War. Bryant was originally intended to be a place  Civil War veterans could learn the fundamentals of business and get a  fresh start. When Ron Machtley moved into the president's office,  Bryant College was still narrowly focused on business education. In  2004, President Machtley announced that Bryant would officially become  a university with two distinct colleges: the College of Business and  the College of Arts and Sciences.   President Machtley has put Bryant on the map in many other ways-- increasing enrollment, revitalizing the campus, and joining competitive  NCAA Division I athletics. Last year, an alltime high of more than  7,700 students from across the world applied for a spot in Bryant  University's freshman class. To help prepare students to compete in a  global economy, President Machtley established a new campus in Zhuhai,  China, and expanded the university's study abroad options. Bryant has  excelled at equipping students with the skills to earn success in  business and many other fields. Employers clearly recognize the value  of a degree from Bryant--99 percent of the class of 2019 was employed  or pursuing an advanced degree within 6 months of graduation.   I wish President Machtley an active and enjoyable retirement, and I  thank him for his dedicated service to the Bryant community.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today, along with my senior  [[Page S4030]]  colleague Senator Reed, to mark the last day of Father Brian Shanley's  tenure at Providence College, where he has served as president for 15  years. Father Shanley is the longest serving president in the history  of Providence College and the only native Rhode Islander to have had  the role.   A graduate of Providence College himself, Father Shanley has led the  Catholic liberal arts college--the country's only higher learning  institution run by the Dominican Friars--through a decade and a half of  change. He has greatly increased P.C.'s national profile and overseen  major capital improvements to the campus, all while ensuring the school  remains true to its principles and a good neighbor in the Elmhurst  section of Providence. Father Shanley created a College of Business to  expand the school's offerings beyond its signature liberal arts  curriculum and a Center for Global Education to foster opportunities  abroad for students. He has taken strides to increase diversity by  investing in financial aid, transitioning to a test-optional admissions  model, and recruiting students and faculty from different backgrounds.  And, of course, P.C. has cultivated a national reputation for its  stellar basketball and hockey programs with Father Shanley at the helm.   I would like to add on a personal note how cordial and gracious  Father Shanley has been in all my dealings with him and with Providence  College in his tenure. It has been a true pleasure to work and interact  with him.   I wish Father Shanley the very best in his well-earned retirement. Go  Friars!                            ____________________
