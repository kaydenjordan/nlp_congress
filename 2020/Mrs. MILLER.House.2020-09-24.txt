 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor our Nation's brave law  enforcement officials who protect our communities from violent crime.   Just weeks ago, in West Virginia, a Fayette County deputy, Levi  Garretson, was attacked during a traffic stop. Thankfully, volunteer  firefighter, Calvin Endicott, was nearby to help fight off the  attacker.   Because of Mr. Endicott's actions, Deputy Garretson was able to go  home that night. Sadly, this is not the case for many officers in our  country. This growing hatred is appalling. Incredibly, some of my  colleagues across the aisle call to defund the police.   Our country was founded on ideals that promote civility and security  for all Americans. We need to unify around a shared goal of law and  order, to stop the rioters and anarchists who burn our cities and  threaten our law enforcement.   I will always stand with our brothers and sisters in uniform.                            ____________________
