 Mr. President, just over a year ago, President Trump  signed into law a major bipartisan bill, the SUPPORT Act, to help  combat the opioid and drug epidemic that is devastating this country. I  call that a very good first step in this long fight, and now we must  continue working to do even more.   Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for those under age  50 in the United States. Our country is in the middle of a major opioid  and meth crisis, and the sad reality is, this epidemic isn't slowing  down anytime soon. It has been said that meth is the next wave of the  opioid crisis.   Sadly, in my home State of Montana, that wave is already reality.  Meth is destroying Montana families and communities. As I travel across  Montana, I hear far too many heartbreaking stories of addiction and  tragedy. From Great Falls to Wibaux, to the Flathead and across Indian  Country, the stories are all too real.   We need to do more to put an end to the tragic stories we are seeing  in the news--no more stories of babies being born addicted to meth; no  more stories of meth breaking up families; no more stories of babies  being left in the forest--literally left in the forest--because their  parents were high on meth. These stories are real, and their impacts  are real.   Montana's meth crisis is claiming lives, breaking up families, and  leaving our foster care systems overcrowded and sometimes overloaded.  It is leading to a significant rise in violent crime. In fact, from  2011 to 2017, there was a 415-percent increase in meth cases in  Montana, with meth-related deaths rising 375 percent during those same  years.   In Montana, the meth crisis is disproportionately impacting Native  American Tribes. Enough is enough. That is why I fought to include my  legislation, the Mitigating METH Act, which strengthens Indian Tribes'  ability to combat drug use, in the SUPPORT Act that was signed into law  just last year.   That historic and comprehensive legislation was a great first step,  but there is a lot more work that needs to be done, and tangible things  can be done.   In Montana--we are a northern border State, but we have a southern  border crisis. I say that for a very clear reason. There is no denying  the fact that the meth that is invading Montana and that is devastating  Montana is Mexican cartel meth. It is not homegrown meth anymore; it is  Mexican cartel meth that is smuggled across the southern border.   Mexican meth is cheaper and more potent. In fact, several years ago,  the meth we saw in Montana was homegrown meth. It had potency levels  around 25 percent. Today, the Mexican cartel meth has a potency level  of over 90 percent. That results in a much more dangerous form of meth.  It is much more widespread, and the price has dropped.   I have met with Montanans across our State--whether it is law  enforcement, doctors, nurses, treatment facility professionals--to come  together, to work together, and to help combat the meth crisis we see  in Montana. I am committed to fighting for more resources that give law  enforcement and Border Patrol the tools they need to fight this  epidemic. I will also continue to advocate for stronger support for  treatment and care for our most vulnerable. Those who are addicted to  meth need help, and they need compassion.   One thing we absolutely must do to help combat the drug epidemic is  to secure our southern border because without secure borders, these  illegal drugs and meth will continue to come across that southern  border and have easy access into our country and into States like  Montana. I won't stand by and let this be the norm.   Earlier this summer, I was honored to welcome Vice President Pence  and Karen Pence to Billings. They got to see this crisis firsthand.  They got to hear directly from law enforcement and Montana families  impacted by the crisis. I saw Vice President Pence and Mrs. Pence  sitting around a table inside a facility that is helping moms who are  addicted to meth and who are working with moms and their children to  get better. They were telling their stories about how they have gotten  better through treatment at the Rimrock Foundation facility there in  Billings and starting out a much brighter chapter in their lives  because of the help provided from Rimrock.   I stand with President Trump. I stand with his administration as we  [[Page S6280]]  work together to secure our borders and protect our communities from  illegal drugs and to end this crisis.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Dottie Wilson of Hill County for her tremendous impact on  the north central Montana community of Havre.   Dottie, a former baker at Grateful Bread, took a tremendous leap of  faith and made the decision to open her own bakery, Infinity Bake  Shoppe LLC in April of 2017.   Dottie's bakery offers a variety of baked goods including cookies,  pastries, scones, and cinnamon rolls, as well as three different  varieties of baked donuts, soups, and lunch items.   Since Infinity Bake Shoppe opened, it has been a great addition to  the Havre community. Dottie did not anticipate her new business would  take off so quickly, but folks from all across the HiLine are lining up  for her baked goods.   Dottie said she was inspired to start her own business in order to  provide her daughter Keeley with a more purposeful future. Keeley, who  has Williams syndrome, followed in her mother's entrepreneurial spirit  and opened up, Lady Bug Bites LLC, making and selling treats for dogs  and cats.   It is my honor to recognize Dottie Wilson for her hard work and  talent in opening up Infinity Bake Shoppe LLC. She is a fine example of  the type of entrepreneurship coming from Montana Main Street  businesses.                            ____________________
