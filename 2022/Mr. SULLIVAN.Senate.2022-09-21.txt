 Mr. President, there has been much made in the Biden  administration about the value of diversity, and I agree that having  diversity in any organization is positive. You get different  viewpoints. But diversity encompasses much more than race or gender or  religious orientation. Those are all important. Diversity actually  means having people around you with varied experiences. As I mentioned,  in my mind, that is certainly important, but it is particularly  important in the Oval Office, particularly important in the White  House. It is particularly important in the leadership of our Federal  Government.   Let's take the example of military experience in this administration.  You would think the Biden administration would think it is important to  have members in his Cabinet or senior White House officials who have  served in the military. After all, he is the Commander in Chief, a very  important part of his responsibilities. But, in fact, virtually no one  in this administration, with the exception of Secretary Austin, at the  highest levels--Cabinet officials, senior White House officials--have  any significant military experience at all.   Why does this matter? The President doesn't have it, of course. His  Secretary of the VA, Chief of Staff, National Security Advisor--just go  down the list. Nobody has any experience.   In the Federal Government of the United States, why does this matter?  It matters because it is obvious by the people this President surrounds  himself--the people who are giving him advice on big decisions for  America--that this President doesn't prioritize military, our national  defense, and our troops and their families. This manifests itself in  many, many ways.    First, most importantly, it matters in how we fund our national  defense. I was on the floor last week, speaking about this very topic.  This is President Biden's first budget. You can see this here, what he  proposed. It has the increases through every Federal Agency. This was a  multitrillion-dollar budget. And it says this is what we are  prioritizing as the Biden administration. You can see, heck, double- digits. That is Education and Commerce. And EPA is over 20 percent, and  Interior over 15 percent--on and on and on, all the green. It is just a  massive expansion of Federal Agencies, except two Agencies: Department  of Defense and Homeland Security, the two Agencies that actually  protect Americans.   If you look to this line of inflation, which when the Biden  administration put out their budget last year was about 4.5 percent,  these are actual inflation-adjusted real cuts by about 2 to 3 percent  to our military. That was the Biden budget not prioritizing our troops,  our national security at all. My view is that that is the No. 1 job of  this government. It is not the President's view, not his team's view.   In the interim--that was last year's budget--we had a war in Ukraine.  We had the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of Defense  testify in front of the Armed Services Committee that we are probably  seeing the most dangerous time globally in any time in the last 40  years.   So what about the Biden budget this year?   Mr. President, you did it again.   This is actually EPA, a 25-percent increase--wow.   But here we go, all the big double-digit increases. When you get down  to the Department of Defense, with now the 9 percent Biden inflation,  we are talking a 5-percent real cut to our military. That is not  prioritizing our military.   You are starting to see how this inflation and other things are  really impacting our troops. The Army, last week, in an article,  suggested that the American military members who are having trouble  making ends meet because of high levels of inflation should go on food  stamps. You heard that correct. We are going to give the EPA a 25- percent raise. We are going to cut defense spending by a 5-percent real  cut, and if you are a soldier struggling because of high inflation to  actually put food on the table, you can go get food stamps. That is the  perfect example of not prioritizing our military.   I want to unpack this further. The Army is saying that, if our troops  don't have enough food to eat, they should look at going on food  stamps. But the President finds it absolutely essential to forgive $560  billion in student loan debt just a couple of weeks ago. Who are the  preponderance of Americans who will benefit from that lawless bailout?  High-earning Americans, the elite--White House staffers, certainly.  They are going to get a half-trillion-dollar bailout, and our troops  are being told to go on food stamps. This should shock every single  American.   So we know the President and his team don't prioritize the military.  Look at these budgets or our troops or our national security. But that  doesn't mean they don't find the military useful. I am going to put up  a picture of a recent speech that, I will tell you, every time I look  at it, my blood boils, and so should every American's blood boil.   It is this picture.   Now, every President gives partisan speeches. Now, I don't think it  is wise for every President to give the kind of partisan speech that  President Biden gave on September 1 in Philadelphia in which he  vilified millions, tens of millions of his fellow Americans who don't  agree with his administration's policies. Some of you may have seen  that speech. The President told the country that many of his fellow  Americans, all of whom are Republican, don't ``respect the  Constitution,'' are ``destroying American democracy.'' He gave this  speech against a blood-red backdrop, fists clenched--look at him-- yelling that millions of his fellow Americans embrace anger--while he  embraced anger in his speech--and chaos. This President who continually  issues lawless Executive orders, like shutting down the ANWR in my  State, his half-a-trillion-dollar student loan bailout, then says that  Republicans are ``against the rule of law.'' He went on and on--the  insults, very partisan, somewhat deranged, attacking tens of millions  of his fellow Americans.   Now, look, Presidents do that. I don't think it is a good idea. But  here is the thing about this speech: To make matters worse--look at  this--he did all this, a clearly partisan speech, while being flanked  by two Active-Duty marines as his political props. Look at that. Look  at that--in my view, a sickening abuse of authority from a Commander in  Chief who has never served in the military--I think he got five Vietnam  deferments--and knows nothing about the Marine Corps' ethos of honor,  courage, commitment.   Remember when General Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs--and  was Chairman under President Trump as well--released a video where he  apologized for standing beside the President, then-President Trump,  when that could have been perceived as political.   This is what General Milley said:         I should not have been there. My presence in that moment       and in that environment created a perception of the military       [being] involved in domestic politics.    I thought that was a good speech by General Milley. He made a  mistake; he apologized; and that was the right thing to do.   This is much worse. This is much worse. These marines, unlike General  Milley, they are being ordered to stand next to the President of the  United States while he rants against millions of his own fellow  Americans.   The President certainly didn't apologize for this speech. In fact,  when criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for the  politicization of the military with these marines propped up next to  him, the Biden administration actually doubled down in terms of their  use of these two Active-Duty marines as political props in a very  partisan speech.   Here is what the spokesperson at the White House said:         The presence of [the] Marines at [that] speech was intended       to demonstrate the deep and abiding respect the President has       for [these servicemembers] . . . [for] the ideals and the       unique role our independent military plays in defending our       democracy, no matter who is in power.    This is Orwellian doublespeak. What a bunch of nonsense.   Here is the fact: The presence of these marines was meant to  politicize the President's speech and politically benefit from the  honor and respect the few and the proud have earned in the hearts of  Americans over decades, over millennium. This should disturb every  single American, whether you are Democrat or Republican. This was just  wrong.   Let me provide another example of the politicization of our military  by  [[Page S4886]]  the Biden administration. Now, this is something that hasn't gotten a  lot of attention. Some people were like, hey, it wasn't a really big  deal. I actually think it was a big deal.   We have some of the best service academies in the world. They are the  best in the world--the U.S. Naval Academy, West Point, Air Force  Academy, Coast Guard Academy. Each of our military service academies  has board members, some of whom are appointed by the President of the  United States for 3-year terms.   Now, I am honored to serve on the U.S. Naval Academy Board. I was  appointed as a member of the Armed Services Committee. Here is the  tradition in our country that every single President has abided by:  When they come into office, they let the Board members finish out their  terms. So, for example, when President Trump was elected, the Obama  administration officials, who were President Obama's appointees,  finished out the terms on the Naval Academy Board, the West Point  Board, and the Air Force Academy Board. That is what we do.   The point is not to politicize the service academies. That has always  been the tradition, every single President--except for Joe Biden. When  President Biden came into office, he looked at West Point, Annapolis,  the Air Force Academy, and somebody said to him ``You know what, Mr.  President, let's fire all the Trump appointees. Let's fire them right  now, all 18 of them'' to clearly politicize the service academies of  America. So that is what they did--something that had never been done  before by any President in the history of the country--and they did it  regardless of qualifications of the current members serving on these  boards. Let me give you some examples.   Retired Army LTG H.R. McMaster was fired off the West Point Board.  Ironically, the same day he was fired by President Biden's White House,  he was honored by the West Point Association of Graduates as the  distinguished graduate of the year of West Point. So one President  fires him, and West Point gives him a great honor. GEN Jack Keane, a  former Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, was fired from the West Point  Board; retired Army COL Douglas Macgregor; an Afghanistan war veteran,  clinical psychologist Meaghan Mobbs; a Bronze Star recipient and  businessman, David Urban; a retired Army lieutenant general, Guy Swan-- 18 qualified people, all fired.   The politicization of the service academies of America was undertaken  by this administration--the first President, the first White House ever  to do it, all fired by Joe Biden and not allowed to fulfill their  terms.   Of course, the Biden administration loves to use our military to push  other agendas that have nothing to do with lethality in winning our  Nation's wars--many, many examples. Let me give you just a couple. From  the beginning, issuing Executive orders not focused on how we have a  stronger military but using taxpayer dollars to establish a committee  within the Pentagon to do what ended up being witch hunts on so-called  extremists in the military, of which--when they came back with their  report, they said they had actions of .005 percent. They also issued  Executive orders to use taxpayer dollars to mandate transgender  transition surgeries for Active-Duty soldiers. Importantly, they become  nondeployable when that happens.   So back to my original point, no one in senior positions in the White  House or the Cabinet--with the exception of Secretary Austin--has  significant military experience, and on so many of these issues, there  is no adult in the room.   Think about these White House conversations where they are talking  about, hey, let's cut the defense budget, and we will grow the EPA by  25 percent. Well, that is a great idea, Mr. President. Let's make sure  we give a partisan speech at Independence Hall, and, oh yeah, let's  grab a couple Active-Duty marines to stand right next to the President  as his props. That is a great idea, Mr. President. Let's come in and  politicize the service academies and fire all the Trump administration  appointees--even American heroes like H.R. McMaster, General Keane-- despite the fact that no President had ever done that before. Great  idea, Mr. President.   This is really problematic, what we are seeing right now, and that  lack of prioritization extends here in the U.S. Senate, unfortunately,  as it relates to our military.   As we know with regard to defense budget cuts, in the 2020 NDAA, we  had a debate right here on the Senate floor where my colleague the  junior Senator from Vermont proposed an amendment to dramatically cut  our military, almost by 15 percent, across-the-board cuts. He even  actually wrote an op-ed in POLITICO. Remember, this is when Democrats  were pushing to defund the police. Here is the op-ed. It is actually  called ``Defund the Pentagon: The Liberal Case.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the op-ed ``Defund the Pentagon: The Liberal Case.''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   Defund the Pentagon: The Liberal Case                        (By Senator Bernie Sanders)         Fifty-three years ago Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. challenged       all of us to fight against three major evils: ``the evil of       racism, the evil of poverty and the evil of war.'' If there       was ever a moment in American history when we needed to       respond to Dr. King's clarion call for justice and demand a       ``radical revolution of values,'' now is that time.        Whether it is fighting against systemic racism and police       brutality, defeating the deadliest pandemic in more than a       hundred years, or putting an end to the worst economic       downturn since the Great Depression, now is the time to       fundamentally change our national priorities.        Sadly, instead of responding to any of these unprecedented       crises, the Republican Senate is on a two-week vacation. When       it comes back, its first order of business will be to pass a       military spending authorization that would give the bloated       Pentagon $740 billion--an increase of more than $100 billion       since Donald Trump became president.        Let's be clear: As coronavirus infections, hospitalizations       and deaths are surging to record levels in states across       America, and the lifeline of unemployment benefits keeping 30       million people afloat expires at the end of the month, the       Republican Senate has decided to provide more funding for the       Pentagon than the next 11 nations' military budgets combined.        Under this legislation, over half of our discretionary       budget would go to the Department of Defense at a time when       tens of millions of Americans are food insecure and over a       half-million Americans are sleeping out on the street. After       adjusting for inflation, this bill would spend more money on       the Pentagon than we did during the height of the Vietnam War       even as up to 22 million Americans are in danger of being       evicted from their homes and health workers are still forced       to reuse masks, gloves and gowns.        Moreover, this extraordinary level of military spending       comes at a time when the Department of Defense is the only       agency of our federal government that has not been able to       pass an independent audit, when defense contractors are       making enormous profits while paying their CEOs outrageous       compensation packages, and when the so-called War on Terror       will cost some $6 trillion.        Let us never forget what Republican President Dwight D.       Eisenhower, a former four-star general, said in 1953: ``Every       gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired       signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger       and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.''        What Eisenhower said was true 67 years ago, and it is true       today.        If the horrific pandemic we are now experiencing has taught       us anything it is that national security means a lot more       than building bombs, missiles, nuclear warheads and other       weapons of mass destruction. National security also means       doing everything we can to improve the lives of tens of       millions of people living in desperation who have been       abandoned by our government decade after decade.        That is why I have introduced an amendment to the Defense       Authorization Act that the Senate will be voting on during       the week of July 20th, and the House will follow suit with a       companion effort led by Representatives Mark Pocan (D-Wis.)       and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.). Our amendment would reduce the       military budget by 10 percent and use that $74 billion in       savings to invest in communities that have been ravaged by       extreme poverty, mass incarceration, decades of neglect and       the Covid-19 pandemic.        Under this amendment, distressed cities and towns in every       state in the country would be able to use these funds to       create jobs by building affordable housing, schools,       childcare facilities, community health centers, public       hospitals, libraries and clean drinking water facilities.       These communities would also receive federal funding to hire       more public school teachers, provide nutritious meals to       children and parents and offer free tuition at public       colleges, universities or trade schools.        This amendment gives my Senate colleagues a fundamental       choice to make. They can vote to spend more money on endless       wars in the Middle East while failing to provide economic       security to millions of people  [[Page S4887]]       in the United States. Or they can vote to spend less money on       nuclear weapons and cost overruns, and more to rebuild       struggling communities in their home states.        In Dr. King's 1967 speech, he warned that ``a nation that       continues year after year to spend more money on military       defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching       spiritual death.''        He was right. At a time when half of our people are       struggling paycheck to paycheck, when over 40 million       Americans are living in poverty, and when 87 million lack       health insurance or are underinsured, we are approaching       spiritual death.        At a time when we have the highest rate of childhood       poverty of almost any major country on Earth, and when       millions of Americans are in danger of going hungry, we are       approaching spiritual death.        At a time when we have no national testing program, no       adequate production of protective gear and no commitment to a       free vaccine, while remaining the only major country where       infections spiral out of control, we are approaching       spiritual death.        At a time when over 60,000 Americans die each year because       they can't afford to get to a doctor on time, and one out of       five Americans can't afford the prescription drugs their       doctors prescribe, we are approaching spiritual death.        Now, at this unprecedented moment in American history, it       is time to rethink what we value as a society and to       fundamentally transform our national priorities. Cutting the       military budget by 10 percent and investing that money in       human needs is a modest way to begin that process. Let's get       it done.     So that was the liberal case, defund the Pentagon. The  junior Senator from Vermont wrote that. The majority leader put out a  tweet saying he was a proud supporter of the defund the Pentagon  amendment. That was right here on the Senate floor.   Of course, there is the National Defense Authorization Act, the No. 1  bill that focuses on national defense for our Nation. That passed out  of committee, the Armed Services Committee, in June in a very strong  bipartisan vote, 23 to 3. It passed the House in July. We will have pay  raises for our troops so the Army doesn't have to tell them go line up  for food stamps because they are hungry. And we need to bring it to the  floor right here.   So what are we doing? As far as I can tell, the majority leader  doesn't want to bring up the Defense Authorization Act until December-- December. That is why I joined a letter led by Senator Tuberville, with  whom I serve on the Armed Services Committee, signed by 20 of my  colleagues, to say to the majority leader: Mr. Majority Leader, we have  a dangerous world right now. Bring the NDAA to the floor. It is going  to pass. It has great support.   By the way, I know the Democrat Senators feel this way, too, on this  topic.   So we need to get this body back to what is important for our  country--bolstering our economy, fighting inflation, bringing down  energy costs, unleashing American energy, and definitely passing the  legislation that funds our military, that provides pay raises for our  troops during this very dangerous time.   So I again ask the majority leader to bring the NDAA to the floor. We  need it.   I call on the President and his administration--the President of the  United States, the Commander in Chief--to truly prioritize our military  and their families, and that begins with putting an end to using them  in a disgraceful way as political props for your partisan agenda.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 5518 and  ask that it be reported by number.    Madam President, about 4 years ago, I was part of a  meeting with several Senators--there were about 11 of us--here in the  U.S. Capitol with the Chinese Ambassador. And in the meeting, I had  raised a number of issues about the lack of reciprocity that China has  with regard to the United States: market access on our trade; their  ability to invest here but we couldn't invest there; the fact that they  have all kinds of journalists in America and we can't have journalists  over there--just across the board on so many things--Confucius  Institutes in American universities, no equivalent in Chinese  universities. No reciprocity on so many topics.   And I will never forget the response of the Chinese Ambassador to the  United States. With 11 U.S. Senators right there, he said: Well,  Senator, I agree there is a lack of reciprocity in a number of areas,  but that is because China is a developing country.   China is a developing country. That is what he said just 4 years ago.  And my response was: Mr. Ambassador, with all due respect, can you  please stop using that talking point about your country being a  developing country? It is kind of an insult to all of our intelligence.  And to be honest, you are not a developing country. The American people  know it; the world knows it; and you need to stop telling everybody and  using that as a crutch.   What does that have to do with the amendment that I just called up?   Well, today, before we vote on the Kigali treaty, I have an amendment  that I am asking all of my colleagues here in the Senate to support. I  am not talking about the merits of the Kigali treaty itself. There is  an element of this treaty that raises a principle that is at stake  right now that is so important with regard to China, the United States,  and the rest of the world.   This treaty that we are getting ready to vote on continues to  classify China as a ``developing country.''   Why does that matter?   Well, as I mentioned, it is a facade. China is not a developing  country; it is the second largest economy in the world. It is one of  the most industrialized countries in the world. It has one of the  biggest militaries in the world. The World Bank even now considers  China an upper middle income country.   But what China keeps trying to do in international organizations and  in international treaties is continue to get the same benefits as truly  developing countries, such Ghana, Somalia, Nigeria, Bangladesh. These  are the countries that need global assistance, not China.   So my amendment today is very simple to this treaty. It first says  that the U.S. Senate concludes:         The People's Republic of China is not a developing country,       and the United Nations and other intergovernmental       organizations should not treat the People's Republic of China       as such.    And then my amendment goes one step further, and it makes the advice  and consent of the Senate for this treaty contingent upon the Secretary  of State of the United States going to the U.N. and the Vienna  Convention Secretariat to file an amendment to the treaty that  clarifies that China should be taken off the annex that defines it as a  developing country.   So we have a declaration--China is not a developing country--and then  it says to the Secretary of State, before you get the advice and  consent of the U.S. Senate, you shall go to the U.N. and file an  instrument that says China should be removed from the list of countries  to this treaty that are called developing countries.   And, again, this matters. This matters, for example, on this treaty.   Why?   Because in this treaty, the developing country annex gives those  countries under that annex much longer time to implement the treaty,  and it actually gives them funding from the U.N. to implement the  treaty.   Now, where does that funding come from?   Most of it comes from the United States. So, in essence, right now,  the way the treaty is organized, the United States gives the U.N. money  to help implement the treaty, and a lot of that money is going to go to  China.    Does anyone in the U.S. Senate think that makes sense? Does anyone in  America think that that makes sense?   It does not.   Furthermore, on this treaty and on so many other international  agreements, whether at the U.N. or other places, when you give China  more time for implementation, particularly as it relates to the global  environment, all you are doing is harming the global environment.   China is a developed country. China is an industrialized country. The  U.S. Senate, the international organizations where China is a member,  need to start recognizing this.   So I am proud to say I worked closely with Senator Barrasso and  Senator Lee on this amendment. I actually wish it were stronger.   Senator Barrasso was here on the floor, talking about his amendment.  I actually think that is the preferred way to go, but we couldn't get  agreement in terms of the Barrasso amendment, so I am encouraging all  of my colleagues to vote on this principle: The U.S. Senate, on any  international agreement or any international treaty, should no longer  agree to the obvious. China is not a developing country; it is an  industrialized country, and we should make clear in the Senate and in  [[Page S4897]]  international organizations that that is the view of the United States,  and we need to encourage the Secretary of State, which is exactly what  my amendment does, to make sure the U.N. and other countries agree with  us on that.   I encourage all of my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the  amendment.
