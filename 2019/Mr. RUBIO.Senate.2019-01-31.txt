 Mr. President, I come to speak about the pending amendment  we are going to vote on in about 25 minutes. It is an amendment that  says it is a mistake to proceed with the withdrawal from Syria in the  pace and scale that is currently proposed or that the White House has  announced they are going to undertake.   What I will say here today is what I said about it initially; that  is, that I think it is a bad idea. I said it then, and I said it to the  President in a subsequent meeting, and I think it is important to  restate it here as we begin to vote, since I believe this issue is  going to be covered in the press more as a political issue than as a  foreign policy one.   It is unfortunate that a lot of these issues are wrapped up as  political decisions. These are not votes on political decisions. These  are votes on the conduct of American foreign policy, which oftentimes  have no partisan lines but rather are ideological, in some cases, or  just simply a different way to view an issue.   I share the White House's and the President's desire that as quickly  as possible--the key words being ``as possible''--we end conflicts  abroad. It is in the best interest of our Nation, our families, and the  families of the service men and women who are stationed abroad and  involved in conflict zones that this be the case. The problem is, if  you do so in the wrong way, you end up dramatically increasing the  likelihood of a future conflict that will involve even bigger wars,  with an even higher investment of lives and resources to win.   Our foreign policy in the Middle East today--particularly in this  region we are talking about with Syria and Iraq--is focused on two  primary objectives, as clearly stated by the policymakers. The first is  the regional threat of Iran, its growing influence and its spreading  reach, and the other is counterterrorism. These are the two linchpins  of why we are there in the first place.   The Iran threat is self-explanatory. They pose a threat to our allies  in the region, particularly Israel but ultimately to the United States.  The terror threat is one that reminds us how quickly we as a nation  have a tendency to forget things.   Now, no one has forgotten September 11, 2001, but what we sometimes  fail to remember is what made it possible in the first place. What made  September 11, 2001, possible in the first place was that a terrorist  organization--al-Qaida--led by Osama bin Laden, had established within  Afghanistan a safe haven. Al-Qaida was not the Government of  Afghanistan--that was the Taliban--but the Taliban allowed them to have  a safe haven in Afghanistan, and from that safe haven, they were able  to plot terrorist attacks against America and ultimately strike us here  in the homeland. It was possible because they had a place that allowed  them to do this.   It is, in fact, the key to any terrorist organization that would like  to conduct external attacks and that would like to attack America. They  have to have a place to operate from, and it cannot be a place where  they are being followed, where they are being attacked, and where they  are being wiped out by Americans or coalition forces. It has to be a  safe haven.   My No. 1 concern about this decision that has been made is that it  could lead to the reestablishment of safe havens inside of Syria from  which ISIS and al-Qaida could reconstitute themselves, conduct external  plotting, and ultimately attack the United States.   We already face this risk. In Northwest Syria today, there is very  little sustained pressure on ISIS elements. In Idlib, there is  virtually no pressure on al-Qaida. Now, imagine with even less  coalition pressure being put upon them, how capable they can become and  how quickly they can establish a place from which they can plot against  us.   To understand why ISIS needs to plot against us and conduct  spectacular attacks against Europe and the United States--this is a  group that needs to prove it is still alive, and it is still strong. If  they can't prove it, they  [[Page S787]]  can't recruit people, and they can't raise money.   They are also in competition with other terrorist groups. In fact,  ISIS is a spinoff of al-Qaida. These groups actually compete with one  another for members and for resources. Both of them have a vested  interest in attacking us abroad, not just in fulfillment of some  ideological aims but as a means of survival because if these groups are  able to conduct or inspire these kinds of attacks, it gives them  credibility, they attract members and fighters, and it allows them to  raise money for more attacks.   Some people will tell you: Well, let the others who are in the region  take care of them--Turkey or Iran or the regime or the Russians. The  problem is, none of these groups have shown any interest in fighting  ISIS, not even a limited interest.   The Turks are largely interested in a buffer zone in the northern  part of Syria--a buffer zone which the Kurds do not dominate because of  their own internal politics. I am not claiming the Turks are fans of  ISIS. I am saying ISIS is not their No. 1 priority.   Their No. 1 priority is defeating Kurdish forces and gaining control  of a buffer zone in the northern part of Syria. That is what they are  going to prioritize above anything and everywhere else. They are not a  reliable partner, nor do they have the capability to be a reliable  partner in sustaining pressure on ISIS.   Interestingly enough, if you look at what Turkey will need--even if  they wanted to be a sustained partner against ISIS--it is logistical  support from the United States of America. In essence, they can't even  do what they are promising to do unless we are there with them to do  it, but they don't want us to be there. That tells you they really just  want us to leave so they can create this zone in the northern part of  Syria.   The regime only cares about ISIS if they are in population areas or  if ISIS is threatening critical infrastructure. If ISIS is taking ahold  of an oil facility somewhere, they will care. If ISIS is in the middle  of a big city, they will care. All of these other vast spaces, they  don't have the resources, and frankly they don't care, as long as they  don't pose a threat to the regime, they don't pose a threat to  population centers they want to control, and they don't pose a threat  to critical infrastructure like oil. If they are not there, they are  not going to spend their limited resources.   All things being equal, they probably want to defeat them, but they  don't have the wherewithal to sustain pressure on them. They have  limited resources, and they are going to invest those resources in  controlling population centers and in controlling critical  infrastructure.   So here is the answer: If the United States and the anti-ISIS  coalition are not in Syria and operating until ISIS is completely wiped  out, there will be no sustained pressure on ISIS or on al-Qaida, and  they will both grow back stronger, and they will have the capability to  plot against the homeland and American interests around the world. That  is something we cannot allow to happen. We cannot have that happen.   Some may say: Well, we can target them. We just don't have to have  1,500 or 1,800 special operators on the ground. We don't need to do  that. We can do it through the air and so forth. ISIS is becoming an  insurgency. An insurgency is much different than a group with a flag  that controls buildings and territory. You can find those people, and  you can strike them. An insurgency is people who blend into the  population.   By day, they are a baker or an accountant or a merchant, but in the  evenings and at night, they are an ISIS fighter planting bombs and  killing people. Insurgencies are very difficult to fight and almost  impossible, if not impossible, to fight with simply airpower, which is  why the situation in Syria has been so positive. Two thousand American  servicemen and special operators, alongside thousands of Syrian  Democratic Forces and Kurds--who are primarily doing the ground  fighting with our logistical support and air support--have eroded  ISIS's control of territory in the country, but they have not  eliminated it, and there is enough of it left that it could  reconstitute itself. In fact, it is in the process of doing so already.  They are clearly capable of killing American servicemen, as they did a  few days ago, and since that time, there have been a series of other  IED attacks inside of Syria, some of which could have killed Americans.   This is a group who has openly talked about their desire to possess  chemical weapons, which they could use at any moment, potentially,  against Syrian Democratic Forces and Kurds in that area--and, by the  way, putting directly in danger our remaining service men and women  alongside them. This remains a dangerous group capable of conducting  attacks not just in Syria but potentially--especially if they have a  safe haven abroad--here in the United States.   That is not to even mention a group who doesn't get talked about  enough anymore--al-Qaida. Al-Qaida still exists, and there is a part of  Syria in which they are completely uncontested. No one is going after  them. They completely dominate the area, and they do whatever they want  from there. And I promise you they are not there starting a car wash;  they are there working to expand their brand and reach, to resurrect  the al-Qaida brand around the world. What is the fastest way to do  that? By conducting an attack against the United States and our  interests. We should be worried about that alone.   The first reason why I am against this policy and why I support this  amendment is that this policy directly undermines one of the two  pillars of our strategy and our policy in this region, and that is  counterterrorism. The second is the spread of Iranian influence. Let  there be no doubt that this withdrawal as currently structured is a  win--perceptually at a minimum but I believe in reality--for Iran.   Let's begin in Southern Syria, the areas that border Israel and  Jordan. Our withdrawal means Iran and their pro-Iranian forces that  include Hezbollah militias will now have even more operating space from  which to target Israel and will now be able to set up a more reliable  ground route by which they can send weaponry into Lebanon to support  Hezbollah so that one day they can attack Israel from the air with  rockets, precision-guided munitions, and the like.   We see it already, for example, in Natanz, where the United States  still maintains a presence very near a huge refugee camp. We can  already see the pro-Iran, pro-regime forces beginning to encroach  closer and closer upon the American position, to the point where we may  have to leave simply because we no longer have a defensive posture we  can sustain. But what the withdrawal has done is it has allowed Iran  and the pro-regime forces to go to our allies, to go to the groups on  the ground whom we have been working with to fight ISIS and say to them  ``The Americans are unreliable. The Americans are leaving. You might as  well partner up with us now. We are the only ones who can protect you''  or ``You can lay down your weapons and just go back to your families  because Americans are leaving.'' I fear it is working. I fear that they  may dictate the pace of our withdrawal, because that announcement alone  has undermined our credibility in the eyes of the partners we have  worked with in Southern Syria.   What I just outlined is also true in the north, where the Kurds are  facing the risk of military attack from the Turks, and they are saying:  America is leaving, and the only people left whom we can partner up  with to protect us are Iran and the regime and/or the Russians.   In fact, we have left them no choice but to join up with Iran and the  Russians and pro-regime forces because if the choice is between  annihilation by a Turkish military attack and joining up with a regime  to stop a Turkish intrusion, they are joining up with a regime in Iran,  further increasing Iran's power in this country.   It is not just contained within Syria; this announcement has actually  accelerated the process of putting pressure on us to also get out of  Iraq. All of the pro-Iran political parties inside the Iraqi Parliament  are pushing very hard, very aggressively to pass a law that kicks  America out of Iraq, and they are moving quickly on this. We see their  tentacles in Afghanistan, where they are beginning to create internal  political pressure through their  [[Page S788]]  parliamentary body to force America to pick a date: Tell us when you  are leaving, a date certain.   People may say: What is wrong with this? Get out of Syria. Get out of  Iraq. Get out of Afghanistan. Why are we fighting other people's wars?   We are not. These are not other people's wars; these are ours. These  people who are going to operate in these safe havens and Iran--we are  their target. They want to strike at us. And if we are not in  Afghanistan and we are not in Iraq and we are not in Syria, then from  where exactly are we going to conduct operations against terrorism?  From where exactly are we going to be postured to defend ourselves if  Iran decides to strike our other military facilities in the region? The  answer is, we won't have anyplace to do that from. We won't. Not to  mention what it says to the region.   Understand this: The Iranians and our enemies in the region have been  telling everyone for a long time--and the Russians echo this--``The  Americans are unreliable. They always abandon their friends. You can't  count on them'' or ``America is a declining power.'' That is the other  argument they use openly: ``America is a great power in decline, and  every year that goes by, you will see that they can't back up their  words, and that is why you can't count on them. America is weakened.''  I don't believe that is true. In fact, we know that is not true. But  halfway around the world, they do, and when we take actions that prove  it, it makes it true in the minds of a lot of people and a lot of  countries, and it actually is dangerous because it could invite someone  to take a reckless and irresponsible action on the basis of  miscalculation. Someone may actually believe ``America is now weak;  let's attack them,'' and then we will be in a war.   The best way to prevent a war is to make sure those who want to fight  you know they have no chance of winning. If you give them any belief  that they have a chance to win because you have withdrawn and, as a  result, reinforced the narrative being used against you, I believe you  will have increased the chance of war.   This is being used against us right now. Iran is openly parroting  this. They are holding this up as an example of an Iranian win. They  are saying: This proves our strategy has been working. The Americans  are leaving Syria. They are going to have to leave Iraq. They are going  to leave Afghanistan with their tail between their legs. We are  winning, and they are losing.   It reinforces a narrative, by the way, that is also used against us  by the Chinese and other parts of the world.   This is a very dangerous situation. That is why this is a bad idea.  This is about a lot more than just pulling out and not wasting any more  money in these other places. There is no one in the world who wishes  that more than I do. I wish the money, I wish the lives, I wish all of  this investment had not had to be spent. I openly wonder, how much more  could we be doing if we didn't have this threat? But here is the  problem: Whether or not we want it to exist, the Iranian threat and the  threat of terrorism exist.   We cannot deal with the world the way we want it to be; we have to  deal with the world the way it is. We didn't create the terror threat,  but it is there. We can ignore ISIS, we can ignore al-Qaida, and we can  ignore Iran, but they will not ignore us. We can decide not to go after  them, but they will come after us.   I think it is a grave mistake because if we allow al-Qaida or ISIS or  both to have a resurgence, they will attack the United States of  America, they will attack our allies and our interests around the  world, and they will try and they will plot to attack us here at home.  The Iranian influence operation and their growth and influence in Iraq  and Syria and now in Lebanon and increasingly in Yemen--and God forbid,  in the future, in Bahrain--pose an existential threat to all of our  allies in this region--none more so than the State of Israel. That is  why I support this amendment. That is why I hope all of my colleagues  will support this amendment.   It is important that the legislative branch and the Senate, which has  a constitutional role to play in the setting of American foreign  policy--they come to us to confirm people, and they come to us to fund  these things--that we play our rightful role in the setting of American  foreign policy. It is important that the Senate be on the right side of  this issue so that we can hope to influence future actions and policies  before they are taken and we can help change them once they have been  taken in places headed in the wrong direction.   Mr. President, I yield the floor    Mr. President, it is my privilege to honor a  Florida small business that exemplifies what it means to provide  quality service and to give back to the community when it matters the  most. As chairman of the Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small business that  exemplifies the value of hard work and the unique American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my pleasure to recognize  Carroll Bradford, Inc., of Orlando, FL, as the Senate Small Business of  the Week.   Carroll Bradford, Inc., is a full-service construction and  landscaping company that was founded in 2010 by Stephen Barnett and Jon  Menke, who were both born and raised in central Florida. Stephen and  Jon are related by marriage and were driven to follow in the footsteps  of their grandfathers, who were both successful small business owners  in the 1940s. The company's name combines the names of each cofounder's  grandfather: Stephen's grandfather, Carroll Barco, and Jon's  grandfather, G.L. Bradford.   Carroll Bradford started in the Baldwin Park community in Orlando and  now has expanded to Jacksonville. Through hard work and dedication,  Stephen and Jon built a reputation of providing quality construction  and landscaping services, being honest with their customers, and giving  back to the community.   In its first 8 years, Carroll Bradford has grown exponentially,  leading the company to create an app to respond to the expanding base  of customers. A testament to this growth is the company's partnership  with the Orlando Magic  [[Page S795]]  basketball team, for which Carroll Bradford proudly serves as the  Magic's ``Official Builder.'' As a result of its exceptional work,  Carroll Bradford has won numerous awards and accolades, including an A+  rating from the Better Business Bureau and recognition from the Orlando  Business Journal as a ``Fast 50'' business in 2017.
