 Madam Speaker, thanks to the hard work of our  committees and the leadership of the Speaker, we found overwhelming  evidence Trump invited foreign interests to interfere in our elections  for his personal gain, and then he took unprecedented efforts to cover  it up, obstructing Congress.   I am proud of the courage of new Members to do their duty, so that,  for the first time in his privileged life, Donald Trump will be finally  held accountable for his reckless personal behavior and business  practices.   I vote proudly for these two Articles of Impeachment. And then I hope  the House retains control of the articles until the Speaker and Leader  Schumer can negotiate an agreement on process and witnesses from  McConnell so that the next stage will be open and fair so that Donald  Trump will ultimately be held accountable.
