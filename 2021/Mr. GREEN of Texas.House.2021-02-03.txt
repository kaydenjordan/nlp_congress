 Mr. Speaker, in 2017, when my Republican friends  had control of the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, they passed  an approximately $1.5 trillion tax break for the very wealthy.   Mr. Speaker, the wealthy weren't suffering. There was no pain. They  were not about to be evicted. There were no mortgage payments behind.  But they got $1.5 trillion approximately in tax breaks.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my dear friends on the other side to see this, if  they will: As a tax break for the working class, let's let people who  are making $75,000 a year have an opportunity to acquire some money to  help them. If it goes into a bank account, it will come out. They are  not wealthy. At some point we have to realize that those who are among  the working class cannot do more with less, while the wealthy need more  to do more.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to save this country, save these  people who are suffering. I will vote for this resolution. I will vote  for reconciliation.
