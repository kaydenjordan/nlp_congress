 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome Brandon Martz and  his family from Jackson County to our Nation's Capitol.   They are here with the help of the Dream Foundation, which fulfills  dreams for terminally ill young people and adults. Brandon is 18 years  old and has been battling Duchenne muscular dystrophy since he was a  toddler.   One of the things we talked about today in my office was the 21st  Century Cures Act and the need to expedite the development of new cures  by prioritizing medical research and streamlining the FDA approval  process.   Signed into law in December of last year, this landmark initiative  will bring hope for patients and families suffering from some of the  worst diseases and hopefully fulfill many dreams.   Mr. Speaker, it was an honor to spend time with Brandon, his brother,  and his parents today and play a part in helping Brandon's dream become  a reality.   I hope their time in Washington offers an opportunity to create many  lasting memories together as a family and fulfill many dreams.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1304, the  Self-Insurance Protection Act. I thank my good friend, Dr. Phil Roe,  for his leadership and insights on this issue.                                time  1500    As the Affordable Care Act continues its death spiral--and indeed it  does, very clearly, and ultimately will leave people without  insurance--too many small businesses in the process and working  families in my district have been left without real options for  healthcare coverage that they can afford.   Self-insured plans are one solution that small businesses have tried  to push back against these rising costs. These policies provide  employers flexibility to design a healthcare plan tailored to the  unique needs of their workers and their families. Last year, over 60  percent of employers who offered healthcare coverage utilized self- insured plans.   Unfortunately, the previous administration pursued regulations that  would jeopardize access to self-insured plans by redefining stop-loss  insurance as traditional health insurance under Federal law. Stop-loss  insurance does not pay our medical claims; rather, it is a tool--I  remind you--that simply provides protections for employers to guard  against a catastrophic medical claim.   Mr. Speaker, our constituents need more affordable healthcare  options, not fewer; and the bill before us will stop any future  administration from putting harmful limitations on self-insured plans.  To achieve meaningful healthcare reform, we must promote flexibility  and innovative options, not curtail them.   H.R. 1304 provides much-needed certainty to the workers and employers  who access quality care through self-insured healthcare plans. As  employers and their employees look to plan for the future, the Self- Insurance Protection Act will help provide some long-term certainty  that these affordable health insurance options are available. I ask my  colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and promoting  healthcare choice for American workers and for their employers.
