 It was after the article in POLITICO came out in       that first intense week of September.         That is correct. I received a text message from       one of my Ukrainian counterparts forwarding that article, and       that is the first they raised it with me.    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. The House managers didn't show you this  testimony from any of these four witnesses. Why not? Why didn't they  give you the context of this testimony? Think about this as well. If  the Ukrainians had been aware of the review on security assistance,  they, of course, would have said something. There were numerous high- level diplomatic meetings between senior Ukrainian and U.S. officials  during the summer after the review on the security assistance began,  but before President Zelensky learned of the hold through the POLITICO  article. If the Ukrainians had known about the hold, they would have  raised it in one of those meetings. Yet the Ukrainians didn't say  anything about the hold at a single one of those meetings, not on July  9, not on July 10, not on July 25, not on July 26, not on August 27. At  none of those meetings--none of those meetings--did the Ukrainians  mention the pause on security assistance.    Ambassador Volker testified that he was regularly in touch with the  senior, highest level officials in the Ukrainian Government and that  the Ukrainian officials would confide things and would have asked if  they had any questions about the aid. Nobody said a word to Ambassador  Volker until the end of August.   Then, within hours of the POLITICO article's being published, Mr.  Yermak texted Ambassador Volker with a link to the article and to ask  about the report. In other words, as soon as the Ukrainians learned  about the hold, they asked about it.   Mr. Schiff said something during the 21 hours--or more than 21  hours--that he and his team spoke that I actually agree with, which is  when he talked about common sense. Many of us at the tables and in the  room are former prosecutors at the State, Federal, or military level.  Prosecutors talk a lot about common sense. Common sense comes into play  right here.   The top Ukrainian officials said nothing--nothing at all--to their  U.S. counterparts during all of these meetings about the pause on  security assistance, but then--boom. As soon as the POLITICO article  comes out, suddenly, in that first intense week of September, in George  Kent's words, security assistance was all they wanted to talk about.   What must we conclude if we are using our common sense?--that they  didn't know about the pause until the POLITICO article on August 28.  There was no activity before. The article comes out, and there is a  flurry of activity.   That is common sense, and it is absolutely fatal to the House  managers' case. The House managers are aware that the Ukrainians' lack  of knowledge on the hold is fatal to their case, so they desperately  tried to muddy the water.   The managers told you the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense,  Laura Cooper, presented two emails that people on her staff received  from people at the State Department regarding conversations with people  at the Ukraine Embassy that could have been about U.S. security  assistance to Ukraine. What they did not tell you is that Ms. Cooper  testified that she could not say for certain whether the emails were  about the pause on security assistance. She couldn't say one way or  another.   She also testified that she didn't want to speculate about the  meaning of the words in the emails. The House managers also didn't tell  you that Ms. Cooper testified: ``I reviewed my calendar, and the only  meeting where I can recall a Ukrainian official raising the issue of  security assistance with me is on September 5 at the Ukrainian  Independence Day celebration.'' The House managers didn't tell you  that.   The House managers also mentioned that one of Ambassador Volker's  advisers, Catherine Croft, claimed that the Ukrainian Embassy officials  learned about the pause earlier than the POLITICO article; but when  asked when she heard from Ukraine Embassy officials, Ms. Croft admitted  that she can't remember those specifics and did not think that she took  notes.   Ms. Croft also did not remember when news of the hold became public.  Remember though, that Ambassador Volker, her boss, who was in regular  contact with President Zelensky and the top Ukrainian aides, was very  clear: ``I believe the Ukrainians became aware of the hold on August 29  and not before.''   This is all the House managers have in contrast to the testimony of  Volker, Taylor, Morrison, and Kent, the text from Yermak, the words of  the high-ranking Ukrainians themselves, and the flurry of activity that  began on August 28. That is the evidence that they want you to consider  as a basis to remove the duly elected President of the United States.   The bottom line is, it is not possible for the pause on security  assistance to have been used as leverage when President Zelensky and  other top Ukrainian officials did not know about it. That is what you  need to know. That is what the House managers didn't tell you.   The House managers know how important this issue is. When we briefly  mentioned it a few days ago, they told us we needed to check our facts.  We did. We are right. President Zelensky and his top aides did not know  about the pause on security assistance at the time of the July 25 call  and did not know about it until August 28, when the POLITICO article  was published.   We know there was no quid pro quo on the July 25 call. We know the  Ukrainians did not know the security assistance had been paused at the  time of the call. There is simply no evidence anywhere that President  Trump ever linked security assistance to any investigations.   Most of the Democrats' witnesses have never spoken to the President  at all, let alone about Ukraine security assistance. The two people in  the House's record who asked President Trump about whether there was  any linkage between security assistance and investigations were told,  in no uncertain terms, that there was no connection between the two.   When Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland asked the  President in, approximately, the September 9 timeframe, the President  told him, ``I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.''   Even earlier, on August 31, Senator Ron Johnson asked the President  if there were any connection between security assistance and  investigations. The President answered:         No way. I would never do that. Who told you that?    Two witnesses, Ambassador Taylor and Tim Morrison, said they came to  believe security assistance was linked to investigations, but both  witnesses based this belief entirely on what they had heard from  Ambassador Sondland before Ambassador Sondland spoke to  [[Page S572]]  the President. Neither Taylor nor Morrison ever spoke to the President  about the matter.   How did Ambassador Sondland come to believe that there was any  connection between security assistance and investigations? Again, the  House managers didn't tell you. Why not? In his public testimony,  Ambassador Sondland used variations of the words ``assume,''  ``presume,'' ``guess,'' ``speculate,'' and ``belief'' over 30 times.   Here are some examples.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. That was my presumption, my personal       presumption.        That was my belief.        That was my presumption.        I presumed that might have to be done in order to get the       aid released.        It was a presumption.        I have been very clear as to when I was presuming, and I       was presuming on the aid.        It would be pure, you know, guesswork on my part,       speculation. I don't know.        That was the problem, Mr. Goldman. No one told me directly       that the aid was tied to anything. I was presuming it was.    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. They didn't show you any of this testimony--not  once--during their 21-hour presentation. It was 21 hours--more than 21  hours--and they couldn't give you the context to evaluate Ambassador  Sondland. All the Democrats have to support the alleged link between  security assistance and investigations is Ambassador Sondland's  assumptions and presumptions.   We remember this exchange.
