 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  1108, legislation I introduced with Ranking Member Frank Pallone to  extend the Federal Communications Commission's general auction  authority.   For the last year, I have worked with Energy and Commerce Committee  leaders and the Senate to develop sound spectrum policy that promotes  economic growth and promotes our national security. In order for the  U.S. to maintain its global competitive edge, we must get spectrum  policy right and not cede our leadership to adversaries like China.   Without congressional action, the FCC's authority to issue spectrum  licenses expires on March 9. This bill will also ensure the FCC has the  authority it needs to continue issuing licenses for a spectrum band  that will be  [[Page H891]]  used to provide better coverage and wireless speeds across the United  States.   This short-term extension will also give us enough time to work out a  broader deal on spectrum policy to ensure the United States continues  to lead the world in 5G and technological innovation and beats China.   I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the House  and Senate on a long-term spectrum auction extension, and I urge my  colleagues to support this measure.
