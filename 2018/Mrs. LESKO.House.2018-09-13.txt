 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize TriYoung, a woman- owned business in Peoria, Arizona, on American Business Women's Day on  September 22.   In August, I visited businesses across Arizona's Eighth District to  discuss how reduced Federal regulations, pro-growth policies, and  Republican-led tax reform have impacted business owners and employees.   For Julie Young, president of TriYoung, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has  produced a sizeable savings that she plans to reinvest back into her  employees.  [[Page H8179]]    TriYoung is a perfect example of how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is  making a difference in the lives of business owners and hardworking  Americans. I am honored to represent this woman-owned business in  Congress, and I will continue to support legislation that allows small  businesses like TriYoung to thrive.   Thank you, Julie, for sharing your story.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am not recorded because I was absent due  to an unexpected appointment. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 397 and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 398.                            ____________________
