 Mr. Speaker, I would say of the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi), it is always fun listening to him, because,  look, we are friends. We are ideologically separated by about, let's  call it a small ocean, but I think there is this passion of we can do  things in our society that are good.   Mr. Speaker, I have really appreciated Mr. Garamendi sort of  embracing in some of our personal conversations my sort of techno- utopianism that the problems the gentleman sees, the problems I see,  that there may be technology that is about to disrupt society in an  incredibly positive way.    I am happy to yield.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman does realize how many  people are creeping out at this moment that we are friendly to each  other.    Mr. Speaker, we really need to talk about Mr.  Garamendi's idea of entertainment.   Mr. Speaker, look, this is actually a point I wish more of our  constituents would actually see. We are actually quite friendly to each  other, even those of us who may have, you know, what is pictured as an  ideological chasm. Oddly enough, we all see many of the same problems,  and we are trying to find a way to get there.   So tonight I wanted to do just one or two things, because I have  picked up a couple of articles in the news over this last week that I  actually find greatly optimistic.   So let's actually sort of start with our five pillars. And I do this  over and over, because, one more time, what do many of us, the  economists, the staff, the really smart people that are here, and then  those of us who are regular Members who were just elected, what is in  many ways the greatest threat to our society?   We have made lots and lots of promises, and we don't have the  resources to keep those promises to those who have earned benefits.   We actually have a demographic curve. As a country, we are getting  older very, very fast. In about eight and a half years: two workers,  one retiree. In about eight and a half years, 50 percent of the  spending in this body will be, less interest, to those 65 and older.   Are we as a government, are we as a society going to keep our  promises?   Mathematically, this has been a passion of mine for a few years now,  trying to find a pro-growth, optimistic way we keep our promises so my  little 3-and-a-half-year-old daughter has the same opportunities I have  had.   So the five pillars we have been working on is how do I start with--I  am going to start with the very top--technology disruption.   Tonight I am going to talk about a couple of really optimistic things  that are happening in healthcare technology that will keep us healthier  and potentially crash the price of healthcare.   I am going to talk about some things that are happening in  environmental technology that are going to lower the costs, make energy  available so the economy can keep growing and yet the environment is  cleaner and healthier.   We are going to talk about employment. How do we actually have more  of our brothers and sisters out there enter the workforce, stay in the  workforce?   There is this concept of labor force participation. And the  economists for years now have said as the baby boomers are moving into  retirement, labor force participation is going to crash mathematically.   We have also had this fragility, this difficulty of millennial  males--oddly enough, about 6, 7 months ago, millennial females really  started to enter the workforce in droves. We still have a problem with  millennial males.   There is also some really interesting data popping up that the number  of Americans, by choice, who are over 70 years old, but they are happy,  and they are healthy, are choosing to stay in the labor force. We have  had almost, I think it was like--the article was talking about a 50  percent rise in seniors staying in the labor force just as a choice by  lifestyle, some because they need the money, many because they are  healthy, and they want to be productive. And that is actually really  good for society.   We are actually going to touch on having to deal with earned benefits  and how we should design those earned benefits. Could we make some  offers within those, saying, if you are willing to stay in the labor  force, if you are healthy and you can do that, should we give you some  spiffs in your benefits. If you are able to stay on your private  insurance for a while, could we do some things.   It is sort of entitlement reform in a very positive fashion. It has  to do with, how do we maximize economic expansion and choice for those  who are seniors?   Population stability. Birth rates have collapsed in our country. We  just have to deal with the reality of the math. How do we incentivize  family formation in an effective way? This one has been really  difficult.   We have had an ongoing sort of research project in our office for a  couple of years now looking at things being done in Canada and  Scandinavia and other parts of the world, even Hungary, and how  ineffective so many programs have been in encouraging family formation.  We are going to have to come up with sort of an American version of  what works there.   Let's face it. Having a little person, they are expensive. It is the  greatest joy of our lives, my wife and I, but we are going to have to  talk about how we help in family formation.   Then also the other side of that concept of population stability is,  what do we do in immigration? How do we design immigration to maximize  economic vitality?   This is going to be a little off subject, but close; I was sort of  heartbroken about a vote we had here 3 hours ago. H.R. 6, it was  dealing with the DACA populations. What happens when the body here  engages in votes that become theatrical, become about exciting your  base, and have no chance of becoming law?   If the majority here had been serious and really wanted a solution  for the young people in DACA, there would have been this opportunity to  come over, talk with Republicans, because many of us have voted for  immigration reform that actually had modules that solved much of the  DACA issue, but they had to come together, because that piece of  legislation will not move through the Senate, will not get the  President's signature.    In some ways, it is actually sort of cruel to exploit a population  with promises and a piece of legislation that we know is never going to  move, and that there was an opportunity to do something that could  have, if we had actually worked together.   I don't know if the fear is doing something that would be seen as  bipartisan with this White House, whether the issue is too powerful,  but it breaks my heart when there are actually paths that, if we had  done border security, if we had done some rationalization of the  dysfunctional mechanisms we have right now on those asking for asylum,  we could have packaged that with a solution for much of the DACA  population and it could have actually moved through the Senate, it  could have gotten the President's signature.   Instead, we just did theatrics.   Sorry to go off sort of the script here.   So population stability.   Then the last one here, economic growth. What do we do as a  government, as a legislative body to maximize economic expansion?   My theory here is economic expansion is moral. Think about it.  Whether it be the Tax Code, whether it be doing smart things  modernizing regulation, whether it be doing smart things with trade, it  is moral when we have economic growth.   How many of our brothers and sisters--that if you read the  economists' papers a couple years ago--who hadn't finished high school,  they were being written off as the permanent underclass in our society.  And today that very population is the population that has the fastest  growing wages and almost full employment. That is a moral thing.   If you actually will come to downtown Phoenix, we have this homeless  campus in downtown Phoenix. There is an organization called St. Joseph  the Worker. My understanding is they have been around for a hundred- some years, and their job is to get populations that have had some of  the most horrible experiences in life and find them jobs.                                time  2045    You walk in the door and they have a stack of job offers on top of  the desk saying: We just need someone to come to our restaurant and  help us. We just need someone to come to our little warehouse and help  us stock shelves.   What does it mean in a society where you have more jobs than you have  available workers? I will argue that that is incredibly moral, and  there should almost be joy in our society right now if we could pull  away the sort of rage partisan blinders right now and say: Isn't this a  neat thing? How do we do more of it?   It turns out that economic growth is crucial if we are going to keep  our promises, if we intend to keep our promises on Medicare, if we  intend to  [[Page H4307]]  keep our promises on Social Security. Unless you do all five of these  things and do all five of those well and very soon, mathematically, it  is almost impossible to keep our promises. It is not Republican or  Democrat; it is demographics.   I want to talk about some of the positive things that technology,  that some of these things are bringing, and that is one of our key  points here. This is the week we call sort of Member Week, where  Members come to different committees of jurisdiction and sort of pitch  their ideas.   So two or three times today in the Ways and Means Committee, we had  Members come and talk about their passion for dealing with different  types of cancers: colorectal screening, lung cancer, these other  things, and then the current mechanism.   My pitch to everyone who cares about those issues is: You are  absolutely right. We need to protect our brothers and sisters in this  country by having those types of screenings to find those cancers as  early as possible and deal with them, but we need to write the  legislation in a fashion where it is future proofed.   I am sure everyone saw these articles that have popped up just in the  last couple of weeks. It turns out there is a breakthrough in blood  tests.   Where, in the old days, we would do a blood test, you would look for  a certain titer, know your body had had an immune reaction to  something, what happens when you can do a blood test that looks for the  cascade--we will call it the throwing off the dead parts of a cancer  cell--and finds that and says: Hey, we just found this little piece of  this DNA; we know that is a cancer DNA; we know what type of cancer it  is; and because of that marker, we can even know where it is?   It turns out this is in trials right now, and it is having tremendous  success. We need to future proof our legislation around here that it is  not enough to care about our brothers and sisters and that we are going  to make sure our society is providing cancer screenings, but that it is  future proofed that when a blood test is the least invasive, most  efficient, cost efficient, easiest to provide, and actually will crash  parts of the price of healthcare in finding these cancers early, but  also being available as a methodology, when we do this in large scale,  being dramatically less expensive than what we use today.   So part of my pitch here and the reason I do this every week or two  is: Understand this disruption of these technologies are here. We need  to future proof what we do legislatively because this is a big deal.   Think of a blood test where you can find several types of cancer if  you have it and you can find it within a couple of hours. This is a big  deal. So this is exciting.   The next one I have talked about two or three times here, but it is  the simplest example of another thing we need to do here.   As we are talking about economic growth, it is also, what do we do to  disrupt the price of healthcare? Remember the stupid conversation we  have had in this place for years now in regards to healthcare hasn't  been about the cost, it has been about who pays and who gets  subsidized. My passion is we need to think differently.   I have come here and done multiple presentations on the new wearable  technologies: the pill bottle that tells you when you have opened it,  the things where you can blow into it and it will diagnose whether you  have a viral infection, and the algorithm can bounce off your phone's  medical records and instantly order your antivirals. That is a  disruption. That lowers the price of healthcare. You got healthier, and  you didn't infect everyone else in your family and your business.   We need to promote these technologies, but there is the other side  that is coming.   Well over 50 percent of our healthcare spending is to those with  chronic conditions. So 5 percent of our population has those chronic  conditions, but they are well over 50 percent of our spending. What  happens if we started to invest in curing them, curing our brothers and  sisters of chronic conditions?   Well, guess what Congress did a few years ago? The Cures Act and some  of these other things, we put lots of money into researching cures. And  now, with some of the new technology and now the next generation of  CRISPR and all these other things that are coming, we are going to have  pharmaceuticals like this. I think they are often referred to as  biologicals. My hope is it is November, but sometime within the next 12  months, we expect to have a single shot cure for hemophilia.   I use this as an example because, apparently, there are a number of  drugs in this sort of category that are coming: a single shot cure for  the 8,000-plus of our brothers and sisters in the country who have  hemophilia A. Now, maybe a million and a half dollars a shot.   So over here we have talked about the technology that keeps us  healthy. Over here, I want us to talk about and start to get our heads  around: How do we finance really expensive but miracle cures? How do we  build a healthcare bond, a mechanism where, hey, we are going to have  all these savings in the future. Can we pull some of that forward or  commit that savings to actually finance a bond so, when a  pharmaceutical like this is available, you cure the 8,000 Americans who  have hemophilia?   Back to our 5 percent of our population who have chronic conditions.  What happens if we can cure just a couple percent of that? It is a big  deal. It would change the cost curve of healthcare. This is a radically  different way of thinking about healthcare.    So what happens when stories like this actually prove out to be true  that those who are suffering with ALS, that sometime in the next year  or two, we are going to have a pharmaceutical, it does not cure at this  point, but it stabilizes the horrible regression of one's life and  abilities that are chewed up by ALS?   Stop. You may have to have this injection a couple times a year,  maybe four times a year. It may be $100,000 per injection. How do we  come up with a methodology that finances such a thing because the cost  of the progression of this disease is stunningly expensive, and it is  just the right thing to do?   It turns out the debate we have had in this place for years of who  pays and who subsidizes now can be a discussion of: How do we use  technology to disrupt the price of healthcare? How do we get healthier  and personal control of our healthcare instead of a collectivist  vision? And how do we finance these incredible disruptive  pharmaceuticals that are coming that either stabilize or cure that  portion of our society who have chronic conditions, who are suffering,  but are also much of our healthcare cost?   This is good news. These are exciting. There should be joy in this  place that we are part of a time that can have this type of curative  approach to healthcare and make these sorts of differences.   So, look, those are a couple of the happy things. If we do our job  well, if we get the financing right, we can have this type of  disruption and see it in the cost curve of healthcare.   So now I want to sort of jump to some of the other discussions that  have been around this body, particularly today, a little bit yesterday,  on greenhouse gases, on climate change, on those things. My frustration  with this is great rhetoric, really bad math.   So let's actually talk about a couple of things that have been going  on and why the rhetoric doesn't match reality.   I believe, actually, technology and those on the more conservative  side actually have solutions that grow the economy, provide  opportunities for our family, provide the opportunities. Remember our  five points that, if we don't have the economic expansion, we can't  keep our promises.   So just as a point of reference, I brought these two slides again.  This one is from 2015. The yellow over there is all the photovoltaic in  the country that was added in 2015. It was a miraculous year, over 38  gigawatts of new generation, power generation, solar. Isn't that  wonderful? Except we took 33 gigawatts of power generation out of  nuclear.   We really didn't gain that much in clean noncarbon-producing or  nongreenhouse-producing energy. You can't have one without the other.  You can't run around and say: Didn't we do  [[Page H4308]]  great? Look, we added all the solar, how much cleaner the world got.  Oh, by the way, we shut down all this nuclear, so actually our baseload  didn't really go anywhere.   Well, it turns out that math was pretty much the exact same the next  year. Once again, the yellow is the photovoltaic that was added. The  multicolor here is the amount of nuclear that came offline. It turns  out more nuclear came offline, in a weird way, because of the loss of  all that nuclear baseload generation.   The photovoltaic that came to the market, which is wonderful--I am  from Arizona. I love it. But we didn't get any better on power  generation that doesn't produce greenhouse gases.   So once again, around here, we need to open our minds and understand  just sort of basic math that you can't be joyful about one and not be  supportive of the other and actually be making mathematical progress.  It is just math.   So back to a thought experiment. I did this on the floor the other  day, and I am going to do it again just because it did create some  really interesting phone calls.   I am going to believe this one here might end up being the single  biggest disruption in my life. And forgive me if I don't get everything  perfect here, but about 4 or 5 months ago, reading some strange  journal--that is what happens when you are on a plane 10 hours a week;  you read a lot of stuff--there was this article. We have vetted it  repeatedly, and it appears it is real.   U.S. labs from universities have sort of broken the Holy Grail in  regards to plant biology. Bear with me. This is a big deal.   What would happen tomorrow if the next generation of agriculture was  40 percent more productive? It would be a miracle. You would feed the  world for the next 250 years.   Think about if you had a 40 percent improvement in agriculture, how  much less water, fuel, what does it do to land prices?   Well, it turns out if you really care about the environment and  greenhouse gases, here is your thought experiment I want you to  struggle through.   World agriculture produces about 2.2 times more greenhouse gases than  every car on Earth. So if you had a 40 percent improvement in  agriculture productivity, it would be as if you removed every car off  the face of the Earth. You just have to be willing to eat seed stock  that functionally, actually, is a type of GMO.   Now, all they did is change some of the cell biology so it grabs the  carbon molecule every time instead of accidentally grabbing the oxygen  molecule and then spending lots of energy trying to purge the oxygen,  which apparently is just one of the inherent faults in nature. They  fixed it.                                time  2100    They did it with tobacco plants. We always use tobacco plants because  that is a genome we have known. I guess that is the first one we broke.  But now they are moving into other types of agricultural stock.   Be prepared. Watch for this. This technology may be one of the  biggest disruptions.   But as a body, when we talk about global warming, when we talk about  this, how much of this body is ready to understand there is technology  coming? Are Members willing to embrace the technology instead of the  sort of Malthusian view that we need to shrink as an economy, that we  need to be controlled, that we need to be managed? Or do Members allow  these market forces to be incredibly disruptive?   I didn't bring the slides this time, but in that same stock, think  about some of the other things going on. Apparently, there has been a  huge breakthrough in the technology of pulling carbon right out of the  air, being able to take that carbon, mix it with some other chemicals,  and turn it back into a fuel stock--negative carbon emission,  economically done. I am looking forward to the joy coming from my  environmental friends who understand.   We have already proven that carbon sequestration works. We have  proven that we can generate power with coal, with natural gas, without  a smokestack, and capture every bit of carbon and then reuse it,  sequester it, if we choose. But now we are going to negative carbon  mining.   Why that is really important is, how many people believe that China  with the 30-plus new coal plants that are going up as part of the Belt  and Road Initiative, that they are going to have lots of great  scrubbers on them?   Once again, if the goal is to punish the United States, great, the  rhetoric is brilliant. If the goal is to grow as a society but still be  cleaner, go with pro-economic expansion embracing of technology and let  us have jobs. Let us have economic expansion so we can keep our  promises.   The last thought experiment I am going to give tonight, remember how  a little while ago I mentioned this is sort of Member week? We call it  pitch week, where a Member will come pitch their priorities, pitch  their ideas in the different committees of jurisdiction. We are hoping  that Members we are already working with will go to the committees that  do certain types of foreign aid.   How many out there care about plastic in the ocean? How many think  banning straws in communities is going to do anything about plastic in  the ocean? If a Member believes that, they have been conned. It is  great virtue signaling, ``Hey, I am banning straws,'' but it is absurd.   Mr. Speaker, 90 percent of the plastic in the ocean comes from 10  rivers, eight of them in Asia, two in Africa. Let's do something that  actually works.   If we are going to have foreign aid and some of the environmental  programs and these things that are out in the world, let's go to those  10 rivers and start removing the plastic.   Let's add value. Let's do those things. If 90 percent of the plastic  in the ocean is coming from 10 rivers--eight in Asia, two in Africa--we  know where it is coming from. It may not provide the virtue signaling  opportunity that we enjoy around here, but it would make the oceans  cleaner.   For once, could we drop some of the political theater? Just like the  vote we had earlier today, where it is great politics, gins up the  base, gives us something to rally around, but it doesn't accomplish  anything.   Mr. Speaker, please, to my Democratic friends, to my Republican  friends, are we here to do good?   My pitch to Members is that we know the problems, and we know the  math--let's be honest about that math--so let's actually do things.   In the next week or two, when we are starting to put together our  appropriations, our policy sets, is there anyone out there on the other  side who will help me say, for the 10 rivers in the world that are 90  percent of the plastic in the ocean, can we adjust that bilateral aid,  the foreign aid, the environmental guidance, the other things we do, go  to those 10 rivers and start to do something? We might lose the  political issue and make the environment better. Or will we just stick  around here and say that we don't need to solve the problem because we  want to be able to talk about it?   Sorry for the sarcasm, but I am frustrated that we are living in a  time of amazing opportunity, of technology disruption, where if Members  really care about healthcare, we are on the cusp of a crash of its  price, but yet its quality and its cures are here. Can we break down  some of the barriers that are stopping us from getting there?   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
