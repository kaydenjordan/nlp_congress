 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 873) to authorize the Global War on Terror Memorial  Foundation to establish the National Global War on Terrorism Memorial  as a commemorative work in the District of Columbia, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(4) Memorial.--The term ``memorial'' means the National       Global War on Terrorism Memorial authorized to be established       under section 2.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 873, the Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act,  authored by Congressman Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, would authorize  the Global War on Terror Memorial Foundation to begin the lengthy  Commemorative Works Act process to establish a Global War on Terrorism  Memorial on Federal land in the District of Columbia. The memorial will  recognize and honor the men and women who have served on Active Duty in  the United States Armed Forces since the attack on our country on  September 11, 2001.   The global war on terrorism is the longest conflict ever fought by  the United States, and there is still no end in sight. We can and  should debate the policies that have prolonged this war and denied our  troops the full might and resources of our Nation. But one thing is far  above and beyond any debate, and that is the heroism, selflessness,  devotion, and patriotism of the men and women of our Nation who stepped  forward from the safety, security, and comfort of hearth and home and  into harm's way when our Nation called.   The Commemorative Works Act requires that a war be ended for at least  10 years before planning can commence on a national memorial. There is  good reason for this requirement: it gives history the insight to place  the war in an historic context and to begin to fully appreciate its  full significance to our country and future generations.   But the war on terrorism has been fought in a decidedly different way  than our past wars. We are now approaching the 16th anniversary of the  attack on New York and Washington. The veterans who sacrificed so much  to keep that war away from our shores deserve some tangible and lasting  tribute to their patriotism and altruism while they, their families,  and their fellow countrymen can know it. The Gold Star families of our  fallen heroes for whom the war will never end deserve some assurance  that their sons and daughters will never be forgotten by a grateful  Nation.   We should remember that many of our Nation's heroes from World War II  never lived to see the completion of the World War II Memorial, which  was completed 59 years after the end of that conflict.   For these reasons, this measure suspends the 10-year period in  current law. It doesn't repeal it. It merely sets it aside for the  unique circumstances of the current war on terrorism.   I am confident that the Memorial Commission will respect and  appreciate the fact that many may have yet to serve in this war, and  history has not yet had time to reflect on its significance to our  Nation and, indeed, to the future of Western civilization. I am sure  the design they recommend will respect these facts and provide  significant latitude for the completion of the memorial after this bane  of Islamic terrorism has been extirpated from our planet and the long- suffering people of the Middle East have been liberated from it by the  brave fighting men and women of the United States Armed Forces that  this memorial will honor and thank.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a July 28, 2017, letter from the  Congressional Budget Office providing a cost estimate for this bill.                                        Congressional Budget Office,                                                   U.S. Congress,                                      Washington, DC, July 28, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 873, the Global       War on Terrorism War Memorial Act.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Janani       Shankaran.            Sincerely,                                                    Mark P. Hadley,                                        (For Keith Hall, Director).        Enclosure.             H.R. 873--Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act  As ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July                                  26, 2017         H.R. 873 would authorize the Global War on Terror Memorial       Foundation, a non-profit organization, to establish a       memorial in the District of Columbia and its environs to       commemorate members of the armed forces who served on active       duty in support of the Global War on Terrorism.        Because H.R. 873 would prohibit the use of federal funds to       establish the memorial, CBO estimates that implementing the       legislation would result in no significant costs to the       federal government.        Enacting H.R. 873 would affect direct spending; therefore,       pay-as-you-go procedures apply. The memorial project would be       subject to the requirements of the Commemorative Works Act.       Under that act, any entity that receives a permit to       construct a memorial must donate to the National Park       Foundation (a nonprofit organization) an amount equal to 10       percent of the memorial's estimated construction cost. That       amount, as well as any project funds remaining after       construction of the memorial, would be available in future       years for maintenance of the memorial.        Based on the experience of similar commemorative projects,       CBO expects that any amounts collected by the federal       government for maintenance would not be received for several       years and would be offset by an expenditure soon thereafter.       On net, CBO estimates that such effects would be       insignificant. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues.        CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 873 would not increase net       direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.        H.R. 873 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector       mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and       would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.        The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Janani       Shankaran. The estimate was approved by Theresa A. Gullo,       Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), the author of this  measure, one of the many thousands of Americans who stepped forward to  answer their country's call.   Mr. Gallagher. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership  on this issue, for working with us, and I ask that he please extend our  thanks to every member of the Natural Resources Committee for its  effort in getting this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank the gentleman from Arizona for his words  and for his service. It is my honor to call him my fellow marine. As an  officer, I did my best just not to get in the way of my enlisted  marines, who were doing the real work. Maybe we can bring some of that  same ethos here to Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill that honors  our post-9/11 veterans and secures their rightful place in our Nation's  Capital.   Earlier this summer, I had the honor of welcoming a group of American  heroes who journeyed from northeast Wisconsin to Washington, D.C.,  aboard the Old Glory Honor Flight. That is one of the truly incredible  things we get to do as Members of Congress.   Just to watch generation after generation of veterans representing  every major conflict since World War II visiting the very memorials  that honor their sacrifice, their service, their commitment, their  courage in those conflicts was one of the most remarkable experiences  of my life.   Just as these veterans visited their respective memorials, so, too,  should the brave men and women who have served and continue to serve in  the ongoing war on terrorism have a memorial one day to honor their  courage, their sacrifice, their commitment. But as the chairman laid  out, current law does not allow for the creation for a memorial for the  war on terror.   The 1986 Commemorative Works Act requires that monuments in honor of  a ``. . . limited military engagement or a unit of an armed force may  not be authorized . . . until at least 10 years after the officially  designated end of such war or conflict.''   But as we know, this is a conflict unlike many others that have  preceded it. This war will have no clear end date, no V Day or V-J Day.  Threats continue to rise, so the longest ongoing conflict in our  Nation's history continues. After 15 years, after over 6,800 American  lives lost, there is still no end in sight.   So this memorial is for the men and women who have died fighting,  those who continue to fight, those who are still joining the fight  against terrorism.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to take a second to recognize the dedicated  members of the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation, many of  whom are with us here today, especially Andrew Brennan, George  Chewning, Chad Longell, and Matt Gannon. They have been tireless in  their commitment to getting this done. Today we are taking an important  step forward, but we still need to get it across the finish line, so I  want to recognize their efforts.   I just want to say, Mr. Speaker, like most, I struggle with how to  truly honor the men and women whose sacrifices far exceed my own. I was  lucky. I had great marines that kept me safe, and we all came home  safe. But my hope is that this memorial will serve as not only a way to  honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifices, but also as a call to  action for us, the living.   I believe that those we will pay tribute to through this memorial  didn't risk everything just so we would sit back and praise them for  keeping us safe. I would submit to you that the fallen don't want our  praise. They want our participation in this incredible experiment in  self-government.   If we are going to continue passing the torch of democracy from one  generation to the next, then we need to build this memorial so that  future generations never forget their duty to do the same, so that  future generations never forget the cost of liberty.   Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support this legislation to  memorialize the service of the brave men and women who have fought in  the global war on terrorism.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), who has  brought this legislation before us today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   With this vote, we will begin proceeding on this memorial and begin a  process of planning a great work to honor the bravery, sacrifice, and  patriotism to those who have defended Western civilization from the  medieval barbarism that has reappeared in our time.   But even more importantly, we begin work on a tangible promise for  future generations, a promise animated by the heroic deeds of these  veterans, the promise of a coming age of liberty and justice, of peace  and tolerance that will surely come. I ask for adoption of this  measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
