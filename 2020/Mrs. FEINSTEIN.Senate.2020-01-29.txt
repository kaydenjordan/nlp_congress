 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the House  managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Feinstein asks the House managers:         The President's counsel stated that ``there is simply no       evidence anywhere that President Trump ever linked security       assistance to any investigations''--is that true?    Mr. Manager CROW. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and thank you,  Senator, for that question.   President's counsel is not correct. There is, in fact, overwhelming  evidence that the President withheld the military aid directly to get a  personal political benefit to help his individual political campaign.   There are a few points that I would like to submit for your  consideration.   First, look no further than the words of the President's Acting Chief  of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, who, on October 17, 2019, during a national  press conference mentioned--or he was asked about the direct connection  between the aid, and he said ``Did he''--meaning President Trump,  referring to ``he''--``also mention to me in passing the corruption  related to the DNC server? Absolutely--no question about that. That's  it, and that's why we held up the money.''   He was repeating the President's own explanation relayed directly to  him.   Second, Gordon Sondland testified he spoke by phone with President  Trump on September 7. The President denied there was a ``quid pro  quo,'' but then outlined the very quid pro quo that he wanted from  Ukraine.   Then he told Ambassador Sondland that President Zelensky should ``go  to a microphone and announce the investigations . . . he should want to  do [it].''   Third, the President's own advisers, including the Vice President and  Secretary Pompeo, were also aware of the direct connection. In Warsaw,  on September 1, Ambassador Sondland told Vice President Pence that he  was concerned the delay in security assistance had become ``tied to the  issue of investigations.'' The Vice President simply nodded, tacitly  acknowledging the conditionality of the aid.   Fourth, we heard from Ambassador Taylor, who, in direct emails and  texts, said it was crazy to tie the security assistance to the  investigations.   Five, we also know there is no other reason. The entire apparatus and  structure of the Defense Department, the State Department that should  have been dealing with the other legitimate reasons--you know, the  policy debate that the President's counsel wants you to believe that  this was about--they were all kept in the dark.   And the supposed interagency process that they made up several months  after the fact had ended months before, during the last interagency  meetings.   Now I will make one final point. Again, if you have any lingering  questions about direct evidence, any thoughts about anything we just  talked about, anything I have just relayed or that we have talked about  the last week, there is a way to shed additional light on it: You can  subpoena Ambassador Bolton and ask him that question directly.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Utah.    Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Feinstein.    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I send a question to  the desk on behalf of Senators Carper, Coons, Hirono, Leahy, Tester,  Udall, and myself to the House managers. Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator Feinstein and the other  Senators is to the House managers:         The President has taken the position that there should be       no witnesses and no documents provided by the executive       branch in response to these impeachment proceedings. Is there       any precedent for this blanket refusal to cooperate, and what       are the consequences if the Senate accepts this position       here?    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, President Trump  has taken really an extreme measure to hide this evidence from  Congress. No President has ever issued an order to direct a witness to  refuse to cooperate in an impeachment inquiry before this.   Despite his famous attempts to conceal the most damaging evidence  against him, even President Nixon allowed senior officials to testify  under oath. Not only did he allow them; he told them to go to Congress  voluntarily and answer all relevant questions truthfully.   But President Trump issued a blanket order directing the entire  executive branch to withhold all documents and testimony from the House  of Representatives. His order was categorical. It was indiscriminate  and unprecedented. Its purpose was clear: to prevent Congress from  doing its duty under the Constitution to hold the President accountable  for high crimes and misdemeanors.   Telling every person who works in the White House and every person  who works in every department, agency, and office of the executive  branch is just unprecedented. It wasn't about specific, narrowly  defined privileges. He never asserted privileges, and the President's  counsel has mentioned over and over that he had some reason because of  the subpoenas.   Well, I tell you, we adopt rules about subpoenas in the House. The  Senate is a continuing body, but the House isn't. In January, we  adopted our rules, and it allows the committee chairman to issue  subpoenas, and that is what they did.   He refused to comply with those subpoenas, not because he exerted  executive privilege but because he didn't like what we were doing. He  tried to say it was invalid, but it was valid.   Actually, he doesn't have the authority to be the arbiter of the  rules of the House. The House is the sole arbiter of its rules when it  comes to impeachment.   Now, this refusal to give testimony, documents, and the like is still  going on. We still have former or current administration officials who  are refusing to testify. You know, we would not allow this in any other  context. You know, if a mayor said that I am not going to answer your  subpoenas, they would be dealt with harshly if it was to cover up  misdeeds and crimes, as we have here. The mayor would actually go to  jail for doing that.   If we allow the President to avoid accountability by simply refusing  to provide any documents, any witnesses--unlike every single President  who preceded him--we are opening the door not just to eliminating the  impeachment clause in the Constitution. Try doing oversight. Try doing  oversight, Senators, working without that in the House. If the  President can just say, we are not sending any witnesses; we are not  sending any documents; we don't have to; we don't like your processes;  we have a wholesale rejection of what you are doing--that is not the  way our Constitution was created. Each body has a responsibility. There  is sharing of power. I, and I know you, cherish the responsibility that  we have that would be eviscerated if the President's complete stalling  is allowed to persist and be accepted by this body. You have to act now  in this moment in history.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.
