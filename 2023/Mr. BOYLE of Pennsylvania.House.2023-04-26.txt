 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle will claim  they are being ``fiscally responsible.'' Let's be clear. There never  has been and never will be anything fiscally responsible about refusing  to pay America's bills. Killing millions of jobs is also not fiscally  responsible. Neither is knowingly unleashing a recession.   That is why even former President Trump said: ``I can't imagine  anybody ever even thinking of using the debt ceiling as a negotiating  [tool].''   Now, I had hoped that when the Speaker referred to the budget process  and debt ceiling as ``apples and oranges,'' it meant my friends on the  other side finally understood the real-world ramifications of their  reckless brinkmanship, yet here we are.                                time  1430    Republicans' DOA act, the default on America act, will cut  investments, crush job creation, and crash the economy.   Their default on America act must be DOA. There is no way Congress  will agree to 10 years of destructive caps and the biggest single cut  to nondefense programs in American history.   For what? In exchange for a few months of respite before we would  have to go through this debt ceiling roller coaster all over again.   Mr. Speaker, when the American people hear what I just said, the  biggest single cut to nondefense programs in the history of the  American Government, they might be wondering what exactly that means.   Well, here are some specifics:   First, in total, we are talking about an immediate cut of at least  $142 billion.   That would mean, for example, public safety. After recent near- misses, under this bill, 125 air traffic control towers would be shut  down, impacting one-third of all airports. Following the disastrous  derailments in eastern Ohio and West Virginia, rail safety jobs would  be dramatically reduced, with 11,000 fewer safety inspection days and  30,000 fewer miles of track inspected annually.   Our communities would be less safe with the cut of Federal support to  60 local law enforcement agencies, 300 to 400 fewer local law  enforcement positions, as well as approximately 11,000 fewer FBI  personnel.   On health, amid a mental health and overdose crisis, nearly 1 million  people facing a suicidal or mental health crisis would be unable to  access support services through the 988 suicide and crisis lifeline,  and tens of thousands of individuals could be denied admission to  opioid use disorder treatment.   In terms of families and nutrition, with the looming rise of food  insecurity, nutrition services such as Meals on Wheels would be cut for  more than 1 million seniors.   How can we allow this to happen?   We simply cannot and must not.   Now, many of us on this side of the aisle who will be speaking will  detail even more of the cuts that are included in this DOA, default on  America act, but for now, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), Speaker Emerita of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my fellow  Pennsylvanian, as well as all the Members of this House, that according  to Moody's Analytics, the legislation that is in front of us ``would  meaningfully increase the likelihood of recession.'' And lead to  800,000 job losses by the end of 2024.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott), the ranking member of the Education and the Workforce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the ranking member of the  Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, just to be clear, to correct  the Record, three times under former President Trump, the debt ceiling  was increased.   Many of us on this side of the aisle voted for it, even though it was  a President not of our own party. In those three debt ceiling  increases, zero of them, zero included cuts to any government spending.   In fact, two of them included increases to government spending.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Higgins), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I keep hearing this doom and  gloom from the other side of the aisle that we are on the brink of  catastrophe. Here is the headline in the world's leading economic  magazine, a magazine that is considered right of center. This is their  headline 2 weeks ago: ``The lessons from America's astonishing economic  record. The world's biggest economy is leaving its peers even further  in the dust.'' That is the accurate record of where this country and  its economy stand right now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Mrs. Hayes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Vermont (Ms. Balint), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, first, I thank my friend, Mr.  Arrington, and truly, we have been friends for our entire time of  service here. I respect his sincerity and how committed he is on this  issue.   I say to him, and I hope he will take this under consideration, that  it is so irresponsible to use the debt ceiling in this way.   Here is the analogy. I mentioned three times we raised the debt  ceiling with a Republican President. Imagine if, in one of those debt  ceiling debates, this side of the aisle said: ``Well, we care deeply  about raising the minimum wage. Right now, we have the longest period  in American history, for as long as the minimum wage has existed,  without an increase, about 15 years.''   What if this side of the aisle said: ``We are not going to vote for a  debt limit increase. We are going to use this as leverage, and in  return, you need to raise the minimum wage, or you need to expand  Medicare to those 55 and older.'' That would be irresponsible, as well.   The debt ceiling is about past spending that both sides often voted  for, that Presidents of both parties signed into law.   Now, if we want to have a conversation about future spending, we  welcome that. We will negotiate on that, but we will not negotiate on  whether or not America pays its bills, period.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar), a member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, listening to all of the doom  and gloom from the previous speaker, you might forget for a moment that  right now, in the world, the greatest economic recovery from COVID is  that of the United States of America, with the greatest job growth in  my lifetime.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Levin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Craig), a member of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Trone), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a distinguished member of  the Budget Committee.     Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time for closing.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman on the other side for this  vigorous debate. Again, I would remind all of us about what is involved  in the DOA act: the single biggest cut to nondefense programs in  American history.   It would, according to Moody's Analytics, lead to 800,000 job losses  by the end of 2024 and a dramatically increased likelihood of a  recession. It would do absolutely nothing to solve the real problems  that we have in our society.   Mr. Speaker, this is not good policy for the American people. This  will jeopardize the record job growth that we are currently  experiencing.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of this House to make the DOA act  exactly that, dead on arrival. Vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
