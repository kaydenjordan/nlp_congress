 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to officially welcome folks  from the Warren County Chamber Alliance to the Capitol this week.   I am so proud to represent these folks here in Congress and so glad  that they are here in Washington these past few days. These leaders are  incredible advocates for our Warren County businesses and residents.   We have had a very productive time discussing our bipartisan policy  work and how our office can help them in their work. They have great  projects, from road updates to high-speed internet expansion to  updating water lines. We hope to have over $14 million coming back to  southwest Ohio in this budget, which, when passed, will help ensure  that these projects are fully funded.   Again, I am proud to officially recognize their visit to D.C. this  week and look forward to continuing our work together.                            ____________________
