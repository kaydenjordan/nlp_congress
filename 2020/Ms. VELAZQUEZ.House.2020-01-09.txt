 Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday morning, southwest Puerto Rico  was struck by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake.   That seismic event followed hundreds of smaller quakes that had  rattled the region since December 28. However, Tuesday's quake  inflicted enormous damage, causing a school to collapse, killing at  least one person, and leaving almost the entire island without power.   Indeed, today, Puerto Rico's largest power generation facility, Costa  Sur, remains offline as we speak. That power plant is responsible for  40 percent of electricity generation on the island. Even as of last  night, more than two-thirds of Puerto Ricans had no electricity.   Mr. Speaker, 250,000 Puerto Ricans were without water. Hundreds of  homes were damaged. As of last night, more than 5,200 Puerto Ricans  were sleeping on the street, afraid their homes could collapse on them.   For the people of Puerto Rico, this natural disaster evokes dark  memories seared in our minds of how this administration and the Federal  Government failed, turning a natural disaster into a humanitarian  crisis.   In 2017, because of this administration's incompetence and  indifference, the Puerto Rican people suffered immensely. They endured  the longest blackout in American history, and 3,000 of our fellow  citizens lost their lives. We cannot afford to repeat those mistakes.   Sadly, today, this administration's disdain for the people of Puerto  Rico remains on full display, this time in the form of previously  approved funds that it is withholding. In response to Hurricanes Maria  and Irma, Congress passed $8.3 billion in HUD relief and mitigation  funding, resources that HUD to this day refuses to release. Let me  repeat that: The Secretary of HUD is violating the law, scoffing at  congressional intent, and blocking the people of Puerto Rico from  receiving previously approved disaster funds. This comes even after  another disaster has stricken the island.   We do not know yet how bad the devastation from this earthquake will  be. We also do not know if there will be yet more earthquakes. But this  is certain: It is unacceptable, especially now, for Secretary Carson  and HUD to stand in the way of Puerto Rico's receiving previously  allocated assistance. It is also illegal.   Mr. Speaker, these are our fellow citizens. They deserve our  compassion and our assistance. When wildfires or earthquakes hit  California or hurricanes strike Texas, Americans stand together and  assist one another. They give each other the helping hand that they  deserve. But when it comes to Puerto Rico, this administration instead  chooses to stand in the way, to block necessary aid, and to put lives  at risk.   Mr. Speaker, if these funds are not released and if Puerto Rican  people perish in the aftermath of this earthquake, then I have to say  that it will be the U.S. Federal Government that is responsible.   We cannot afford further delay. HUD must release these funds  immediately, and FEMA must get to work, helping Puerto Rico recover  from the latest catastrophe.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this Administration's impulsive and  reckless behavior has made our nation and the men and women of our  armed forces less safe. It has heightened the risk of a conflict in the  Middle East and it has jeopardized our relationship with our allies-- both in the region and around the world.   We should remember--not long ago, many Members of this body voted to  ratify the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or the Iran deal. That  agreement was working, it was accepted by the world and, most of all,  it was containing Iran from securing nuclear weapons.  [[Page H115]]    President Trump and his Administration turned away from that  agreement, setting off a chain reaction of events, which led to  yesterday's attacks by Iran on American personnel who are serving in  Iraq.   We should be clear--no one in this body--Democrat or Republican--will  mourn the loss of Soleimani. He was a monster who was responsible for  horrible atrocities. However, we also have to question whether the  actions taken by this Administration in killing him made our nation,  our servicemembers and our allies safer or less safe.   So where have the Trump Administration's policies brought us?   The government of Iraq is asking U.S. forces to leave. After  thousands of American lives were lost and billions of dollars spent,  our ally in the fight against ISIS appears to be moving toward  expelling U.S. troops.   Iran has announced that it is resuming aggressive development of  nuclear weapons. The people of Iran are coalescing behind their  government, united in outrage from Soleimani's killing.   The United States government needs a comprehensive, well-considered  strategy for Iran. That strategy needs to be explained to Congress--and  more importantly to the American people. The rationale for killing  Soleimani must be fully and publicly explained. I believe the American  people people--when they hear the evidence--will agree that this action  was not necessary to prevent an imminent attack.   Most of all, we can no longer allow diplomacy and national security  to be conducted through Twitter.   The Resolution we will vote on today would prevent the Administration  from pursuing additional military action against Iran without properly  consulting Congress.   We, as a nation, must learn from the mistakes of the past. We cannot  allow our country to ignite another war by conducing foreign policy in  an irresponsible, impulsive manner.   The young people wearing our uniform abroad count on us to be better.  We have a moral obligation to the millions of innocent civilians living  in the Middle East who could perish or lose loved ones or their homes  if a broader conflict erupts.   We must be better than this Administration has been. I urge my  colleagues to support this Resolution.
