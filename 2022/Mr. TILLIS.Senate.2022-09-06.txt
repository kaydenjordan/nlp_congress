 Mr. President, I announce that my colleague from North  Carolina, Senator Richard Burr, will be necessarily absent this week.  He is at home in North Carolina recovering from hip replacement  surgery. The procedure was successful, and he is doing well. He will be  closely monitoring votes and looks forward to rejoining us here in the  Senate next week.                            ____________________
