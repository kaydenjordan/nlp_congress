 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to Botham  Jean.   Botham Jean was from the island of St. Lucia. He moved to Dallas,  went to college, and got a good job. As soon as he moved to Dallas, he  joined a church because he was a Christian and very much into the Word  of Jesus Christ.   On a Friday night a few weeks ago, he was in his apartment doing the  right thing at 10 o'clock at night, probably trying to relax and unwind  from the workday, and a Dallas police officer mistakenly came into his  house and shot and killed him.   My prayers are with Botham's family and friends.   Officer Amber Guyger, who killed Botham, has been charged with  manslaughter, even though she aimed, pulled, and fired the trigger. The  last five people in Dallas County who have been charged with  manslaughter have been charged with that charge because of drunk  driving. She was charged with manslaughter even though she aimed,  again, and pulled the trigger.   The Dallas Police Department fired Guyger on Monday amid overwhelming  outrage in the community. I think it was the right decision, but it was  long overdue.   I want to be clear. I respect law enforcement in this country and  their sacrifices. But also, if we look at the facts of this case, the  facts show us that Officer Guyger shot an unarmed Black man in his own  apartment, and she was able to go back to her apartment that night. She  had days before police finally arrested her, and she was given the  benefit of the doubt, something that was not given to Botham Jean.   I firmly believe that if Officer Guyger had walked into that  apartment and seen a White man or a White woman, she would not have  pulled that trigger. I firmly believe that. That is the root of the  problem. What I can say with certainty is that I am tired of waiting  for a time when it is safe to be a Black man in America.                                time  1045    I have a 12-year-old son. Other Congressional Black Caucus members  have kids and grandkids, sons and grandsons. Other people around the  country have sons, grandsons, and nephews whom they love and want to be  safe every day.   America is at the brink of a prolonged watershed moment between the  African-American community and police officers in this country. We need  action. We need to collectively break the dam. As a Nation, we need to  fix the culture of police brutality and gun violence against  communities of color that have lined the fabric of this country for  over a century.   Our criminal justice system is rooted in a systemic failure to  prosecute the  [[Page H9099]]  unjustified shooting of Black men and boys.   I am deeply troubled that the Texas Rangers took so long to issue an  arrest warrant for Amber Guyger. I am angry that people are actually  calling Botham's character into account because he had a very small  amount of marijuana in his apartment: 0.3 ounces.   We will never know what was in Amber Guyger's apartment because,  again, it was 36 hours before a warrant was issued for her arrest.  Police didn't go and search her apartment. She had days to clear out  her apartment, if there was anything in there, but we will never know  because it took them so long to issue an arrest warrant after she  walked into someone's apartment that was not her own and, again, aimed,  fired, and pulled the trigger.   I am heartbroken that this man was killed in his own apartment, a  place where all of us should feel safe. But what gets me most upset is  that nothing has changed. This is a story that we have heard on repeat,  and the dial will keep spinning until we put an end to it.   We all know the names, and there have been too many to share, but I  just wanted to remind you of a few.   In South Carolina, Levar Jones was stopped at a gas station. He was  instructed by police officers to get his license. He had his hands up.  As he was reaching for his license, the police shot him, after being  instructed to get his license and insurance out of the car.   In Florida, Charles Kinsey was shot while taking care of an autistic  patient. Go back and look at the YouTube videos of these. You don't  have to take my word. He is sitting on the curb, taking care of this  autistic patient, hands up in the air, and police shoot him.   Antwon Rose from east Pittsburgh was 17 years old. He was unarmed,  with his hands up, and shot by a policeman.   Go and look at the videos. Their lives have all been cut short. Males  in the Black community have been unjustly killed in our country at a  staggering rate. We need law enforcement to be transparent in the line  of duty and we need to work diligently to remove biases for those  ranks. I hope that is something we can do together. Don't think it  can't be your rights next. Don't think they won't tread on you.                            ____________________
