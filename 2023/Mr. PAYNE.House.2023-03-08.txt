 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate March as National  Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month.   Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths  nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention.   This year, more than 153,000 Americans will be diagnosed with the  disease, and more than 51,000 people will die from it. Yet, if we catch  it early, 90 percent of patients can survive within 5 years.   The key is awareness and education. If we can educate more Americans  about colorectal cancer, we can limit the number of deaths from it. We  can remove the fears and stigmas that prevent people from getting  screenings.   It is 11 years, 2 days ago, on March 6, that I lost my father,  Congressman Donald Payne, Sr., to colorectal cancer.   If more people get screened, we can prevent more families, more  fathers, more mothers, more sisters, and more brothers from succumbing  from the dreaded disease.                            ____________________
