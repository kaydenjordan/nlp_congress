 Mr. Speaker, why are we here this morning? We are  here because dignity should be part of life in America. We are here  because the Founding Fathers, imperfect as they were, said we are here  to create a more perfect union.   We are specifically here because a Justice on the United States  Supreme Court, Justice Clarence Thomas, appallingly stated that other  cherished, fundamental rights should be subject to abrogation, writing:  ``In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive  due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.''   It is shameful that we would have to be here today, but I proudly  stand with my community, those who understand and recognize that it is  crucial for the Respect for Marriage Act to pass so that respect can go  for the loving relationships, the families, the daughters, the sons,  the aunts and uncles, and all the husbands and wives that come as  family.   Let me be very clear: I am the only Member in the Texas delegation  that voted against the Defense of Marriage Act. I voted against it.   DOMA was wrong then, it is wrong now, and I continuously stand with  all of you to pass H.R. 8404, the Respect for Marriage Act.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in strong support for H.R. 8404, the  ``Respect for Marriage Act'' and the collaboration in the Senate last  week that enabled it to pass the Senate and return to the House for  today's vote.   I am very concerned that the archaic dictum that the Supreme Court  used in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization to justify  overturning the well-established and reaffirmed right to abortion could  be further weaponized in the future to strip away other fundamental  rights, including the right to marriage equality.   Specifically, in his concurring opinion to the Dobbs decision,  Clarence Thomas appallingly stated that other cherished, fundamental  rights should be subject to abrogation, writing, ``. . . in future  cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process  precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.''   Thomas left no doubt about his regressive, byzantine intentions,  adding, ``. . . we have a duty to `correct the error' established in  those precedents, Gamble v. United States, 587 U.S. __x-8 __  (2019) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 9). After overruling  these demonstrably erroneous decisions, the question would remain  whether other constitutional provisions guarantee the myriad rights  that our substantive due process cases have generated.''   To prevent Thomas's dream scenario from inflicting a nightmare on the  rest of the country, the Respect for Marriage Act would codify in  federal law our essential rights conferring marriage equality for same  sex and interracial couples, protecting the rights of Americans to  marry who they choose.   It would also repeal the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act  (DOMA) of 1996 that problematically defined marriage as being between  one man and one woman.   I am always concerned when someone's rights are being infringed,  which is why I wholeheartedly supported the version of this bill that  passed the House earlier this year.   Even with the Senate amendment, I still recognize the great strides  that will be achieved with passage of this bill in its current form.  The Senate's embrace of this legislation, with strong bipartisan  support, demonstrates the bill's alignment with bedrock American values  and its strong support among the American people, across political  ideologies.   After witnessing the Senate's passage of the Respect for Marriage  Act, I am proud to say that we are on a path to guaranteeing marriage  equality for every American.   The Supreme Courts' rulings in Loving v. Virginia, and Obergefell v.  Hodges were founded on the promise of unenumerated rights and due  process for all American people as guaranteed in the 9th and 14th  amendments of our nation's Constitution.   The 9th Amendment states that the federal government does not retain  final authority over rights not listed in the Constitution--which, in  effect, includes the right to marry someone regardless of their sex or  race. That very personal and intimate right is retained by the people.   Additionally, the 14th Amendment ensures that no right afforded to  the American people can be taken away without due process of law, while  also guaranteeing to all Americans that they shall have equal  protection under the law.   The same law that applies to a Black man wishing to marry a Hispanic  woman must be applied equally to an Indigenous woman wishing to marry a  White woman, a nonbinary individual wishing to marry a man, and so on.   That is the Constitutional promise in the United States.   Marriage Equality is not a right that can be stripped away by a  conservative faction of the United States Supreme Court, nor by  extremist Republican legislators.   It is a fundamental aspect of our democracy.   The assurances of the 14th Amendment became part of our national  governing documents as a protection against those who would use their  power to wipe away the freedoms of others without restraint or consent  of the governed.   It is unfortunate that we must rely on its strength again today.   We cannot and will not allow Republican lawmakers and conservative  Justices to continue to toy with the rights of the American people.   That is why I strongly support the Respect for Marriage Act and  commend my friends in the Senate for garnering bipartisan support for  this act.   This Act would ensure that an individual be considered married as  long as the marriage was valid in the state where it was performed.   This ensures that same-sex and interracial couples would continue to  enjoy equal treatment under federal law--as the Constitution requires.   This bill would go further by officially repealing the Defense of  Marriage Act.   While the Supreme Court effectively rendered DOMA inert with its  decision in Obergefell, this unconstitutional and discriminatory law  still officially remains on the books.   H.R. 8404 would repeal DOMA once and for all.   The Respect for Marriage Act would also prohibit any person acting  under color of state  [[Page H8832]]  law from denying full faith and credit to an out-of-state marriage  based on the sex, race, ethnicity or national origin of those in the  marriage.   It would also authorize the U.S. Attorney General to enforce these  protections and would allow recourse for any person harmed by a  violation of this provision.   We will not back down from demanding marriage equality.   We will not back down from demanding racial justice.   We will not back down from demanding equal rights for all of the  American people.   I strongly support H.R. 8404, the Respect for Marriage Act, and  encourage my colleagues to pass this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I know how hard the chairman works. I  would have preferred the mark of the President's budget, but this is  hard fought and hard won.   I thank the chairman for the raise that has been given to our  servicemen, their housing allowances. Let me thank him for this  important research stream to the historically Black colleges and for  Ukraine.   Let me also thank him for what we have fought for in the name of  Vanessa Guillen, and that is a new protocol for the sexual assault that  occurs in our military branches. Let me not point out a particular one.   Let me also stand on this floor and say hostage Brittney Griner has  come home. That is a testament to what America is all about. I thank  all those who played a role and indicate that, as she has come home and  her family is ecstatic, I remind everyone that former marine Paul  Whelan should be brought home, as well.   I thank President Biden for working on making sure there is an  authorization bill that really responds to the people of the United  States military. I am delighted that the amendments dealing with breast  cancer that I offered were included, $10 million for triple-negative  breast cancer. I am delighted for the PTSD funding, $2.5 million, that  I offered, as well, to ensure that the people of the military are taken  care of. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to recognize the importance.   Brittney Griner is home.   Madam Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to express my support  for the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 7776, the  National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2023.   Congress has the solemn duty to ensure that those who wear the  uniform of the United States--and those civilians who provide  logistical and operational support--have the equipment, training, and  resources needed to carry out and complete their mission.   And we must never forget that a grateful nation has a sacred  obligation, in the words of President Lincoln, ``to care for him who  has borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan.''   This legislation rises to meet that mandate admirably in myriad ways,  from providing a 4.6 percent pay raise for service members to  increasing funding for housing, childcare, and improved food for  service members.   Importantly, the bill provides over $131 million in funding for  research at HBCUs--a 22.8 percent increase--which improves integration  of HBCUs into our country's national defense research and development  infrastructure.   These are important measures because, as the DoD is the largest  federal agency, the wide scope of activities covered by the NDAA impact  every sector of our economy and every facet of American life. The  activities funded by the NDAA are, in effect, a microcosm of the  activities of the United States, and, as such, they must set the tone  for how these issues are to be addressed in our country's other  industries and communities.   Of course, the main purpose they serve is to protect our country and  strengthen our national defense. So, I am pleased that this bill  reinforces our capacity to meet the challenges posed by Russia's  aggression in Ukraine, China's increasing agitation in the South China  Sea, non-state terrorist groups, cyber-attacks, and other threats to  our country.   I am especially pleased that this bill adopts a modern yet long-term  approach to our national defense by embracing innovative strategies,  emerging technologies, workforce diversity and inclusion, preparation  for asymmetric combat, and operational continuity and resilience.   In furtherance of these essential principles and methods, I offered  amendments to the NDAA when it came to the floor of the House in July,  and I am very pleased that the legislation before us today includes my  amendments which I would like to summarize.   My amendment #191 authorizes a $2.5 million increase in funding to  combat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and I thank my colleagues  on the Armed Services Committee for adding the full $2.5 million  increase into this legislation.   PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war  veterans, but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents, such  as torture, being kidnapped or held captive, bombings, or natural  disasters such as floods or earthquakes. According to the NIH, an  estimated 3.6 percent of U.S. adults had PTSD in the past year.   People with PTSD may startle easily, become emotionally numb  (especially in relation to people with whom they used to be close),  lose interest in things they used to enjoy, have trouble feeling  affectionate, be irritable, become more aggressive, or even become  violent.   Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in their thoughts  during the day and in nightmares when they sleep. These are called  flashbacks. A person having a flashback may lose touch with reality and  believe that the traumatic incident is happening all over again.   My amendment recognizes that the soldiers afflicted with PTSD are,  first and foremost, human. They carry their experiences with them. Ask  a veteran of Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan about the frequency of  nightmares they experience, and one will realize that serving in the  Armed Forces leaves a lasting impression, whether good or bad.   My amendment will help ensure that ``no soldier is left behind'' by  addressing the urgent need for more outreach toward hard-to-reach  veterans suffering from PTSD, especially those who are homeless or  reside in underserved urban and rural areas of our country.   My amendment #194 authorizes a $10 million increase in funding for  increased collaboration between the DoD Office of Health and the  National Institutes of Health to research and combat Triple Negative  Breast Cancer. I am very pleased that my colleagues added the full $10  million increase into the bill.   As a Member of Congress, a mother, a sister and a spouse, and a  breast cancer survivor, I feel a special responsibility to do all I can  to ensure that every American can defeat all types of cancer, and  especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). We must increase our  efforts to protect women in the military, and women who are spouses of  service members, from this virulent and lethal illness.   The 13-25 percent of breast cancers that are triple-negative  disproportionately afflict  [[Page H8849]]  Black women. Although the rate of all breast cancers is 10 percent  lower in Black women than white women, Black women are 3 times more  likely to suffer from triple negative breast cancer than are white  women. In 2013, the American Cancer Society estimated that 27,000 Black  women are diagnosed with the illness annually.   African American women who are diagnosed with triple negative breast  cancer--an especially aggressive type of cancer which often occurs at  younger ages than other breast cancers--have a five year survival rate  of 78 percent after diagnosis as compared to 90 percent for white  women.   The key to beating this cancer is early detection, and the DoD's  health care system for women service members and women who are spouses  of service members can enable early detection.   A 2007 study of more than 50,000 women with all stages of breast  cancer found that 77 percent of women with triple-negative breast  cancer survived at least 5 years, versus 93 percent women with other  types of breast cancer. Another study of more than 1,600 women  published in 2007 found that women with triple-negative breast cancer  had a higher risk of death within 5 years of diagnosis.   By prioritizing this very lethal condition, the DoD can make great  strides in protecting women from triple negative breast cancer's worst  effects.   My amendment #199 directs the Secretary of Defense to ensure that  candidates granted admission to attend a military academy undergo  screening for speech disorders and be provided appropriate  opportunities and supportive services.   Academy students should have the option of undergoing speech therapy  to reduce speech disorders or impediments.   I am pleased that Report Language was added that cites the DoD's  recent attention to this issue, and states, in part, that the DoD is  now ``noting the availability of medical waivers in certain  circumstances for physical or medical standards, providing the Reading  Aloud Test administered to applicants,'' and very importantly,  ``describing the availability of speech therapy.''   My amendment #195 directs the Secretary of Defense to audit current  practices for the administration of sexual harassment claims and submit  a report detailing efforts to prevent sexual harassment and protect  service members, and compiling data and research on sexual harassment  prevalence in the military, cases reported, legal proceedings, and  convictions.   Sexual assault is endemic in our military, especially for female  service members. Streamlining and auditing the process of reporting  sexual assault protects victims and is a necessary step in weeding out  abusers.   I am very pleased that this bill advances key reforms to the Uniform  Code of Military Justice to prevent sexual harassment and abuse by:   placing sexual harassment and related sexual offenses in the  jurisdiction of the Special Trial Counsel;   requiring independent trained investigators outside of the immediate  chain of command to investigate claims of sexual harassment;   requiring the randomization of court-martial panels;   expanding reporting requirements on the implementation of the New  Special Trial Counsel program; and   permitting the Secretary of Defense to expand restricted reporting of  sexual assault for civilian employees rather than relegating them to  only filing unrestricted reports with the military.   In light of these measures to reform the enforcement process against  sexual offenses, I am pleased that, as a result of my amendment, Report  Language has been added, stating that, ``. . . the matters addressed in  this provision are routinely addressed in the Department's Annual  Report on Sexual Assault in the Military.''   My amendment #190 requires a report to be submitted to Congress  within 240 days following enactment on the risks posed by debris in low  earth orbit and to make recommendations on remediation of risks and  outline plans to reduce the incident of space debris.   Man-made objects in Earth's orbit that become space debris no longer  serve a useful function, yet their impact can pose serious risks to  personnel in orbiting spacecraft, satellites, and essential systems  since they travel at speeds up to 17,500 miles per hour. Space debris  includes nonfunctional spacecraft, abandoned launch vehicle stages,  mission-related debris, and fragmentation debris.   I am very pleased that my amendment led to inclusion of bill language  requiring the Secretary of Defense to respond to a reporting  requirement regarding space debris that was included in the Joint  Explanatory Statement accompanying the National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2022 specific to defense and national security  space assets.   My amendment #198 requires the National Guard Bureau, in coordination  with the Secretary of Defense, to submit to Congress and others in  2023, 2024, and 2025 a report identifying the personnel, training, and  equipment needed by the non-federal National Guard to prevent,  mitigate, respond to, and recover from natural and man-made disasters.   Hurricane Harvey's impact in Texas was so severe that it lingered for  years. The storm's footprint covered over 9,000 square miles, including  the city of Houston. Hurricane Harvey dropped over 52 inches of rain in  the Houston area. At its peak, one-third of Houston was underwater,  leaving 34,575 evacuees in shelters across Texas.   The scope and magnitude of these dueling disasters tested the  National Guard and Reservists in unprecedented ways. To prepare for  major natural disasters in the future, this amendment requires a  readiness report by the National Guard and Reservists to make sure they  have what they need to assist communities in need of disaster  assistance.   My amendment will help the National Guard help communities prepare  for disasters, respond to them, and rebuild from them. It will improve  the ability to support the important mission of the National Guard and  Reservists to engage in disaster response.   Thus, I am pleased that bill language was included to require the  Chief of the National Guard Bureau to include in the National Guard  Bureau unfunded priorities list any unfunded priorities related to non- Federal National Guard responsibilities in connection with natural and  man-made disasters.   My amendment #197 requires the Secretary of the Navy, not later than  180 days after enactment of this Act, to submit to Congress a report on  desalinization technology's application for defense and national  security purposes to provide drought relief to areas impacted by sharp  declines in water resources.   I am pleased my amendment resulted in Report Language stating that,  ``We are aware of the importance of expeditionary desalinization  capabilities to crisis scenarios, including natural disasters.  Accordingly, we direct the Secretary of the Navy to provide a report to  the congressional defense committees, not later than August 1, 2023,  outlining the current inventory and usage of desalinization systems,  planned future investments into technologies and systems, and any  current and projected future needs for expeditionary water purification  that may not be met by current and planned capabilities.''    My amendment #189 requires a report to be submitted within 220 days  following enactment on the Capacity to Provide Disaster Survivors with  Emergency Short Term Housing.   As we witnessed in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, as well as  other major natural disasters, enormous swaths of the population are  displaced, communities are unlivable with no prospect for near-term  rebuilding or restoration, and there is an enormous unmet need for  emergency housing.   Because of the need to prepare for the consequences of future major  natural disasters, I thank my colleagues on the Armed Services  Committee for including bill language that effectuates my amendment by  directing the development and submission of a report that will help  enable disaster survivors to access emergency short term housing.   My amendment #59 recognizes that Black men and women have played an  integral role in our nation's defense: from the bravery of Crispus  Attucks, an escaped slave, during the Boston Massacre, to today. The  amendment would address the historical and current barriers to Black  Americans' participation and equal treatment in the Armed Services.   The racial inequality and mistreatment of Black men and women that  has historically permeated our military continues to this day, with  more than 750 complaints of racial or ethnic discrimination from  service members in fiscal year 2020 alone.   But discrimination doesn't exist just within the military rank-and- file, as in FY2020, civilians working in the financial, technical and  support sectors of the Army, Air Force and Navy filed 900 complaints of  racial discrimination and over 350 complaints of discrimination by skin  color, as data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  reveals.   According to a report by the Defense Department's Diversity and  Inclusion Board, while the enlisted ranks of the active and reserve  military were ``slightly more racially and ethnically diverse than its  U.S. civilian counterparts,'' the opposite was true for the officer  corps.   We owe it to those brave men and women who have proven time and time  again to be an integral part of our military to examine the Armed  Services' history of discrimination and to determine the necessary  steps to repair the harm caused by these inequities.   I am very pleased by the inclusion of report language acknowledging  the history of inequities and stating in part, ``Therefore, we direct  the Secretary of Defense to brief the Committees on Armed Services of  the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than May 1,  2023, on those current and future efforts in support of a more  inclusive force. The brief  [[Page H8850]]  shall include resources allocated, lessons learned, how such efforts  advance our strategic national security and readiness postures in  support of the National Security Strategy and the Department's National  Defense Strategy, and any such other information as the Secretary deems  appropriate.''   My amendment #193 condemns the actions of Boko Haram and directs that  the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense  and the Attorney General, submit a report on efforts to combat Boko  Haram.   I am pleased that, as a result of my amendment, report language was  included stating that, ``We direct the Secretary of Defense, not later  than June 1, 2023, to brief the congressional defense committees on the  activities and initiatives undertaken by the Department of Defense to  assist the Government of Nigeria and countries in the Lake Chad Basin  to combat Boko Haram, al-Qaeda affiliates, and other terrorist  organizations while respecting and protecting human rights and  promoting respect for the rule of law.''   My amendment #192 requires the Secretary of Defense to report to  Congress about programs and procedures that ensure students studying  abroad through Department of Defense National Security Education  Programs are trained to recognize, resist, and report against  recruitment efforts by agents of foreign governments.   Because of the need for American students who are studying abroad to  be protected from risks and dangers presented by agents of foreign  governments, I am pleased that my amendment has resulted in bill  language that effectuates my amendment by requiring that a report  developed and submitted to Congress about the programs and procedures  that are being undertaken to protect these Americans studying abroad.   My amendment #196 directs the Secretary of Defense to report to  Congress in not less than 180 days the actions taken to protect U.S.  armed service personnel from armed attacks conducted by militants and  terrorists in pursuit of bounties and inducements the agencies,  organizations, or entities aligned with the Russian Federation.   I am pleased that my amendment resulted in the inclusion of report  language stating in part, ``. . . we direct the Secretary of Defense,  not later than June 1, 2023, to provide a briefing to the Committees on  Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on  actions taken to protect servicemembers and U.S. personnel from armed  attacks conducted in pursuit of bounties or inducements offered by  agencies, organizations, or entities aligned with Russia.''   Madam Speaker, I applaud my colleagues on the Armed Services  Committee, as well as their Senate counterparts, and the committee  staff in each chamber for their extraordinary work crafting this  extensive, multi-faceted, visionary legislation that will strengthen  our national defense both in the current fiscal year and for many years  to come.   I would also like to express my appreciation to my colleagues on the  committee for recognizing the value that my amendments bring to our  national defense infrastructure and maintaining them in the final  language that is before us today.    Mr. Speaker, this is a very historic day.   We overturned and dismissed the words of Justice Thomas that the  rights of Americans should be denied.   We voted for the Respect for Marriage Act that will be signed by the  President of the United States.   Then in the midst of darkness, Brittney Griner was swapped and is on  her way home. Negotiations by the hostage negotiating team took months  because Mr. Putin would not negotiate.  [[Page H8857]]    Finding our hostages and bringing them home is not a partisan issue.  I love Paul Whelan and his family. We introduced legislation passed by  the House that said to bring Brittney Griner home and bring Paul Whelan  home.   I am happy for Cherelle, Brittney's mother and father, Houston,  Phoenix, the Nation, and all the players in the WNBA, but we will  continue to use the power of the sovereign United States to bring Paul  Whelan home, as we did Trevor Reed and as we did those who came from  Venezuela.   Let us unify together. Let us celebrate Brittney and fight to bring  Paul Whelan home.                            ____________________
