 Mr. Speaker, this month, the Federal Reserve estimated GDP  will hit 4.8 percent in the second quarter of 2018. Under the former  administration, GDP never hit even 3 percent.   Thanks to tax reform and regulatory relief passed by this unified  Republican government, Americans are experiencing economic expansion  after 8 years of stagnation. According to the Bureau of Labor  Statistics:   One million jobs have been created since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  was enacted--223,000 were added last month;   In May, average hourly earnings increased by 2.7 percent; and   Unemployment is at its lowest since 2000.   The Conference Board also reports consumer confidence is at a 17-year  high.   Democrats apparently haven't learned the key to economic progress,  promising to raise taxes if given the chance. However, tax cuts and  repeal of onerous Obama-era regulations have been pivotal for our  economy. Now, nearly every measure of success is in our favor.                   The PROSPER Act is Good for Our Country     Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a little bit today about the  PROSPER Act and share some articles that have been published that help  explain why the PROSPER Act is so good for our country, so good for  students, and needs to be passed.   The first article is an article in Forbes by Preston Cooper, May 23,  2018.   Mr. Speaker, I include the entire article in the Record.                        [From Forbes, May 23, 2018]          What Betsy DeVos Should Have Said About the PROSPER Act                            (By Preston Cooper)         Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos testified before the       House Committee on Education and Workforce on Tuesday.       Representative Bobby Scott, the Democratic ranking member on       the committee, asked DeVos about his concerns with the       PROSPER Act, House Republicans' bill to reform the federal       role in higher education. DeVos' answer could have been       better. Here's how the exchange between the two proceeded:        Rep. Scott: Madam Secretary, the PROSPER Act provides for a       $15 billion cut in student aid, is that right?        Secretary DeVos: I've heard that opined. I'm not sure I       agree with that, but . . .        Scott: Do you have another number?        DeVos: Pardon me?        Scott: Do you have another number?        DeVos: It's an approach to giving students much more       flexibility in pursuing their higher education.        Scott: $15 billion cut. Do you have another number?        DeVos: I have heard that opined, that that is the case. I       said I don't necessarily share that perspective.        Here's a better answer that DeVos could have given to       Scott's question. (The below exchange, in case it's not       clear, is entirely fictional.)        Rep. Scott: Madam Secretary, the PROSPER Act provides for a       $15 billion cut in student aid, is that right?        Secretary DeVos: That's not quite accurate, Congressman,       but it's a common misconception. The Congressional Budget       Office score of the PROSPER Act did estimate a $15 billion       reduction in student aid over the next ten years, but only on       the mandatory side of the budget. Democrats and many in the       media latched onto this number, which appeared on page two of       the score, and ignored what the other thirty-five pages said.       But as I have read the entire CBO score, I can tell you that       the PROSPER Act does not cut federal spending on higher       education.        The PROSPER Act expands the federal government's flagship       student aid program for low-income students, the Pell Grant.       To encourage timely completion, the bill provides a $300       bonus to Pell Grant students who take on more than a full-      time course load. Most importantly, the bill makes several       regulatory changes aimed at expanding both student and       institutional eligibility for the program. As a result, under       the PROSPER Act, an additional 1.1 million students annually       would receive Pell Grants by 2027.        All of these changes cost money, of course. But the Pell       Grant is unique among federal programs in that it is funded       partially on the mandatory side of the budget, and partially       through the annual appropriations process. The $15 billion       reduction in student aid that you cited, Congressman, only       reflects changes on the mandatory side. If you include the       estimated increase in appropriations due to Pell Grant       expansion in your calculations, you'll find that the PROSPER       Act will increase, federal spending on higher education by       $12 billion over the next ten years.        While the PROSPER Act increases higher education spending       overall, it's true that the bill finds savings in certain       areas. In a time when the national debt surpasses $21       trillion, it's important to live within our means. Changes to       student loan repayment options are the largest single source       of savings in the PROSPER Act. These changes mostly focus on       limiting loan forgiveness, which in practice delivers its       benefits mostly to graduate borrowers with very large loans.       The bill makes these changes while retaining income-driven       repayment options for borrowers to ensure monthly payments       remain affordable.        The PROSPER Act therefore redistributes federal funds from       graduate students and those with high student loan balances,       who tend to be higher-income, to the low- and middle-income       undergraduate students who receive Pell Grants. These       priorities are also reflected in the administration's budget       proposal, which would make the student loan program more       generous for undergraduates and pay for it by asking higher-      earning graduate borrowers to pay a little more.        In conclusion, the PROSPER Act does not cut federal higher       education funding by $15 billion. It increases funding by $12       billion by making new investments in the Pell Grant program       for our nation's most vulnerable  [[Page H4743]]       students. Recognizing budget constraints, the bill partially       offsets the cost by reining in poorly-targeted and expensive       loan forgiveness programs. While I welcome debate over       specific provisions of the PROSPER Act, I hope those are       priorities that Democrats on the committee can get behind.     Mr. Speaker, Mr. Cooper explains that there is a common  misconception about PROSPER that is being exploited, unfortunately, by  many colleges and universities and our Democratic friends.   He says: ``The Congressional Budget Office score of the PROSPER Act  did estimate a $15 billion reduction in student aid over the next 10  years, but only on the mandatory side of the budget. Democrats and many  in the media latched onto this number, which appeared on page 2 of the  score, and ignored what the other 35 pages said. But as I have read the  entire CBO score, I can tell you that the PROSPER Act does not cut  Federal spending on higher education.''   ``The PROSPER Act expands the Federal Government's flagship student  aid program for low-income students, the Pell grant. To encourage  timely completion, the bill provides a $300 bonus to Pell grant  students who take on more than a full-time course load. Most  importantly, the bill makes several regulatory changes aimed at  expanding both student and institutional eligibility for the program.  As a result, under the PROSPER Act, an additional 1.1 million students  annually would receive Pell grants by 2027.''   ``. . . you'll find that the PROSPER Act will increase Federal  spending on higher education by $12 billion over the next 10 years.''   ``Changes to student loan repayment options are the largest single  source of savings in the PROSPER Act. These changes mostly focus on  limiting loan forgiveness, which in practice delivers its benefits  mostly to graduate borrowers with very large loans. The bill makes  these changes while retaining income-driven repayment options for  borrowers to ensure monthly payments remain affordable.''                                time  1215    ``In conclusion, the PROSPER Act does not cut Federal higher  education funding by $15 billion. It increases funding by $12 billion  by making new investments in the Pell Grant program for our Nation's  most vulnerable students. Recognizing budget constraints, the bill  partially offsets the costs by reining in poorly-targeted and expensive  loan forgiveness programs.''   I welcome the debate over specific provisions in the PROSPER Act, and  I hope that those priorities are ones that the colleges and  universities will get behind, and that our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle will get behind.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government became heavily involved  in the Nation's postsecondary education system when Congress passed the  Higher Education Act of 1965.   Over time, well-intentioned but misdirected policies and requirements  have put special interests ahead of students' interests. It is time to  develop a system designed to support students in completing an  affordable postsecondary education that will prepare them to enter the  workforce with the skills they need for lifelong success.   The Education and the Workforce Committee is moving us in that  direction, Mr. Speaker, by passing last December the PROSPER Act. The  PROSPER Act, the word ``PROSPER'' stands for: Promoting Real  Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform.                                time  2045    It is a really apt title for what it is that the committee is  proposing. I emphasize this is a work of the Education and the  Workforce Committee and the 23 Republican Members who are on that  committee.  [[Page H4771]]    What the PROSPER Act does is it expands student access to higher  education in many different ways:   It allows students to use Federal student aid, including Pell grants,  for shorter term programs that will help students get into the  workforce more quickly.   It expands the availability of industry-led earn-and-learn programs  that lead to high-wage, high-skill, and high-demand careers.   It improves early awareness of postsecondary Federal financial aid  options for students in high school.   It makes the application for Federal student aid easier for middle  class families by streamlining the Free Application for Federal Student  Aid, or FAFSA, making the FAFSA available on a mobile application and  ensuring both the app and the online form are consumer tested, clear,  and easy to use. We hear from parents all the time about how difficult  the FAFSA is to complete.   It repeals unfair requirements that limit low-income students' access  to career-focused institutions.   It supports at-risk and minority students by reforming the TRIO  programs to better evaluate the effectiveness of these programs, expand  access to these programs for students, and encourage institutions to  create programs using evidence-based innovations like P4Success.   The PROSPER Act improves student aid in the following ways:  simplifying student aid into one grant program, one loan program, and  one workstudy program to ease confusion for students who are deciding  the best options available to pay for their college educations.   Let me give you an example, Mr. Speaker, of the complications of the  loan programs as they currently exist. There are six different loan  programs, nine repayment options, and 32 deferment and forbearance  options. What has that gotten us? It has gotten students $1.4 trillion  into debt. We find that unacceptable, and PROSPER will help change  that.   We give a Pell grant bonus to recipients who enroll in the number of  credits necessary to complete their education in what is considered on  time. That will vary: for students in community colleges, 2 years; and  for students in a baccalaureate program, 4 years.   We add $14.5 billion back into students' pockets by eliminating  hidden origination fees on Federal student loans that add unnecessary  costs to college.   Mr. Speaker, I talk every day to Members who have been misled by  colleges and universities in their districts about what PROSPER does.  Many well-meaning, I am sure, administrators and college presidents are  calling Members and saying: The PROSPER Act cuts financial aid for  students.   Mr. Speaker, it does nothing of the sort. Because of the way we  restructure the loan programs, however, it does save the taxpayers,  right now, based on CBO's score, $15 billion. However, it makes  available to students 12 million more dollars just in financial aid,  not to count what we are talking about in the $14.5 billion in  origination fees.   By providing access to a new ONE Loan with reasonable loan limits and  creating an easily accessible income-based repayment option, it offers  an affordable monthly payment option to all borrowers, and it caps  interest accrual. This is something else that the schools  misunderstand. We do help the students with their loan programs not  while they are in school, but when they are out of school.   Many people have misunderstood the legislation and the wording in the  PROSPER Act, so I have encouraged my colleagues to share with me the  concerns they hear from colleges and universities so we can make sure  that what they are being told are the facts and not either a  misunderstanding of the legislation, because people aren't used to  reading the legislation, or an out-and-out fabrication of what is in  the bill.   We reward the institutions in the workstudy program by helping the  most vulnerable students complete their education and expand the  ability of students to receive Federal workstudy dollars while gaining  valuable work experience in a field of their choice.   Mr. Speaker, I have been in education for a long, long time. I know  40-some years ago we had studies that showed that students who  participated in the workstudy program made better grades, made better  use of their time, graduated at a higher rate, and were much more  likely to get a job after graduation. What we do is we actually double  the amount of money in the workstudy program and allow a portion of  that money to be used by students in an industry- and institution- approved program in the private sector.   We all know that internships often turn into jobs, and we know it is  much more likely that a student would get a job in the private sector  if he or she is able to do an internship and workstudy funds can be  used to cover those internships.   Another thing that the PROSPER Act does is it reimagines how  institutions best serve students in these ways, providing students  access to new providers of postsecondary education by allowing those  providers to partner with traditional colleges and universities for up  to 100 percent of a student's educational program.   We are living in a vastly changing world with all types of  opportunities available now to students to gain an education and to  gain the skills they need. We need to stop living in the 16th century,  as much of education is doing in this country, and come up to speed  with what is available to us through technology.   We, in the PROSPER Act, encourage competency-based education by  creating a clear pathway for competency-based education programs to be  eligible for Federal student aid to help students attain a less costly  degree based on their own learning rather than time spent in a seat.   Mr. Speaker, when I taught many years ago at Appalachian State  University, at Mayland Community College, and at Caldwell Community  College, I often encouraged students to participate in activities  outside the classroom because so much impressive learning can go on  outside of sitting in a seat listening to a teacher lecturing. We need  to do more of that.    Students, again, have access to so many opportunities where they  could be deemed proficient in an area and be able to get credit for  that which would speed up their earning a degree.   We repeal the antiquated and rigid definition of distance education  making it possible for institutions to develop more creative methods of  delivering postsecondary education.   We allow, through the PROSPER Act, minority-serving institutions and  Historically Black Colleges and Universities to use grant funds for  certain initiatives such as pay for success, dual enrollment, and the  development of career-centered programs.   It is time, again, Mr. Speaker, for us to acknowledge that there are  many, many opportunities out there for students to gain the skills that  they need to be able to be certified and be able to get the credentials  that they need to lead a successful life in our country, and what we  are doing with the PROSPER Act is advancing those opportunities.   I want to quote from an article that was recently published that  encourages the passage of the PROSPER Act. The article was written by  Rachelle Peterson, who is the policy director at the National  Association of Scholars, and I am going to give a few quotes from that  article.   She says: ``It has been 53 years since President Lyndon Johnson  signed the Higher Education Act into law, and 10 years since it was  reauthorized, under President Obama. Over the years, the law--which  touches nearly every aspect of higher education--has turned into a  special interest bonanza. It shields traditional colleges from  marketplace competition, weaves a labyrinthine web of student aid  options, packs on the pork, and in the last administration served as a  pretext for the Department of Education to invent politically charged  regulations.''   I couldn't have said it better myself, Mr. Speaker.   She goes on to say: ``The PROSPER Act . . . would streamline Federal  programs, relax burdensome regulations, forbid the Secretary of  Education from acting outside the scope of the law, and protect the key  principles of free speech and religious freedom.''   Mr. Speaker, it is hard to get a package of legislation that would do  all of those things, but she goes on: ``Today,  [[Page H4772]]  my organization, the National Association of Scholars, released a top- to-bottom review of the PROSPER Act, concluding that it represents the  best opportunity to reform higher education in decades. With a few  tweaks, the PROSPER Act should be passed at once. Two especially  important areas--Federal student aid reform and protections for freedom  of speech and association--show why.''   I am very, very grateful to the National Association of Scholars and  Rachelle Peterson for her kind words about the PROSPER Act.   She goes on to say: ``Currently, Federal student aid is a complicated  system that encourages students to take on unmanageable debt and  incentivizes colleges to raise tuition.''   She mentions the different loan programs, grants, and ways to get  loans forgiven. She talks about the PROSPER Act simplifying Federal  student aid, reining in costs, and making it easier for students to see  their options.   She goes on to say: ``PROSPER also gives colleges `skin in the game'  by making them financial stakeholders in students' success. Individual  programs whose students have low loan repayment rates would become  ineligible for accepting Federal student loans, forcing these low- performing programs either to improve their quality or to lower their  costs. When students drop out, colleges would become liable to repay a  portion of the students' Federal aid, creating an incentive to adopt  high admissions standards.''   She goes on to say: `` . . . the PROSPER Act does a remarkable job of  cutting bureaucratic overgrowth to return Federal student aid to its  core purpose: helping students who are prepared for college find ways  to afford it. . . . `'                                time  2100    She goes on and on. I am not going to continue to quote from her, but  I include in the Record this material so that every person reading the  Congressional Record has an opportunity to read her excellent article.                       [From The Hill, May 23, 2018]       Congress, Pass the Prosper Act for Federal Student Aid Reform                           (By Rochelle Peterson)         It has been 53 years since President Lyndon Johnson signed       the Higher Education Act into law, and 10 years since it was       reauthorized, under President Obama. Over the years, the       law--which touches nearly every aspect of higher education--      has turned into a special interest bonanza. It shields       traditional colleges from marketplace competition, weaves a       labyrinthine web of student aid options, packs on the pork,       and in the last administration served as a pretext for the       Department of Education to invent politically charged       regulations.        The PROSPER Act, introduced in December by Rep. Virginia       Foxx (R-N.C.), would reauthorize the Higher Education Act and       clean up the mess it has become. The bill would streamline       federal programs, relax burdensome regulations, forbid the       Secretary of Education from acting outside the scope of the       law, and protect the key principles of free speech and       religious freedom.        Today, my organization, the National Association of       Scholars released a top-to-bottom review of the PROSPER Act,       concluding that it represents the best opportunity to reform       higher education in decades. With a few tweaks, the PROSPER       Act should be passed at once. Two especially important       areas--federal student aid reform and protections for freedom       of speech and association--show why.        Currently, federal student aid is a complicated system that       encourages students to take on unmanageable debt and       incentivizes colleges to raise tuition. The system has six       loan programs, numerous grants, and some four dozen options       for paying off or getting loans forgiven.        The PROSPER Act simplifies federal student aid, reining in       costs and making it easier for students to see their options.       It caps the amount of money parents and students can borrow       from the federal government. It streamlines federal student       aid into a single loan program, a single grant program, and a       single repayment program. It eliminates special interest       projects, such as public service loan forgiveness, which       privileged government employees by forgiving their loans       after 10 years of payments.        PROSPER also gives colleges ``skin in the game'' by making       them financial stakeholders in students' success. Individual       programs whose students have low loan repayment rates would       become ineligible for accepting federal student loans,       forcing these low-performing programs either to improve their       quality or to lower their costs. When students drop out,       colleges would become liable to repay a portion of the       students' federal aid, creating an incentive to adopt high       admissions standards.        The bill misses some important elements of student aid       reform, such as making income-share agreements enforceable       and requiring colleges to spend a minimum percentage of       endowment income. It also maintains the Department of       Education's monopoly on government student aid, rather than       transferring financial authority to the states.        But overall, the PROSPER Act does a remarkable job of       cutting bureaucratic overgrowth to return federal student aid       to its core purpose: helping students who are prepared for       college find ways to afford it, without driving up costs.        The PROSPER Act also takes an important stand for freedom       of speech and association, principles that colleges have       recently given scant attention. The Act prevents colleges       from discriminating against religious student groups by       denying them official recognition and other standard       benefits, such as access to campus facilities. And it       protects the rights of religious institutions to govern       themselves in a manner consistent with their religious       missions.        The PROSPER Act also addresses the need for free speech on       campus, although its policy changes, while laudable, need to       be shored up. Currently, many colleges designate ``free       speech zones'' as the only places students and faculty can       engage in public speech. In response, the PROSPER Act offers       the ``sense of Congress'' that free speech zones are       ``inherently at odds'' with the First Amendment--a principled       though legally unenforceable statement.        A key amendment by Rep. Tom Garrett (R-Va.) requires       colleges and universities to disclose any speech codes,       providing sunlight that will help watchdog organizations and       free speech litigators target bad campus policies. The       amendment also authorizes the secretary of Education to       investigate colleges that are accused of using unpublished       rules or selective enforcement to target certain types of       speech. This is important for students whose free speech has       been abridged, because they currently have little recourse       but to file a lawsuit, an expensive and time-consuming       endeavor.        These are key changes that go a long way toward restoring       freedom of speech on campus. But no bill is perfect, and the       PROSPER Act misses some opportunities. It should also       authorize the secretary of Education to investigate whether       colleges' policies are actually conducive to free speech in       the first place. Colleges should be required to report to       Congress annually on the state of free speech on their       campuses, including details on any violations of free speech,       punishment for offenders, and steps taken to protect free       speech going forward Colleges repeatedly found to be       malfeasant at protecting free speech should lose eligibility       for Title IV federal student aid.        Students deserve a college education that is rigorous,       affordable, dedicated to intellectual freedom, and focused on       scholarship, not politicization. The PROSPER Act is a step in       the right direction.     My reason for doing this is to say that it is not just  members of the committee, it is not just Members of Congress who  support the PROSPER Act. It is people who understand the situation that  exists in our country and want to see us make things better for  students.   Mr. Speaker, I grew up extraordinarily poor, but I knew that  education was my key to getting out of poverty. I had to work hard, but  I also had to get credentials. In this day and time, we know that  having credentials is more important than ever.   So I want to say again, the PROSPER Act, which stands for Promoting  Real Opportunities, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform,  is a key to doing that. This will do more to help poor students get out  of poverty than almost anything that I have seen in a long, long time.   Every Member of Congress hears every day that employers do not have  people to fill the 6 million jobs that are out there that are vacant  right now. What we do with PROSPER is make it possible for 7 million  more students to get Pell Grants. And part of our reason for doing that  is to help students get into short-term programs that will give them  skills, give them credentials, and allow them to build on those skills  over time, hopefully, to create a degree.   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, what we are doing with PROSPER is  allowing people to be able to get to participate in short-term programs  where they will gain skills that will make them employable. They will  be able to build on their credentials over time and, we hope, become  life-long learners and ultimately earn degrees.   But the main thing is, we have right now 6.6 million jobs vacant in  this country. We have employers crying for people to fill those jobs.  They cannot find those people now in this country. We have many people  who could fill the jobs if they were able to gain the skills for them.  By opening up Pell Grants to 7 million more students, we think we will  get a match.  [[Page H4773]]    It is clear right now, Mr. Speaker, that post-secondary education is  unworkable for far too many individuals trying to enter the workforce.  Americans deserve a better system that works for them.   The PROSPER Act advances bold, commonsense solutions that will  transform post-secondary education, better serve students, protect  taxpayers, and set America up for long-term economic success.   We are doing things in the bill that colleges and universities asked  us to do. We are getting the Federal Government out of the way by  repealing outdated Federal regulations and prohibiting the Secretary  from exceeding her authority under the law.   Again, the institutions have asked us for this. By doing this,  everybody wins, Mr. Speaker. The PROSPER Act simplifies and improves  Federal student aid by moving to one grant, one loan, one workstudy  system, making it easier for students to understand their options. The  bill encourages institutions to evolve, but holds them responsible by  rethinking the post-secondary education accountability system.   The bottom line is this bill is about getting people into jobs with  the skills they need to succeed. To do that, it cuts through the morass  of Federal red tape, eliminates the maze of Federal aid programs, and  unleashes innovation to a sector stuck in the 20th century--I would  argue maybe even the 19th century.   I am going to make one or two more general comments about what  PROSPER does, because I think it is so important that the American  people understand what it is we are attempting to do here.   Since 2007, Mr. Speaker, the published in-state tuition and fees at  institutions increased at an average rate of 3.2 percent beyond  inflation. If that had happened with the average automobile in this  country, the average car today would be costing $80,000, instead of  probably about $27,000. That is the inflation that has occurred in  post-secondary education.   We have a 6-year completion rate of only 54.8 percent. That is  unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. Every year that a student is forced to stay  in a college or university is costing that student $68,000 in lost  wages and tuition and fees.   The numbers go on and on. Eighty-one percent of parents say 4-year  schools charge too much. Fifty-four percent of parents think 4-year  schools are accessible to middle class Americans. In other words, many  middle class Americans have given up on the hope of their child going  on to school.   Only 13 percent of people in this country believe college graduates  are well prepared for success in the workforce. Fewer than two in five  managers believe college graduates are well-equipped for a job in their  field.   Mr. Speaker, as I said, I made my living for a long time in  education. I love education. I want everybody to get a great education.  I know that it is the ticket to success in this country. But our  current system is not working. What we do with the PROSPER Act,  Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education  Reform will give Americans a much better chance to gain the skills they  need and be successful.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 10 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, June 6, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
