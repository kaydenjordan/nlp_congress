 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the George  McGovern-Robert Dole International Food for Education and Child  Nutrition Program.   Twenty years ago, Congress established McGovern-Dole as a permanent  program under USDA in the 2002 farm bill. McGovern-Dole provides at  least one nutritious school meal to some of the world's most vulnerable  children.   It is a life-changing program that has improved the food security,  nutrition, literacy, and education of 31 million children, their  families, and communities--building goodwill toward the American people  in over 48 countries.   With the support of American farmers, ranchers, and millers,  McGovern-Dole programs are carried out by NGOs, the U.N. World Food  Programme, local partners with U.S. financial and technical assistance,  and U.S. and locally purchased food commodities.   Congressman Tracey Mann and I have introduced H. Res. 1156 to  continue the McGovern-Dole program and build upon its 20 years of  success. I invite all of my colleagues to cosponsor and support this  resolution.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 1204 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1204         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (S. 2938)       to designate the United States Courthouse and Federal       Building located at 111 North Adams Street in Tallahassee,       Florida, as the ``Joseph Woodrow Hatchett United States       Courthouse and Federal Building'', and for other purposes,       with the Senate amendments to the House amendment thereto,       and to consider in the House, without intervention of any       point of order, a single motion offered by the chair of the       Committee on the Judiciary or his designee that the House       concur in the Senate amendments to the House amendment. The       Senate amendments and the motion shall be considered as read.       The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided       and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of       the Committee on the Judiciary or their respective designees.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion or demand       for division of the question.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (S. 2089) to       amend the Families First Coronavirus Response Act to extend       child nutrition waiver authority, and for other purposes,       with the Senate amendment to the House amendment thereto, and       to consider in the House, without intervention of any point       of order, a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on       Education and Labor or his designee that the House concur in       the Senate amendment to the House amendment. The Senate       amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The       motion shall be debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Education and Labor or their respective       designees. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening       motion.        Sec. 3.  Upon adoption of this resolution, the House shall       be considered to have taken from the Speaker's table the bill       (H.R. 4346) making appropriations for Legislative Branch for       the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, and for other       purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to have       concurred in the Senate amendment with an amendment       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 117-53.        Sec. 4.  House Resolution 1132 is hereby adopted.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the  [[Page H5884]]  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, earlier today, the Rules Committee met  and reported a rule, House Resolution 1204, for two measures.   First, it provides for consideration of the Senate amendments to the  House amendment to S. 2938, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The  rule makes in order a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on  the Judiciary that the House concur in the Senate amendments. It  provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary.   Second, the rule provides for consideration of the Senate amendment  to the House amendment to S. 2089, the Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022. The  rule makes in order a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on  Education and Labor that the House concur in the Senate amendment and  provides 10 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking member of the Committee on Education and Labor.   Finally, the rule deems passage of H. Res. 1132 and deems that the  House concur in the Senate amendment to H.R. 4346 with an amendment.   Madam Speaker, let me first say that I am so disappointed with where  this school meals extension landed. We had a bipartisan, bicameral  agreement in place, a measure that, in my opinion, didn't go far  enough. But I was willing to support it because we have a hunger cliff  looming in 6 days.   It passed the House yesterday by a vote of 376-42. Then, one Senator  decided to hold up the bill, a bill to give kids free meals over the  summer and provide administrative flexibilities and extra funding to  schools in the fall. The objection? A provision that gave free meals at  school for kids at 185 percent of poverty or below. For a family of  four, that is a family with a maximum total household income of just  over $50,000 a year.   What a rotten thing to do. I can't say the words I would like to use  on the House floor to describe just how callous this is, so let me just  say this: It takes a real jerk to take food out of the mouths of kids.   I am going to support this bill. The stakes are too high for us not  to support it, and there are a lot of good provisions in here,  provisions that extend the flexibilities and provide a reimbursement  rate increase to schools to help them continue serving kids nutritious  meals and extend universal free meals over the summer.   But I am going to continue fighting like hell at every chance to make  sure that every child gets a free breakfast and lunch as part of their  school day.   Food is a right. I believe it is a fundamental human right. And for  kids living in poverty, school meals are sometimes the only nutritious  food that they have access to.   I thank my friends, Chairman Scott and Chairwoman Stabenow, for their  work in averting the hunger cliff and getting free meals to kids this  summer. I thank Speaker Pelosi for her incredible leadership. I thank  Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro for her persistence on this.   They are all dedicated to ending hunger, especially among children. I  am going to continue to work with them until we finally end hunger in  this country once and for all.   In addition, Madam Speaker, let me just say that this is a historic  moment. We are on the threshold of passing the first major overhaul of  Federal gun safety legislation in decades. This bill that we will soon  vote on will save lives, and it couldn't come at a more important time.   As the American people are demanding that we do more to prevent gun  violence, the Supreme Court is recklessly striking down gun safety laws  that have been on the books for over a century.   As the American people look to Congress to take action to prevent the  next mass shooting, House Republican leaders are caving to the gun  lobby, whipping against a bipartisan, bicameral agreement of  commonsense gun safety measures that an overwhelming majority of the  American people support.   Despite what you will hear on the floor today, the American people  get it. They know the terrible toll gun violence has taken on  communities all across this country: over 100 per day killed by guns;  more children killed with a gun in the last two decades than on-duty  police officers and Active-Duty military combined; the list of mass  shootings and tragedies grows longer and longer by the month.   Yet, if you talk to Republicans here in the House, you would think we  are living in an alternative universe. Just this week, most Republicans  voted down a bill to alert people when a mass shooting was happening  near them. Let me repeat that: Just this week, Republicans voted down a  bill to alert people when a mass shooting was happening near them.   Are you kidding me? What kind of people don't even want you to know  which way to run if there is a shooting nearby?   I am so sick and tired of the stranglehold that the gun lobby and  their blood money have on the Republican Party. Enough is enough. The  time has come for action. The time has come for us to put aside  politics and actually do the right thing.   I commend the many Republicans who have done just that. I don't think  I could agree with Senator Mitch McConnell on where to go to have  lunch, but he said that the Safer Communities Act is ``a commonsense  package of popular steps that will help make these horrifying incidents  less likely while fully upholding the Second Amendment rights of law- abiding citizens.'' That is Mitch McConnell.    Senator Lindsey Graham--and we are polar opposites--said: ``The  legislation is not perfect, but we must not let the perfect become the  enemy of the good.'' That is Lindsey Graham.   Even here in the House, some courageous Republicans have said that  they will support this bill, like Congressman Tony Gonzales, who said:  ``It is my duty to pass laws that never infringe on the Constitution  while protecting the lives of the innocent.''   The U.S. Senate is notorious for not being able to build consensus  around solutions to fix the most straightforward of problems, yet here  they have come up with a reasonable, bipartisan deal on a contentious  issue.   I think it is shameful, quite frankly, that GOP Leader McCarthy and  his team are parroting the gun lobby's talking points. But what I find  even more disappointing, frankly, are the crocodile tears about  bipartisanship from the GOP when they vote time and time again against  substantial bipartisan deals like this one.   Please spare us the lectures. Nothing in this bill is new. Nothing in  this bill is controversial. These ideas have been around for decades,  and they are what the American people want.   If people are worried about backlash back home, this is an  opportunity for you to correct the record. Go home and tell the truth  that this bill does nothing to infringe on the Second Amendment, and it  doesn't punish law-abiding gun owners.                                time  0930    This country is crying out for action. Americans are begging us to  work together to protect our kids and our communities.   I know I am asking you to vote against your party's leadership. I  know that is a tough spot to put some of my Republican friends in. But  I think at the end of the day, you owe it to yourself to consider this  one idea: What if this bill stops even one mass shooting from  happening? Is a ``no'' vote worth the lives of your constituents?   Don't listen to those who are spreading crazy conspiracy theories,  saying that this is going to lead to everyone's guns getting taken  away. We hear it over and over and over again. Listen to your GOP  colleagues who helped write this bill and who passed it over in the  Senate. Listen to the American people who overwhelmingly support this  bill, and then listen to your conscience.  [[Page H5885]]    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, let me just say that it is a little frustrating to  kind of hear my colleagues imply that somehow we are moving too fast,  after decades of inaction, of doing absolutely nothing, after massacre  after massacre after massacre, doing nothing. Now we are being accused  of moving too fast.   Want to talk about the process? We have had countless hearings on gun  violence and on measures to combat gun violence in a variety of  committees here. We had a committee hold a hearing with a young girl  from Uvalde who told Members of Congress that she had to cover herself  with the blood of her dead classmate and pretend that she was dead in  order to escape being killed herself.   We have heard from law enforcement officials. We have heard from  grieving parents. Nothing in this bill is controversial. People have  seen--the text of this bill has been available since Tuesday. It is not  that complicated.   So when people say: Process, oh, we just need more time, and we  should do more hearings, and we should do this and we should do that-- no. I mean, this is put up or shut up time for all of us. This is an  opportunity that we cannot miss.   So the choice for Members on both sides is simple. I mean, we are  either going to do something--again, this is way more modest than  anything that I would suggest that we do. But we are either going to do  something, or we are going to do the same old same old, nothing.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just say a couple of words in response to the gentleman from  North Carolina.   He just said that Democrats and Republicans should come together.  Well, they did. I mean, Mitch McConnell is a Republican. Lindsey Graham  is Republican. Tony Gonzalez is a Republican. I mean, Republicans and  Democrats have come together like they never have before on this issue.  Maybe my Republican friends ought to get together with their Republican  friends to try to work it out on their side. But Democrats and  Republicans have come together.   I am having trouble following the gentleman's logic when he basically  implies that if we can't do something to stop all shootings, then maybe  it is not worth doing anything. Nobody is saying that what we are doing  today will prevent every shooting. What we are saying today is that it  will prevent some. What we are saying today is it will protect lives.   In the aftermath of Uvalde and Buffalo, people all across this  country, regardless of their politics, were so horrified. They are  demanding that we act. Again, as I said at the outset, I would have  preferred that we do more. I understand that we can only get done what  we can get done in the reality in which we are living here in the  Congress; and in the Senate you need 10 Republicans to get permission  to have a cup of coffee. The fact of the matter is, there is a process  over there that has prevented even a debate on gun safety legislation  because of the filibuster. But a number of Republican Senators came  together because they listened to their constituents, and I think they  finally said we have to do something.    No one is saying this will stop every shooting, but under that logic,  why do we have fire departments?   We have fire departments but there are still fires.   Why do we have seatbelt laws?   There are seatbelt laws and there are still people that get killed in  car crash fatalities.   I mean, the bottom line is, we have them because they save some  lives, and it is worth it. As I said at the outset, for every item in  this bipartisan package there has been a hearing on at some point. None  of these ideas are new. So there has been a process.   But what I find particularly ironic is that as we are being lectured  about, oh, we need more time, we need more hearings, the gentlewoman  says that we should bring up the gentleman's bill and consider it  immediately with no hearings, with no process. I mean, I get whiplash  just trying to follow the logic of my friends from the other side.   Madam Speaker, the bottom line is either we are going to do  something, or we are not. And those who are arguing for delaying this  more and more and more are the same people who will never vote for it.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I just want to take a moment to  recognize and thank a longtime Rules staffer who will be leaving us  next week for the Department of Commerce as their director of  legislative affairs.   Rose Laughlin, who is next to me, has been with the Rules Committee  for 8 years, starting as an intern with the late Congresswoman, Chair  Louise Slaughter. Rose was Ms. Slaughter's right-hand woman.   Rose, I know that Louise was terribly proud of all of your  accomplishments and your dedication to the people of this country.   Madam Speaker, I think it is fitting today that Rose is here because  this will be her last rule on the House floor. It is fitting that she  is here because this is a historic bipartisan measure on gun reform  that will actually make it to the President's desk. No one on this  committee has worked harder or more thoughtfully over the years for gun  reform than Rose.   Her dependable, resourceful, collaborative attitude has made this  work easier for us all. This institution, and those we serve, are  better off because of her dedication to public service.   Rose, you always will have a home here at the Capitol. We are going  to miss you, but we are excited about continuing to work with you in  your new role, and we are very proud of you.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and  Republicans, to vote for this bipartisan bill. It is not that long, and  people have had it since Tuesday. It has been posted since Tuesday.   As I said, it is not everything that I think needs to be done.  Certainly, it is not everything that we have passed in this House, but  it is a start. If we pass this and send it to the President for his  signature, and it becomes law, it will save lives. It is what the  American people want.   Madam Speaker, I have talked to so many families who have lost loved  ones to gun violence. I have watched the hearings in which grieving  parents and brothers and sisters have talked about how horrific it was  to lose a loved one to gun violence, begging us to do something so that  no other family has to go through that.   For years, all of those pleas have fallen on deaf ears. When we have  even tried to get anything done here, modest legislation, we send it  over to the Senate and couldn't get the 60 votes to even have a  discussion on the Senate floor. That just changed.   It changed, I think, because people are so horrified about what just  recently happened, but also what has been happening time and time again  in this country.   I know the question for everybody here is not about: Does this  violate the Second Amendment, or is this taking away guns from lawful  gun owners? It is not. That is all garbage. It really is. That is not  what this is about.   I get it. The gun lobby is making phone calls and threatening to hold  back checks if people somehow don't frustrate this bill so that it  can't get to the President's desk.   We were elected to help people and to protect people. In the Senate,  we have this remarkable bipartisan collaboration, and in the House, we  have Republicans who have supported sensible gun safety legislation.   Madam Speaker, I hope this is an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote in  the House. I know that it may not be because the leadership here has  urged Republican Members to oppose this. I regret that very much.   When people say that this is somehow a leftwing bill--I mean, Mitch  McConnell, Lindsey Graham? Give me a break. This is a truly bipartisan  bill. It is a compromise.   To suggest that we need more hearings on a bill on a compromise that  every single topic in this compromise has had hearings on before, to  suggest to do that by people who don't want this to move to begin with,  come on.   This is the put-up-or-shut-up moment for people here. We either do  something, or we are going to do nothing. We have been doing nothing  for years.   I urged in my opening that people think long and hard before they  vote. Consult your conscience.   I can't go back and talk to parents who lost loved ones to violence  and say: ``Oh, we tried, but it wasn't perfect.'' I could easily go  back and say: ``I wish it were bigger and more. It is not perfect, so I  am not going to support it.'' I am supporting this because it is  something, and it is going to save lives.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to please support this. I  urge a ``yes'' on the rule and a ``yes'' on the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1204    Strike the first section after the resolving clause and insert the  following:         That immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 7966) to provide for increased authorization of       funding to secure schools, and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  [[Page H5890]]       the Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit. Clause 1(c) of       rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 7966.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time and  move the previous question on the resolution.
