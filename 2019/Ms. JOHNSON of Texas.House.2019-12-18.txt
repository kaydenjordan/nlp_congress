 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res.  755, a resolution Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United  States, for high crimes and misdemeanors. Today is indeed a solemn day  for the United States of America.   The two Articles of Impeachment, as written and passed by the House  Judiciary Committee, outline the findings of the investigations done by  several committees of jurisdiction, charged with the constitutionally- mandated task of finding out the truth.   The truth is the President abused his power of office by obstructing  the impeachment inquiry; solicited the interference of the Ukraine  Government in the 2020 U.S. presidential election in an attempt to  undermine our elections; and posed a threat to national security for  political gain.   Madam Speaker, I have listened to and spoken with my constituents in  my district and throughout the state of Texas. The corrupt pattern of  evidence is overwhelming. Therefore, I am voting in favor of H. Res.  755, a resolution Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United  States, for high crimes and misdemeanors.
