 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, following the invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Iraqi  leader Saddam Hussein, the United States and the international  community demanded the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces under the  threat of military action. After Saddam Hussein defied calls to  withdraw from Kuwait, the United States, along with a broad coalition  of European, regional, and global allies, began Operation Desert  Shield, followed by Operation Desert Storm, a 100-hour land war which  expelled the Iraqi forces from Kuwait.   Approximately 700,000 members of the American Armed Forces served as  part of Operation Desert Storm and Operation Desert Shield. Of those,  293 died in theater and 148 were killed in action.   The 2015 National Defense Authorization Act authorized the National  Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial Association to establish a  memorial as a commemorative work on Federal land in the District of  Columbia. This honors the members of the American Armed Forces who  served and those who made the ultimate sacrifice in support of our  country.   The joint resolution before us today approves the general location of  the memorial so that it is in close proximity to the National Mall and  other nationally significant war memorials, as determined by the  Secretary of the Interior.   This resolution is an opportunity for the country to come together  and thank the servicemembers who fought in the Gulf, those whose lives  have been forever changed by their experience in this war, and those  who did not return.   I support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), the author of this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the joint resolution, H.J. Res. 3.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the joint resolution was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
