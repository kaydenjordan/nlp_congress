 Mr. Speaker, 1 week ago today, Speaker Pelosi made  history. For the first time in more than 230 years of the United States  House of Representatives, the Speaker of the House rejected the  minority party's picks for a select committee.   This House has seen partisan fights. This House has seen turmoil.  This House has seen deep division. But never in the history of its  existence has it seen a Speaker reject the minority's picks for a  select committee until Speaker Pelosi.   Her historic move cemented the January 6th Select Committee as  completely partisan from top to bottom. Every committee member was  handpicked by Speaker Pelosi for a specific purpose. And we know what  that purpose is: to push her narrative and her agenda.   Despite Speaker Pelosi's attempts to obstruct the truth, Republicans  will continue our own investigation and follow the facts where they  take us because we owe it to the American people to ensure this never  happens again.                            ____________________
