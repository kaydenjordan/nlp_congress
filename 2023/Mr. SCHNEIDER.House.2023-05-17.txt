 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my dear friend,  Beverly Sussman, who this week retired after serving 8 years as Buffalo  Grove Village president.   A dedicated civil servant, Beverly has devoted her energies to the  village for more than 30 years.   Focusing on revitalizing Buffalo Grove, Beverly has led on  infrastructure redevelopment and attracted significant investment in  development projects across the village that will benefit residents for  many, many years.   Significantly, she led with a focus on fiscal responsibility, all to  the benefit of Buffalo Grove residents who have not had a tax increase  over the past 4 years.   Beverly has also focused on creating a welcoming community built on  civic engagement and youth development. Of course, that is not  surprising since at her core Beverly is still the teacher she was at  the beginning of her career.   Throughout it all, Beverly has been supported by Martin, her beloved  husband of 62 years. Their greatest achievement has been their three  sons and eight grandchildren.   It is my great honor to thank Beverly for all she has done and to  wish her and Marty health and happiness in whatever their next chapter  may bring on their journey together.                            ____________________
