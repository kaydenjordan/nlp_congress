 Thank you, Mr. President.   It is great to have our colleague from Georgia on the floor of the  Senate once again, doing the outstanding job that he has always done  for the people of Georgia, recognizing the great individuals back home  who make Georgia such a great State, and we are just blessed to have  him here. I thank him for his continued service for the people of  Georgia and the people of this country.  [[Page S3000]]
