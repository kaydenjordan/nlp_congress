 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California  for her years of service, appointed service, recognized service, for we  have gone to the southern border many times.   I am a resident of the southern border. I am committed to the people  of the southern border, as I am to the people of the United States, and  most importantly, to the heroic workers who work for the Federal  Government.   First, let me say that any regular order of business of this House  should be the opening of the government and paying the workers now.   I have been alongside of every aspect of the southern border, every  State, including California, New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. I have  been to every part of the southern border. I have seen the terrain. I  have gone up to the Rio Grande and on the Rio Grande several times. I  have seen it at its fullest and I have seen it at its most narrow.   I have seen tunnels. I have seen the San Diego wall, if you will. I  have seen the steel fencing. I have spoken to Border Patrol agents  alongside of the border.   The tragedy of young Felipe, who passed away; I went to the part  where he walked up with his father and they presented themselves to the  Border Patrol.   My colleagues, including the gentle chairwoman, have likewise, walked  with me or been to the border many times. They have solutions. So  regular order now seems to be a straw man. We are placing on the floor  of the House a bill that will open the government until February 28,  but it will fund the Department of Homeland Security. May I say those  words again? Homeland Security.   We are sitting here today, and we are not considering that our  Homeland Security Department, one of the largest--I believe second to  Department of Defense, rightly so, because it is homeland security-- which I have had the privilege of serving since the heinous terrorist  act of 9/11. I have never given up this committee because it is close  to my heart. It means the protection of the American people day by day  that they look to now. Post-9/11, we have a Homeland Security  Department.                                time  0945    All of the leaders of that department whom I have worked with, most  recently Secretary Kelly, formerly the chief of staff of this White  House, and Jeh Johnson, have said in a letter: Open the government.    Mr. Speaker, you will begin to see the unraveling.  It is unraveling.   TSA officers make $28,000. Every one of you are going to see them  going out and coming back in. You are counting on air traffic  controllers to keep the planes aloft. You are counting on pilots and  flight attendants to be there pursuant to the aviation system.   I have been hearing pilots and airlines talking about putting pilots  on layoff, if you will, because they are frightened about the planes,  and they may have to shut down some of the routes.   This is a ripple effect. The Smithsonian system is crumbling, $4  million. They cannot afford one more day.   But I want to get back to our TSOs and all of those line officers,  the DEAs, the ATFs, the FBIs under the DOJ are not funded even though  essential and working. So why not take this bill that covers Secret  Service?   I hope the President's acquiescence and calm tweet announcement  acknowledging that there cannot be a State of the Union when the  government is in collapse and there is no state of a Union and that we  will not have one, sadly, because we do work together, I am saying to  my good friends: Pass the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I say to my good friends on this side of the aisle,  Republicans: You are going to vote ``no'' on a homeland security bill  on the pretense of regular business, the lives of TSOs. One young TSO  had to send her newborn baby to her mother because she could not afford  to take care of that child. They don't have gas money. They are not  allowed to take enormous gifts.   Every time I travel, there they are, the frontline people of this  government in the system that is most attractive to terrorists:  airplanes. They have never moved away from that.   So I am asking my colleagues to realize the importance of this bill  that will fund reopening the government, the Department of Homeland  Security, allowing these employees to be paid and begin us on the  process of opening government and paying our workers.   God help us.    Madam Speaker, let them eat cake--Marie Antoinette.   The Secretary of Commerce has indicated that my $28,000-paid TSA  agent can walk into the Nation's banks and demand a loan. Well, right  now, in my district, the city and other good neighbors are opening  their doors to give free groceries to those TSOs and other wonderful  Federal workers. I don't know what bank they can go into.   I can tell you that Edith, who just returned from deployment in the  Middle East, is suffering. She hasn't worked for 25 days. To make  matters worse, she has to take temporary work in order to help pay for  her children. She now is selling personal possessions to make a  difference.   Sandra, who recently came to Houston to work at NASA, came to start  on January 7 from Nebraska. She hasn't been able to work; she doesn't  have a job; and she doesn't have any money.   Or what about Linda, who has been working and now has to work extra  shifts to help pay for her children? She, too, is selling her items for  rent, groceries, everything that is needed.   Let them eat cake. That is what is being said by this administration.   Open the government. Pay our workers now.   Mr. Republican, join us in the 11 times that we have voted to open  the government now.   Madam Speaker, today I rise to join my colleagues in condemning the  President's decision to shut down the federal government, furloughing  800,000 civil servants and forcing nearly half that many to work  without pay, and which is costing the economy more than $1 billion each  day in lost productive and economic output.   As the Trump Shutdown enters its thirty-fourth day, the effects of  President Trump and Republicans' reckless decision to shutter the  government over a wasteful and unnecessary border wall are obvious.   A continuing resolution could be passed that would provide funding  for the federal government through February 28, 2019 but it has not  been done.   Frontline federal employees, including law enforcement and public  safety personnel, have been working without pay since December 22. So  many people have risked their lives in order to serve this country and  the way they have been treated   This includes around 14,000 FBI agents, 54,000 Customs and Border  Protection agents, 47,000 Transportation Security Officers, and 6,000  Forest Service firefighters.   TSA employees received their last paycheck on December 28, this  single paycheck will now have to stretch much further than they  initially anticipated.   The shutdown has already forced some employees to look for new jobs  or take on extra work, and the pressure is immense for employees and  families with no other source of income.   Among those not receiving a pay check for their work are 3,200 Secret  Service agents who risk their lives every single day to protect  President Trump and his family.   Speaker Pelosi's decision to delay the State of the Union is in  defense of the Secret Service agents who would be forced to work  without pay.   In addition to the federal employees working without pay, hardworking  federal employees at agencies like the Department of Justice, the  Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Agriculture, and  NASA have been furloughed without pay, plunging them and their families  into uncertainty.   These are real American families that are being put through an  unwarranted and unnecessary shutdown, and they are suffering because of  it.   With many federal employees being furloughed, and those deemed  essential being expected to work without pay American families are now  stuck wondering how they are going to get by without an income,  especially since things like rent, groceries, children's prescriptions  and general day-to-day living costs must still be paid whether the  government is fully functional or not.   The Trump Shutdown will end when the President comes to his senses.   The Republican members of the House and the Republican controlled  Senate can send a message to the President to end the shutdown by  voting a veto proof margin in favor of a short term continuing  resolution.   Not only are Americans struggling to pay for their day-to-day  expenses but veterans and military families are suffering as well.   The shutdown has lasted long enough that the Department of Veterans  Affairs has said that it may not have enough money to pay disability  claims and pension payments.   This could affect approximately 3.6 million veterans.   The military is also suffering in other areas.   For example, changes of station for military personnel will be  delayed and facility and weapons maintenance could be suspended.   Military commissaries (base grocery stores) have shut down and  military families are being forced to shop elsewhere, costing up to 30  percent more on average than at the commissaries.   The United States Coast Guard is still without funding.   This is an added expense that adds up quickly, especially for  military families living in cities with a high cost of living.   Edith Banda who recently returned from a reservist deployment in the  Middle East is  [[Page H1192]]  among thousands of people in the Houston area feeling the impact of the  government shutdown.   Edith has not worked her federal job in downtown Houston since the  shutdown 25 days ago.   Making matters worse, she and dozens of others in Houston are unable  to seek temporary private sector work because such jobs require  permission, and the people who process those requests have been  furloughed.   Edith has begun selling her personal possessions to make ends meet,  but she said another couple of weeks of no work would be crushing.   There are so many other issues that we could tackle with the money  Trump wants to spend on the wall.   With an increase of $265 million the Department of Justice could hire  2,000 new police officers and make steps towards making many  communities a safer place.   With an increase of $99 million the Office of National Drug Control  Policy could support community-level efforts to address substance abuse  programs in nearly 730 additional communities.   With an increase of $200 million the Economic Development  Administration could create or preserve 31,000 jobs for our hardworking  Americans.   With an additional $20 million Small Business Administration grants  could support dozens more Women's Business and Veterans Outreach  Centers providing business training, counseling and outreach to 47,000  additional U.S. veterans and women   These are the changes that American citizens deserve.   Madam Speaker, it is critical that the President ends this government  shutdown and end the unwarranted suffering of American families across  the nation.                            ____________________
