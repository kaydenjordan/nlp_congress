 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4468, the  Choice in Automobile Retail Sales Act. I support EVs, but this  administration continues to push a rush-to-green agenda that  prioritizes government mandates over the American people.   The American people have spoken through their shopping habits. EVs  sit unsold on lots nearly twice as long as internal combustion engine  vehicles due to a lack of charging infrastructure and high costs. On  average, EVs cost $16,000 more than internal combustion engine  vehicles.   We all want to reduce emissions, but EVs are not the solution that  the administration says they are. The amount of raw materials in one  long-range battery EV could instead be used to make 90 hybrid electric  vehicles. The overall carbon reduction of those 90 hybrids over their  lifetimes is 37 times as much as a single battery EV.   Where are the raw materials developed?   Mostly in China.   Should we be dependent on them?   Preserving consumer choice is critical to maintaining competition in  the automotive markets and ensuring access to reliable and affordable  cars for all Americans.   You cannot force Americans to buy cars they do not want any more than  you can force energy transitions that can't be accomplished.
