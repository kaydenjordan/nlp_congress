 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the flooding back  in my home State of Arkansas and the need for prioritized spending and  more Federal investment in waterway infrastructure.   While national media attention is largely focused elsewhere, the  Arkansas River has swollen to historic levels, flooding homes and  businesses, breaching levees, and devastating farmland.   President Trump issued an emergency declaration last week allowing  FEMA to provide immediate relief to 16 counties most severely affected.  This Federal aid is extremely valuable as communities work tirelessly  to save businesses and homes.   Arkansas is not alone in experiencing flooding. Our neighbors in  Oklahoma, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Missouri, as well as South  Dakota, Iowa, and Kansas have all been affected by flooding this year.   These disasters beg the question: What can Congress do to prevent  future flooding?   More specifically, how can we improve infrastructure within our  States to reduce the risk of dam and levee breaches?   As ranking member on the Transportation and Infrastructure's  Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, I hope to add insight  into that very question.   Waterways tend to be out of sight and out of mind, but widespread  flooding has made navigable rivers impossible to ignore. In Arkansas  alone we have seen an estimated $23 million in daily economic loss  along the Arkansas River. When barges and boats can no longer navigate  inland waterways, the entire State and surrounding areas suffer.   Much of the infrastructure along these rivers was initially installed  in the 1960s and 1970s and is now reaching the end of its shelf life. A  backlog of maintenance projects compounds the issues, and we can't just  keep putting temporary patches on systemic problems.   For example, I recently cosponsored bipartisan legislation that would  unlock billions of dollars in already collected fees to maintain our  Nation's Federal ports and harbors. In many cases, we have the money  for infrastructure projects, however, red tape and bureaucracy slow  down the process and prevent necessary work from occurring.   The irony of delaying projects on our navigable waterways is that  these projects often have tremendous economic returns--as high as 10 to  1 and 16 to 1. It makes economic sense and it is common sense to invest  in waterways and infrastructure.   Unprecedented flooding such as we are observing should serve as a  chance for us to reexamine infrastructure to ensure it is updated and  capable of protecting life and property.   No doubt, as flood waters recede in the coming days, Congress'  attention will turn elsewhere. But I urge my colleagues in both the  House and the Senate to come together, address long-term projects that  have been on the back burner for years, and keep WRDA on its 2-year  schedule.   We can't control the weather, but we can and should do better than  accepting as the norm to have outdated and failing infrastructure,  flooded homes, and washed out farmlands. The American people deserve  better than this.   Before I close, I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge and thank  the countless first responders and volunteers who have worked around  the clock to fill sandbags, move livestock to higher ground, transport  possessions from homes at risk of flooding, and rescue people trapped  in moving floodwaters.   Governor Hutchinson, the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management,  the Arkansas National Guard, the Corps of Engineers, and many other  State and local officials have led an efficient and organized response,  and their swift action has certainly saved lives and property.   Arkansas doesn't back down when challenged, and we persevere through  the storms of life. I have heard so many stories of Arkansans rallying  around one another in their time of need, and this gives me hope for  the days ahead.                            ____________________
