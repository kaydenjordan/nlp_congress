 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Wyoming.    Mr. President, the Senate Finance Committee is working  this week on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It is a very important piece of  legislation that the country is looking forward to having passed.   This is a Republican plan to give tax relief to the American people.  Just as the name of the legislation says, it actually addresses both  issues: tax cuts and jobs.   First of all, the legislation will cut the taxes for American  workers. One of the biggest cuts in the plan is that it roughly doubles  the standard deduction that people take. Right now, the standard  deduction for a married couple is about $12,000. If we double it,  people will not pay any Federal income taxes at all on the first  $24,000 they earn. That is a big tax cut. It is aimed squarely at lower  income and middle-income families in this country.   A lot of people will decide to take this deduction instead of going  through the painstaking process of itemizing deductions on their income  tax returns. It saves people a lot of time. It also saves them the cost  of accountants and lawyers who help them figure out the complicated  taxes that they end up paying in this country each year.   Republicans are also working to preserve other deductions that are  important to American families. When we put all of these together, we  are going to cut taxes for people and put money back in their pockets  instead of sending it to Washington.   The second thing to know about this tax relief legislation is that it  is going to be a big boost for jobs in America. In fact, it will help  America create more than 900,000 new jobs.   It is also going to lead to higher pay. That is because the  legislation will cut the taxes that small businesses have to pay. Small  businesses create most of the jobs in America. If we let them keep more  of their money, they can hire people and grow their businesses. That is  what happens in this country. That is how our economy works; people  hiring people matter to grow the economy. They can also give workers a  raise and offer better benefits. When Washington takes less and  businesses keep more, workers are better off every time.   Republicans also want to bring down the rates that Washington charges  other businesses. A lot of people work for small businesses, but a lot  of people also work for large businesses as well. If we are able to cut  taxes for those businesses, then those workers can get the same raise.  How much more money are we talking about? Well, according to the Tax  Foundation, it amounts to about $2,600 for a typical middle-income  family. That is what you get when you combine the tax cut and the pay  raise that people will see across the country. For that family, an  extra $2,600 is going to be a very big deal. A majority of Americans  say that they don't have enough savings today to cover a $500 emergency  expense if one came up.   Millions of American families will be far better off because of the  tax relief that Republicans are working on this week. It will boost the  economy, help individual workers, and help their families. This is  about tax cuts, and it is about jobs. That is how you keep the economy  growing. That is how we keep American families thriving.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
