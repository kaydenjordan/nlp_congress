 Mr. President, they say that baseball is the great  American sport, and I am a fan. I love watching baseball games,  especially the Cubs and the Cards and the White Sox in the region where  I grew up. But possibly one of the greatest moments remembered in  baseball actually didn't occur during a game; it occurred in 1939 when  a baseball player by the name of Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees  gave a famous farewell speech at Yankee Stadium.   Gehrig was an amazing baseball player. Naturally, he is in the  Baseball Hall of Fame. He was indestructible. His nickname was the  ``Iron Horse''--so durable, so dependable. He was always there.   In April of that year, 1939, he had removed himself from the game,  saying he couldn't play any longer. Then, just a few weeks later, he  made his famous farewell speech at Yankee Stadium. He was sick and  suffering from a rare disease, known as ALS, but he stood up there in  front of that microphone. We can still remember it in our mind's eye-- that black and white film--when he announced he was the luckiest man on  Earth. He died 2 years later from ALS.   The disease, because of his prominence and the public sentiment and  profile, became known forever as Lou Gehrig's disease. It is still with  us. It still is as virulent and deadly as it was in his time.   I have come to know a number of people who have suffered from that  disease.   Recently, just a few months ago, my dear friend Gary LaPaille, who  was the State chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party when I ran for  the U.S. Senate and who was a strong supporter, passed away from ALS.   A great friend of mine, Bill Brandt, who lives in the suburbs of  Chicago, is now battling it.   This morning, I had a visit in my office from Brian Wallach. Brian  Wallach and his wife Sandra have been dealing with the diagnosis of  more than 6 years ago, of ALS. Brian is still with us, thank goodness,  because of his determination and the determination of his family.   Brian is an unusual and extraordinary person. He was working in the  Obama White House with Sandra when they decided to marry. He is an  exceptional, talented individual, as is his wife Sandra, who served as  my communications director for many years.   When the diagnosis was handed down, it was a few days before they  brought home their baby from the hospital--a little girl--6 years ago,  but they were determined that Brian was going to see as much of her  life as possible even though he had been diagnosed with ALS. So they  created an organization known as I AM ALS and set out with an agenda to  beat the disease.   Brian has been an amazing fighter in dealing with that disease and in  trying to find ways to cure himself but, basically, to cure others who  might be diagnosed in the years to come. Their focus is on many  different areas, but primarily it is on medical research. What they  have achieved when it comes to medical research--just the two of them  with their organization and many supporters across the United States-- is nothing short of remarkable. For example, after a 5-year period in  which no new ALS drugs were approved, the FDA approved two new drugs  over the past year, and there is another one that I understand was  announced just a few days ago. They were pushing for research to find  ways to treat ALS successfully.   The reason I tell that story--and the fact that Brian was just in my  office is fresh in my mind--is I hear the debate on the floor of the  U.S. Senate about  [[Page S1580]]  our Federal budget. Part of our Federal budget--an important part of  our Federal budget--is the budget for the National Institutes of  Health. This is the premier medical research Agency in the world--in  the world. I am proud of the fact that it is in the United States and  that every day it is responsible for dramatic breakthroughs against  diseases and illnesses all across the spectrum and all across the  United States and benefits to the world. Their discovery of new drugs  for ALS is just one indication of the good work that they do.    For instance, Collins was the head of the NIH for many years under  Presidents of both political parties. He is so good--and I am glad he  is still working with the Biden administration--he is so good that  Presidents--conservative, moderate, liberal; all of them--wanted  Francis Collins to head up the National Institutes of Health, which he  did remarkably. He was part of the team that discovered the human  genome, which literally changed overnight the way we approach medicine  in the United States and around the world.   I met with Dr. Collins a few years back and said: I would like to  help you at the NIH. I think your work is one of the most important  assignments in the Federal Government. What can I do?   He said: Senator, if you could give me 5 percent real growth in NIH  budgeting each year, my researchers will continue their inspiring work  to find cures and find new drugs that will make a difference in the  lives of millions of people.   I set out to do that with the cooperation and help of Roy Blunt, a  Republican; with Lamar Alexander, a Republican; and with Patty Murray,  who has just been our North Star when it comes to medical research.   We said: Let's try to achieve the goal of 5 percent real growth each  year with the National Institutes of Health. We were lucky in the last  10 years to do it six or seven times. The question is, Will we be able  to do it in next year's budget?   Sadly, the budget proposed by the Republicans in the House of  Representatives devastates the National Institutes of Health's budget-- at least a 20- to 25-percent cut in the amount of money on medical  research. What impact does that have? Well, I can tell you it has a  direct impact on lessening the number of grants that are awarded each  year for medical research, but, secondarily, it sends a message to the  researchers who are working so hard across the United States that they  can't depend on us in Congress to fund their needed research in the  years to come. That will discourage some, and some will walk away from  a lot of research that could be very promising. And to do that in the  name of helping America is just plain foolish. In fact, it is  offensive.   I would like to say to Speaker McCarthy and those who are endorsing  his budget: Stop for a minute and consider the impact of what you are  doing. There are people and families all across America who are  counting on medical research for someone they love, and that research  is coming through in remarkable ways, unprecedented around the world.   To think that we would cut the medical research budget of the United  States by 25 percent and to argue that that is in the best interest of  our country is madness, and it is political selfishness.   I would just plead with my friends on the other side of the aisle: At  the end of this debate on the budget, don't let medical research be one  of the casualties.   There are so many important areas I can add to that list of things  that are critical for the future of America, but I wanted to speak to  medical research this morning because Brian Wallach was a visitor in my  office, and he reminded me that the determination of Brian and his wife  Sandra and many people just like them to push for medical research is  literally making a difference so that Lou Gehrig's disease will one day  be a disease of the past that we will have conquered.
