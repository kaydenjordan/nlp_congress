 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a dedicated  law enforcement officer from Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional  District.   Northern Lancaster County Regional Chief of Police David Steffen was  recently selected to serve as the president of the Pennsylvania Chiefs  of Police Association, which represents over 1,200 commanding level  officers across local, State, and Federal law enforcement entities in  Pennsylvania.   Chief Steffen has spent his 40-plus-year career in law enforcement,  having served in Jackson Township, Hampden Township, and then the  Northern York County Regional Police Department, before being named the  first chief of Northern Lancaster County Regional Police Department in  2011.   As chief of the department, Steffen leads over 30 full-time sworn  officers and three civil staff, covering approximately 100 square miles  in north central Lancaster County.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Chief Steffen for supporting his  fellow law enforcement officers, for achieving this recognition, and  congratulate him on his new and well-deserved role.   To Chief Steffen and law enforcement officers across Pennsylvania's  11th District and across the country, thank you for your dedicated  service and your efforts to keep our community safe.                  Honoring Elizabethtown Mayor Chuck Mummert     Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my congratulations  to Mayor Chuck Mummert of Elizabethtown Borough in Lancaster County.   Mayor Mummert was recently named Mayor of the Year by the  Associations of Mayors of Boroughs of Pennsylvania. Mayor Mummert has  served the residents of Elizabethtown since 2006, in his first 4 years  as a member of borough council there, and then since 2010 as mayor.   In addition to this honor, Mayor Mummert, in 2018, received the  Governor's Award for Local Government Excellence, and he previously  served as president of the Pennsylvania State Association of Boroughs.   Mayor Mummert is known as the singing mayor, as he is frequently  called upon to lend his talented voice in singing the national anthem  at events; something that I have certainly always enjoyed.   So I want to congratulate Mayor Mummert on being named Mayor of the  Year, and to thank him for all of his work in continuing to make  Elizabethtown Borough an exceptional place to live, work, and raise a  family.                            ____________________
