 Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION          Iraq--Bell Helicopter Contracted Logistics Support (CLS)         The Government of Iraq has requested to buy additional       services, as indicated below, that will be added to a       previously implemented case whose value was under the       congressional notification threshold. The original FMS case,       valued at $28 million, included a Bell Contracted Logistics       Support (CLS) and Field Service Representative (FSR)       contract. This notification is for the combined CLS and FSR       maintenance support for the following Bell aircraft: three       (3) 407 variants, 206B3, OH-58A/C Kiowa, Huey II and 505.       Also included is U.S. Government and Contractor engineering,       technical and logistics support services; studies and       surveys; and other related elements of logistics and program       support. The estimated total cost is $300 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a strategic partner.        The proposed sale will improve the Republic of Iraq's       capability to meet current and future threats by enhancing       the strength of its homeland defense. The Republic of Iraq       will have ho difficulty absorbing these services into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Bell Helicopter Company,       Fort Worth, TX. There are no known offset agreements proposed       in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of four (4) additional U.S. Government or       contractor representatives to Iraq for a duration of one (1)       year to support CLS for Bell 505 aircraft. There are       currently seven (7) U.S. Government or contractor       representatives in Iraq that will stay an additional two (2)       years to provide support for the contract option years for       CLS and FSR service support for the three (3) 407 variants,       206B3, OH-58A/C and Huey II aircraft.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________
