 Mr. Speaker, as our Nation celebrates National  Catholic Schools Week, I rise to recognize the lasting contributions of  Catholic education in my south Florida community.   Carrollton School of the Sacred Heart, Our Lady of Lourdes Academy,  and Immaculata-LaSalle High School are just a few of the many Catholic  institutions serving my district. These schools do more than just  provide their students with an excellent education, Mr. Speaker. Each  one of them is also dedicated to instilling a religious grounding and  moral values in our students so that they can dedicate their lives to  serve our God, their families, and our community.   Congratulations to the teachers, administrators, and staff at our  fantastic Catholic schools. Thank you for your dedication to building a  brighter future for all of south Florida.
