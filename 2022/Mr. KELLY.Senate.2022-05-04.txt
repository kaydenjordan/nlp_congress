 Mr. President, I call up my motion to instruct, which is  at the desk.    Mr. President, microchips are in everything from household  vacuums to the most advanced fighter jets. A resilient domestic  microchip supply chain is important to our national security and to our  economy, but we have two problems. We are facing a shortage of  microchips, and we do not have the capacity to produce enough of them  here in the United States. That is why we have worked together,  Republicans and Democrats, to pass a plan in the Senate competitiveness  bill that will boost American microchip manufacturing capacity, create  thousands of jobs, and help lower costs for families.   I ask my colleagues to support this motion to show the continued  bipartisan momentum behind our plan so we can get this across the  finish line.   I am OK with a voice vote.                                Vote on Motion
