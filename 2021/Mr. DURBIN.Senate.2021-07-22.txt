 Madam President, America is a nation of immigrants. But  for the Native Americans, the first people over here, all of us have  come to this country in various stages in our family life: personally,  through our parents, grandparents, and beyond. We have built, within  the confines of our Nation, an amazing story to tell the world of how  such a diverse group of people can come together in one place and make  a nation that has an impact on the world itself. That makes it very  difficult to understand sometimes why we struggle so much with the  issue of immigration. It is so central to who we are, what we have  done, what we will become. Yet, when the conversation comes around  about immigration policy, immigration law, we dissemble into warring  factions and too often get little or nothing done.   The Presiding Officer may be surprised to know that it has been  almost 36 years--36 years--since this Congress has passed any  meaningful or substantive immigration law. The last real effort was  under President Ronald Reagan. That is not an indication that our  immigration system is perfect. It is far from perfect. There are many  problems with it, as we look at it in a critical and important way.   I look at it from a perspective that maybe is different than some. I  am the son of an immigrant. My mother was brought to this country at  the age of 2 from Lithuania, became a naturalized citizen, and was very  proud of that fact and raised her three boys to be proud of it as well.   Just a few steps from this Chamber is my office that I have decorated  with the naturalization certificate of my mother right next to my desk,  a reminder of who I am, where I came from, and also a warning to anyone  coming into the office that this Senator feels very strongly about the  issues of immigration.   Now I have the responsibility, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary  Committee, to actually deal with the laws surrounding immigration. It  is not an easy assignment. If we have failed for 36 years to come up  with a law, it is because there are strongly held views on both sides.  Yesterday was a good illustration of that.   I called for a hearing with my friend and colleague Senator Alex  Padilla, a California Senator, on farm labor, farm workers. The reason  we wanted to call this was because it was not untimely that we had  received a bill from the House of Representatives, which they passed on  a bipartisan basis, to rewrite the laws on farm workers. They did a  great job. I want to commend them for the effort of sending this  legislation our way, this bipartisan legislation with 30 Republicans  joining most of the House Democrats to enact it in the House of  Representatives. And now it is over on our side of the Rotunda. It is a  timely and important question.    We estimate that there are 2.4 million farmworkers in the United  States who plant and pick our crops, milk the cows, process the food,  and work in poultry and meat processing. And without them, these  industries would struggle to survive.   That is not my analysis; it is the analysis of the American Farm  Bureau and many other organizations that represent agriculture in  America.   Of the 2.4 million farmworkers in the United States who pick these  crops, half of them are undocumented. That means that, literally, they  work in the fields picking the crops that reach our tables and they  could be deported at any minute.   The bill that came over from the House of Representatives addresses  that. Here is what it says. It says: If you can prove that you have  worked picking crops for at least 10 years--10 years--and you can pass  a criminal background check, we will give you the opportunity to apply  for citizenship. But it is not instantaneous. Ten years is just the  starting point. You then have to give us 4 years more of working in the  fields, and then we will give you a green card. And in 5 years more,  you could be eligible for citizenship. You are going to go through all  kinds of reviews and background checks on your path to that moment.   So literally, we are saying to farm workers: If you will give us 19  years of your life picking our crops, we will give you a chance to be a  citizen.   I have just heard that process characterized as amnesty--amnesty. For  people who are breaking their backs, in the sweltering heat of America,  with the toughest jobs imaginable, spending 19 years of their life  putting food on our table and then passing a criminal background check,  some call amnesty. I won't.   And if you had listened yesterday to the hearing, you would  understand why even that process, as bipartisan as it was in the House,  is in a tangle of politics here on the Senate side. Two speeches given  by members of the Republican membership of the committee really told  the story. They started talking not about farm workers picking crops or  milking cows or processing our food, they started talking about  terrorists, drug dealers, human traffickers, violent criminals coming  across our border.   And they rejected the notion that we should give any of them the  opportunity for citizenship at any point. They didn't even read the  bill. About 19 years of hard work in the field before you could  possibly qualify, they just said ``reject it.''   And when I listened to that, I wondered what they had for dinner last  night because it is quite likely that whatever they had--whether it was  a vegan diet or one that included meat or other food products--it was  on their plate because one of these people that they have just  characterized as a potential terrorist is breaking his back, day in and  day out, to make sure that there is food for every American.   We heard stories. Linnea Kooistra was a dairy farmer in Woodstock,  IL. She and her husband own a dairy farm. That may be one of the  hardest assignments in the world. Those cows are going to get milked  twice a day if you are going to make a living, and you better be  prepared to give time to do it every single day, twice a day. She and  her husband did it for years, won awards for their work.   Now, they have just kind of semiretired into row crops, which are  challenging, too, but not like a dairy farm. And she said: You know,  the thought of our continuing our farm was impossible unless we had  immigrant labor.   The jobs on their dairy farm are tough, demanding jobs. People aren't  lining up to apply for those jobs. They needed immigrants to make it  work, and they couldn't get them.   There was a fellow that was there yesterday--an extraordinary guy,  person; I had just met him for the first time--and I ran across him by  watching television. I said, yesterday in a hearing, that my appetite  for television starts with the Chicago Bears and goes through baseball,  a lot of politics and news, but I never miss, if I can help it, the CBS  ``Sunday Morning'' show.  [[Page S5030]]    Two weeks ago, this man named Shay Myers, whose home is in Idaho and  who farms in Oregon growing asparagus, came on the show and did such a  remarkable job, and I said to my wife: I would like to get him before  our committee.   Well, he was there yesterday, and he told his story again, and he  told about that asparagus field. There aren't many left in the United  States because it is tough work and it is unpredictable, and some  people just can't make it and how tough it was for him when finally the  entire asparagus crop is ready, but there are no pickers for the crop.  And it is backbreaking, intensive work.   He took his entire production of asparagus and basically said:  Because I can't clear immigrant workers across the border, 90 of them,  to pick my acreage on asparagus, I am just notifying the public in the  area, It is free, come and take it; it is going to rot in the fields if  you don't.   He just gave up and made nothing as a result of it. He grew up, he  said, in a community in Oregon or Idaho--I am not sure which--which was  half and half, half Anglo, half Hispanic. And he said: I am a very  conservative person politically, but how can you say that these people  haven't earned their opportunity for citizenship? They work so damn  hard, and nobody else wants to do this work, and we count on them.   And, he said: I just happen to believe that growing these crops in  the United States is a good thing. American consumers, more and more,  are saying: We want some standards. We want to know about the chemicals  you are going to use on these crops. We want to know about your farming  practices.   He said: I pay close attention to those in America. Other countries  that send us those crops from other countries don't pay any attention  to it.   And he made a very, very valid point. When I think about those  workers and how critical they were to him and his livelihood, it is  hard for me to sit here--or stand here and ignore some of the criticism  of this farm workers bill.   I want to salute Michael Bennet, of Colorado, in particular. He is  our colleague here. And he has, time and again, been able to mobilize  the growers and the farm workers into an agreement on a bill. He did it  again. He did it once before. I saw him do it, almost miraculously,  with our Gang of 8 effort, a comprehensive immigration reform 7, 8  years ago. And now he has done it with this bill. It is amazing.   Arturo Rodriguez was there, one of the founding members of the United  Farm Workers--an organization, you will remember, from the days when  Cesar Chavez was drawing our attention for the first time in America to  who picks the crops. Rodriguez was there, and he was speaking for the  workers again--bringing workers from Michigan and Georgia, who were  young Hispanic women, who were working in the field just a few weeks  ago and now are sitting in the Halls of Congress, begging for this  legislation.    When I think about all that and then hear that work effort, that  bill, being dismissed by the Republican leader this morning as mass  amnesty--``mass amnesty,'' that was the phrase he used--it saddens me,  and it angers me. It saddens me that many of the Senators who are  saying these things aren't listening to these farm workers who are  giving their lives so that we can have food for our families.   Tom Vilsack was there yesterday, the Secretary of Agriculture. I like  him. I voted for him twice to be that Secretary. I am glad he has the  job. He told the story of going to the State of New York, meeting a man  who had been a migrant worker, picking crops for 20 years. This man had  heard about Vilsack's arrival and about this legislation that was  pending, and he said to the Secretary of Agriculture: I hope this  happens so I can see my family.   And Vilsack said to him: Your family, where is your family?   He said: In Mexico. He said: I have been here for 20 years picking  crops in the United States of America, going from field to field and  State to State--20 years--and I haven't been able to see my family in  that time.   And Vilsack said: Why?   He said: Because I am undocumented. And if I cross that border to see  my family, I may never get back here again to pick the crops and earn  the money and send it back to my family so they can get by.   We don't think about that very often, do we? We think, Well, these  workers come in, and everything is just normal. Nothing is normal about  being undocumented and picking someone's crops and not being able to  see your family for 20 years.   I am not going to give up on this issue of immigration. America  shouldn't give up on immigration. There are a million reasons why the  theory that helping to find good immigration laws is mistaken in some  way when you consider the fact that each year we naturalize a million  people in America. Those are people who went through the process I  described many times, waiting for years for that opportunity. And we  say a million new Americans, through this legal process, is normal and  good for us. I think it is.   There are some who say that if we said to farm workers, You have a  path to citizenship, a 19-year path to citizenship, of backbreaking  work in the fields, that we are sending a message to countries to turn  them loose, come on into the United States, no questions asked. I  couldn't disagree more.   We should have a process in America in immigration which we are proud  of, that reflects our heritage and our belief in immigration as part of  our future as well. I think there are just some basic things that every  Member of the Senate should consider and, I believe, should be the  basis of our immigration policy.   First, we need a secure border. In the age of COVID-19 and drug  dealing, I want to know who is coming into this country and what they  are bringing. That is not an unreasonable question to ask at our  borders. A secure border is important for those reasons.   Second, we should never knowingly allow any person to come into this  country who will do us harm, nor allow anyone into this country who  threatens us.   And third, we need an orderly process, one that respects the law  because the United States cannot absorb all of the people who want to  come here right now. We have to have an orderly process, knowing who is  coming into the border and what impact they are going to have on our  Nation.   And then we ought to sit down and, instead of throwing around all the  labels of mass amnesty and terrorism and human trafficking, acknowledge  who these people are.   One of the things that the Senator from Kentucky referred to, I am  sure, is a decision last week in Texas by a Federal court. That judge,  Hanen, again, ruled in a way that troubles me--I think troubles many  people--that the DACA Program, created by President Obama that has  given up to 850,000 young people a chance to become at least legal in  America temporarily, was unconstitutional and wrong. I think his  decision is terrible, and I hope that the Biden administration appeals  it and we win the appeal.   But the people who are affected by that decision, by the DACA  decision, are young people, as I mentioned--infants and toddlers-- brought to this country, who grew up here and know no other country.  They pledge allegiance to that flag in a classroom every morning. They  believe that is their flag, this is their country. And most of them,  when they were teenagers, finally realized for the first time they have  a problem: They are undocumented.   Should they be given a chance to become citizens of the United  States? Overwhelmingly, the American people--Democrat, Republican, and  Independents--say: Yes, that is only fair; give them a chance. They  were brought here as kids. Give them a chance, those Dreamers, those  DACA recipients. And to have them characterized as the beneficiaries of  mass amnesty is unfair, and frankly, it doesn't reflect very well on us  as a nation.   If we cannot find in our values, in our hearts, an opportunity to  give these young people a chance to prove themselves, it really  disappoints me that my colleagues would take that position.   These young people are remarkable. For 20 years of my public life, I  have come to know them, and I am always amazed by the fact that I don't  have to put a footnote at the end of that sentence and say ``except for  a few here and there.'' By and large, I have never run into one who has  run into problems. I know it happens occasionally,  [[Page S5031]]  but it is so rare. These are remarkable young people, Dreamers, who  just want a chance to be part of America's future.   I have come to the floor over 120 times with color photographs  telling their individual stories. Each one is an amazing testimony to  who we are as Americans and why these young people want to be part of  us and what they can bring to this country. Remarkable stories-- doctors, nurses, teachers, engineers, members of our military,  frontline workers--on COVID-19. They do remarkable things.   One of them, yesterday, appeared in a video before our committee,  Vicente Reyes. Vicente Reyes is a DACA recipient. His mom and dad are  undocumented. He is studying robotic engineering at a university in  California.   Do we need him? I mean, can we do without Vicente Reyes? I assume we  can do without him, but wouldn't we be better if he were part of us,  part of the American family, and part of the American future?   That is what DACA is about. That is what Dreamers are about. If we  help him, is that mass amnesty to give that young man a chance?   Incidentally, he told a story. He used to be out there picking those  crops, and his mom and dad still are. Every morning, he said, before  they go to the fields for a 10-hour day of back-breaking work picking  crops, he said: Mom and dad hug me. They hug me and I hug them back  because we know something. There is a secret in our family. My mom and  dad are undocumented, he said. They may not come home tonight.   That is what that family faces to go out and do this back-breaking  work, and that is the reality. And to dismiss this as mass amnesty--to  even talk about a path to citizenship for Vicente, to talk about some  way to help his mom and dad from being frightened every single day of  being deported, that is what I dedicated my work for in this Senate and  the Senate Judiciary Committee for many years.   I hope we can find some Republicans who will step up and join us in  that effort. We need at least 10 of them. That is hard to find. Maybe  we can find them. I am hoping we can do it soon.   We have a lot of work to do in this country for the Dreamers, for the  farm workers, for the frontline workers who were there when we needed  them so desperately during the COVID-19 pandemic and are still there  today doing that work.   We are a big, wonderful nation that has a great story to tell, and it  is a story of success written by immigrants with their blood and their  toil and their dedication to this great Nation. We need to renew that  effort.                            ____________________     Madam President, this has been one of the most difficult  years ever for the Capitol Police here in Washington. These are men and  women who have worked in this building and nearby in our office  buildings and protect us to make sure we can come safely to work every  single day and our staff and our visitors and tourists who come to the  Capitol Building. These men and women are amazing.   We know that January 6, 2021, is a date that they will never forget.  They were on the front lines of the violent January 6 insurrection that  shocked this building, our Nation, and the world. Hundreds of Capitol  Police literally fought for hours that day to protect this building and  to protect me and other Members of the U.S. Senate.   The attack left one Capitol officer, Brian Sicknick, dead and more  than 140 total officers from the Capitol Police and DC Police injured.  Some members said it was the most savage fighting they have ever  witnessed or been part of. Many of them thought they would die that  day, yet they were back at their post the very next day and the day  after that, and the day after that, and this morning too.   On April 2, the Capitol Police were still struggling to heal from the  insurrection when their department suffered another devastating loss. A  driver rammed his car into a barricade just outside the Capitol, a  barricade I go through every morning. And one officer was injured and  another officer, Billy Evans, was killed--killed. The memorial to him  is still out at that barricade.   Only once before in the 193-year history of the Capitol Police had  the department lost two members in the line of duty in the same year.  That was on July 24, 1998. This coming Saturday is the anniversary of  that event, the 23rd anniversary of the murders of Capitol Police  Officers Jacob ``J.J.'' Chestnut and Detective John Gibson.   It happened on a Friday afternoon. I remember the day. Most Members  of Congress had already gone home for the weekend, but the Capitol was  still filled with staff and tourists. Officer Chestnut was at his post  guarding an entrance on the east front of the building when a man with  a .38-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver and a history of serious mental  illness walked in and shot him point-blank in the back of the head. The  shooter then ran to the nearest opened door, seeking to escape.   On the other side of that door, Detective Gibson just warned  congressional staffers to hide under their desks, and he was face-to- face with that shooter. For the first time in his career, Detective  Gibson fired his weapon in the line of duty, hitting the man four  times. The man shot back, hitting Detective Gibson twice. Both officers  died.   John Gibson had 18 years with the Capitol Police. J.J. Chestnut, a  Vietnam veteran, had 20 years in the Air Force before joining the  Capitol Police. He was ready for retirement. He thought he was going to  be able to take time off with his family, but he lost his life that  day.   They became the first civilians ever to lie in honor in the Capitol  Rotunda. Today, the Capitol Police headquarters is named after them.   Their murders remained the darkest days in the history of the Capitol  Police until January 6, 2021, until a defeated and bitter President  Donald Trump incited an angry mob and sent them to this Capitol to try  to overturn a Presidential election.   The images from that day are sickening and we have seen them over and  over. On February 3, Brian Sicknick became the third Capitol Police  officer to lie in honor in the Rotunda.   I had a chance after that to speak to his parents. They were so proud  of him and they thought he had a safe job as a policeman. Working at  the U.S. Capitol, that has to be a safe place to work. Among the  mourners paying their respect in the Rotunda that day were President  Biden and the widow of Officer Chestnut   Mr. President, the men and women who safeguard this Capitol deserve  more than words from us, more than speeches. They protect us with their  courage and they stand up and fight for us whenever they are called on.   Men and women in law enforcement are on the front lines when it comes  to the Nation's gun violence epidemic. So far this year, at least 36  police officers in the city of Chicago have been shot or shot at. It is  too easy for convicted felons and people with serious mental illness to  get their hands on guns and use them.   More than 90 percent of the American people--all political faiths-- believe we should have serious background checks to keep guns out of  the hands of people who will misuse them: Convicted felons, mentally  unstable people.   The House passed a bill, H.R. 8, in March that would fortify this  effort to keep guns out of those hands. Senators Murphy and Manchin  have been leading the negotiations. They are not coming along very  well. I wish they were. I hope our Republican colleagues will join us  in supporting that.   In the meantime, I hope that we don't allow the events of January 6  to just become a matter of history. There are still important questions  we need to answer.   And the Capitol Police have done something unusual, maybe the first  time in memory. They have written us a letter and begged us to have a  commission to really look into and investigate what happened on January  6. They had so much at stake that day. They risked their lives for us.  And, sadly, Senator McConnell is not agreeing to move forward on a  bipartisan commission. Speaker Pelosi is trying to put one together now  and it is not easy. I commend her for her effort.   It would be a shame for us to walk away from the events of January 6  because of worries about political consequences. We owe it to the  American people. We owe it to the Capitol Police.  [[Page S5032]]  We owe it to the families of those who were injured and those who died  to do our part to get to the bottom of what led up to January 6.   If we want this Capitol to be available for future generations to  visit peacefully in a positive way, let's do our part to make sure we  get to the bottom and answer that fundamental question.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
