 Mr. Speaker, Monday marked the last day  of school for students at the DuBois Area Middle School. It was a last  day like probably none other.   In addition to celebrating the long-awaited start of summer vacation,  the sixth grade students finished off their school year with a special  visit from Silicon Valley.   Representatives from Google traveled to Clearfield County,  Pennsylvania, to deliver a CS First Roadshow, a computer science  education presentation. Google specifically developed this event for  fourth through eighth graders.                                time  1015    Two Google employees delivered the hour-long presentation which  focused on teaching students both problem-solving and technical coding  skills through a series of interactive activities.   They encouraged kids to develop an interest in computer science  education by giving real-life examples of how coding and STEM education  can lead to educational opportunities and exciting careers.   Mr. Speaker, the presentation was incredible, and it was clear that  the students truly enjoyed it. These are the kinds of skills that  students everywhere need to be exposed to at a young age to get them  interested in the STEM fields.   I was excited to kick off this event at DuBois Area Middle School. I  told the students that technology is constantly changing, and America  needs the next generation of computer scientists ready for any  opportunities that might come our way.   We need more people in this world who can help build the future or  invent  [[Page H4853]]  the next big thing. That is why it is extremely important for our  students to learn about computer science at an early age. The CS  Roadshow helped kids build their own fun stories using Scratch, which  is an introductory coding tool.   Our students today are exposed to technology at such an early age,  but don't necessarily get to learn about why computer science should be  an important part of their lives, both now and in the future. The CS  First Roadshow teaches students about the importance of STEM education  and uses interactive activities to teach them coding basics.   Hopefully, this experience instilled a newfound passion for computer  science in these students, and I think it did just that. I could tell  from the joy on their faces and the fun that they were having with  their partners that they truly were beginning a journey with computer  science.   Mr. Speaker, currently there are more than 500,000 open computing  jobs in the United States. In Pennsylvania alone there are more than  17,800 open computing jobs--that is 3.4 times the State average demand  rate--and only 2,969 computer science graduates.   By the year 2020, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts there  will be 1 million more computer science jobs than graduating students  who qualify for the jobs. And only 10 percent of K-12 schools in the  United States offer computer science classes, which is a statistic that  we must improve.   I look forward to checking back in with the DuBois Area Middle School  at the start of the next school year to see how it can expand upon and  grow more of an interest in computer science programs for our young  learners. After all, they are our future.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, yesterday the President  signed into law the VA MISSION Act, which takes a number of steps  toward giving our veterans the care they deserve. My bill, the VETS  Act, was included in this larger package. It will allow VA-employed  doctors to practice telemedicine across State lines.   The VA already has an extremely successful telemedicine program,  boasting an 88 percent satisfaction rating, but outdated regulations  restricted this program from growing to achieve its full potential.   The VETS Act will now allow VA doctors to utilize telemedicine to see  patients in any State and any location, including in the comfort of  their own home. This is especially helpful for veterans who are  battling post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury who  have had a hard time traveling to a VA facility or live in rural areas.   Mr. Speaker, our veterans deserve the best care available to them,  and the VETS Act is one of the provisions of the VA MISSION Act that  will advance this care.   I commend the President for signing this bill into law. Telemedicine  is better access, better care, and true healthcare reform.                            ____________________
