 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the taxpayers  in my district and urge my colleagues to quickly pass bipartisan  legislation to lift the cap on the State and local tax deduction.   Capping the deduction hurts homeowners and undermines State and local  efforts to invest in our roads, schools, teachers, and first  responders.   Setting the cap at $10,000 for both individuals and joint filers  unfairly punishes married couples.   Richard from Walnut wrote that while he and his wife are trying to  plan for their retirement, ``the net result of the cap was less money  in my pocket.''   Kyle from Yorba Linda wrote to me: ``This new marriage penalty is a  slap in the face to those of us who are trying to grow our roots in  your district.''   I introduced bipartisan legislation with my colleagues,  Representative Sherrill from New Jersey along with Republican  Representatives Peter King and Elise Stefanik.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of my constituents, I urge my colleagues to  join us in support of this legislation before the year's end.                            ____________________
