 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3152,  the Fight CRIME Act.   This bill looks to impose sanctions with respect to countries,  individuals, and entities that engage in any effort to acquire,  possess, develop, transport, transfer, or deploy Iranian missiles and  related goods and technology.   For years, the Government of Iran has proven to be erratic and  unpredictable.   With thousands of people being arbitrarily detained or unfairly  prosecuted solely for peacefully exercising their human rights.   Women, people of the LGBTQ+ community, and people of ethnic and  religious minority suffer intensified discrimination and violence in  Iran.   We must impose visa- and property-blocking sanctions on foreign  persons that are knowingly involved with Iran or Iran-aligned entities  in certain missile-related activities.   This involves the acquiring, possessing, developing, transporting,  transferring, or deploying missiles or related items and technology  that are covered by the Missile Technology Control Regime, or  developing missile or drone technologies.   We must also impose sanctions on certain adult family members of  those who are subject to the sanctions previously mentioned.   Foreign persons who knowingly provide significant support to or  engage in a significant transaction with those are also subject to the  sanctions previously mentioned.   The bill also requires the Department of State to report to Congress  on various topics, including a diplomatic strategy to renew  international restrictions on certain missile-related activities.   The Government of Iran brought this upon themselves.   The many accounts of enforced disappearances, torture and other ill- treatment are just some of many atrocities committed by the Iranian  Government.   Similarly, the usage of the death penalty increased, and public  executions resumed.   The people of Iran are tired of the regime forcing its unjust will on  them.   In 2022 alone, more than 500 people were killed by the violent  crackdown on protesting in Iran.   Additionally, more than 14,000 people were arrested, including  protesters, journalists, lawyers, activists, artists, and athletes who  voiced support for the freedom movement.   There are countless more stories and recollections as to why the  Government of Iran should face these sanctions.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3152, the Fight  and Combat Rampant Iranian Missile Exports Act, and the limiting of the  Iranian Government.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 589, the  Mahsa Amini Human Rights Security Accountability (MAHSA) Act.   This bill would require the President of the United States to impose  property- and visa- blocking sanctions on certain individuals and  entities affiliated with Iran.   Additionally, this bill would impose requirements that the President  periodically make determinations about whether certain existing  sanctions apply to specified persons and impose the applicable  sanctions, including determinations concerning:   (1) the Supreme Leader of Iran and any official in the Office of the  Supreme Leader of Iran;   (2) the President of Iran and any official in the Office of the  President of Iran; and   (3) any entity overseen by the Office of the Supreme Leader of Iran  which is complicit in supporting human rights abuses or terrorism.   Iran currently faces widespread unrest because of various human  rights violations.   In 2022, security forces killed more than 500 persons, including at  least 69 children, and arrested more than 19,000 protesters, including  children, according to the nongovernmental organization Human Rights  Activists News Agency.   Some of those arrested faced the death penalty, including children.   The government also routinely disrupted access to the internet and  communications applications to prevent the free flow of information and  to attempt to interrupt or diminish participation in protests.   Although the human rights violations in Iran are unacceptable and  certainly condemnable and actionable in response, to address this  matter in the manner set forth by this bill is concerning.   First, this bill and its text targets the Iran government itself, not  individuals in the government.   Because of this, this bill would essentially remain in effect  indefinitely, regardless of a change in leadership and political or  social agenda.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 12, 2023, on page H4246, in the third column, the  following appeared: Because of this, this bill would essentially  remain in effect indefinitely, regardless of a change in  leadership and political or social agenda. In addition, this bill  is supported by 3 organizations that have previously advocated for  military action against Iran (the American Israel Public Affairs  Committee, United Against a Nuclear Iran, and National Union for  Democracy in Iran). Although these organizations might support  this bill with positive intentions, their methods of seeking  change might not be the answer if it includes violence. Iran and  its people deserve peace, not additional hardships.      The online version has been corrected to read: Because of this,  this bill would essentially remain in effect indefinitely,  regardless of a change in leadership and political or social  agenda. Iran and its people deserve peace, not additional  hardships.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Iran and its people deserve peace, not additional hardships.   Instead of implementing this act, Congress should investigate the  sanctions that are already in place on the Iranian leadership and could  consider amending those sanctions.   This bill has been built on positive intentions that seek to solve an  important and pressing issue.   However, I think it would benefit us to reexamine already existing  sanctions on Iranian leadership.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 492-- ``Condemning the Government of Iran's state-sponsored persecution of  the Baha'i minority and its continued violation of the International  Covenants on Human Rights.''   Since 1979, Iranian authorities have killed or executed more than 200  Baha'i leaders, and more than 10,000 Baha'is have been dismissed from  government and university jobs.   June 18, 2023, marks the 40th anniversary of the execution of 10  Baha'i women by the Iranian Government each witnessing the hanging of  those hanged before her in a final failed attempt to induce abandonment  of their faith after over 6 months of imprisonment and violent abuse,  with the youngest only 17 years old.   In the previous years, the Congress has declared that it deplored the  religious persecution by the Government of Iran of the Baha'i community  and would hold the Government of Iran responsible for upholding the  rights of all Iranian nationals, including members of the Baha'i faith.   On December 15, 2022, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a  resolution (A/C.3/77/L.34) criticizing Iran for human rights abuses and  calling on Iran to carry out wide-ranging reforms, including:   End its continuing disregard for protections under Iranian law or  internationally recognized safeguards relating to the imposition of the  death penalty and to commute the sentences for child offenders on death  row.   Ensure, in law and in practice, that no one is subjected to torture  or other cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment and eliminate in law  and in practice, all forms of systemic discrimination and other human  rights.   Cease the widespread and systematic use of arbitrary arrests and  detention and releasing persons detained for the exercise of their  human rights and fundamental freedoms.   Through June and July 2022, there had been a surge in persecution of  Baha'is including the subjection of over 100 Baha'is to arrests,  arraignments, sentencings, and raids on their homes and businesses  across Iran, as well as the sentencing of 26 individuals in the city of  Shiraz to a combined total of 85 years in prison.   In response the Department of State's Office of International  Religious Freedom issued a statement on August 2, 2022, indicating that  ``[a]mid a continued rise in arrests, sentences, and imprisonments, the  U.S. urges Iran to halt its ongoing oppression of the Baha'i community  and honor its international obligations to respect the right of all  Iranians to freedom of religion or belief''.   The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Public  Law 112-158) amends and expands the authorities established under the  Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of  2010 (Public Law 111-195) to sanction Iranian human rights abusers.   Resolved as follows:   Therefore, be it resolved that the House of Representatives, condemns  the Government of Iran's state-sponsored persecution of the Baha'i  minority in Iran and the continued violation of the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and  Political Rights.   Calls on the Iranian government to immediately release the imprisoned  or detained Baha'is and all other prisoners held solely on account of  their religion.   Calls on the Iranian Government to end its state-sponsored campaign  of hate propaganda against the Baha'is and to reverse the state-  [[Page H4249]]  imposed policies denying Baha'is and members of other religious  minorities equal opportunities to higher education, earning a  livelihood, due process under the law, and the free exercise of  religious practices.   Calls on the President of the United States and the Secretary of  State, in cooperation with responsible nations, to immediately condemn  the Government of Iran's continued violation of human rights, and  demand the immediate release of prisoners held solely on account of  their religion; and urges the President and the Secretary of State to  utilize available authorities to impose sanctions on officials of the  Government of Iran and other individuals directly responsible for  serious human rights abuses, including abuses against the Baha'i  community of Iran.   H. Res. 492, is an important bill supporting Congress' longstanding  position condemning such atrocities against religious minorities.   I, therefore, urge all members to support this important legislation  and reenforce this longstanding objection and condemnation to these  horrific atrocities and inhumanity.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.R. 1567,  which will require the Department of Agriculture and the Department of  the Interior to submit accurate reports regarding hazardous fuels  reduction activity.   Hazardous fuels reduction activity is an important effort to curb  wildfires.   Some sources state that wildfires cost the United States upwards of  $3 billion in damage from 2022 to 2023 and have destroyed 616,486 acres  across the United States since January of this year.   In the State of Texas alone, three quarters of the state have been  issued a wildfire declaration.   In the city of Houston, wildfires have damaged the air quality and  burned through several homes, negatively affecting many civilians'  lives.   Due to both the environmental and economic havoc that wildfires  present, it is important that we have accurate reporting to best  prepare for these disasters.   This bill is important because it monitors the risk elimination  solutions for wildfires in an accurate and dependable manner while also  allowing oversight of the USDA and the Interior.   This bill is a first step to accurately determine effective methods  to reduce the risk of wildfire and because of this I ask my colleagues  to support this bill.
