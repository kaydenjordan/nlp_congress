 Mr. Chair, I rise today to express my deep concern  about the Biden administration's equity action plan at the Department  of Housing and Urban Development.   We must ensure that American tax dollars allocated to HUD are spent  based on financial need and readiness, not the Democrats' divisive  social justice agenda.   These equity action plans direct the department to give special  attention to individuals based on their race or if they identify as  transgender or gender nonconforming. These criteria have no place in  providing affordable housing and ending homelessness.   Helping Americans out of homelessness or helping them to buy their  first home should be based on only preparedness and creditworthiness.   Anything else does them a disservice in the long run, as evidenced by  the housing collapse of 2008, which was the result of unscrupulous  promotion of subprime loans.   It is a fundamental tenet of our Republic that we treat all Americans  equally, regardless of their race or creed. If any American is  struggling, they should have equal access to assistance.    The Department of Housing and Urban Development should  support those who are in need and ready to receive or help--no need for  equity action plans.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support Congressman Self's  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to wish the State of Montana a  happy 134th birthday. On November 8, 1889, Montana was the 41st State  admitted to the Union, and it is truly a blessing to call it home.   Montana boasts a rich heritage and is home to some of the Nation's  most pristine public lands, including Glacier National Park and the  crown jewel of the National Park System, Yellowstone.   However, what truly makes Montana special is the people. Montanans  are hardworking folks who value our traditions and cherish our freedoms  and our liberties. There is a reason that Montana is the most patriotic  State in the Nation.   Our Montana way of life is second to none, and it is an honor and a  privilege to represent the Treasure State here in Congress, which is  why we will continue to fight to protect our way of life.   Happy birthday, Montana.                            ____________________
