 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her  leadership.   I also want to salute our colleague, Congresswoman Chu, for her  persistent advocacy and her moral clarity on the subject we address  today.   I commend the House for passing the resolution to condemn the  horrific shootings in Atlanta on March 16 and to reaffirm the House's  commitment to combating hate, bigotry, and violence against the AAPI  community.   Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, we have seen racist  sentiment, discrimination, and hate crimes targeting Asian Americans  skyrocket to alarming levels. Members of the AAPI community have been  calling out for help for over a year now. They should not have to live  in fear of facing discrimination, hate, or violence while walking in  their neighborhood, going to the grocery store, or going to work.   Since the pandemic's outbreak, there was a 1,900 percent increase in  violence against this community in 2020 alone and a 150 percent  increase in hate crimes against AAPIs in America's major cities.   There were 3,800 reported cases of Asian-American discrimination  related to COVID-19 over the past year, 68 percent of which targeted  Asian-American women. Three in five Asian Americans have experienced  discrimination during the pandemic.   Let me be clear: These events do not occur in a vacuum. America has a  dark history of vilifying minorities, including targeting the Asian- American and Pacific Islander community, in particular, and using  Federal law to enable that discrimination and even violence.   Look no further than the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, the first  Federal law to bar an entire group of people from immigrating purely  based on their race, and the internment of Japanese Americans in 1942.   No one should feel unsafe in America ever. We all play a role in  stopping the spread of violence and racism against the AAPI community.  Solidarity is greater than racism. Today, we are all Asian Americans.
