 Mr. Speaker, today I would like to bring attention to  the outstanding achievements of the University of Texas at Austin men's  swimming and diving team. For the fourth consecutive year, this team  took home the NCAA title.   College athletes from around the country dream about competing at the  NCAA championships. As student-athletes, this could also mark the peak  of their athletic career.   In addition to these incredible athletes, I would like to  congratulate their coach, Eddie Reese. Coach Reese has the most wins in  this sport's history. After 40 seasons at the University of Texas, he  has trained athletes to win 14 national titles.   Coaches like this don't come around often, and I would like to thank  Coach Reese for his dedication to this great university.   I would also like to take this time to identify UT seniors on the  team: Jonathan Roberts, Brett Ringgold, and Joseph Schooling. As they  leave their college days behind, they will always remember this moment,  and they will remember this team.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the University of Texas on  these impressive accomplishments and simply say: Hook `em.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
