 Madam Speaker, on June 22, Barbara Kim-Hagemann became  the first woman--the very first woman--to be installed as State  commander for New Jersey's Veterans of Foreign Wars.   Barbara is a U.S. Army veteran who served in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait  during Desert Shield and during Desert Storm.   When she returned to America, she joined a VFW, and the VFW post was  in Jackson, New Jersey. There, she became the first female post  commander in Ocean County and then the first female district commander,  where she served for two terms.   Now, as VFW State commander, Barbara's project for this year focuses  on veteran suicide prevention and mental health awareness, a subject  that is so important and needs so much work. She also works on  strengthening networks of support, communication, and care for veterans  across New Jersey's communities.   We are incredibly lucky to have Barbara. I thank her for her service  abroad and the continued service she brings to our south Jersey  community. Her State is proud of her, south Jersey is proud of her, and  the United States of America is proud of her.    May God bless Barbara Kim-Hagemann.                            ____________________
