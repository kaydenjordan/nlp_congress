 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Thank you, Mr. President.   Mr. President, the nomination of Betsy DeVos has triggered an outcry  of deep public opposition. It has also inspired an outpouring of  popular support for public schools.   Public education is what has made America great. It is at the heart  of the American dream. Our schools are much more than just a collection  of classrooms. They are expressions of our communities and our values.   This is a lesson I learned from my parents. My father was the school  custodian in a public school. He took tremendous pride in ensuring that  the school was clean, in good repair, safe, and welcoming to the  students. He was part of the public school team entrusted with our  community's children. He, along with the teachers, principals, and  every staff member at the school were deeply committed to public  education. We saw that commitment each and every day. He spoke of that  commitment when he came home in the evening. The teachers would do much  more than what was asked of them to ensure that students got the best  opportunities and best education. Everyone in our school was pulling  for our children. That is the way it should be, and that is the way it  must be. This was free public education, the hallmark of America, and  perhaps one of the most important contributions that we have made to  progress, prosperity, and economic growth, not only here in the United  States but around the globe. That is what we are talking about today-- the future of public education.   It is that kind of commitment to public education, going in early,  working hard--I can remember of course in the wintertime, when the  storms would rage through Rhode Island, it was not uncommon for my  father and his colleagues to be out there on a Sunday afternoon, if the  storm was bad enough, shoveling all night long so that Monday morning  the school was open for the children, the teachers could get there, and  the food could be prepared. That is the type of commitment that has  been evidenced throughout our history when it comes to public  education. That investment of effort but also of trying to understand  and trying to improve public education has been at the heart of what we  have all done.   Indeed, I believe it is that kind of commitment to public education  that has caused millions of Americans to speak up about the nomination  of Betsy DeVos. Teachers, parents, and community members have been  calling across the country, writing, emailing, urging the Senate to  reject her nomination. I have received over 12,500 calls and messages  from Rhode Islanders, an unprecedented negative response to a  Presidential nominee.   We are the smallest State in the Union. We have a population of just  over 1 million people, and we understand that even for the most  challenging and publicized issues, we rarely get this type of response.  It is because this nomination touches a nerve. It touches a nerve with  people who are products of public schools because they honor the  success of public schools, but it also touches the nerves of people who  may not have attended public schools because they recognize the value,  the necessity, the need for good public education. Without it, we can't  move forward as a nation; without it there is no alternative except  typically very expensive private arrangements to educate our children.   Once again, free public education has been a hallmark of this  country. It might have been one of the most dominant factors in  ensuring equality. Our country is based on equality--equality before  the law. But without a good education, how can one be equal? How can  one understand their rights and use their rights, understand their  abilities and use their abilities?   Our constituents all across the country want a champion for public  education at the helm of the Department of Education. They want someone  committed to public schools, someone knowledgeable about the Federal  role in education, and they have determined that Betsy DeVos is not  that person. Having looked at her record and viewed her performance  during the confirmation hearings, they are telling us that she is the  wrong choice to lead the Department of Education, and we should heed  their pleas. Of the thousands of Rhode Islanders who have contacted me  to express their opposition to Mrs. DeVos's nomination, I would like to  share the sentiments of a few who exemplify the deep concerns I am  hearing.   One teacher wrote:         Mrs. DeVos is not versed on the real concerns of families       and their children, and does not know the issues and concerns       educators face in our schools. As a teacher in a public       school, I believe she is completely unqualified to lead the       Department of Education. She does not understand the       definition of proficiency and she did not know our children       were protected by Federal laws (disability act). As a parent,       I do not believe Mrs. DeVos understands the concerns middle       income families have regarding their children and their       futures. She also does not believe that guns should be kept       out of our schools. This proves how out of touch she is with       our students, their families and teachers.    I think many Americans agree with the sentiment that Mrs. DeVos is  out of touch and out of step with American families. Neither she nor  the President seems to have much, if any, experience with public  schools, as students, parents, educators, or administrators.   Another theme that Rhode Islanders wrote about was the double  standard of this nomination. One vice principal wrote:         We as administrators are required to be highly qualified in       order to run our schools through an evaluation process. We       also require this of our teachers as well. How can we support       someone in a position to lead the educational process who is       not held to these same standards?    That is a fair question that neither Mrs. DeVos nor the Trump  administration has answered.   But again, it is not purely about her resume. Another theme I heard  about from many Rhode Islanders is their fear of the empathy gap from  this administration. Here is an example from a letter written by a  public school principal:         [M]y heart is sinking. I have worked as an educator in       urban public schools for the past 19 years, as a teacher and,       now, as a principal. I was an attorney before I was a       teacher--I came to the profession as a second career, by       choice, with a passion for righting the inequities our       students face. I have worked all of my career with our most       needy populations, a group whom I believe also to be our most       brilliant, caring, loving, and amazing young people. I feel       blessed to get to work with them and their teachers every       day. I ache for the things they don't have that other schools       have, and for my powerlessness to right that wrong. Betsy       DeVos wishes to take on a role with the power to right those       wrongs. Yet, she seems unaware that such inequities exist,       and is undisturbed by them. She has never worked with young       people in schools, much less in public schools, much less in       urban schools. She has never been a teacher or an       administrator or the parent of a child in a public school.       She has never wrestled with the incredible want for       resources, the choices we have to make every day, all within       a city and state with some of the most prestigious and       wealthy schools just a few steps away.    The realities for our urban students are so vastly different from the  reality that Betsy DeVos and her contemporaries live in. To hear her  unable to even comprehend the need for equal access and equal  opportunity for high quality childcare and post-secondary education was  painful. To hear her say it would be nice for everyone to have access  to a college education, but nothing in life is free--she is completely  unaware of her own privilege, the privilege of her children, and the  privilege of her family and extended circle, those who have billions of  dollars, who were born into great wealth, and who have never had to  struggle economically. That is unacceptable in someone who wishes to  fill one of the most distinguished offices in our land.   Our students and teachers and schools need a champion who will work  tirelessly to reverse the inequities of our educational system-- inequities that I am painfully aware of every day here in Rhode Island.  It isn't right that some students have football fields, and 1:1  computers, and huge libraries, and food choices and AP classes and much  more, while others have no outdoor spaces, little access to technology,  and crumbling buildings. We cannot allow  [[Page S792]]  that to be who we are. Our families work incredibly hard and want the  very best for their children. To say, ``everything in life isn't  free,'' when it has been for Mrs. DeVos's family, is hypocritical and  mean. We need a champion of equity. Please vote against her  confirmation.   This next letter I want to share is from the mother of a special  needs child. Like many Rhode Islanders, she is distressed by the fact  that Mrs. DeVos has suggested that a landmark civil rights law should  be left up to the States. She writes:         I have grave concerns about the nomination of Betsy DeVos       as Secretary of Education. As a parent of a special needs       child, it would not be an understatement to say that I was       horrified at Ms. DeVos' answers to the questions about the       Individuals with Disabilities Education Act during her recent       hearing. The one thing we rely on the Department of Education       to do is to vigorously enforce and uphold the landmark       civil rights law that is IDEA. Without it, our children       will fall through the cracks. It is extremely difficult to       navigate the system and make sure your child gets the       support he or she needs. My son is 20 now so I've been       doing it for a long time. I've served on both state and       local special ed advisory committees, school committee,       taken special ed training, even mentored other parents,       and I STILL don't completely understand all of the nuances       of the IDEA laws. For someone to be appointed to the       highest office in the land in charge of upholding those       laws and not be aware of them, is unacceptable. It's too       big of a learning curve. Surely there are more qualified       candidates.    Last Congress, we came together to rewrite the No Child Left Behind  Act. We passed the Every Student Succeeds Act on a strong bipartisan  vote--85 to 12.   We moved toward giving States and school districts more flexibility  in designing their accountability systems, especially regarding how  they identify and intervene in schools that are struggling to serve  their students as well. We strengthened transparency, including greater  transparency about resource equity. We agreed to maintain key Federal  protections--or, as Senator Murray calls them, ``guard rails''--to  ensure that we do not return to the days when students, such as  students with disabilities, English language learners, poor and  minority students, routinely fell through the cracks.   For the Every Student Succeeds Act to work, States and school  districts need a strong partner at the Department of Education--a  partner who understands how public schools work, a partner who is  committed to strengthening public schools. Mrs. DeVos is not that  partner. Her life's work has been to divert taxpayer dollars to fund  alternatives to public schools.   Some on the other side of the aisle have argued that private school  vouchers are no different from Pell grants or GI Bill benefits. This  claim is another one of those alternative facts that the new  administration is so fond of.   Public elementary and secondary education is enshrined in our States'  constitutions. Attendance is compulsory. Public schools do not charge  tuition, and they must accept all students.   Pell grants and GI Bill benefits support postsecondary education,  which is voluntary. Schools do not have to accept all students, nor are  students required to attend. Individuals must pay to go to college.   We do not want a system of elementary and secondary education where  students and families must pay and schools can choose which students  they serve. That is not the universal system of public education that  has made our Nation great.   Our constituents understand that, which is why we have seen the  public outcry against this nomination. And with this public outcry,  they reaffirm our commitment to public education, recognizing that it  has been the force that has pulled this country forward over  generations; indeed, generation after generation. With that  understanding, we have just, in fact, on a bipartisan basis, provided  more flexibility and more discretion to the Department of Education. We  need a Secretary who will take that discretion and flexibility in the  spirit of public education with a fundamental and primary commitment to  American public education, with a desire to see American public  education succeed, not fail. We need that type of Secretary.  Unfortunately, Mrs. DeVos is not that type of Secretary.   So I urge my colleagues to heed the call of all of our constituents  in an unprecedented outpouring of messages and phone calls and text  messages and rallies, and join me in voting no against this nomination.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, after a great deal of careful thought and  consideration, I have decided to oppose Senator Sessions' nomination to  be the next Attorney General of the United States.   I have long served with Senator Sessions. While he and I have  frequently disagreed on certain legal and civil rights issues, I have  never doubted the sincerity or heartfelt nature of his positions. I am  deeply concerned, however, that he cannot be the effective check on the  Executive Branch that our nation currently needs.   In just the short time since President Donald Trump took office, our  Nation has faced upheaval and challenges to the way our government  typically runs. The President's unprecedented refusal to divest himself  of his business holdings while in office has created legal and  constitutional conflicts that are unique in our Nation's history. His  use of social media to antagonize American businesses has already  caused needless volatility in our economy, which is the cornerstone of  global financial stability. Most recently, he has unilaterally enacted  a ban on travel to the United States from several Muslim-majority  countries--creating chaos in airports, separating families, and  tarnishing our Nation's image around the world. It is of great concern  to me that Senator Sessions has already stated his unwillingness, if  confirmed, to recuse himself from investigations into potentially  unlawful activities of the Trump campaign and Trump administration.   Moreover, Senator Sessions and I disagree on how the law should treat  immigrants, refugees, the LGBTQ community, women, and racial  minorities, among others. These disagreements go to the heart of the  Justice Department's law enforcement and civil rights functions. For  instance, in 2013, Senator Sessions voted against a bipartisan effort  to reform our Nation's immigration laws. This effort garnered  overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle and would have done  much to address the immigration problems facing us today. He also voted  against the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act,  which provides much-needed support to and protections for some of the  most vulnerable people in our communities--and is overseen by the  Justice Department that he hopes to administer. Additionally, his  statements and votes in opposition to reaffirming the prohibition on  torture run counter to our values and basic precepts of international  law. And he has voted against every recent effort in this Chamber to  establish the most basic, commonsense laws that would keep our  communities safe from the threat of gun violence. He also has called  into question the Voting Rights Act and praised the Supreme Court's  harmful decision striking down a key section of this law.   These are just some of the clear disagreements I have with the  positions Senator Sessions has taken over the years, which cause me to  doubt his ability to effectively lead the Justice Department. Our next  Attorney General should be a champion for all Americans' civil rights  and civil liberties. The occupant of that office should give Americans  confidence in our judiciary, our elections, and the impartial due  process that is the hallmark of the rule of law. Therefore, I cannot  support Senator Sessions' nomination to be Attorney General of the  United States.
