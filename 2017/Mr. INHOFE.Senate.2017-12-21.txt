 Madam President, let me make a comment to the Senator  from West Virginia. One of the problems we have right now is that  during the last administration, there was a war on fossil fuel--which  includes coal and nuclear also--and some of the damage has already been  done. Unfortunately, we can't come in with a ready fix now and assume-- because a lot of the generators out there had done field switching out  of coal, so you can't switch it back. So I will say it was help coming  not quite on time, but nonetheless it is here now.                            ____________________     Madam President, let me mention something that is very  significant to me personally. I remember it was 2 years ago today that  I picked up USA TODAY, and in a USA TODAY article, they singled out my  State of Oklahoma and said that we are not treating our veterans right.  We were in shock at that time. In fact, the article detailed some  really appalling things that were going on and were not going on in my  State of Oklahoma. There were things the inspector general reported  during the Obama administration that we had no way of knowing about.   We seem to have more veterans per capita in Oklahoma. One of the  reasons is we have five major military establishments, and Oklahoma is  a great place to live, so a lot of them retire there. They were not  getting the help they need, and they were not getting the treatment to  the highest standards that were available.   This isn't how we take care of veterans in Oklahoma. Senator Lankford  and I and two of the House Members worked on this and talked to  regional Veterans' Administration leadership. We talked to the  veterans. We talked to whistleblowers. And we identified three key  problems that we needed to fix. This is interesting because these are  three problems in my State of Oklahoma, but they would be the same  thing in Nebraska or any other State because it is not just in our  State of Oklahoma.   The first one was that the VA couldn't fire bad employees.   This is always a problem. You go into an organization and you find  that things are not going very well because there are one or two bad  employees. Yet it takes you a year before you are able to get rid of  these people. Despite having been identified, it takes forever to  terminate an employee.   Well, we fixed that this past summer when President Trump signed the  VA Accountability Act that included our language to allow the Secretary  of Veterans Affairs to immediately fire employees for misconduct or  poor performance. That was successful. We did it. That is history.   I have to say that during President Trump's administration so far, he  has used this firing authority on over 500 bad actors from the VA, and  we are finally creating a culture of accountability in the VA, which is  having positive results. That is the first reform.   The second one: Too many veterans were forced to receive care from VA  facilities that were hours away or didn't provide specialized care.   This is a problem. A lot of these veterans don't have the capability  to move around and get the care they need, and they didn't have the  choices. So we actually had to make a change, and we did. We worked  with the President and reauthorized the bipartisan VA Choice Program.   The VA Choice Program is great because it allowed our veterans to  actually, in those hard-to-reach areas, get high-quality healthcare,  regardless of where they had to travel to get it done. That was a  success.   Finally, after the USA TODAY article, we requested an accredited  third-party look at the problem at our VA facilities because previous  reports from the Obama Veterans Affairs inspector general failed to  identify and correct these problems. Well, my request was denied. It is  just like any bureaucracy. They don't want someone looking over their  shoulder, so they said: No, we are not going to allow you to have a  third party accompany the VA to look into the problem that you have.   Some are not aware of this, but in the Senate, when someone is  nominated, we can put a hold on them and not allow them to go through  confirmation--at least for a long period of time. At that time, the  President--our current President--had nominated a person to be the  inspector general of the Veterans' Administration. We put a hold on him  until they allowed someone to come in and monitor the evaluation that  the VA was doing of their own bureaucracy in Oklahoma. That worked,  except the problem with that is it was a one-time authorization. We  needed to make that a permanent part of our structure. I am pleased to  say we did that.    When we signed the Enhancing Veteran Care Act, it permanently granted  the VISN directors--that is one of the director levels of the VA--and  gave the medical center directors the authority to request, at their  request, an outside oversight in order to evaluate what they had done.  It has been very successful.   It is important for the regional directors to have the authority  because  [[Page S8205]]  they have the best idea of the reality of care at their facilities.   I appreciate the work of my colleagues, Senator James Lankford,  Congressman Markwayne Mullin, and Congressman Steve Russell. It turned  out to be a real good team, and we are able to get these things done.  We are already starting to see real progress in improving the veterans'  care in Oklahoma and across the country because as we are improving the  system we had in Oklahoma, that same system can be improved in Nebraska  or any other State.   We need to get our VA facilities from their current ratings to the  highest standard. The highest standard rating is five stars. We are now  up to three stars in Oklahoma. We were at one star when we first  discovered this problem on that fateful day 2 years ago today in an  article in USA TODAY.   President Trump will continue to be an important partner for Oklahoma  as we continue to improve our veterans' care.                            ____________________     Mr. President, President Trump's commitment to our  veterans is only matched by his commitment to our servicemembers and  our national security. You can't really segregate it out and say, well,  we are going to take care of our veterans' activities and then still  say we are not going to allow our country to have the national security  they fought so hard for.   We saw that earlier this week when the President outlined his  national security strategy, charting a new course for American foreign  policy, leaving behind the failed policies of the Obama administration.  With his national security strategy, President Trump has been clear  that he is committed to protecting the homeland, promoting American  prosperity, and advancing peace through strength. Have you ever heard  that before, peace through strength? I am one of the few who is old  enough around here who remember our great President we had who talked  about peace through strength when he had to rebuild the military after  the Carter administration. It was actually as bad--or as downgraded as  our military has become from the last administration.   Now he is asserting America's leadership in the free world. We saw  how under President Obama the military was forced to divert resources  for priorities that weren't even about defending America. He used the  military to advance his liberal agenda, which led to the wasteful  spending on what they call the green Navy and the green bullets. The  idea that climate change was the largest threat to our national  security, all of that has changed and not a moment too soon.   President Trump is focused on what matters, rightfully taking out  things like just worrying about climate change as opposed to rebuilding  our military, and he is building it at a very rapid rate right now.   We passed the bill, the Defense authorization bill, and we have made  a great start on this.   Now, when the President came into office, our military was facing a  readiness crisis, and Americans didn't really understand this. They  didn't know. They had not been told this. We had a biased media that  didn't allow this information to get out. As an example, our Air Force  today, right now, is short 1,500 pilots, and 1,300 of those are  actually fighter pilots. Only 50 percent of the Air Force squadrons are  trained and ready to conduct all of their assigned missions. I have to  repeat that. Only 50 percent of our Air Force squadrons are trained and  ready to defend America.   The Navy is the smallest and least ready it has been in years. It  currently can only meet 40 percent of the demand for regional combat.  The commanders in the field include only enough personnel to man six  and a half of our nine carrier air wing.   A carrier air wing is something a lot of people are not familiar  with. A carrier air wing has approximately 75 combat aircraft.  Currently, we have manned only 6\1/2\ wings and are 8,000 sailors  short.   This is an air wing. They have F-18s, they have EA-18s, they have F- 35s, they have C-2As. Again, just a little over half of ours are  actually ready. Well, that is the problem we are faced with right now.  More than half of the Navy's F-18s are grounded because they are  awaiting maintenance or lack of necessary parts. If you look at our  Marines, our Marines are using F-18s, and 62 percent of F-18s will not  fly. People are just shocked when they find out about it. It is because  we don't have the spare parts. Well, we are getting busy on that. We  are going to make sure we correct those problems.   The Army has said that only about one-third of their brigade combat  teams, one-fourth of their air aviation brigades, and one-half of their  division headquarters are currently ready.   A brigade combat team consists of 7 battalions, approximately 4,500  students. I wish I had time to come up with a chart on this, but the  carrier wing is one that is absolutely necessary to get folks straight,  and we plan on doing that.   Faced with the most dangerous threats I have seen in my lifetime,  these are critical gaps in our military we simply cannot accept.   I often say, when I look back at the good old days of the Cold War,  where we had two superpowers--and the superpowers, we knew what they  had, they knew what we had. It is totally different now.   You have a country like North Korea, which has demonstrated that they  have the capacity now to reach an American city. We learned that on  November 28, when they actually demonstrated a range that would reach  one of our continental U.S. cities.   They tried to give us a little bit of comfort in saying, well, we  don't know that they would be able to carry a warhead. We don't think  they would have the capacity to do that. Well, we don't know that. That  is not much comfort.   When they say: We don't have the capacity to be accurate on a reentry  because of what a missile has to go through on a reentry, well, that is  not very comforting that this would happen.   Anyway, the NDAA--the bill we passed, that the President signed into  law--would be a good step in correcting the readiness shortfalls. I  look forward to continuing to work with him on this critical process.   We have a committee that already is having hearings about the  problems we are having. We had one, actually, in the subcommittee  hearing I chaired just this week. We are busy correcting these  problems.   Meanwhile, back to our VA problems in Oklahoma, we put two new great  directors in the VA clinics. We have a level of veterans' care  Oklahomans are proud of. Only yesterday, President Trump signed the  Enhancing Veteran Care Act to ensure that we continue to give our  veterans the best care. They deserve it, and they are going to get it.   At the same time, we are going to restore and rebuild the military as  our Nation's No. 1 priority. Our troops deserve it, and they are going  to get it.   I yield the floor.
