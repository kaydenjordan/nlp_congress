 Mr. Speaker, this week marks 3 years since Russia  violated Ukraine's territorial integrity and illegally stole Crimea.   In 2014, the people of Ukraine peacefully decided to move closer to  the European Union and away from the Russian sphere of influence.  However, the Napoleon of Siberia would have none of it. Russian troops  invaded the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine. Little green men then invaded  two more regions in eastern Ukraine.   The Russian invasions have cost 10,000 Ukrainian lives, but Russia  has not stopped. Troops are pursuing a slow strategy to take more and  more territory in eastern Ukraine.   Russia has invaded a sovereign country and taken over its lands. Mr.  Speaker, what country is next?   The American people must stand with Ukraine and against the tyranny  of the Russian bear. It is time to stand up to Putin. He must pay a  price for his aggression. Sanctions against and isolation of the bear  are good places to start.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
