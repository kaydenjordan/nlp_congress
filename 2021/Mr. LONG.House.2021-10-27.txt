 Mr. Speaker, you hear a lot today about the gain of  dysfunction research.   Gain of dysfunction research is going on right here in Washington,  D.C., and I say it is time we put a stop to it. This gain of  dysfunction research leads us to all kinds of problems in our country  that we weren't facing before January 3 of this year and most  definitely before January 20 of this year.   Our friends across the aisle have proposed $5.5 trillion in new  spending, $2.1 trillion in new tax increases, the highest level of  spending and highest level of tax increases in history.   Now, they can say no one under $400,000 has to pay these new taxes,  but through the dysfunction of Congress and the White House, this gain  of dysfunction research must stop.   People under $400,000 are paying 42.1 percent more for gas. It is  kind of a status symbol today to be able to fill your tank up with gas.   Gas utilities are up 20.6 percent. I only wish in my hometown that is  all we were going to face this winter. Propane, kerosene, firewood are  up 27 percent.   The energy crisis, national average for gas up to $3.38.   And not to mention the dysfunction going on at our border, the worst  border crisis in 30 years, 192,000 in apprehensions.   I say it is time to end the state of dysfunction in Washington, D.C.  research.                            ____________________
