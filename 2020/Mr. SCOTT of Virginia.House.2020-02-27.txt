 Mr. Speaker, on Monday morning, our Nation  lost a truly brilliant mathematician and pioneer, Ms. Katherine Goble  Johnson.   While I knew Katherine and her family personally for many years, like  so many Americans, I never fully appreciated her work until her untold  story was revealed in the book and movie, ``Hidden Figures.''   She had a long and illustrious career at NASA, but also had a  tremendous impact on the Hampton Roads community that she called home.  She was president of Lambda Omega Chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha  Sorority, and she sang in the choir and served as a trustee at Carver  Memorial Presbyterian Church in Newport News.   She served as a role model for countless children; and while she did  not reach the stars like the astronauts whose trajectory she  calculated, in her career, she did.   We remember her as a true American hero, and I send my deepest  condolences to her family and all who were inspired by her remarkable  life and work.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that all Members join me and Congresswoman Luria,  who represents the Hampton area, the Virginia delegation, and others in  a moment of silence in honor of Ms. Katherine Goble Johnson.                            ____________________
