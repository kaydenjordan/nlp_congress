 Mr. Speaker, today I introduced legislation to honor  the life of a high school buddy of mine and a decorated Navy SEAL, Bill  Mulder. Bill was a true American hero who served our country with honor  and distinction.   Like many of our troops, Bill's greatest fight wasn't on the  battlefield; it was the struggle that often ensues from the mental,  emotional, and physical wear and tear from military service. On top of  that, people like Bill,  [[Page H3732]]  who spend their entire careers pursuing excellence as a warrior, often  wrestle with life back as a civilian.   The Transition Assistance Program can help prepare folks like Bill  for the challenges and opportunities of transitioning to civilian life,  to create a new sense of purpose, to equip them with the tools to be  successful in the marketplace, leveraging their unique experiences and  skills from their time in the armed services.   Named in honor of Bill Mulder, my legislation works to strengthen and  improve this program. We owe it to Bill and every veteran to make the  transition from Active Duty to civilian life more seamless and  successful, which I believe this legislation does.   God bless the Mulder family. God bless our troops. God bless America.                            ____________________
