 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``West Los Angeles VA Campus Improvement Act,'' which I introduced  today. Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA) is introducing companion  legislation in the House.                 Background on the West Los Angeles VA Campus    In 1888, the 388-acre campus that is now home to the West Los Angeles  VA Medical Center was deeded to the federal government by Arcadia  Bandini de Stearns Baker and Senator John P. Jones in order to  establish a home for disabled Civil War Veterans.   Until the 1970s, the land served primarily to house Veterans, and the  campus long represented the largest Veteran housing development in the  nation.   Unfortunately, in 1972, 2,800 Veterans living on the West LA VA  campus were displaced after the Sylmar Earthquake caused major damage  on campus. Rather than repair the housing units, the VA eventually  leased portions of the property to non-VA tenants.   Forty years later, homeless Veterans and advocates sued the VA for  illegally leasing facilities on campus and for failing to use the  property to support Veterans, as required by the original deed.   A U.S. District Court subsequently ruled that many leases on campus  were illegal under the terms of the original deed, and in 2015, the VA  agreed to facilitate the development of 1,200 housing units for  homeless Veterans on campus.   In 2016, Congress enacted legislation that I introduced with Senator  Barbara Boxer and Congressman Ted Lieu, entitled the ``West Los Angeles  Leasing Act of 2016,'' to set up an oversight framework for the housing  development and to ensure that lease revenues from ongoing leases  stayed on campus.                             Need for Legislation    In 2018, the VA selected a ``Principal Developer'' to complete  housing renovation and construction projects on campus, allowing for a  more streamlined and efficient building process.   However, the VA has determined that current law restricts it from  using on-campus lease revenues for housing construction, maintenance,  or services. The VA has determined that clarifying language is needed  to ensure that funds generated on campus can be used for these  purposes.   Giving VA the flexibility to use locally-generated revenue in this  way could significantly reduce the time it takes to get homeless  Veterans into housing.                                 Bill Summary    The ``West LA VA Campus Improvement Act'' would explicitly authorize  the VA to use any funds collected pursuant to leases, easements or  other use agreements at the West LA VA for the development of  supportive housing and services on campus.   The bill would also increase the time period for enhanced use leases  on the campus from 75 to 99 years. Increasing the length of the leases  would align with other leasing terms the VA has, and help reduce the  financing costs for new housing.                                  Conclusion    Last year, the regional homelessness count reported that more than  3,900 Veterans are experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. It is long  past time for this land to be returned to its intended purpose: to  serve as a home where Veterans can receive the care and treatment they  deserve.   This bill will help move us closer to that reality.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill. Thank you,  Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Wyden, and Mr.          Sanders):   S. 127.
