 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for the week to come, I yield to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader and my  friend.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        March 2, 2017, on page H1484, the following appeared:   Mr. Speaker, I yield to      The online version has been corrected to read:  Mr.  Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority  leader the schedule for the week to come, and I yield to    ========================= END NOTE =========================     (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    I thank the gentleman for that information.   The gentleman mentions the Defense Appropriations bill is going to be  brought forward. It is my understanding that the text was just  introduced this morning. Is that accurate?    Do you know when it will be marked up?   I yield to the gentleman from California.    Is the majority leader not aware of whether there will be  a markup on the bill or will it come directly to the floor through the  Rules Committee?    The gentleman just indicated that this will be the bill  that we passed last year.    So I am correct, then, that the bill will be the same bill  that we passed last year? Is that accurate?    The majority leader may not know, and I certainly  understand that. We will see what differences might exist. If there are  any substantive changes in the bill, we would hope that it would be  subjected to a hearing or at least a markup.   But the gentleman believes there is no substantive change. Is that  accurate?    I thank the majority leader for that observation.   I agree with the majority leader that subjecting the Defense  Appropriations or any other appropriation is not a tenable or  appropriate policy to pursue.   The gentleman knows we were for an omnibus being passed in 2016, as  an omnibus was passed in 2015, which, therefore, gives the  administrators of any agency or Secretaries of any agency the  opportunity to have the ability to plan over a period of time longer  than months.   So I certainly agree. But very frankly, I want to tell the majority  leader, on our side of the aisle we are very, very concerned that  privilege will be accorded to the defense bill.   Can the majority leader tell me whether or not we intend to adopt and  pass, in the regular order, individual bills--the Labor-Health bill,  the Interior bill, the Agriculture bill, et cetera, et cetera--in a  similar manner? That means considering them on their merits discretely,  separately, individually.   I yield to the gentleman from California.    I appreciate that, Mr. Leader, if that is your goal; and I  hope that, in fact, we can pursue that goal. Very frankly, we believe  that the scenario is being set up to take care of the defense bill.   I voted for the defense bill. I was one of those people. I intend to  vote for the defense bill next week when it comes to the floor, if, in  fact, as the gentleman represents, it is substantively the same as the  bill that we have already adopted.   What I am concerned about and what Members on my side of the aisle  are very concerned about is that the remaining nondefense discretionary  spending bills will be substantially altered from that which we would  have passed in December of last year in the 2017.   Of course, we were 4 months late doing that--or 3 months late, at  least: October, November, and December. But I am hopeful, Mr. Leader,  that those bills will, in fact, be considered discretely so that the  American public can see us vote on those bills and on the priorities  that are incorporated in those bills.   Mr. Leader, it appears that the majority has stalled somewhat in  their efforts in a path forward on repeal of the ACA. President Trump's  address on Tuesday, it seems to me, didn't offer many details. He does  say, however, that everybody is going to be covered--everybody--with  better health care,  [[Page H1485]]  cheaper. If that bill comes to the floor, I am going to vote for it,  Mr. Leader. I want you to know that. Health care for everybody-- quality, accessible, affordable, and cheaper.   Now, as the majority leader knows, the budget resolution that was  passed this year set a deadline of January 27 for committees to report  legislation repealing the law. It is now March 2, and there are  reports, Mr. Leader, that Republicans have a draft bill that perhaps is  located in H-157, that it is not being posted, and that Republicans  have been told they can view it in H-157.   I don't know that I have the room number correct, and I am not sure  that the information that I have is correct, but I will tell you that  Michael Burgess, or Dr. Burgess, on your side of the aisle said this.  He said it yesterday: People need to have access to this document-- apparently his presumption was he did not have access to the document  or he believed others should; not only Members of our side of the  aisle, but also the public--and if there are problems, let's talk  through them. It's been a long time in the works. Most of the pieces  that are in there, people have seen in the past, but it does need to be  an open process.   Mr. Leader, let me repeat that. It does need to be an open process,  according to Dr. Burgess.   Gus Bilirakis says: We're not having a hearing or anything. We're not  having a hearing or anything. But there'll be a place for us to view  it, the draft.   Paul Ryan, the Speaker, said, 3 days ago: We're going through the  committee process. We're doing this step by step. We're having public  hearings. We're having committee work on legislation. This is how the  legislative process is supposed to be designed. We are not hatching  some bill in a back room--perhaps H-157; he didn't say that, I said  it--and plopping it on the American people's front door.   Mr. Leader, you and I both were here when the Affordable Care Act was  passed. There was a lot of talk about the Affordable Care Act and how  it was passed in the dark of night. That was baloney, of course. We had  79 bipartisan hearings and markups over the 2 years that we considered  the Affordable Care Act. House Members spent nearly 100 hours in  hearings, heard from 181 witnesses from both sides of the aisle,  considered 239 amendments--both Democratic and Republican--and accepted  121 amendments.   The original House bill was posted online 30 days before the first  committee began their markup and more than 100 days before the  committee introduced their merged bill in the House. House Democrats  posted the House bill--that was the final process--online 72 hours  before the bill was brought to the floor, consistent with our rules.   Now, to my understanding, the Ways and Means Committee has been told  this bill is going to be marked up on Wednesday. There will not have  been a single hearing, there will not have been a single witness, and  Members cannot, on our side of the aisle--as I understand it--see the  bill today.   I don't know where all my Tea Party friends are who demanded full  consideration and that everybody read the bill. I don't see them out on  the lawn. I don't see them out on the plaza. I don't see them out on  the sidewalk as they were when we were considering the bill and we had  those 181 witnesses, the 100 hours of hearings that they thought  weren't sufficient.                                time  1130    I don't know whether they will think that having a markup next  Wednesday when the bill has not even been made available to Democratic  Members of the House. Apparently, Republican Members have to go to a  room to see it, and the public clearly has no idea of what that bill  is.   Mr. Leader, I hope you will tell me that I am wrong, that there will  be hearings consistent with what Speaker Ryan said 3 days ago. I hope  you will tell me, yes, we are going to honor what Speaker Ryan said,  that we are going to have those hearings, we are going to have  witnesses, and we are going to consider amendments.   All of us understand that this is one of the biggest issues  confronting the American people. We have had hundreds of thousands of  people showing up at town meetings saying how concerned they are, yet,  if my information is correct, Mr. Leader, they will have no opportunity  to talk to the Committee on Ways and Means.   I am further informed, and I hope the majority leader says this is  wrong, that the markup will occur before the Congressional Budget  Office has the opportunity to say how much it is going to cost. All  this weeping and gnashing of teeth about balanced budgets and fiscal  responsibility, a bill that affects 18 percent of the gross domestic  product, and the critical need for people to have access to affordable,  quality health care, not one of them will have an opportunity to know  how much this repeal will cost.   Again, Mr. Leader, I hope you are going to be able to tell me, no,  Mr. Whip, we are going to have hearings, we understand how important  this issue is, how much interest there is in this country, and we are  going to give time for serious consideration, and we are going to have  witnesses come before those hearings; and then after the witnesses, we  are going to have a markup after substantial debate and consideration  is allowed on both sides of the aisle.   I now yield to the majority leader with the hopes that he will be  able to give me some degree of confidence that Paul Ryan, our Speaker,  was correct, that we are going to follow regular order and make a  transparent consideration of this piece of legislation.   I yield to my friend.    I have some more.    I thank the gentleman for his comment. It is, therefore,  extraordinarily sad that we have spent 6 years with only one option  that the majority would pursue: repeal. Not fix, not make it work  better, not ensure that people can afford their care, not make sure  that insurance companies had the competence to stay in the market  because the market was destabilized for all of its lifetime to date by  the Republicans saying all we are going to do is repeal.   The gentleman talks about the cost. The gentleman cannot tell me some  4  [[Page H1486]]  days before he suggests passing a piece of legislation that will affect  18 percent of our gross domestic product what it will cost. Why?  Because he has no score from the CBO. He can tell me all he wants about  6 years of waiting and listening. He has no score on this bill. My  judgment is he will have no score when he marks it up. By the way, he  will give no access, contrary to Speaker Ryan saying that we are going  to go regular order. I reject, with all due respect, Mr. Majority  Leader, the fact that we had a hearing a year ago or 2 years ago or 3  years ago, that the opinion that was given at those times by various  witnesses who differed on their conclusions, that we can apply that to  the bill that you have introduced now.   I don't know what the bill you have introduced is. I don't know  whether you have introduced it or somebody else has introduced it. I  don't even know whether it exists. I told the gentleman what I am told.  He has not disabused me of any of the assertions I made. He has  not disabused me that it is not available publicly. He has not  disabused me of the fact that we can't see it. He has not disabused me  of Dr. Burgess saying it ought to be seen by everybody and considered,  it should not be in a secret room someplace that people have to go to,  like it is a secret document. We have to go down to the Capitol Visitor  Center in the secure facilities of the Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence to see secret documents. Surely that is not the standard  that we are giving to a bill that will have such, in my view,  catastrophic effect on individuals, on jobs, and on businesses.    Mr. Speaker, I want to tell the majority leader that I do not accept  the proposition that a hearing over 6 years about repeal only--and I am  not sure how many hearings there were. Maybe the majority leader knows.  But I know for a fact that proponents of the bill were very difficult  to get on the list of witnesses that we wanted to testify at some of  those hearings. The American people, the Tea Party, all those people  for and against who came to these town meetings should really lament.  And, frankly, I think that the Speaker's representation is not being  followed. The assertion that it was done last year, the year before, we  have a lot of new Members in this Congress who weren't here. Frankly,  when we have bills introduced in Congress, we usually have hearings on  them. That is the regular order.   Now, we haven't been following regular order on all these  congressional review acts, Mr. Leader, so maybe the precedent nowadays  is forget about hearings because most of the bills that we have  considered during this Congress have not had hearings. The  ramifications of the repeal of these rules no one knows. There were no  hearings on those. Frankly, we didn't have hearings on those year after  year after year in the past. So, Mr. Leader, it appears that the  representation you are making is we know all about this, we don't need  hearings, we have been talking about this stuff forever, we are just  going to act. The courage, I would suggest to my friend, the courage  would be to expose these to full and fair and open debate. That would  be the courage.   Now, Mr. Leader, unless you want to respond to that, I will move on  to a different subject.    Mr. Leader, you can be assured that history will show  that. Can I see the bill today?    In other words, they will mark it up before anybody in the  public, including a Member of the House of Representatives----    Before then, we cannot see it.    Is that what the gentleman is telling me?   I yield to my friend.    Mr. Leader, reclaiming my time, that is not regular order.  I have been here a long time. You have been here a long time. That is  not regular order. Regular order is you introduce a bill, you go up to  this desk, and you put a bill in. We don't follow that very much, but  that is regular order. It is then printed. It is referred to a  committee. The public can see it as soon as it is printed. It goes to  the committee. They establish a hearing. The witnesses then come before  the committee and testify as to its positive and negative aspects. The  committee then schedules a markup. It may even be the same day after  the hearing, I get that. And then they mark it up. But the bill has  been given to the public and to Members, invariably under regular  order, substantially before that happens.   You are telling me, as I understand it, Mr. Leader, I cannot see the  bill today, 5 days before it is scheduled to be marked up. Is that  accurate?   I yield to my friend.    Is the leader telling me that he does not know personally  whether a markup is scheduled on the Affordable Care Act repeal next  week?   I yield to my friend.                                time  1145     I thank the gentleman, but that was not my question,  whether the chairman of the committee knows. Maybe the gentleman does  not know, in which case he can say no.   My question is: Does the gentleman know whether a markup is scheduled  for next week in the Ways and Means Committee on the repeal of the  Affordable Care Act?   I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I don't know whether that is a ``yes'' or a  ``no'' or ``I don't intend to tell you,'' but it certainly does not  tell me whether the majority leader knows that.   I would suggest to the chairman of the committee, though, Mr.  Speaker, that the majority leader ought to be informed of what the  committee is doing on such an important issue.  [[Page H1487]]    I am just informed that while the majority leader may not know, The  Hill newspaper knows and says: ObamaCare reconciliation markup on track  for next week.   They, perhaps, heard the same rumor I have heard, Mr. Leader.    I ask you: Do you expect the Budget Committee to have a  hearing on it?   I yield to my friend.    I thank the gentleman.   I will close on this subject, unless the majority leader would like  to make a comment. He does know I like quotes.   Mr. Leader, you said the following:         This bill is being pushed through because the majority in       the Congress refuse to listen to the people.    You said that on March 2, 2010. You were referring, of course, to us  Democrats who refused to listen to the American people, because your  presumption was the American people was not for the proposition we were  promoting.   There were two candidates for President who got major votes in this  election. One was Hillary Clinton, who said: I want to keep the  Affordable Care Act. And one was Donald Trump, who said: I want to get  rid of the Affordable Care Act. Although, he has said then and now that  he wants to have everybody covered at a cheaper price with assured  benefits. As I said, we would support a bill like that.   Of those two candidates that were running, one got 65 million votes  and one got 62 million votes. Now, the one who got 62 million votes won  the election. Why? Because of the electoral college. He is the  legitimate elected President of the United States. I do not question  that at all. But it ought to give some degree of humility that he got 3  million less votes than the person that espoused policies other than  those espoused by President Trump. It ought to give some pause to let  the American people into the process and testify.   I will tell the gentleman that what the Republican Party is  recommending in repeal of the ACA will have very substantial  consequences. You may think they are positive, I may think they are  negative, but I hope neither one of us think that that won't have very  substantial consequences for our country. In that context, we ought to  have allowed, and we ought to allow, the people of this country to  testify on those consequences.   Again, I will move on, unless the gentleman wants to make an  additional comment.   I yield to my friend.    There are so many comments I could make in response to  that.   No one today on this floor is questioning the legitimacy of President  Trump's Presidency--period. What I said was that more people voted for  the candidate who wanted to keep the ACA than voted for the candidate  who wanted to repeal the ACA.   Secondly, if the gentleman refers to the polls of his quote in 2010,  then I can refer to the polls today, which show that the majority of  respondents believe that the ACA should be retained until and unless an  acceptable replacement is provided.   The gentleman talks about 6 years. Not once in those 6 years, not  once, has the majority party offered a comprehensive replacement for  the Affordable Care Act. They have talked about it.   By the way, on the 26-year-olds and on the preexisting conditions,  the repeal bills didn't say we were going to keep the preexisting  conditions or the 26 age or the lifetime limits or the annual limits or  the drug discounts for senior citizens. It didn't say any of that. It  said repeal the ACA.   So the polling data today, Mr. Speaker, is that more people want to  keep the ACA prior to the consideration and adoption of a replacement  than want to repeal it. I agree with you, that is a change from 2010.  And the reason it is a change is because they are now looking at it  very carefully. They are figuring out what, in fact, it has done for  them and their families and for their children who had preexisting  conditions and for their access to affordable health care, and they are  saying: We are taking a second look.   They do not now reflect that poll to which the gentleman referred  that is now 7 years old and, very frankly, last year's poll. Now they  look at it differently.   I yield to my friend.    Well, I think that is some degree of clarity in terms of  the markup, and no hearing, no witnesses, and I presume no CBO score to  tell us how much that legislation is going to cost.   Now, Mr. Leader, two things. One is certainly less global and  impactful,  [[Page H1488]]  but, nevertheless, important. I am sure the gentleman met with the  Governors when they were in town, as I did. They met on a bipartisan  basis. I met with a lot of the Republican Governors and Democratic  Governors together.   They are very concerned, as you know, not only about the ACA--which  we talked about, which they have great concerns of the impact on their  States, Republicans and Democrats, of the repeal of the Medicaid  expansion, in particular, the impact it will have on them and their  people--but they also are very concerned about the Marketplace Fairness  Act.   That is simply, frankly, trying to protect small businesses so that  they can compete, the local mom and pop store can compete with the  online vendors so that everybody would have to pay the sales tax,  whatever the State sales tax is. That bill, I believe, enjoys the  majority support in this House. I think it has enjoyed the majority  support since it passed the Senate pretty handedly.   Does the gentleman know whether or not that bill is going to be  considered at any point in time in the near term?   I yield to my friend.    Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my friend, the  majority leader, that I look forward to working with him. I see that he  recently observed that the attorney general ought to recuse himself in  dealing with issues of the relationship between the administration  during the course of the campaign and Russia, which the intelligence  community has said interfered in America's election.   All of us ought to be concerned about that--a foreign government  interfering in our democracy; particularly, a government that is  hostile to our interests; particularly, a government led by Mr. Putin,  who has committed international crimes, who, contrary to international  law, invaded Crimea, still holds Crimea inconsistent with international  law, and has been sanctioned. Hopefully, those sanctions will stay in  place.   I agree with the gentleman that, at the very least, the attorney  general ought to recuse himself. I have asked him to step down.    But we need to have, Mr. Speaker, an independent bipartisan  commission with subpoena power, similar to the 9/11 Commission, for the  security of our country and, yes, for the confidence building for our  President to see what, in fact, were the relationships between his  campaign and Russia and to what extent Russia involved itself in trying  to impact on the elections of the United States.   I don't have anything further to say. Unless the gentleman wants to  say something, I will yield back.   I yield to my friend.    I thank the majority leader for his comments.   Let me say that I was very disappointed to learn that Mr. Nunes, at  the request of the administration, talked to members of the press  before the investigations have occurred, before they have heard a  single witness, to say that he really thought this was not a matter  that really needed careful consideration. That is not a quote. I  characterized what I read his comment to mean to the press.   In addition, I understand the Department of Homeland Security was  also requested, and the FBI, to talk to the press to tamp down interest  in those. The American people need to be very concerned about these  issues. Every Member of this Congress, a separate and coequal branch of  the Government of the United States, ought to be very concerned about  that.   The Bible says that the truth will set us free. And the truth will  give us confidence. And the truth should be known by the American  people.   The problem I have with the Intelligence Committee is that the  Intelligence Committee--most of the information they gather is not  available to the public. I don't know what they will do moving forward.   But we found in the 9/11 Commission a perfect example of a commission  equally divided with two extraordinarily respected co-chairs that got  to the bottom and made significant recommendations, most of which-- almost all of which--were adopted in a bipartisan fashion by this  Congress.   So, Mr. Speaker, I would hope that we would pursue that not in lieu  of the Intelligence Committee--not in lieu of the Intelligence  Committee--but in addition to.   Benghazi, we had seven committees, and you thought on your side of  the aisle that wasn't enough, so you spent some $4 million on an  additional special committee to find exactly the same conclusion.   So, in this case I do not oppose the work of the Intelligence  Committee, but I certainly believe the American people would expect and  would want a similar bipartisan commission as they saw work on the 9/11  tragedy to give them the confidence that Russia is not in any way  undermining the independence of our government or undermining the  democracy that we hold so dear.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
