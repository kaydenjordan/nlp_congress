 Madam President, reserving the right to object, the  Senate has a lot of very important work to do. We have been out a  couple of weeks, and it is time to get back to work. Senator Schumer,  yesterday--or this past week--sent the Democratic caucus a long to-do  list that includes keeping the government open, which is very  important; our annual Defense bill, which is very important; addressing  prescription drugs, which we are all very concerned about; the farm  bill. There are a lot of other things that we have got to address in  this caucus, in this room. Missing from that list was military  nominations.   This is my 11th time standing up here and continuing to harp on the  fact that we need to do something about this new policy that the  Secretary of Defense has passed down and passed to the military. So far  this year, dozens of lower level military nominations have passed  through unanimous consent, but a number of important nominations are  pending or will soon be pending.   General Smith's, as the Senator just brought up, is one of the most  important. I have got a great deal of admiration for General Smith.   Earlier today, General Smith became the acting head of the Marine  Corps. He is doing the same exact job which he has been doing for  several years. The only difference is that today he is an acting  official. This has minimal effect on his ability to lead.   There may be a delay in his planning guidance, and he cannot yet move  into the Commandant's residence. But there is little doubt about  General Smith's ability to lead effectively, even now. There is little  doubt that soon he will be confirmed.   I have met with General Smith. I have got great respect and  admiration for what he has done. General Smith has dedicated nearly  four decades to the Marine Corps. He has got a record to be very proud  of. During our meeting, General Smith assured me that he was committed  to keeping politics out of the military. And for me to vote for  somebody, that is exactly what I am looking for: keep politics out of  the military.   The Marine Corps has done an excellent job of staying mission- focused. One result is, because of that, the marines are the only  branch that is meeting its recruiting goals. I believe that the Marine  Corps is in good hands now with General Smith.   But if Chairman Reed and the Democrats are so concerned, let's vote.  That is all I keep asking for. Let's vote on these nominees.   This week, the Senate will consider a DOJ nomination for an office  that has around 20 employees--20 employees. I agree that this is an  important nomination, but surely the Commandant of the Marine Corps is  more important. So if the Democrats are so worried about General Smith  being an acting official, then let's vote. I keep asking for that.  Let's vote and clear this up.   With that, I object.    Mr. President, ROTC programs are critical  source of leadership for our Armed Forces. ROTC programs also change  people's lives. A perfect example is MSG Donna Johnson of Birmingham,  who began her military career in ROTC at Jackson-Olin High School.   She says that after joining the ROTC, she knew that she was meant to  be a soldier. The idea of serving those in need motivated Donna to join  Alabama's National Guard full-time. She faithfully represented our  State and country across the world, including stops in Iraq and Kuwait  as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. While stationed in Kuwait, Donna  was asked to sing the national anthem for her fellow servicemembers  after her commander noticed her gift of singing. She cites this as one  of her most memorable experiences during her 38 years in the Guard.   Donna continues to share her love of America through song at various  events across Alabama, including Veterans Day ceremonies, school  assemblies, and athletic events. Donna also generously invests her time  in Alabama's next generation of leaders by mentoring in the Birmingham  City Schools' ``Common Ground'' program. She serves as a positive role  model for young women ages 12-14, encouraging them to rise above  challenging circumstances, stay in school, and respect themselves and  others.   We are blessed to have Donna serving the people of our great State,  and I am proud to recognize her as the July Veteran of the  Month.                            ____________________
