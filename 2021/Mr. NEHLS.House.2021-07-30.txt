 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Rock and  Roll Hall of Famer and ZZ Top member, Dusty Hill.   Dusty was born and raised in Dallas, Texas, and began playing bass at  the age of 13. Embarrassment on stage was a great motivator for Dusty,  and he soon mastered the bass. From 1966 to 1968, Dusty played with his  brother, Rocky Hill, and future ZZ Top bandmate, Frank Beard, in the  Dallas-based band, American Blues.   In 1970, wanting to focus more on rock and roll and less on blues,  Dusty moved to Houston and joined ZZ Top with Frank Beard and Billy  Gibbons. The trio performed their first concert together just outside  of my district at the Knights of Columbus in Beaumont, Texas, on  February 10, 1970.   The trio would stay together for the next 50 years, releasing  numerous hits and entertaining tens of millions of fans across the  world.   I know Dusty is missed greatly. And, Frank, I know you are watching.  I spoke to Debbie this morning. But Dusty will live on together as a  staple of Texas and in rock and roll history.                            ____________________
