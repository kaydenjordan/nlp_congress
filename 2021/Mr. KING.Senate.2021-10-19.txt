 Mr. President, with regard to the comments of the esteemed  Senator from Texas, I say to the Senator: I would suggest, if your  colleagues are interested in election reform and election laws, that we  have a dialogue and that we have some discussion. I would welcome a  proposal from your side of the aisle on election laws and how we deal  with efforts to suppress the vote in other parts of the country, and  also to change the Electoral Count Act.   Is the Senator interested in those and entering into such  discussions?    Not to prolong the discussion, but Article I, Section 4 of  the Constitution makes it abundantly clear that the responsibility for  election administration is a joint one between the States and the  Congress, and that the Congress, at any time, can alter regulations or  the efforts to control the vote in a particular State.   That has been true ever since the drafting of the Constitution. It  was true at the time of passage of the 15th Amendment. It was true at  the time of the passage of the Voting Rights Act.  [[Page S7046]]    So I look forward to the possibility of working with any colleague on  protecting the sacred right to vote in this country.   I will have further comments on this legislation today.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, the United States of America is an anomaly  in world history. We are a 245-year experiment in self-government,  which is based upon an idea that was radical in 1776. It was tested at  Gettysburg, Antietam, Shiloh, and the Wilderness. It was defended at  Anzio, Iwo Jima, and Normandy, and was reaffirmed in 1965. It is an  idea that the people--all the people--are the ultimate source of power  and can govern themselves through their elected representatives. That  was a radical notion in 1776.   The historical norm is just the opposite--kings; pharaohs; dictators;  czars; warlords; emperors; and, more recently, presidents for life.  Throughout most of human history, and right up to the present day, in  most countries, the people have little or no say in the decisions that  determine their fate. And these rulers are rarely, if ever, beneficent.  In fact, again, the historical norm is just the opposite--pervasive  corruption, the pursuit of power for its own sake, the crushing of  dissent, sham elections, and the abuse or even elimination of anyone  not sufficiently loyal or useful to the leader. That is the historical  norm.   There is nothing surprising about this because it reflects human  nature. History fairly shouts at us that power corrupts, and absolute  power corrupts absolutely.   Given the consistent history of this experience--of warlords,  dictators, czars, and the abuse of their authority--it is clear that  what we are doing, this experiment, is fragile. It is not the norm. It  is an anomaly. What we have and take for granted is in no way  guaranteed. As has been the case for democratic experiments throughout  history, it can fail. Rarely can it fail from external attack. Almost  always, democratic experiments fail from erosion from within.   On the surface, our democratic system protects us by resting upon our  ingenuous Constitution, the primary purpose of which is to establish an  effective government while at the same time dividing and dispersing  power, and in Madison's evocative phrase: Obliging the government to  control itself.   And of all the safeguards built into the Constitution--and there are  many; two Houses of Congress, vetoes, division of the war power, advise  and consent, enumerated powers, Federalism, the Bill of Rights--of all  of those protections, the most fundamental and essential is regular  elections, the clearest expression of the people's will.   For most of my life, I have not really thought much about how  elections actually work. You go to the town office or the school gym,  they cross your name off on a list, hand you a ballot, and you go into  a booth and make your  [[Page S7083]]  choice. You then put the marked ballot into a box or hand it to a  clerk--usually it is a volunteer doing their civic duty in my  hometown--and then they run it through a counter. Or you can get a  mail-in ballot from your town clerk, mark it at home and send it in. Or  in my town you can drop it in a drop box anytime of the night or day.  It is out in the front of the town office.   That is it until later that night, when the results--either from  automatic counters or from hand counting the ballots themselves--are  announced, precinct by precinct, town by town, city by city, and State  by State.   And then you go to bed, happy or unhappy, energized or discouraged,  either reveling in the victory of your preferred candidates or  determined to work harder next time. And thanks to the Framers, there  always is a next time, usually in 2 years hence.   The next day, you go about your business trusting--trusting--that the  system was operating according to the rules and that the announced vote  count accurately reflects the preference of you and your fellow  citizens. The key word is ``trust.''   The miraculous result of this entire process is something we  completely take for granted but is exceedingly rare--exceedingly rare-- in human history: the peaceful transfer of power, whether it is the  city council, the Congress, or the Presidency itself.   But two interrelated things are happening right now with regard to  this system that are unprecedented in my lifetime and have caused me to  worry as I never have before about the future of my country. These two  things are profoundly dangerous to our fragile Republic.   One is the breakdown of trust in the system itself and the other is  an overtly partisan attempt to use this loss of trust as a pretext to  change the results of future elections by limiting the participation of  voters deemed unworthy--although that is rarely said out loud--or  unlikely to vote for your particular political party.   This discussion is usually framed in terms of election integrity--the  prevention of widespread voter fraud--which it is argued is tainting  the outcome of our elections.   Unfortunately, these so-called election integrity measures almost  invariably end up limiting the participation of a substantial number of  voters, many of whom have historically been denied the right to vote by  one device or another for over 100 years. It is limiting that  participation either as inadvertent collateral damage or, more likely,  as stone-cold partisan voter suppression.   When I used to interact with the main legislature either as a private  citizen for many years or as Governor, the inevitable first question  from the chair of the committee was: What is the problem we are trying  to solve here? You want to change the law; what is the problem we are  trying to solve? In this case, is the problem really voter fraud, or is  it election results the party in power in a particular State doesn't  like?    The implicit burden that this question puts upon those who would  change a law is to demonstrate by some reasonable and credible evidence  that there is a problem in the first place. And simply saying--or  endlessly repeating--that there is a problem doesn't make it so. To put  it another way, repeating a lie doesn't make it true.   Every objective study to try to detect widespread voter fraud in this  country has failed to produce credible evidence of anything but  scattered and vanishingly rare cases. I am not saying it doesn't exist,  but they are scattered and vanishingly rare cases.   Even the overtly partisan so-called ``audit'' of the votes in  Maricopa County, AZ, failed to find what they were so desperately  looking for--failed to find what they were so desperately looking for.   The key question is not whether such fraud exists at all but whether  it is so widespread as to change the results of an election involving a  substantial number of voters.   In the wake of the 2016 election, the President convened a commission  to assess this very question, but the commission was disbanded within 8  months with no published finding of significant election fraud  whatsoever. That was their mission--to find fraud--and they couldn't  find it.   Further, as I mentioned, I know of no objective study that has ever  concluded that such widespread fraud exists anywhere in our country.   Even more compelling is that in spite of Herculean efforts by the  former President and his supporters over the course of the months  following the 2020 election, no credible evidence has yet been produced  to support his allegations, and all of the allegations have been  rejected by every court--more than 60. They have been rejected by every  court that has considered it. The only fraud here is the allegations  themselves.   In other words, not only is there no evidence of substantial fraud,  what evidence there is reaches the opposite conclusion. But here is the  problem; here is what is chilling. Fully, one-third of Americans and  two-thirds of members of the Republican Party now believe that the 2020  Presidential election was not legitimate, that there was widespread  fraud, and that the election was somehow stolen--not based upon  evidence, because there isn't any, but based upon the repeated  assertions of the former President and his supporters.   The problem with this goes well beyond the wave of voter suppression  legislation that is sweeping the country. The deeper problem is the  massive and unprecedented erosion of trust in the electoral system  itself, the beating heart of our democracy. Of all the depravations of  the former President, this is by far the worst.   In relentlessly pursuing his narrow self-interest, he has grievously  wounded democracy itself. And, by the way, I mean ``narrow self- interest'' quite literally. He doesn't give the slightest damn about  any of us, about any of us in this body. He will cast any or all of us  aside whenever it suits his needs of the moment. Everyone in this room  knows this to be true.   The reason this is so destructive is that if you can't trust  elections, what are your options? What are your options for making the  transcendent decisions upon which our society is based?   One is to change the rules to discourage your perceived enemies from  voting. Check--that is in the works.   Another is to change the rules to give partisan legislators the power  to override election results they don't like. Check--also in the works.   Another is to contrive pseudo legal arguments to justify the  corruption of the counting of electoral votes and then to pressure the  Vice President, who presides over the counting of the electoral votes,  to join in the scheme. Check--we now know this was very much in the  works in the days leading up to January 6.   Or, finally, tragically, try to change the results if you don't trust  elections through violence or threats of violence. Check--January 6 and  death threats to election officials of both parties across the country.   January 6 was not a random day on the calendar. It was the day  appointed by law to finalize the results of the November election. Many  of those who came to Washington that day were not there to protest but  were there with the explicit purpose of disrupting and stopping this  crucial final step in our democratic process.   The rallying cry that day was not ``protest the steal.'' It was  ``stop the steal.'' And that is exactly what was attempted in this room  on January 6.   It is important to remember that most failures of democracy, as we  look at history, started with legitimate elections. But once in office,  the leader manipulated the electoral process to consolidate their hold  on power, just as was attempted last winter. And once power is seized,  the control and reach of the modern surveillance state is truly  terrifying, truly terrifying. Ask the Uighurs in China or members of  the opposition in Russia, if you can find any alive.   Russia, Turkey, Venezuela, and Hungary are all examples of the slide  from democracy into authoritarianism that has happened just in our  living memory, just in our lifetimes. This is not a theoretical threat.  We have seen it already happen in our lifetimes. Those countries still  have elections, but they don't mean much.   And what if the current wave of voter suppression legislation  succeeds and keeps tens or hundreds of thousands of  [[Page S7084]]  people from voting in 2022 or 2024? Or what if in 2024 a partisan  legislature in a swing State--and they are giving themselves this power  right now--votes to override the election results in their State and  send their own preferred set of electors to Washington? Then it won't  just be Republicans who distrust elections, and we will be left with a  downward spiral toward a hollow shell of democracy, where only raw  power prevails and a peaceful transfer becomes a distant memory.    There has been a great deal of talk in recent weeks and months of a  possible constitutional crisis in 2022 or 2024. We don't have to wait  that long. We are in the midst of such a crisis right now. One of our  great political parties has embraced the idea that our last election  was fraudulent, that our current President is illegitimate, that they  must move legislatures across the country to ``fix'' the results--to  ``fix'' the results--of future elections.   Here is the part that I think is the most tragic. A substantial  portion of our population has lost faith in our democratic system  because they have been repeatedly told that something important was  stolen from them, even though that is untrue. And that portion of our  population seems prepared to accept some version of authoritarianism.  All but the most extreme sources of information have been devalued, and  violence bubbles just below the surface.   But it doesn't have to be this way. We in this body, perhaps more  than anyone else in this country, have the power to change direction,  to pull our country back from the brink, and to begin the work of  restoring our democracy, as we did in the Revolution, as we did in the  Civil War, and as we did in the civil rights struggles of 60 years  ago--first, by simply telling the truth and then by enacting a set of  basic protections of the sacred right to vote.   It won't be easy, and it will involve risk. I am aware of that. I  understand that. It will be particularly difficult when we are asked to  speak hard truths that many of our most ardent supporters don't want to  hear. But the alternative is worse, worse even than losing your job in  this body. The alternative is the loss of our identity as a people, the  loss of the miracle of self-government, the loss of the idea of  America.   I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that we are at a hinge of  history, that circumstances have thrust us--those of us in this body-- into a moment when the fate of the American experiment hangs in the  balance.   We are the heirs and trustees--I emphasize ``trustees''--of a  tradition that goes back to Jefferson and Lincoln, to Webster, Madison,  Margaret Chase Smith, and, yes, our friend John McCain. All of them  were partisans in one way or another, but all shared an overriding  commitment to the idea that animates the American experiment, the idea  that our government is of, by, and for the people--all the people.   Lincoln thought that the most important word in the Declaration of  Independence was ``all.'' ``All men are created equal''--all, all the  people.   Now is the moment that we are called upon to reach beyond our region,  our State, our party, ourselves to save and reinvigorate the sputtering  flame of the American idea.   Yes, democracy is an anomaly in world history. We have to remember  that what we have is unusual. It is rare, and it is fragile. It rests  upon the Constitution and laws, to be sure, but it also rests even more  on the trust our people place in our democratic system and in us.   Deliberately undermining that trust for short-term political  advantage, which is exactly what is happening right now--undermining  that trust for political advantage in the short term is exactly what is  happening right now--is a tragic and dangerous game.   No election, no endorsement, no Senate seat, no Presidency is worth  it. Nothing is worth destroying what our forebears fought and died  for--nothing.   Several weeks ago, a bipartisan group of us went to Gettysburg and  walked the battlefield with two leaders from the Army War College. I  have been there before but have never been so moved by the experience  as I was on this trip. The stories of valor and supreme sacrifice--the  20th Maine on Little Round Top, you know that I would mention that; the  1st Minnesota at the exposed center of the Union line; the Iron Brigade  on the first day; the colossal losses on both sides, unimaginable  losses on both sides in a matter of 3 days--were a sobering reminder of  what it took to preserve this country.   But we learned something else that day--that it was a near thing. If  a Union officer named Strong Vincent had hesitated in moving those  three regiments to the top of Little Round Top, or if an officer from  Minnesota named William Colvill had hesitated in leading the 1st  Minnesota on a suicidal charge--82-percent casualties, a suicidal  charge--into the teeth of the Confederate advance, our country would  have been lost. It was a near thing. It never had struck me so hard as  it did at Gettysburg several weeks ago.   And so it is today--a near thing--only, the test is not on the  battlefield, and no one here is being asked to give up their lives. We  are simply being asked to tell the truth, to recommit to the ideal of  democracy, to keep faith with our history and our inheritance. And if  we hesitate, all could be lost. This is not speculation. All could be  lost.   And we now know from the events of January 6 and the relentless  attempts to subvert the results of the 2020 election in the last days  of the prior administration, it was and still is a near thing.   That is what is so chilling and frightening. As it is in the old  Protestant hymn I remember from my youth, so it is today:         Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide.    I believe that this is that moment for each of us. The concluding  words of Lincoln in his message to Congress in the dark winter of 1862  have never been more apt. They are eerily applicable to us today. Here  is what Abraham Lincoln said:         Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this       Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite       of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance,       can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which       we pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the       latest generation.    In honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. Indeed, destiny has  placed us here at one of history's fateful moments. Our response to it  will be our most important legacy. Of all the other things that we have  done, this moment will be our most important legacy.   I believe we all know our responsibility. And whether we like it or  not, history will record whether we--each one of us--meets that  responsibility. Madam President, may God, working through each of us,  save the United States of America.   I yield the floor.
