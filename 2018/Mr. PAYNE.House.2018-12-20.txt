 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the students,  faculty, staff, and friends of Linden Public Schools in New Jersey for  spreading holiday cheer while helping those in need.   Each year, members of the Linden Public Schools load into buses with  Santa Claus and travel through their town to sing carols and collect  donations for a charity gift drive.   Staff and students put their hearts into planning the event, which  they call Caroling for a Cause. This year, they collected more than  1,000 gifts from across the community. Those gifts will help bring  smiles to the faces of more than 300 children.   Mr. Speaker, this is the season of giving, and the Linden Public  Schools are leading by example.   I thank the students, faculty, and staff who participated. And I  applaud Superintendent Danny Robertozzi for supporting Caroling for a  Cause.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing everyone who  participated. They are helping make sure their friends and their  neighbors in need have a Merry Christmas and happy holidays.                            ____________________
