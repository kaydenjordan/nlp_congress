 Mr. Speaker, it is an important day for people who knew  and loved the three individuals who were being held improperly by North  Korea. They have now been released due to the negotiations with our  prior colleague Mike Pompeo--our, now, Secretary of State--and also  President Trump.   It is interesting, Mr. Speaker, for those who have not spent a lot of  time studying American history, they have not realized what a benefit  it can be to have an American President who is deemed to be a person  who cannot be properly accounted for. His actions may be of interest to  foreign leaders.   Frankly, I enjoy hearing people in other countries say they are just  not sure what to make of President Trump. They are not sure if he is  crazy; they are not sure if he might push the button to launch  missiles; they are just--he is so unpredictable. But, actually, I think  he is very predictable. The man knows how to negotiate.   As I pointed out to him a couple of times, if you look through our  history, people who were considered to be the most educated, some said  the highest intellect, greatest intellectual ability--you have people  like John Quincy Adams, who is a hero of mine because of his dedication  to bringing an end to slavery. It didn't happen during his 4 years of  being President. It didn't happen during his 16, 17 years in the House  of Representatives, but he was so dedicated to his purpose that he  materially affected the young freshmen who sat at the back of the room  for 2 years, overlapping about a year with Adams before his fatal  stroke on the House floor just down the hall.   John Quincy Adams, when he was President, for all his education,  intellectual ability, I mean, the man wrote books in German, loved the  French language, read books in other languages like French and German,  probably kept the best journal of anyone who was ever elected  President, but he really didn't accomplish much of anything at all when  he was President. Some of that had to do with the election controversy  surrounding that.   Look at people like Woodrow Wilson, a former college president,  supposedly high intellectual ability, but, yes, he did get us involved  in World War I. He drug his feet. There were things that could have  been done, but nobody had any concern worldwide for Woodrow Wilson. He  was considered very predictable, and it got us into some trouble  because people didn't think he had the nerve to stand up when it was  needed.    Jimmy Carter was touted as being some sort of nuclear engineer, went  to the Naval Academy, but the fiascos in which he was involved as  President showed a man who was a nice man but rather inept when it came  to foreign affairs. Obviously, the Iranians had no fear of him. He had  such poor judgment that he encouraged the removal of the Shah of Iran.  Not a nice man, but he was an ally. And Carter didn't have the  foresight to see, kind of like President Obama when he was dealing with  Qadhafi--Obama with Qadhafi, Carter with the Shah of Iran, they figure:  Well, he is not a nice guy, so we will run him off. We will encourage  him being run off.   In the case of Qadhafi, if it weren't for Obama's planes and the  missions to take out those defending Qadhafi, Qadhafi would probably  still be in charge in Libya, and ISIS and al-Qaida elements would not  have gained the incredible foothold they have had. There wouldn't be  the chaos there is today in Libya.   President Obama was touted as being of high intellectual capacity,  yet just one fiasco after another when it came to foreign affairs as we  have seen in the news recently, President Obama's efforts to get $100  billion to $150 billion, some of it on pallets with just cash, American  dollars on pallets with forklifts, moving those from the United States  into the hands of the Ayatollah Khamenei and his bloodthirsty religious  zealots in Iran, the biggest supporter of terrorism in the world. So  deemed to be an intellectual President Obama was, and yet just  incredible malfeasance when it came to foreign relations. People were  not afraid of him.   It was interesting to see polls, while President Obama was our Chief  Executive Officer, showing that, although nations where Muslims were  the majority, they didn't have much respect for President George W.  Bush, but there were polls indicating that they had even less respect  for President Obama.   How could that be?   They didn't see him as being very decisive. Indicative of that was,  when he drew a line in the sand, had a red line, and Syria crossed that  line, he did nothing about it, in essence. So that encouraged our  enemies.   I know there are those who said that things that happened at  Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, other places, actually hurt America badly  because it inflamed our enemies, whereas, actually, nothing inspires  our enemies like the showing of weakness. As President Reagan once  said:         Of all the wars that occurred during my lifetime in which       America was involved, none of them occurred because America       was too strong.    So when other nations perceive weakness, it is provocative, and that  is what has happened in our 200-plus-year history. If we are perceived  as being weak, it is provocative.   President Obama oversaw a number of such weak, provacative incidents.  Some weren't weak, they were just foolish, like encouraging the taking  out of Qadhafi. He was not a good man, had blood on his hands from back  in the 1980s, and yet when President George W. Bush sent troops into  Iraq, Qadhafi had an epiphany and invited us to come in and tell him  what weapons he could keep and what he had to get rid of because he was  afraid that he would be the next nation to be invaded.   When it comes to North Korea, President Clinton, educated in what are  considered by some to be quite elite schools, Ivy League schools, and  yet he oversaw, as President, negotiations with North Korea. This is  just a rather short summary, but basically Madeleine Albright as  Secretary of State and President Clinton's approach to North Korea was:  Look, we will make sure that you get all the nuclear material you need  to make nuclear weapons; we will make sure you get all the technology  you need to create nuclear weapons.                                time  1330    We will get you in a better situation as far as the ability to have  nukes than you could ever have possibly done on your own. And all we  ask in return, in essence, is you sign a document saying that you won't  use the technology and the materials to make nuclear weapons.   I can just envision the glee, the celebrations behind the scenes in  North Korea over how crazy and foolish American leaders are, during the  Clinton administration, because they are going to give us everything we  need to have nuclear weapons, and all we have got to do is put a  signature on a document.   Then we saw history repeat itself when John Kerry played the role of  Madeleine Albright, this time with Iran; and, of course, we did have  [[Page H3925]]  Wendy, who was so helpful in getting North Korea what they needed to  make nuclear weapons, had her as the lead negotiator, with John Kerry,  with Iran, to make sure Iran had an agreement that would enable them to  have nuclear weapons.   And if they lived up to every part of the agreement, this disastrous  agreement, as President Trump described it repeatedly during the  election and since, they would still have nuclear weapons in 10 years  from when the agreement started.   We know--and I went down to the SCIF and reviewed things there. It  shouldn't have been classified. It should have been available for the  whole country to read. Eventually it was available. But it appeared  very clear that the agreement that was enabled by Senator Corker, yes,  he is a Republican, but just wasn't familiar enough with the  Constitution as he needed to be, because he thought you could take a  treaty, which the Iran deal definitely was because it modified other  treaty terms, and you can't do that unless it is in a treaty.   The Constitution requires that a treaty is not valid, a deal such as  the Iran agreement, until it is confirmed by two-thirds of the Senate.  And I am not saying anything that we didn't say back at the time. I was  trying to get the Senate to wake up; that you can't ratify a treaty,  which the Iran agreement is, unless you have two-thirds of the Senators  voting to ratify, confirm the agreement.   Without two-thirds voting in support of the agreement, there is no  agreement. All you have is something on paper that might as well be a  memo.   But they acted like it was a deal, and that is why President Obama  and John Kerry made sure that the Ayatollah, these radical Islamists  that want to end America's existence on the planet as a country in  which there is self-representation through a Republican form of  government--yet they sent $100 billion to $150 billion in cash. And my  friend  Steve King from Iowa, Dana Rohrabacher, it may have been  somebody else, but we went and met with the two lead inspectors in Iran  from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA people talk about  so much. Oh, yeah, we can be comfortable that the Iran deal is a great  deal because those inspectors are carefully inspecting the facilities  and any nuclear efforts in Iran.   I even heard one of my friends, whom I have a great deal of respect  for, on FOX News this week, saying that: Look, you can't do anything  with nuclear material without being detected because there are isotopes  that are easily detectable, so the Iranians can't do anything in the  way of creating nuclear weapons, moving nuclear material, without us  knowing.   I am not sure the source for those comments, but I am sure of the  source of my comments. I was asking the two lead inspectors of Iran  with the IAEA: Gee, we just sent $100 billion or more to Iran. If Iran  were to take some of that money, or all of it, and buy ready-made  nuclear weapons from Pakistan, which has them, from North Korea, can  you guarantee us that they could not get those nuclear weapons into  Iran without your knowing?   And the answer was: Of course we cannot guarantee that.   In fact, I was told that the IAEA could set up detection equipment in  Iran, say, at an airport or wherever, but they could not set up the  detection equipment anywhere without Iran knowing exactly where the  detection equipment was; and unless Iran was foolish enough to either  bring nuclear material or a nuclear weapon right beside their detection  equipment, then no, they would have no way to know whether Iran was  bringing nuclear weapons or even nuclear material into Iran.   So I am not sure where this other information comes from, that you  can't do anything with nuclear material or weapons without the IAEA  knowing, because that is news to the IAEA. They don't know what they  don't know, but they know that they don't know if somebody is trying to  evade their detection equipment. It is that simple.   So when you have an agreement with people who go out before, after,  and during the negotiations and stir up crowds with chants like ``Death  to America,'' and you tell people in your country that you want to see  America gone, that it is the Great Satan, Israel is the Little Satan,  you want them both wiped off the map, wiped off the face of the Earth,  you want any evidence that we ever existed eliminated, then you are  dealing with a country that cannot be trusted.   Whether you call the radical Islamic leaders in Iran crazy, or just  dogmatic jihadists, either way, they are a threat to America. And you  send them money, they are likely going to spend it in a way that hurts  America, kills Americans, kills Israelis, and makes Iran more dominant  in the world.   So all of us who took an oath to support and defend the United States  Constitution, if we are sending money to Iran, my opinion, we are  grievously violating that oath because they are going to do all they  can to subvert our Constitution and, they hope, be able to wipe us out.   Of course, one of their points that was discussed in their  Philadelphia meeting over 25 years ago--the FBI had evidence of the  meeting and evidence of the things, their goals, what they wanted to  accomplish. Well, one of their goals, over 25 years ago, these radical  Islamists in America--one of their goals was to subvert the U.S.  Constitution to sharia law.   They believed the easiest way to subjugate the U.S. Constitution to  their radicalized version of sharia law was to get--either through the  courts, through the legislature, or through the U.N., and force  countries to adopt what the U.N. passed as criminal laws in their own  countries. There are people here who keep advocating for that. But get  a law passed, one way or another, that, in essence, says you cannot say  anything negative about radical Islam, and make that a crime,  punishable by jail, prison, fine.    So we have been moving that way; that is, in essence, what hate  crimes are. Hate crimes, as I said back in 2007, `08, `09, when we were  bringing this issue up, I said, really, you don't need a hate crime  statute. We were told: Oh, yes, you do, because look at what happened  outside of Jasper, Texas. Well, that is just south of my district. None  of the people involved were constituents.   But when I heard about what happened, three White men took an African  American, had him drug behind their truck, tortured the poor man to  death, I wouldn't have a problem if Texas passed a law that said, in a  situation like that, somebody is found guilty; then the victim's  family, in that case, the Jasper victim, have their family select the  manner that the defendant is to be drug and the terrain over which he  is to be drug, and who will be dragging him across that terrain.   If we passed a law like that, basically, capital punishment, with a  different way of inflicting the capital punishment, I would not object.  It is so outrageous what those three defendants did.   But the ridiculous remedy that is proposed here in Congress was: We  will fix that situation by providing punishment for hate in somebody's  heart, and we will be able to sentence you to life in prison. There is  no death penalty for any Federal hate crime.   Actually, this is how ludicrous the law was that was passed here in  Congress. If someone were being tried for a hate crime because of the  physical assault on someone else, the defendant would be totally,  completely exonerated and held not guilty if he raises a reasonable  doubt that, no, no, I didn't choose somebody because of their race,  gender, any type of group they were part of. No, I just wanted to  arbitrarily kill somebody, abuse somebody. I didn't care what group  they were part of.   Under the Federal law, that person would have to be acquitted of the  Federal hate crime because they chose their victim randomly, or at  least raised reasonable doubt that they may have chosen the victim  randomly so they are not guilty of this heinous crime.   Whereas, under Texas law, if you harm somebody, it is not nearly as  important the feelings you have in your heart as what you did. And  under Texas law, the two most culpable defendants in that case, in my  opinion, properly got the death penalty, and the least culpable person  got life in prison.   So this case, which was heralded as the great poster case for why we  need a  [[Page H3926]]  Federal hate crime, actually would diminish the punishment that the  defendants in a hate crime case would get. They couldn't get the death  penalty anymore. Oh, no; they will get life in a Federal prison instead  of death under Texas law.   We did not need that hate crime. And as I said years ago when this  bill was being pushed, ultimately, what this hate crime bill will be  used for is to punish Christians, Christian ministers, for reading  verses directly out of the Bible, as has been done in Congress, in the  House and Senate since the very beginning of this Nation.                                time  1345    And now we are starting to see it being used as a threat against  Christians. We hear more and more people say the biggest hate group  threat is Evangelical Christians.   Well, if they are real Christians, they cannot have hate in their  heart for others, and yet they are being called the biggest threat as  potential hate criminals.   It needs to be changed. We need to punish people for what they do  wrong, and not whether or not they had some improper thought in their  head.   But I am grateful that countries look at Donald Trump the way they  looked at Ronald Reagan, because it is helpful historically.   ``Saturday Night Live,'' seems like I recall Reagan's character being  portrayed as walking around with a finger out wanting to push the red  button so he could launch missiles with nuclear weapons on them, and  the world said: Wow, this Reagan guy is really crazy.   It is invaluable for foreign leaders to not be sure about the  American President, because that gives them more negotiating power.   It is kind of like a great poker player, except that Donald Trump  indicates clearly he doesn't bluff. And as he pointed out to North  Korea, he is not bluffing. And though he would rather not take the  actions that are required, he will take them, and I believe he will,  and apparently Kim Jong-un believed he would as well.   So if you look historically, Teddy Roosevelt has his Navy go around  the world. People are going: This guy is crazy. Look, he just sent his  Navy around the world. You don't know what this guy is going to do. Run  up San Juan Hill? Who knows? This guy is a little bit crazy. And it  always was helpful in foreign relations.   Now, Khrushchev took the measure of John F. Kennedy, very intelligent  man, who wanted to protect America, but he was not decisive in his  early days. Khrushchev scared him out of following through on his  promise to provide air cover to those going into Cuba to try to  eliminate Castro. Scared him off. Backed him off of his promise to  provide him air support. So people were killed who were relying on  President Kennedy's promise.   President Kennedy gave a speech and said, in essence: We are not  going to let anybody build a wall and wall off part of Germany, Eastern  Europe. And it was just, as I recall, a couple of weeks or so before  Khrushchev ensured that the bricks were being laid and the wall was  started.   They had a meeting in Vienna, and President Kennedy told people he  didn't do well in the negotiating, that Khrushchev scared him and he  didn't represent America well.   Well, that is not going to happen to Donald Trump. He is not going to  go to into a negotiation with Kim Jong-un or the Ayatollah or anybody  else and go in and come back out as President Kennedy did and confide:  Wow, I really showed weakness. I didn't do a good job. He scared me.  That is not going to be our problem under President Donald Trump, and  our country is going to be better off because of it.   So I applaud President Trump for rightfully taking the step to  discount and discontinue the farce that was the Iran treaty. It was not  properly ratified.   And even though I wish we had had President Trump in place to stop  the hundred-plus billion dollars that President Obama and John Kerry  sent to the biggest suppliers of terrorism, no doubt that money will be  used or has been used to kill Americans, but there is a new sheriff in  town, and President Trump is going to make sure that doesn't happen  again. God bless him for stopping the Iranian farce.
