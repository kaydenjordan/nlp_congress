 Mr. President, will the minority leader yield for a  question?    Will the majority leader yield for a question?                            ____________________     Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.    The majority leader has said he is going to put a rule  change on the floor, and we are going to return to historical norm. The  historical norm has been that when such issues are on the floor,  amendments will be allowed.   Does the majority leader intend to allow amendments?    Referring to historical norms, it has been a historical  norm to allow amendments on the floor of this Chamber so that they  could be debated, and I recall very well listening to you complain a  great deal about Harry Reid's blocking of amendments, blocking the  tree, and he did, in fact, do that as the majority leader.   Then he would negotiate with that whole set of amendments on both  sides. It took some time, but there were amendments.   We have had a historic lull in amendments, and now we are proposing a  rule change on how this Chamber operates. So isn't it the right thing  to do, before returning to historical norm or trying to restore that  sense of making this a functioning Chamber--    Yes.--to allow amendments when this comes to the floor?  I am asking if he would allow such amendments.    Reserving the right to object, I didn't actually get  clarity on whether he will open the floor for amendments when he will  bring this rule change to the floor--whether it will be open in the  sense that when one amendment is completed, a Senator can ask for  another to be considered or only the amendments he approves will be  allowed to be considered.    Reserving the right to object.    Reserving the right to object, I will, in fact, make  this the last time I reserve the right to object, simply to make the  point that there are many ideas for improving this Chamber that have  not had due consideration.   My colleague has expressed a lot of frustration over executive  nominations. I put forward an amendment in the minority establishing a  100-day clock for amendments to be voted before this floor once the  paperwork is complete. Others have other ideas, including the ability  to have a time at the start of every 2 years to be able to have an open  debate on amendments--on how we work. Others have other ideas for  improving this Chamber.   I think such a debate is way overdue, but if it is the majority  leader's intent to allow just the one issue that he is bringing  forward, then that is not turning the clock back to historical norm.   I was here in this Chamber in 1976 and during the eighties, seeing  this body debate issues. I would ask, if my colleague brings this to  the floor as he is planning to do, that he open it up for amendments.  Get a time agreement. I will certainly encourage my side to agree to  such a thing.   I take your point about it not just being a delay. I think there are  serious possibilities for improving how we work that should be debated.  I hope my colleague will open the floor for amendments.   I withdraw my objection.    Mr. President, this month, Women's History Month,  we recognize and celebrate the contributions that women have made to  the betterment of our Nation. Today, I want to talk about one such  remarkable woman from my home State of Oregon: Delores Pigsley.   In 1991, Delores Pigsley said, ``You never quit being an Indian just  because your tribe has been terminated.'' Delores--Dee to her friends-- ought to know. As a young child, Delores witnessed the termination of  her Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, in 1954, and just  over two decades later, in 1977, she was the driving force behind the  Siletz becoming the first Tribe in Oregon, and just the second tribe in  the entire United States to have its Federal status as a sovereign  government restored.   For over four decades now, Delores has never slowed down or wavered  in her commitment to serving the members of the Siletz Tribe, 32 of  those years as Tribal chairman.   As chief negotiator for the Siletz Tribe, Delores passed agreements  with Congress, negotiated compacts, and testified here on Capitol Hill  before Congress. She has worked with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and  Indian Health Services on behalf of her Tribal members, and thanks in  no small measure to her leadership, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz  Indians, which was once on the verge of ceasing to exist, now owns and  manages a reservation of over 3,500 acres, with a casino, resorts,  hotels, a school, and health clinics.   Delores is many things to many people: a chairman, a leader, a role  model, a wife, a mother, and a grandmother. In spite of all her  accomplishments, she remains humble, attributing much of her success to  other Tribal council leaders and to many national Tribal leaders who  have served as mentors to her.   So this Women's History Month, let's take a moment to recognize and  to thank Delores Pigsley for all that she has done for the members of  the Siletz Tribe, for Tribes across the country, and for the people of  Oregon.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 20 minutes.    Mr. President, the most important words in our  Constitution are the first three. We all know them: ``We the people,''  written in supersize font so we don't forget what our Constitution is  all about--government, as Lincoln put it, of, by, and for the people,  or, as Jefferson put it, government designed to produce laws that  reflect the will of the people.   We don't see that now. We don't have a government of, by, and for the  people. Instead, we have a system that has been profoundly corrupted.  It has been corrupted by gerrymandering. It has been corrupted by voter  suppression and intimidation. It has been corrupted by dark and dirty  money that has flooded our campaigns and wiped out the voice of  millions of Americans. That is where we are now in this corrupted  state.   We have debates on the floor that are all about helping a small group  of people within a circle of power and privilege rather than having  bills that help the citizens of the United States of America. In fact,  we have a President who just this week said his goal was to tear down  healthcare for 30 million Americans, to wipe out the expansion of  Medicaid, to wipe out the tax credits that assist so many Americans  with being able to afford insurance, to wipe out the protection to be  able to get healthcare if you have a preexisting condition, and to wipe  out the ability of your children to be on your policy until the age of  26. That is government by and for this very little circle of privilege  and power instead of the people of the United States of America. We saw  it in other ways too.   In 2017, we saw a bill that reached into the Federal Treasury, took  $1.5 trillion, and gave almost all of it to that small group of people  inside that circle of privilege and power while it ignored the rest of  the country. That is what happens in corrupt countries. The power elite  reach in, take the Treasury for themselves, and ignore the will of the  people.   Every Member of this body took a pledge to the Constitution of the  United States--a Constitution not founded on we the powerful but on we  the people. So I ask: Are we going to honor that oath? If we are going  to honor it, it means we have to stand up and end this deep and vast  corruption.   Yesterday, Senator Udall and I and all of my colleagues on this side  of the aisle introduced a bill that is designed to take on  gerrymandering, to take on voter suppression, and to take on dark  money. Let's talk about gerrymandering.   The Supreme Court has never done a thing about it even though it is  clearly all about having the powerful choose its voters rather than  having the voters choose their Representatives. It is a complete  shredding of the vision of the Constitution. The Supreme Court utterly  failed to act. It has a case before it now, and it will have another  opportunity, but don't hold your breath.   The time to address gerrymandering is before it is done. How do you  do that? You do that with independent commissions. Independent  commissions have been adopted in States like Iowa, and they have been  widely received by the citizens as an issue of fairness. Yet, across so  many States, we have congressional districts that are deliberately  gerrymandered to favor the parties in power. It has happened in  Democratic States, and it has happened in Republican States. You see it  sometimes by the crazy configurations of the map. Sometimes you see it  when a State that is essentially equally divided between the parties  produces congressional Representatives heavily leaning to one side.   It is hard to remedy after the fact, but you can remedy before the  fact by having independent commissions across this country. The way you  take that on is you have a group of six individuals. They take two from  the Democrats and two from the Republicans and two of whom are  Independents, and they may select a broader set of participants--maybe  an additional three  [[Page S2101]]  for the Ds and three from the Rs and three from the Independents. Then,  when they take votes, there has to be a vote from each of those three  sectors. That is sort of the design that forces cooperation and sets up  a condition of fairness, and that is what the For the People Act does  that we introduced yesterday.   Now, I will tell you that State by State, and in my State, people  ask: Why should I fix gerrymandering when that State over there still  favors the other party? It is like waving the white flag on my turf  while they are ripping us off over there. That is why it should be done  at the Federal level. That is why we should pass the For the People  Act.   This act takes on the issue of voting fairness. If you really believe  in the vision of a democratic republic, you believe in voter  empowerment, not voter suppression. Yet what have we seen this last  November 6? We have seen strategies to keep college students from  voting, strategies to keep communities of color from voting, strategies  to keep the poor from voting, strategies to prevent Native Americans  from voting. Those strategies are born from people who don't believe in  the vision of our Constitution. They don't believe it is the foundation  for what we have. They see this as just a game to produce a result,  which is a government for that small group of people inside that circle  of power and privilege. I am a little more patriotic than that. I  believe in the vision of our Constitution, so let's take on these  efforts to obstruct voting.   We did have a bill that had vast bipartisan support. It was called  the Voting Rights Act, and we reauthorized it with vast bipartisan  support because not so long ago, both sides of the aisle believed in  the vision of our Constitution but not now. Unfortunately, now we are  hearing that our colleagues across the aisle like voter intimidation.  We see the Republican States engaging in it on a massive scale. It is  increasing their power. They want to hold onto it--to clutch it to  their chests and not let go. Yet, if you believe in the Constitution,  if you believe in our country, you would let go. You would say: Let's  appeal to all of the voters with our vision and not try to stop them  from voting.   That is why we need to take down the barriers for voting. That is why  we need automatic voter registration and internet registration and  same-day registration--so people can sign up to vote. It means we need  better access to voting so there isn't manipulation at the precinct  places and so there is early voting nationwide and the right to choose  to vote by mail.    Now, of course, I am a little biased on this because my home State of  Oregon led the Nation in automatic voter registration, and we led the  Nation in voting by mail. For those who are worrying about people  voting who shouldn't be voting, nothing is more secure than to vote by  mail, and those who are worried about electronic machines being hacked  and not having a paper ballot, there is nothing more secure than voting  by mail.   When polls do occur and people go to those polls, shouldn't we make  sure they are adequately staffed? The whole strategy of moving polling  places at the last minute in order to confuse people and the whole  strategy of understaffing polling places in the neighborhoods that you  don't want to have vote is really evil--evil in that it takes away the  vision of our Constitution. Voter empowerment is the vision; voter  suppression is not. So that takes us to those polls and to our making  sure we have a polling protection act. That is why we need the For the  People Act--to take that on.   Then we come to dark and dirty money--money flowing in from  corporations and all kinds of overseas, foreign participants. Nothing  is being done here about that. Of course, the vision laid out by Thomas  Jefferson called it equal voice. It meant distributed power among the  electorate, not concentrated power, only with equal voice. He said it  was the mother principle. Only with that do you get bills that reflect  the will of the people. We are getting bills that reflect a small  circle of power and privilege, not the people, because of this dark  money concentrating power.   When the Koch brothers' cartel puts hundreds of millions of dollars  into our campaign, the ordinary voter asks: Where is my equal voice? I  don't have hundreds of millions of dollars. I will be lucky if I can  give $10 to this candidate and $15 to that candidate. So the American  people know the system is rigged--rigged in a profound way by this dark  money.   Where does this come from?   It comes from that same Supreme Court that gutted the Voting Rights  Act, from that same Supreme Court that failed to take on  gerrymandering. It is the Court that has flipped our Constitution on  its head and has replaced we the people with the vision of government  by and for that small group of people in a circle of power--people like  the Koch brothers, who, in 2014, spent hundreds of millions of dollars  to change the makeup of this Chamber. Nobody in my blue-collar  neighborhood has hundreds of millions of dollars. They know the system  has been rigged. That is why we need the For the People Act--to restore  the vision of our Constitution.   I encourage all red-blooded, patriotic Americans to stand up for  their Constitution, to fight for the vision embodied in Jefferson's  mother principle of equal voice, distributed power, and to remedy the  dark money flowing through our campaigns. Not only is it vastly  corrupting, but it drives vast cynicism because the people see what is  going on.   Let's fix the gerrymandering on the front end. It is hard for the  courts to do it on the back end even if they had the will to do so.  Let's fix fair voting on the front end and not argue about it afterward  when we can't even count the ballots because there are electronic  machines and people didn't have a fair chance to get to the polls.  Let's fix the dark money and embrace equal voice.   I am concerned that time is short to save our Republic because the  money has so piled up under this strategy of government by and for the  powerful that over the last decades, while the wages and benefits of  ordinary people have been flat or declining, the wealth of that small  circle of power has gone through the roof.   In the first three decades after World War II, everyone participated.  It was the spirit of the war. We were all in it together. Let's make  our government work for all. In the midseventies, it ended--vast wealth  for the wealthy and only struggling opportunities or struggling  conditions for those ordinary Americans.   We have to save our Constitution. Let's do it. Let's pass the For the  People Act. Let's have a full and robust debate on this floor so we  will all be accountable to our citizens and to our pledge and our oath  to the Constitution of the United States of America.   I yield the floor.
