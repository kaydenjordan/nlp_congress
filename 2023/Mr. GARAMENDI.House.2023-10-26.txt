 Mr. Speaker, later today, we are going to be taking up  an extraordinary piece of legislation and voting on whether this Nation  is going to be all in on a new nuclear arms race or whether we are  going to modulate and think about what it is that we are funding. We  are basically going to be funding the potential destruction of all that  exists on this planet.   I will also address the House on an issue that occurred yesterday in  Maine. Another assault weapon was used to murder at least 16 people,  with perhaps another 50 being wounded.   It is time for this House to act on extending the previous ban on  assault weapons. This has nothing to do with the Second Amendment. This  has everything to do with war on the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I hereby remove my name as a cosponsor of  H.R. 3721.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer a critical amendment  to pause wasteful and unnecessary spending at the Savannah River  Plutonium Processing Facility.   This is a responsible measure. It will pause the development of this  nuclear facility while we fix the cost overruns and mismanagement  associated with this.   Given the rhetoric of the Republican side of the aisle about reining  in excessive spending, this amendment should be something that we would  all agree on.   The estimated cost of the Savannah River facility tripled from $3.6  billion to nearly $11 billion since the start of the project. It will  likely continue to increase since this program is not scheduled to be  completed until 2035.   According to the August Government Accountability Office report, it  will probably be delayed even further until 2038.   Why are we spending $11 billion on this wasteful facility? You would  think it might be part of our critical national security, but that is  not the case.   For those unfamiliar with this facility, it is being built to produce  plutonium pits, which is the core of a nuclear weapon. We already have  thousands of these pits.   Some will stand up here and say, oh, my. We need to replace them  because they age out. These pits will last at least 100 years.   Some studies by independent panels of scientists and academics have  suggested that these pits have an even longer life cycle.   That is why in the House-passed fiscal year 2024 NDAA, the House  Armed Services Committee adopted my amendment for an independent  assessment of plutonium-pit aging by experts.   If we really care about responsible government spending, we must  ensure there is a need before allocating billions of dollars to rebuild  a stockpile that we already have in place and that really should never  be used.   To reiterate, this amendment is a pause on next year's spending  because we really do need to evaluate the science.   By the way, it is only $858 million, but hey, every dollar counts.  This pause is essential, timely and a prudent step.   In our haste to build new nuclear bombs, we must allocate those costs  appropriately. A January 2023 GAO report found that the National  Nuclear Security Administration lacks a comprehensive schedule or cost  estimate on what we are doing here with this particular program. The  NNSA has not even identified all of the activities or milestones to  achieve an 80 pit per year production capacity.   I am sure that some will argue, wrongly, in my view, that I am  undermining national security. They will make exaggerated claims about  the necessity to engage in a nuclear arms race.   Well, we are, but the question is, are we doing it wisely? The answer  is no. We are spending money unnecessarily and in an ill-advised way.   As a citizen, I am also aware that we face challenges here at home.  We have heard many of those. I also know that the new Speaker wants to  rein in unnecessary expenditures. I would suggest that this is one.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have a question. I have a question  about fairness in the debate. The chair of the subcommittee has offered  two pro forma amendments, giving my side of the debate no opportunity  whatsoever to respond to the issues that have been raised.   Mr. Chairman, I am curious, is fairness out of order on this floor?    Mr. Chairman, I posed a question to the Chair. Does  the Chair have an answer to my question?   Is fairness out of order on this floor?    Mr. Chair, a parliamentary inquiry would be: Sir, how  can I achieve, under the rules of the House, a fair debate with equal  time on the issue?   Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary question before the Chair. Fair  is fair, guys.    Further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, in an effort to achieve that  consultation, sir, could the House provide me with information since I  do not have before me the rules of the House.   Perhaps they can provide me the rules of the House and I could read  it, or perhaps the Chair can provide some advice on that particular  section of the rules.    Further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chair.    Mr. Chairman, if I might ask another parliamentary  question, sir. As the author of this amendment, do I have the  opportunity to propose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 of those pro forma  amendments?    Well, then let us get started.    Mr. Chair, I have a pro forma amendment.    How many minutes do I have remaining, sir?    Mr. Chairman, this House has always operated in a fair  and evenhanded way. And I must say, the use of the pro forma amendment  by my colleagues on the Republican side creates a very unfair debate,  in which the points put forward in opposition to my amendment, I do not  have time to deal with.   However, I will take whatever time I have remaining and not spend  much time on the necessity for fairness in the debate, which has a  whole lot to do with the time available.   Now, very, very quickly, since I have only a minute and some seconds  left here.   This is not an end to the plutonium pit production. What it says is  to pause for 1 year, an $850 million expenditure on what has become not  a plutonium pit but a dollar pit. Billions and billions of dollars have  been spent on the Savannah facility, first, to somehow deal with the  nuclear waste. That didn't work.   It has been repurposed to build plutonium pits. The reality here is  there will not be a pit built in Savannah River for at least a decade.  So all of this chatter about the safety of this Nation is nonsense. The  reality here is we have a money pit.    Mr. Chair, apparently, we want a debate on the  plutonium pit issue. Well, let it happen. Let's get some facts here.  The 80 pits per year has little to do with nuclear arms, nuclear bombs,  it has everything to do with a number that was invented by the  committees of this House.   So what are we going to do with these pits?   First of all, the pits will not be built in Savannah River for at  least a decade, and quite likely 15 years. Yes, perhaps they will in 15  years produce 50 pits per year. For what purpose?   Specifically, now the pit production is taking place at Los Alamos  National Laboratories, which is diligently and wastefully moving  forward to produce 30 pits per year.   The first pit at Savannah River--that is the war reserve pit--it is  likely to be produced in 3 to 4 years from now, beginning at the rate  of one a year and eventually moving to 30 per year, which will probably  take a full decade and several billion dollars to do.   What is that pit going to be used for?   Maybe we ought to know before we start talking about the safety of  this world and this Nation.   The pits that are going to be built at Savannah River are  specifically for a new nuclear bomb, the 87-1, which has not yet been  produced.                                time  1045    Presumably, that bomb will go on the new Sentinel missile, which in  and of itself is $150 billion that we will spend to replace the  Minuteman III missiles that are now in the silos in the upper Midwest.   By the way, the Minuteman IIIs are perfectly good for at least  another decade, so why are we spending that money? Presumably because  we decided a decade ago that we ought to do it and that somehow the  Minuteman III missiles wouldn't continue to work.   In a recent test this year, the Minuteman III worked perfectly well,  and there has been no indication that the Minuteman III missile cannot  continue to work perfectly well for the next decade or more. We have  not yet calculated the full cost of replacing the Minuteman III with  the new Sentinel program, but the estimates are well over $150 billion.   For what purpose? To make us safer? No. It won't make us safer at  all.   By the way, what bomb will be put on the Sentinel while we await the  87-1? Guess what it is? It is the existing bomb that we have on the  Minuteman III. That new weapon, the 87-1, is at least a decade away,  and the cost is unknown, but you had better get your billion dollars  together because it will surely be in that range.   We need a debate about all of this. This is not about national  security. This is about a new nuclear arms race that puts humanity on  this planet in serious jeopardy. We have quite enough weapons to deter  anybody from using a nuclear weapon, and yes, so do China and Russia.   This is about deterrence. How many bombs, how many weapons, how many  delivery systems are necessary for deterrence? If it is a war, yes, all  three countries have quite enough to terminate life on this planet. We  don't need more to achieve a victory in a nuclear war. We have quite  enough already. We can target wherever we need to target--in China, in  Russia, wherever. We have quite enough for that.   As a deterrent, we have quite enough for deterrence. Yes, Putin  rattled the nuclear saber. To what effect? What effect did his rattling  achieve? Nothing.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I think I will take a deep breath. I was  a little wound up a few moments ago. If the opposition to this  amendment would like to go through that process of an additional 5  minutes, we will play that game, and I would actually appreciate doing  that.   There is a lot that we need to discuss here. There is a lot that this  House needs to consider, and it is about the nuclear enterprise. It is  about a 10-year mission that we have been on to rebuild our nuclear  programs.   One part of that nuclear program is a new nuclear bomb to be put on  the new Sentinel rockets that replace the Minuteman III. A moment ago,  I discussed the situation. Do we really need to spend $120 billion,  $150 billion over the next decade to replace the Minuteman III and a  new nuclear bomb? The answer is, we have time. We have time.   As I said a few moments ago, the Minuteman III will work for a  considerable period into the future, and the nuclear weapon that is  presently on the Minuteman III is going to work for many more years. It  is not aging out. It is perfectly reliable.   What is this 87-1 all about? It is a new bomb. It, in fact, is the  first new bomb that we have built in many years. Presumably, it will  work better than the bomb that is presently on the Minuteman III and  will be used on the new Sentinel rocket when it is ready to be placed  into new silos upon which we will spend billions of dollars building  the silos and the infrastructure.   The 87-1, this brings us right back to the previous question that we  had about plutonium pit production. Do we need additional pit  production? I ask all of us to take a calendar, look at the years  ahead, and begin to put in place the arrival of the new Sentinel, which  will surely be at least a decade, if not longer. Then, look at the pit  production that will be able to be put in place in Los Alamos, one a  year, two, three, four, five. We will be stacking up new pits in Los  Alamos well ahead of the need for this new weapon to be put on the  Sentinel rocket. We will have an inventory of pits that would be used  for the 87-1.   What I am saying here in this amendment is, wait a minute. Take a  look at the calendar. Take a look at the way these pieces fit  together--billions of dollars in Savannah River to build nuclear pits  that will not even be available for at least a decade and a half. Take  a look at the pits we are producing and will be able to produce at Los  Alamos and the stockpile of pits that would then be available for the  timing of the 87-1, should we ever decide that we need it.   We do not need to spend this money today on the 87-1 or on Savannah  River. This is a pause. We heard the new Speaker stand right there and  tell us that we have a deficit problem.   We sure as hell do have a deficit problem. Part of it is how we spend  our money. We ought to take a look at that.   That is what these amendments are about. These amendments are about  spending money unnecessarily now. We have things that we desperately  need to do. We need to educate, to research, to be in competition  economically with China. Yet, here we are. A small amount of money  here, pause this expenditure. Pause it. We are not doing away with the  87-1, although that is another argument we might have someday. Right  now, why are we spending this money today? Why?   The new Speaker wants to deal with the deficit. Deal with this. Pause  this expenditure. We have plenty of time to deal with this.   For those who argue that this has something to do with our current  national security, you are dead wrong because this will not be  available for at least a decade, and you can argue whether we even need  it then.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
