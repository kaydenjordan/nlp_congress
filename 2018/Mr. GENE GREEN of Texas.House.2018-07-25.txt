 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.  Res. 981, and to condemn the Ortega regime's escalating, brutal  campaign against its own people.   Ortega has now been in charge of Nicaragua for 22 of the last 39  years. After years of consolidating power by installing his wife as  vice president, and gradually chipping away at the power of the  judiciary and congress, Ortega has now dropped all pretense of being  anything other than an authoritarian leader.   More than 300 people have now died in Nicaragua for having the  courage to speak out against his and his wife's dictatorial rule.  Ortega has now shown himself willing to target members of the clergy  for fulfilling their sacred duty to recognize the value of human life,  and for putting themselves in harm's way to try to protect their  people.   This should be unacceptable to the U.S. and to the international  community. I commend my colleague Rep. Ros-Lehtinen for taking a stand,  and I encourage the executive branch to use all non-military means  available to hold Ortega accountable for these deaths and to stop the  carnage in Nicaragua.
