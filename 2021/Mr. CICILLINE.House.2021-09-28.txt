 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the EQUAL Act  which eliminates the discriminatory sentencing disparity between crack  and powder cocaine.   I want to thank Chairman Nadler for his leadership in bringing this  bill before our committee and its quick passage. And, of course, I  thank Chairman Jeffries and Mr. Armstrong and Chairman Scott for their  leadership on this issue.   As you know, Mr. Speaker, 35 years ago, Congress passed the Anti-Drug  Abuse Act, which created this drastic sentencing disparity between two  types of cocaine; the same substance, just in a different form. And as  has been explained, under the disparity you needed 100 times the amount  of powder cocaine than crack cocaine to get the same sentence.   There was no scientific basis for this, no empirical evidence that  there was any difference. The harm that this caused was devastating to  so many. For more than three decades defendants have suffered under  this disparity with highly disproportionate impacts on communities of  color. That has led to mass incarceration and, as I said, the  destruction of so many lives unnecessarily.   In 2010, Congress changed the sentencing disparity from a 100:1 to  18:1. And while that was some progress, in 2018, we improved on that  even more under the extraordinary leadership of Mr. Jeffries by making  it retroactive. But while it was a step in the right direction, making  the disparity smaller did not make the sentencing fair. And today we  finally do that.   I served as a public defender and a criminal defense lawyer for many  years, and I have seen, unfortunately, how often our criminal justice  systems fails to deliver justice. And this disparity is just one of  those examples. This vital legislation will at last fully resolve the  discriminatory sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine  and correct this injustice for so many.   Our prisons are overcrowded and lives are unfairly harmed every day,  especially in communities of color, because of unjust and  discriminatory sentencing laws resulting in mass incarceration and  other harms.   The EQUAL Act is one important step of so many that we have to take  to end this cycle. I want to end again by thanking Mr. Jeffries for his  extraordinary leadership on this bill. I thank Mr. Nadler for bringing  this bill to the floor, and I am delighted it is bipartisan.   And if Mr. Gohmert is right, that Texas did this some years ago, 1:1,  I will say words that I never expected to say on the House floor in my  life: We need to follow the lead of Texas.                                time  1315
