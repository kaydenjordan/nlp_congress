 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in strong support of this measure.   Let me, first of all, as I have so many times before, thank Chairman  Royce for his leadership in advancing this lifesaving legislation, as  well as Representative Smith, the bill's author.   I also want to acknowledge my friend from California, Congresswoman  Barbara Lee, one of the lead sponsors not just of this bill, but of the  2003 legislation that originally authorized PEPFAR. She is the chair of  the Congressional HIV/AIDS Caucus and a tireless champion in the fight  to end HIV/AIDS, and I salute her tremendous leadership. She was  talking about this when very few people were, and look at what we have  accomplished.   Fifteen years ago, the idea that we would one day talk about an  ``AIDS-free generation'' would have seemed like fantasy. At the time,  this disease had killed more than 20 million people,  [[Page H9489]]  another 42 million were infected, and a mere 50,000 people in Africa  had access to lifesaving treatments that were still relatively new.                                time  1700    Enter PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the  largest commitment by any country in the world to combat a single  disease. Today, thanks to PEPFAR, 14 million men, women, and children  are receiving treatment. More than 85 million people were tested for  HIV last year. New diagnoses among young women and girls, a  particularly vulnerable population, have dropped dramatically. And more  than 2 million babies have been born HIV-free to mothers living with  HIV.   When President George W. Bush signed PEPFAR into law in 2003, he  said: ``We will keep our commitment until we have turned the tide  against AIDS.'' I think that will be President Bush's legacy, the  positive force he was for PEPFAR and helping people living with AIDS.   The bill we are now considering is the newest chapter in that  commitment. It extends key provisions that have allowed PEPFAR to  succeed. It also enables Congress to continue its oversight role so  that PEPFAR's vital work plows ahead while we make sure taxpayer  dollars are put to use efficiently and effectively.   In my view, that oversight role has become especially important.  PEPFAR thrived in the previous two administrations, and I regret that  the current administration has twice sought deep cuts to efforts to  fight AIDS. If these cuts were enacted--and, thankfully, Congress has  rejected the requests--it would set us back more than 2 decades. We  would see the first spike in new HIV infections worldwide since 1995.  It would negate the enormous work and billions invested over the past  15 years.   At the same time, the administration has reimposed and expanded the  global gag rule, the so-called Mexico City policy. I think it is a  wrong approach. This approach to healthcare is denying so many people  their right to comprehensive healthcare from providers they trust. It  has ripple effects that hamper our work to combat HIV/AIDS.   For example, a Mozambican Association for Family Development clinic  tested nearly 6,000 patients for HIV over a 3-month period between July  and September of last year. Then the global gag rule went into force,  and the clinic lost its funding. During the next 3-month period, just  671 patients were tested for HIV, a decline of nearly 90 percent.   This is not something that we should just fathom. For 15 years,  PEPFAR has been a model of what can be achieved through bipartisan  cooperation. I hope that the administration will return to that  consensus by ending its budget requests and lifting the global gag  rule, which evidence shows is utterly at odds with the goals of PEPFAR.  We cannot have budget cuts for something like this.   Only then will it be possible to accelerate the progress achieved  over the last 15 years and finally realize our goal of an AIDS-free  generation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), one of the lead sponsors of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 2 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is a great advocate for those living with  HIV/AIDS.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me close and let me say that, as the sponsor of the last PEPFAR  reauthorization in 2013, I am proud to be a part of this effort. And I  again thank Chairman Royce; Congresswoman Lee; the chair and ranking  member of our Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations Subcommittee, Representatives Smith and  Bass; and Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen as well.   I also thank Ambassador Deborah Birx, the U.S. Global AIDS  Coordinator and U.S. Special Representative for Global Health  Diplomacy, for her tireless work to ensure PEPFAR's success.   Mr. Speaker, over the last 15 years, PEPFAR has been nothing short of  revolutionary. It is a humanitarian and global health triumph, with  very few rivals across history, but it is still a work in progress.   An AIDS-free generation remains aspirational, certainly more within  reach than it was a few years ago, but still a vision that we need to  keep working for. If we reverse course, if we slash funding for these  efforts, it would undermine our own efforts with foolish policies. We  stand to lose so much of what has been achieved.   I am glad to support this bipartisan measure which would keep us on  the right course, and I again urge the administration to agree with  what Congress has done, not to cut funding in this much-needed help. I  am pleased to support the bill. I ask all Members to do the same, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in support of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Donovan for his work on this  resolution which reaffirms America's relationship with Liberia and  calls for the Government of Liberia to hold accountable those who  carried out mass violence and atrocities during the country's civil war  in the 1990s. That war resulted in the deaths of over 200,000 people  and was marked by gross human rights violations.   In the wake of this conflict, the Liberian Government started working  to investigate the horrific crimes committed during the war. In 2005, a  Truth and Reconciliation Commission put forward recommendations to  follow through on those efforts. But now, 10 years later, the  Government of Liberia still hasn't fully implemented those  recommendations.   Liberia, as the chairman pointed out, and the United States share  close historical, political, and economic ties. We in the United States  are committed to helping Liberia prosper as a stable democracy.   The 2017 elections were an important turning point. This was the  country's first peaceful democratic transition of power since 1944.  Today's measure rightly congratulates Liberia for this achievement.   For Liberia to fully move forward, it must deal with its past. So  this resolution urges Liberia to implement the recommendations from the  Truth and Reconciliation Commission. There must be justice and  accountability for the atrocities committed during Liberia's Civil War.   Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us today is a very important step  to continue our strong relationship with Liberia, and I am happy to  support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I yield myself the  balance of my time.   I again want to thank Mr. Donovan and Chairman Royce for their work  on this effort. We want to ensure that the U.S. continues to enjoy its  centuries-long relationship with Liberia.   The measure puts the United States on record again, once again,  encouraging Liberia in the right direction toward democratic stability  and accountability. So I urge all Members to support this resolution,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution.   Let me thank Mr. Castro for introducing this measure underscoring the  importance of U.S.-Australia bilateral cooperation in space. I am  grateful for his leadership in bringing this next-generation issue to  our attention in the House.   The United States and Australia already share deep bonds of  cooperation:   We are treaty allies;   We share intelligence as Five Eyes partners;   We are engaged on a range of issues around the world, from defense,  to trade, to development;   We share a deep cultural connection rooted in our common values of  democracy and openness;   And, of course, this is a friendship quite literally forged in blood.  Americans and Australians have fought and perished side by side in  every war since World War I.   In July, the U.S.-Australia relationship entered its 100th year, and  we celebrated together ``100 Years of Mateship.'' We are already  thinking about our cooperation over the next 100 years, and the U.S.- Australia partnership in space research, exploration, and utilization  will surely be a key area.   The days are gone when human activity in space was limited to great  powers competing with one another. Today, with telecommunication and  weather satellites floating overhead, space plays a major role in the  day-to-day lives of people all over the world.   Of course, not all countries interested in space exploration share  our interests and values when it comes to space. That is why we want to  ensure that the values that have underpinned the U.S.-Australia  partnership are also carried into our collaboration in the space  domain.   This resolution reaffirms those values and the importance of this  forward-looking partnership. I am pleased to support it, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Castro), the author of this bill and a valuable member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.  [[Page H9495]]    Let me again thank Mr. Castro for putting forward this timely and  important resolution. He has been a valued leader on policy on Asia and  policy in Australia.   As we look to the future of U.S.-Australia relations over the next  100 years, I am confident that our countries will be able to expand our  close collaboration in the critical domain of space exploration and  research.   This resolution commends the Government of Australia for constituting  the Australian Space Agency, which lays the foundation for our  bilateral cooperation in space. It also underscores America's interests  in prioritizing space cooperation in the years to come and in doing it  with a good friend in Australia.   I support the passage of this resolution. I encourage my colleagues  to do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure and I yield  myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking Mr. McCaul for putting  forward this important bill, which would authorize the Trans-Sahara  Counterterrorism Partnership. I want to also thank Congressman Keating  for his hard work on this bill as well.   This interagency program was established in 2005 to help America's  partners in the Sahel and Maghreb counter terrorism and violent  extremism.   In places where instability leads to terrorism and conflict, it is  important that we collaborate with our allies and that our policy is  driven by united interagency effort. That is why this bill is so  critical.  [[Page H9497]]    It requires the Secretary of State to work with the Secretary of  Defense and the USAID administrator to create a comprehensive strategy.  By coordinating our diplomatic, military, and development efforts at  home and with partners abroad, the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism  Partnership Act strengthens our response to the international security  threats facing these regions of Africa.   Mr. Speaker, the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership is an  important program that will enhance our international security efforts  in an area that demands attention.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I, again, want to thank Mr.  McCaul for his hard work on this measure and to Chairman Royce for  moving it forward.   This bill authorizes a very important program that strengthens our  efforts to assist partners in the Sahel and Maghreb to counter  terrorism and violent extremism.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from New York, the Honorable Joseph D. Morelle, be permitted to take  the oath of office today.   His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to his election.    Mr. Speaker, as co-dean of the New York delegation, along  with my colleague Congresswoman Lowey, the New York delegation is  pleased to welcome our newest colleague, Joe Morelle, representing New  York's 25th District in upstate New York.   Joe has been elected to the seat of our beloved and departed  colleague Louise Slaughter. Joe hails from Irondequoit and, like  myself, served in the New York State Assembly. He was elected to that  body in 1990 and became majority leader in 2013.   He graduated from SUNY Geneseo with a bachelor's degree in political  science and began his political career at age 28 as a Monroe County  legislator. Congressman Morelle and his wife, Mary Beth, are well known  and well loved, and we are so happy to have Joe Morelle as one of our  colleagues.   Congratulations, Joe.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Morelle).
