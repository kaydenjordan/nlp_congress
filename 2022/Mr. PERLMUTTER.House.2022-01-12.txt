 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Agent Ashley  Ferris of the Lakewood Police Department for her heroic actions which  undoubtedly saved lives and protected our community from further  violence.   On December 27, 2021, the Denver and Lakewood, Colorado, communities  experienced a terrible tragedy. A gunman opened fire at multiple  locations in Denver before traveling to Lakewood where he continued the  shooting spree.   As a result of this gun violence, five lives were taken and two  others were injured. My condolences go to the friends and family of the  five victims of these murders: Alicia Cardenas, Danny Scofield, Sarah  Steck, Alyssa Gunn-Maldonado, and Michael Swinyard. Jimmy Maldonado was  injured as well as Agent Ferris, who bravely confronted and killed the  gunman even after being shot in the abdomen, undoubtedly preventing  additional loss of life.   The Lakewood Police Department said it best: ``If not for the heroic  efforts of Agent Ferris and other law enforcement, this incredibly  violent tragedy could have been even worse.''   Agent Ferris was previously recognized for her actions on the job in  2020 when she, along with two fellow Lakewood Police Officers,  performed lifesaving measures on a woman suffering medical distress.  For her actions, she was presented with the department's Lifesaving  Award.   I am thankful Agent Ashley Ferris was recently released from the  hospital. I wish her a full and speedy recovery, and I extend my  deepest appreciation for her bravery, sacrifice, and service to our  community.                            ____________________
