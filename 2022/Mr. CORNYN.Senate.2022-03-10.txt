 Mr. President, government funding, as we all know, is set  to expire tomorrow night at midnight, and the Senate has the  responsibility not just to keep the lights on but also to make critical  investments in our country.   I could only wish that we had come to this point through a more  rational and more deliberative sort of way; but, unfortunately, this  seems to be more the norm than the exception where four people get into  a room and they write a piece of legislation, then they bring it to the  floor, and your only option is to vote yes or no on it. We don't have a  practice of making sure that on each one of these bills, people get to  actually offer amendments and shape that legislation. I guess that is a  quaint and old-fashioned notion, but that is how I thought the  legislative process was supposed to work. Maybe that is a topic for  another day, but it is unfortunate that this is where we are.   Last night at 10 o'clock, the House voted on an almost 3,000-page  bill, and then we are expected to vote on it the next day or the next 2  days. This is not a way to run a railroad.   We all know that democracy is under attack in the world, and that  means we need to do everything we can to provide for our defense and to  support our friends and allies around the world.   We know that there has been a tug-of-war between our Democratic  colleagues and this side of the aisle when it comes to prioritizing  national security spending, and that actually is one reason why we find  ourselves here at this late date, voting on this multithousand-page  bill, because our colleagues on the other side of the aisle wanted to  prioritize domestic spending, not national security spending.   Thank goodness that has been now negotiated where there is virtual  parity. Thanks to the leadership of Ranking Member Shelby and our  colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, the bipartisan bill  includes $42 billion more in defense spending. I can't think of any  time in our recent history where we need those additional resources  more for our security and the security of our friends and allies.   This $42 billion increase in defense spending will provide our  military commanders with what they need to respond to the threats that  we are facing today and to prepare for those threats we see on the  horizon.   It is ironic I find myself speaking to the Senator from Maine, whom I  serve with on the Intelligence Committee, because he knows a lot of  this subject matter as well--certainly well, maybe better than I do.  But we all know that Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine was what we  thought was a relic of the past.   My dad was a B-17 pilot in the Army Air Corps in World War II. He was  shot down on his 26th bombing mission over Nazi Germany and captured as  a prisoner of war, where he served for the last 4 months of that war.  We thought--Europe thought, the world thought--that perhaps we had  gotten beyond that sort existential threat to our way of life and that  the autocrats of the world--people like Vladimir Putin, President Xi,  the Ayatollah in Iran, Kim Jong Un in North Korea--that these  individuals would be deterred from provoking a war like Vladimir Putin  has provoked in Ukraine.   One thing Winston Churchill liked to say: If there is one thing for  sure, it is that humankind is unteachable. We keep making the same  mistakes over and over again. We keep thinking, well, we can cash the  peace dividend because that is in the past, only to find ourselves, as  Secretary Bob Gates said--he said, of all the military conflicts we  found ourselves involved in, in the last several generations, we  haven't planned for a single one of them. But we had to be ready, and  we had to be able to defend our way of life and our values and our  allies.   So Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine is a reminder of the threats  [[Page S1084]]  that remain to our freedom and the freedom of other democracies around  the world. So there could not be a more appropriate time to plus-up our  national defense spending, while at the same time providing additional  resources, humanitarian and otherwise, to our friends in Ukraine who  are fighting for their very existence.   We know that Ukraine is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, so we have no legal obligation to come to Ukraine's  defense, but I do believe we have a moral obligation to provide that  assistance, both military and humanitarian.   Russia has waged an unmistakable war on that democracy, violated the  sovereignty of the Ukrainian people. It has even targeted civilians and  brought immeasurable destruction to Ukraine. The only question is,  After Putin has miscalculated the will of the Ukrainian people to  defend themselves and the commitment of America and our NATO allies and  other freedom-loving countries around the world to support Ukraine--now  that they are bogged down, Russia is bogged down in Ukraine, the  question is, Well, is Putin going to give up? Is he going to try to  come up with a face-saving device, or is he going to double down? I am  afraid Putin is going to double down, which means we are going to see  more attacks on innocent civilians. We are going to see more Ukrainian  cities leveled to the ground, indiscriminate killing of men, women, and  children. This is all that Putin knows. The question is, How does this  end? That is a chilling question, but the answer is even more chilling.   As I said, I believe we have a moral duty to support Ukraine, and  this legislation provides $13 billion in humanitarian, economic, and  military assistance. We need to get this money out the door as soon as  possible, while the United States and NATO needs to continue to supply  the Javelins and other anti-aircraft, anti-tank weapons to help the  Ukrainians defend themselves against this existential threat.   The good news is, this is a bipartisan effort. A lot of things we do  around here we divide up along party lines--the shirts and the skins, I  like to call them--but the fact is, we all support Ukraine, and we are  all looking for ways we can help them during their time of need.   Another thing that this Omnibus appropriations bill does is it  reauthorizes the Violence Against Women Act. This critical program has  been defunct and moribund since 2019. For some reason, this was not a  priority of this Chamber or of this Congress for the last 3 years, but  thanks to the leadership of Senators Ernst and Murkowski--Senator  Feinstein was an essential part of the negotiations--we were able to  reach a bipartisan agreement to strengthen and modernize this law.   I am a proud cosponsor of the legislation, and I thank our colleagues  on the Appropriations Committee for prioritizing its inclusion in this  legislation. This funding will make critical investments for our  country, including critical investments in our own people.   One of the good things about this Omnibus appropriations bill is it  does exclude poison pills that included things like taxpayer funding of  abortions. Those are not included in this bill.   While it is far from perfect, there is no question that a bill  drafted solely by Republicans would look a little different. But the  world does not operate on the basis of ideals. The perfect cannot be  the enemy of the good. So despite its flaws, despite the crazy process  by which we find ourselves here voting on this $1.5 trillion  appropriations bill, notwithstanding all the reasons I could cite why  maybe I should vote against it, I think there is enough good in this  bill to support it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, 2 weeks ago, President  Biden nominated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson--and I know I mispronounced  her first name; Judge Jackson, let me just call her--to serve as an  Associate Justice on the Supreme Court.   During his State of the Union Message, President Biden said that  choosing somebody to serve on the Supreme Court is one of the most  serious constitutional responsibilities a President of the United  States has. Likewise, I believe our responsibilities under the  Constitution of evaluating the nominee, going through the advice-and- consent process, is one of the most serious responsibilities we as  Senators have, and I don't take that responsibility lightly.   Members of this Chamber are pretty familiar with Judge Jackson's  qualifications, as she was confirmed to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals  just 9 months ago--sometimes called the second most powerful Federal  court in the land, right below the Supreme Court of the United States.   There is no question that Judge Jackson is an incredibly smart person  and has all of the sort of pedigree that you would expect: graduated  from the best universities, the best law schools, has had a broad range  of practice. She received both her undergraduate and law degrees from  Harvard. She clerked for a Supreme Court Justice, Justice Breyer. She  served on the Federal bench for nearly 9 years.   I could say, as somebody who served on the State court bench for 13  years, I appreciate the President picking somebody who has actually had  real-world experience on the trial bench. Too often, I think our  Supreme Court nominees are academics and people who have very little  real-world experience. But you can't argue that Judge Jackson does not  have that kind of real-world experience, serving as a public defender,  serving on the trial court, and serving on the court of appeals for the  last 9 months.   We all know that a nomination for the Supreme Court requires a  rigorous assessment of far more than just a resume, though. Our Framers  set forth the role of the Supreme Court in article III of our  Constitution.   Alexander Hamilton noted in Federalist 78 that the judiciary, he  said, would have ``no influence over either the sword or the purse. . .  . [i]t may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely  judgment.'' Now, if I can interpret what Alexander Hamilton was really  saying in modern language, it is that judges shouldn't be politicians.  They are not policymakers.   That is why we appoint them--they are appointed--for lifetime tenure,  to be protected from the pressures of politics or personality, and that  is why they have such a critical and important role in our government.  But it is not the same role as we serve as elected representatives. We  are enmeshed in politics. We are directly responsible to the people-- not for the legal correctness of our arguments or our legislation or  constitutional interpretation, although I think we do have some  responsibility since we take an oath to uphold the Constitution and  laws of the United States, but it is different, and I think most people  recognize judges are different than politicians. Judges should not be  politicians appointed to serve for lifetime tenure and be unaccountable  to the public and yet make policy. That is why judges decide individual  cases. We don't decide individual cases here; we make policy for broad  swathes of the American people. But judges decide cases based on a  controversy, a set of facts, and the application of the law to those  facts, which is, again, the antithesis of politics. That is what  judging is all about.   So the Supreme Court is not just another branch of government that  you can go to if you don't get your desired outcome in the political  branches. If you don't win the election, if you don't elect your like- minded representative, you are not supposed to just go to the Supreme  Court and say: OK, now you give me what I want because I couldn't get  it through the political branches.    The Supreme Court is not supposed to be a failsafe to be utilized to  deliver results that can't be secured through the legislative process.  Our democracy, equal justice under the law--that is what it says right  above the door of the Supreme Court of the United States: ``Equal  Justice Under Law''--can only be accomplished when the same law applies  to all of us. Cases are therefore decided based on their unique facts-- not on politics, not on personal preferences, not even on strongly held  personal beliefs. This is absolutely critical to our system of checks  and balances and the health of our democracy.   So I look forward to meeting Judge Jackson in person. I saw her  across the hearing room when she was before the Judiciary Committee  just about a year  [[Page S1085]]  ago. But I want to ask her a little more about her judicial philosophy  and how she views her role on the Supreme Court.   Now, some have suggested, since she has been confirmed to the circuit  court, that this ought to be a rubberstamp. Well, I don't view it that  way. Circuit court nominees and district court nominees have to apply  Supreme Court precedent, but when you are a member of the Supreme  Court, there is no higher court that dictates the decision or the  precedence you need to apply.   Now, ideally, you are applying the statutes and laws passed by  Congress and the Constitution itself, but there is admittedly more  flexibility for the nominee, which means her philosophy is even more  important to know now.   I tried to flesh out Judge Jackson's judicial philosophy during her  confirmation hearing for the DC Circuit Court. A number of us submitted  questions for the record asking her to clarify her judicial philosophy  and the way she interprets the Constitution.   We have heard a lot of testimony over the years about originalists  and textualists and different ways people approach their duties as a  judge.   I don't think Judge Jackson was particularly forthcoming with her  answers when we asked about her philosophy, and I ultimately voted  against her confirmation for the circuit court. Now, that vote is not  going to determine how I view her nomination to the Supreme Court, but  I think the question applies with even greater strength because she  will not be bound by Supreme Court precedent.   I know she will have plenty of time and plenty of opportunity to  clarify her views during the confirmation process, and I hope to see an  unvarnished look, beginning with our conversation tomorrow, on  Thursday.   I am also eager to learn more about Judge Jackson's views of the  Supreme Court as an institution, which has increasingly come under  attack by partisans, again, who don't particularly like the decisions  of the Court. But that is not supposed to be the test. The test is  whether they apply the Constitution and laws of the United States to  the facts found by the finder of fact.   There have actually been a number of calls here on the Senate and in  our political system in general to change the makeup of the Supreme  Court, to actually add additional Justices to the Court--something that  used to be called court packing back in the days of Franklin Delano  Roosevelt. But Justice Breyer, to his credit, whose seat Judge Jackson  has been nominated to fill, has been a steadfast defender of the  Supreme Court as an institution, and I hope soon-to-be-Justice Jackson  takes her cues from her mentor.   Justice Breyer echoed the comments of the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg  and warned about a potentially dangerous politicalization of the  Supreme Court and the consequential loss of public confidence in its  judgments. Well, I would like to know whether Judge Jackson agrees with  Justice Breyer and whether she shares Justice Ginsburg's assessment  that nine seems to be a good number when it comes to the Supreme Court.   In the coming days and weeks, the Senate will thoroughly review Judge  Jackson's qualifications, just as this body has done for every other  nominee to the Federal bench. This is a familiar process to most of us.  Judge Jackson is the fourth Supreme Court nominee we will have  considered in the last 5 years.   But I hope there is something we do differently this time than has  been done in the recent past, particularly in the case of Justice  Kavanaugh. Frankly, the confirmation process for Justice Kavanaugh was  an embarrassment and, I believe, a black mark on this Senate.  Conversely, I think we have an opportunity to show the American people  how to do it the right way and treat Judge Jackson with civility and  dignity, even when we disagree. We know that outside groups launched a  full-on character attack against Judge Kavanaugh. Even Justice Barrett,  more recently, was attacked based on her religious beliefs.   I can assure you that will not happen this time around. We will  meticulously review Judge Jackson's record. We will ask detailed  questions to understand her judicial philosophy. We will read and  review her opinions and carefully evaluate her ability to serve.  Through it all, there is no question that she will be treated with  dignity and respect.   I think the confirmation process must be thorough and it must be  civil. The American people and, frankly, the nominee deserves nothing  less. I am prepared to fulfill my advice and consent duties as a Member  of this body and as a member of the Judiciary Committee.   As we know, there is no particular timeline for this process. In some  cases, it moves quickly, and in others it has taken significantly more  time. Chairman Durbin has announced that the Judiciary Committee will  begin its confirmation hearing in the week of March 21, which doesn't  allow much more time for our colleagues to meet with Judge Jackson  before evaluating her record, and I know she has prioritized meeting  with Members of the Judiciary Committee. I hope she will have adequate  time to meet with other Members who are not on the Judiciary Committee,  as well.   I know our colleagues are anxious to expedite this process, but we  all know Justice Breyer will stay on the Court until the end of this  term, which will be the first week or so in July.   Justices do not have term limits. They are not held accountable on  elections, but they wield tremendous power under our Constitution. So  we have a duty, not necessarily to get it done fast but to get it done  right and thoroughly evaluate Judge Jackson's qualifications and ensure  that, if confirmed, she will serve as a fair and impartial member of  the Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.
