 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. This  push to remove the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights  Amendment is an unnecessary and unconstitutional power-grab.   This bill is unconstitutional. Congress set a deadline for the ERA;  it was 1979. With only 35 of the 38 States needed for ratification at  the time, Congress extended the deadline to 1982, but no other States  joined in, ending the ratification process for the equal rights  amendment.   Even the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that the  deadline for the ERA ratification had long passed. She said: ``I would  like to see a new beginning. I'd like it to start over. There's too  much controversy about latecomers--Virginia, long after the deadline  passed. Plus, a number of States have withdrawn their ratification. So,  if you count a latecomer on the plus side, how can you disregard States  that said, ``We've changed our minds?''' If my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle want to ratify the ERA, they have to start over.   Women also already have equal rights under the law. In decision after  decision, the United States Supreme Court has underscored that the 14th  Amendment to the United States Constitution gives women equal rights  and prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, rendering, I believe,  the ERA unnecessary.   Finally, if ratified, the ERA would be used to codify the right to  abortion, undoing pro-life protections, and forcing taxpayers to fund  abortions.   The New Mexico Supreme Court ruled that their State's ERA provision  required the State to fund abortions. Numerous pro-abortion groups have  already made the case for ratifying the ERA on the basis of expanding  their abortion agenda. Just listen to the words of the organizations  pushing this legislation themselves.   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, NARAL,  has claimed that, ``With its ratification, the ERA would reinforce the  constitutional right to abortion.''   Planned Parenthood and the Women's Law Project has said that State  bans and government funding of elective abortions are ``contrary to a  modern understanding of the ERA.''   The National Organization for Women has said, ``An ERA--properly  interpreted--could negate the hundreds of laws that have been passed  restricting access to abortion care and contraception.''   With this unconstitutional bill, my colleagues across the aisle are  hiding behind the rhetoric of equality for women to eliminate any and  all protections for unborn babies, half of which would be girls, then  women, if given the chance to live.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.                                time  1045     Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.   This version of the Violence Against Women Act does not protect  women. Instead, this bill puts partisan political priorities ahead of  women in need. While my colleagues on the other side of the aisle like  to claim they are the party of women, this partisan reauthorization  proves that they only put women first when it is convenient.   I am a survivor of domestic violence from a previous marriage. I was  afraid for my life, and I was afraid for my daughter's life.  Thankfully, I escaped that terrible situation. So I am intimately  familiar with the desperate situations many women who are victims of  domestic abuse face. As a domestic violence survivor, I know just how  important services and protections are to women across our Nation.   Previous reauthorizations of the Violence Against Women Act have been  bipartisan, but not this one. This version is filled with partisan  priorities that force women's domestic violence shelters to take in men  who identify as women, strip away protections for religious  organizations, and eliminate Second Amendment rights without due  process.   The most egregious provisions of this bill push leftist gender  ideology at the expense of important protections for women's privacy  and safety. Sex-segregated shelters provide a safe place for women who  have been abused, often at the hands of men, and offer them a sense of  privacy and security. If this bill is enacted, these shelters, under  penalty of Federal law, would be required to take in men and shelter  them with women, putting vulnerable women at risk.   Religious objections are also under attack in this legislation. This  bill excludes critical First Amendment protections for faith-based  organizations. This almost certainly guarantees that attacks on  religious organizations will continue over disagreements on religious  liberty and gender ideology.   This bill is also being used to change and erode Second Amendment  rights for everyone by introducing a new provision that would lower the  standard by which government can take away someone's right to bear arms  without due process, including for nonfelony crimes.   Passing legislation that supports women who have been victims of  domestic abuse, trafficking, and sexual assault should be a bipartisan  issue. In this partisan Violence Against Women  [[Page H1460]]  Act, women in need are not the priority. Leftist ideology is the  priority.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.
