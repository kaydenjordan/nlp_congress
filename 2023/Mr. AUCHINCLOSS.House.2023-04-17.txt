 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to a Texas judge's  attack on women's reproductive freedom. This ruling undermines proven  scientific research and needlessly restricts women's access to  healthcare.   Mifepristone is a safe and effective medication that has been used by  millions since it was approved by the FDA two decades ago. Medical  determinations should be left to medical professionals.  [[Page H1744]]    I am thankful for the work of the Healey administration in my home  State to insulate Massachusetts residents from this decision. The  Commonwealth must not let Texas set the agenda for women's healthcare.   I also strongly support the work of organizations like Mayday Health,  who are informing and empowering women to make their own decisions  about their reproductive health and working to get the medication  across State lines.   On the Federal level, I joined my colleagues in submitting an amicus  brief to the Supreme Court urging them to protect a woman's right to  choose. I will not stop fighting to ensure access to safe, effective  reproductive healthcare for all Americans.                            ____________________
