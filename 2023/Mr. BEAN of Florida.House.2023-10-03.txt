 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor one of the  best and brightest of Florida's Fourth Congressional District, Luke  Cooper.   Luke is an exceptional young man who was recently announced as a  silver medalist for the Congressional Award, one of the highest awards  Congress can bestow upon America's youth.   The Congressional Award Foundation was created to recognize  initiative, service, and achievement in young people. There are  exceptionally few who meet these lofty goals, and Luke is one of them.   He has given back to his local community by volunteering at Safe  Animal Shelter in Clay County, fostering cats and kittens until they  can find forever homes. Through his 150 hours of service, Luke has  helped with the shelter's efforts to care for homeless animals while  leaving a positive impact on his community.   As a volunteer at Clay County Teen Court, Luke has gained hands-on  experience with our judicial system and learned the necessary skills to  be a catalyst for a better tomorrow.   Beyond service to others, Luke has put in hundreds of hours of  personal development, including training for a 50-mile cycling  excursion and sharpening his problem-solving skills on the golf course.   A prime example of what students from Florida's Fourth Congressional  District are capable of, I am proud to congratulate Luke Cooper on his  impressive achievements.                     Honoring Jacksonville Exchange Club     Mr. Speaker, what do Hasbro, Warner Brothers,  Russell Stover, and the Jacksonville Exchange Club have in common?  Well, they all were started in 1923 and have thrived for 100 years.  They each represent the gold standard of service and success.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Jacksonville Exchange Club, an all- volunteer national service organization that has been providing  valuable services and programs to members of our community for 100  years.   Since 1923, the club has continued to expand and evolve, dedicating  their free time toward the pursuit of community projects that promote  volunteerism, good citizenship, and love of country.   With a strong belief that America's youth are the leaders of  tomorrow, club members actively seek out ways to inspire and engage  Jacksonville's youth with programs such as Student of the Year,  Accepting the Challenge of Excellence Award, and Americanism Speech  Contest.   The Jacksonville Exchange Club continues to not only make a  difference through their ongoing community service efforts but by  providing members with a space where they may gather, exchange ideas  and knowledge, and pursue the core principles envisioned by the club's  original members.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to ask my colleagues to join me in  celebrating this significant milestone of the Jacksonville Exchange  Club, its members, and the entire city of Jacksonville.   On its 100th anniversary, I wish the Jacksonville Exchange Club  continued growth and prosperity in the years ahead.                            ____________________
