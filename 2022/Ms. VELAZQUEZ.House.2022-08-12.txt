 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  historic legislation.   The climate crisis is the single-most important issue facing our  future, the future we will all share, Democrats and Republicans.   I understand this is a down payment on climate action and more needs  to be done, but let's focus on what this bill does. It lowers the cost  of healthcare and prescription drugs. It lowers energy costs and  delivers the largest-ever climate action by investing in domestic  energy production and manufacturing while reducing carbon emissions by  roughly 40 percent by 2030. It lowers the deficit and helps fight  inflation by making a historic payment on deficit reduction of $300  billion. We do this by making the biggest corporations and ultrawealthy  pay their fair share in taxes.   Enough with the fear-mongering by the other side. Let's get this done  on behalf of hardworking families across America.
