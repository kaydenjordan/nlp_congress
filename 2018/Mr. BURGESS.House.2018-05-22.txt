Sec. 6.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (S. 2155) to promote       economic growth, provide tailored regulatory relief, and       enhance consumer protections, and for other purposes. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived.

During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 905 provides for the  consideration of three important bills aimed at protecting our country,  reducing regulatory burdens in the financial sector, and allowing  patients who have nowhere else to turn with another option to  potentially save their lives.   These three bills, taken together, show House Republicans' commitment  to putting Americans' interests first.   Today's rule provides for a structured rule to begin consideration of  H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019.  The resolution grants 1 hour of debate equally divided between the  chair and ranking member of the House Committee on Armed Services.   In addition, as the first of two likely rules on the fiscal year 2019  NDAA, the rule provides for the consideration of 103 amendments to the  defense bill.   Along with the Defense Authorization Act, the resolution today  provides for a rule for House consideration of S. 2155, the Economic  Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the Senate- passed bipartisan bill to reduce the regulatory burdens imposed on  community and local banks by the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory  legislation.   The legislation went through rigorous debate in the House and the  Senate, and it mirrors in many ways the House-passed CHOICE Act, passed  by the House in the summer of 2017 under the stewardship of Financial  Services Chair Jeb Hensarling.   Moreover, the resolution before us provides for a rule to allow the  House to consider the unanimously passed Senate bill, S. 204, the  Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina  Right to Try Act of 2017.   This legislation, highlighted by the President during his last State  of the Union address, has been a top priority of the President for the  Congress, allowing terminally ill patients a last chance at survival  using a carefully crafted FDA process.   H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2019, would authorize appropriations for military activities of the  Department of Defense and for military construction, as well as  prescribe military personnel strengths for the next fiscal year.   This critical piece of legislation, one of the most important bills  that any Congress will consider in any year, provides the resources and  the direction necessary for our men and women in uniform to do what  they do best: protect and serve our country throughout the world.   As will be discussed by many Members of this body over this week,  this bill touches on all aspects of military policy, from the Middle  East to the Korean Peninsula to the Arctic waters.   Among the hundreds of amendments the Rules Committee is likely to  make in order on this legislation, I am pleased that, once again, my  amendment, offered with Ms. Lee, Mr. Lance, Mr. DeFazio, Mr. Jones, Mr.  Welch, Mr. Lewis, and Ms. Schakowsky, will again be made in order. This  continues to push the Department of Defense to finally complete a full  audit of its finances, as required by law.   S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer  Protection Act, corrects some of the more egregious provisions in the  Dodd-Frank financial regulatory legislation.   The bill focuses on regulatory relief on smaller financial  institutions--namely, community banks and credit unions--so they can  more readily meet the needs of their local communities without  burdensome Federal regulations stifling their economic growth. This  places the focus of the financial institutions back on their customers  instead of completing paperwork and answering to agencies in  Washington, D.C.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, our final bill in today's rule, S. 204, will  look familiar to many people here today, as we are again considering  legislation that would bring hope to terminally ill patients across our  country.   A similar bill, H.R. 5247, passed this House in March. Minority  Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats have refused to act on H.R.  5247, the revised version of the Right to Try legislation, which passed  the House 2 months ago on a strong bipartisan vote.   As this body had heard earlier this year, Right to Try was the one  piece of legislation that President Trump came and stood in the well of  this House and specifically promised to the American people in his  State of the Union address.   Today, I will say again what I said in March when we first took up  Right to Try: I stand with the President and I stand with the thousands  of Americans with terminal diseases and their families and their  friends in getting this important policy to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, when we pass this bill today, it doesn't go back to the  Senate. It has already been passed by the Senate. It goes immediately  down to the White House for a signature and becomes law.   Here is an interesting fact. In the last couple of months since the  House passed its Right to Try bill, even more States have joined this  strong grassroots movement. Now, 40 States, including my home State of  Texas, have passed and signed a version of Right to Try into law.   In nine other States, a version of Right to Try has already been  introduced, including the State of New York, which is the home State of  the minority leader of the United States Senate.   Last year, the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee held a hearing  on access to investigational drugs where S. 204 was discussed. At that  time, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Scott  Gottlieb, and other advocacy groups expressed concerns on the various  Right to Try bills introduced in the Senate and the House.   So, when the President asked the Congress to act, the House responded  by holding multistakeholder discussions with patient groups, medical  research advocates, and the administration in order to improve the  original Right to Try bill. I want to commend Chairman Walden for  leading these negotiations.   I am also proud of the revised Right to Try legislation that the  Energy and Commerce Committee produced because the policies were sound,  and I believe it was a positive step forward in granting access to new  treatments while allowing additional input from the Food and Drug  Administration.   Unfortunately, the minority party on the other side of the Capitol,  Senate Democrats, said ``no, thank you'' to the revised House bill.  While I am not surprised by their decision, I think the American  people, particularly patients  [[Page H4294]]  with terminal diseases and their loved ones, would not be satisfied  with a ``no, thank you'' nonaction by Congress on such an important  issue.   Today, the House is ready to act for the American people and will be  considering S. 204, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan  McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017.   This passed the Senate unanimously last August. This bill will offer  terminally ill patients a chance at life. After it passes this House,  it will be signed into law.   Our Nation has achieved unprecedented innovation and scientific  breakthroughs recently and over the course of the last decade. American  patients have widespread access to innovative treatments, thanks to  researchers and our academic institutions and those working in the  pharmaceutical and medical device industries.   Despite these achievements, we continue to hear from patients with  serious, life-threatening conditions, including my constituents from  north Texas, who remain frustrated with what they see as regulatory  barriers from trying new therapies when everything else has failed  them.   As a physician, I understand that access to investigational drugs and  therapies is a deeply personal priority for those seeking treatment for  loved ones diagnosed with very difficult diseases.   This crossroads where our Nation seems to be--when a potentially  lifesaving treatment, while not approved, both exists but remains  unavailable--is an important debate that we are having for these  Americans. To them, it is not only a matter of life or death but  another chance to spend more time with their children, grandchildren,  parents, and other family members.   Some of the opponents of Right to Try point to the Food and Drug  Administration's current expanded access program, which is aimed at  helping patients who do not qualify for clinical trials gain access to  therapies that the agency has yet to approve.   While this program makes a good faith effort to help patients, we can  do more by passing Right to Try and creating an alternative pathway for  these patients to access eligible investigational drugs.   Additionally, we know that many individuals may not qualify for a  clinical trial if they do not meet strict patient inclusion criteria,  which may include factors such as age, gender, type and stage of their  disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.   There are also many patients for whom participation in a clinical  trial is not feasible, especially those who live in rural areas far  from the clinical trial sites.   Most, if not all, of the patients with a terminal medical condition  fall into one of these categories. This legislation that we are doing  today allows these patients to participate in an alternative pathway,  opening another door to investigational drugs that does not exist  today.   While there are a few differences between S. 204 and the House-passed  Right to Try legislation, the underlying policies between the two bills  are very similar.   For example, only certain investigational drugs are considered  eligible under both bills. In order to qualify, the drug must have  completed a phase one clinical trial; have an active application at the  Food and Drug Administration; be under active development or production  by a manufacturer; and not have been approved, licensed, or cleared for  sale under current law.   Also, both bills require reporting of serious adverse events, having  written informed consent to the treating physician, and notifying the  agency when a sponsor provides an investigational drug.   Lastly, Commissioner Gottlieb at the Food and Drug Administration  recently expressed support for the Senate-passed Right to Try bill  being considered today and said that his agency could ensure an  appropriate level of patient safety through guidance and rulemaking.    In other words, while the Food and Drug Administration may have some  additional work, the key point is the agency can achieve the proper  balance of ensuring patient safety and granting access to new  investigational drugs.   I think the Commissioner would agree that we would have preferred the  revised House Right to Try legislation, but doing nothing is currently  not an option. Hundreds of thousands of Americans with terminal  illnesses and their families are looking for us to act. I support  restoring hope for these patients and giving them a fighting chance at  life.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members of this esteemed body to support today's  rule and all three underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds for purposes of  rebuttal before I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Budd).   As a point of situational awareness, as of last week, in this  Congress, over 1,000 amendments have been heard on the House floor: 47  percent Democratic, 41 percent Republican, 15 percent bipartisan.   For a point of reference, the last term that Nancy Pelosi was Speaker  of the House, the 111th Congress, less than 1,000 amendments for the  entire Congress. We passed that milestone prior to last week. We will  continue to hear amendments on the floor.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Budd).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes for the  purposes of a response.   I would, of course, lead with the observation that those who do not  remember their history are doomed to repeat it. I don't remember  precisely who said it, but I think it bears repeating today.   In the 111th Congress, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats allowed less  than a thousand amendments to be considered on the floor.   Of the bills that were considered at that time, the Dodd-Frank bill  was one of those bills. The amendments that were blocked by the  Democrats in the 111th Congress were precisely the type of amendments  that we are now considering today in the bill to alleviate some of the  obstructions, some of the gridlock that has occurred with our credit  unions and smaller banks--things that people have been asking us for  repeatedly for the last 5 to 7 years.   Mr. Speaker, the number of amendments that were blocked in the 111th  Congress was significant. We have a chance today to undo some of that  process, and I believe we ought to take that opportunity. As of 1\1/2\  weeks ago, over a thousand amendments had been made in order in this  Congress.   The Committee on Rules is run differently today than it was in the  111th Congress. It used to be that you had to submit 45 copies of an  amendment and you had a time limit by which you had to submit those  amendments. You can submit amendments late now.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to myself.   Chairman Sessions has been very accommodating in allowing us to bring  amendments to the Committee on Rules late.   There is no clock in the Committee on Rules, as the gentleman well  knows. You can talk as long as you want in the Committee on Rules about  your amendments, and you can offer whatever amendments you prefer.   The process is not ideal, but it is important that we move forward  with these important reforms that people have been asking us for years.  And, today, that day is at hand, and those reforms will be delivered.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1215     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, seeing no more speakers on my side, I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to reiterate, the Rules Committee has spent  hours listening and considering Member testimony. We have welcomed over  225 Members to testify during this Congress, and roughly 493 times have  made over 1,000 amendments in order, including 474 from Democrats, 383  from Republicans, and over 150 which were bipartisan amendments.   The rule today is important, three important pieces of legislation.   The National Defense Authorization Act. Our number one priority when  we are elected to this body is the defense  [[Page H4300]]  of our Nation, and we are authorizing that expenditure today.   The bill to reform the financial services institutions is one that  has been requested by small banks and credit unions for years, and this  body is today prepared to deliver.   Then finally, the Right to Try Act. The President stood in the State  of the Union message and said that it was not correct that people had  to go to other countries in order to get the medicines that they needed  to prolong their lives. He wanted that to end, and today we are taking  the step to end that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support today's rule and the  three underlying pieces of legislation   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An amendment to H. Res. 905 offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       20) to reform the financing of congressional elections by       broadening participation by small dollar donors, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and       controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committees on House Administration, Energy and       Commerce, and Ways and Means. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 20.          The Vote on The Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 210.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill  [[Page H4350]]  (S. 292) to maximize discovery, and accelerate development and  availability, of promising childhood cancer treatments, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 292         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we are here to debate the Childhood Cancer  Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research Act, also known as the  Childhood Cancer STAR Act.   Each of us knows someone who has suffered from cancer, whether it is  a family member, friend, patient, or loved one. It is especially heart- wrenching to watch children go through a cancer diagnosis and cancer  treatment.   The bill we are considering today is for our children, the future of  our Nation. I would like to acknowledge and thank my fellow Texan,  Congressman  Michael McCaul, for leading our work to deliver hope to  America's youngest cancer patients.   Congress has done remarkable work to pass legislation such as the  21st Century Cures Act, which provided Americans with great hope that  increased investment in biomedical research would lead to treatment and  even cures for our most devastating diseases.   The 21st Century Cures Act authorized over $4.5 billion in new  funding for the National Institutes of Health, including nearly $2  billion for the Cancer Moonshot.   The Childhood Cancer STAR Act builds upon the mission of 21st Century  Cures but focuses on empowering the National Institutes of Health and  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increase the amount  of research and surveillance for cancer in children, adolescents, and  young adults.   Groundbreaking discoveries rely on robust and reliable investment in  research, and this requires robust and reliable dollars for research.   This bill authorizes $30 million a year through fiscal year 2023 for  the National Childhood Cancer Registry, which will provide grant  funding for the purpose of collecting information to better understand  the epidemiology of cancer in children, adolescents, and young adults.   The bill also authorizes the National Cancer Institute at the  National Institutes of Health to make awards that will support  childhood cancer biorepositories, giving physicians and researchers  tools to better understand these diseases.   Mr. Speaker, it is vital that physicians and their teams can provide  comprehensive and coordinated care for pediatric cancer patients. The  bill allows the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human  Services to make grants to establish pilot programs to develop, study,  or evaluate model systems to improve the quality and the efficiency of  care for childhood cancer survivors.   It also provides for greater efficiency and coordination of care for  those survivors as they transition into adulthood and for the Secretary  to work with experts to identify best practices.   Similarly, this bill gives the National Institutes of Health Director  the authority to make grants to programs that conduct or support  research relating to pediatric cancer survivors.   As I have said, this legislation is for our children. It is for the  families that are building our Nation's future. If we can ensure that  these young patients receive treatment and cures for childhood cancer,  they may grow up to become biomedical researchers who will find the  next generation of cures; they may write the next great American  classic; they may become prima ballerinas, Olympic athletes, or all of  the above.   This legislation is for kids like Sadie. Sadie was diagnosed with  ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, on February 25, 2015. She was just 7  years old at the time. This young north Texan fought through  infections, blood transfusions, and rare side effects. She missed out  on second grade and she missed out on third grade as she underwent  weekly chemotherapy sessions.   Today, it is my great joy to share that Sadie beat the odds and Sadie  survived leukemia. She received her last chemotherapy treatment May 26,  2017. Now, at 10 years old, Sadie is able to live the life of a normal  kid.   I would like to thank Sadie and her family for their willingness to  share their story and for their advocacy in support of this important  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I met Sadie in my office last spring, and I was inspired  by her story. She started a nonprofit, the Sadie Keller Foundation, to  raise money to help other kids who are facing cancer. Her mission is  pretty simple. It is to put a smile on the faces of children fighting  cancer all over the country and to remind them to keep fighting.   So, today, I urge Members of Congress to support this important  bipartisan legislation. In sending this bill to the President's desk,  we will help Sadie achieve her mission of putting a smile on the faces  of children fighting cancer. We will provide families across this  country with hope for a better tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the full  committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance), vice chairman of one of our subcommittees.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. McCaul), chairman of the House Committee on Homeland  Security, fellow Texan, and the principal author of the bill that we  have before us today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe).    Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to express my strong support  for S. 292, the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and  Research Act of 2018, Childhood Cancer STAR Act.   And, once again, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. McCaul), for spearheading this effort.   I urge all my colleagues to support the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 905, I call up  the bill (S. 204) to authorize the use of unapproved medical products  by patients diagnosed with a terminal illness in accordance with State  law, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in  the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  insert extraneous material into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, here in the people's House, we reflect the will of the  American people. When the Right to Try Act is law in 40 States, it may  no longer just be a grassroots movement. It is a call to action from  Americans from coast to coast--many of the over 1 million Americans who  die from a terminal illness every year--to return choice and control  over treatment options to where it is most effective: with the patient,  with the doctor.   Today, the House is taking up the Right to Try Act for the third  time. But the reason we are here again debating this issue is because  of the Senate Democrats' refusal to take up the revised right-to-try  legislation that passed this House by a bipartisan vote 2 months ago.   That revised bill, H.R. 5247, was more narrowly crafted than this  version of S. 204.   This version, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn,  and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, is before us today. S.  204 was authored by Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and passed by  unanimous consent in the Senate last August.   I think it is important, so let me take a moment to lay out the  efforts by the Energy and Commerce Committee since that time.   First, the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, which I chair,  held a hearing last October to consider right-to-try bills, including  this bill, S. 204, where Members heard from Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the  Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, from patients and  other groups that either support or oppose the concept of right to try.   For several months, our committee engaged in conversations with  patients, advocates, the administration, particularly the Food and Drug  Administration, and stakeholders on all sides of this complex topic.   Our aim was to open the door to innovative, experimental drugs for  terminally ill patients without necessarily compromising the vital work  and mission of the Food and Drug Administration. The product of that  aim was H.R. 5247, the revised House right-to-try bill.   Sadly, Senate Democrats said ``thanks, but no thanks'' to the House  bill. Frankly, I am perplexed by their decision, because not a single  Senate Democrat expressed any reservation when S. 204 passed their  Chamber by unanimous consent last August.   So House Republicans will show the American people that we hear you.  We will act to deliver on a promise made by the President in this House  before the joint session of the House and Senate during the State of  the Union address. He told us that we would pass the right-to-try  legislation. Well, today, we are doing just that.   You know, this was kind of a bold statement by the President, to  stand up in the State of the Union and say that he wanted to sign this  bill into law. So I am proud to boldly stand with him and stand with  the American people.   Mr. Speaker, we live in the greatest Nation in the world. An  unprecedented amount of innovation and scientific breakthrough is the  norm. We have innovative treatments at our fingertips because of the  valuable contributions of researchers in academia and the private  sector.   Despite these achievements, I still hear from patients with serious,  life-threatening conditions, including constituents from north Texas,  who remain frustrated with the current regulatory processes that  prevent them from trying or experimenting with new therapies when  everything else has failed them.   As a physician, I understand that access to investigational drugs and  therapies is a deeply personal priority for those seeking treatment for  their loved ones with serious terminal conditions.   To my friends on the other side of the dais in the committee and the  aisle here in the House, I have a simple question: Why do you not want  to allow these patients to exercise their right to fight for  their future?    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H.R. 5247, the House right-to-try  bill that currently remains in the Senate.   However, the right-to-try legislation before the House today is the  Senate bill, S. 204, so I am pleased that we are considering this  right-to-try bill so that terminally ill patients have a chance, maybe  a second chance, at life.   These patients are our constituents. They could be someone we know.  Let us take this opportunity to improve access to experimental  treatments for them and give them renewed hope.   S. 204 establishes an alternative pathway for terminally ill patients  to access certain investigational drugs that have successfully  completed a phase one clinical trial and have an active application at  the Food and Drug Administration. They also must be under active  development or production by the manufacturer.   It is important to note that, for these patients, they have exhausted  all FDA-approved treatment options and are unable to participate in a  clinical trial involving these investigational drugs.   The bill we will be voting out soon is about patients. It is about  having more  [[Page H4357]]  time with their loved ones. In the words of Vice President Mike Pence,  ``It's about restoring hope and giving patients with life-threatening  diseases a fighting chance.''   With hundreds of thousands of Americans with a terminal illness and  their families looking for us to act, I urge Members of this House, the  people's House, to support restoring hope and giving them a fighting  chance at life.   I urge a vote in support of S. 204. Let us send this groundbreaking  legislation to the President's desk for his signature, and let it  become the law of the land.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton), the vice chairman of the full  committee and chairman emeritus of the Energy and Commerce Committee.   (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), a valuable member of the Health Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), another principal author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, I want to read from the Statement of Administration  Policy that was put out by the Executive Office of the President.   The last paragraph:   Since the late 1980s, the Food and Drug Administration has  facilitated access to investigational drugs, devices, and biological  products for the treatment of seriously ill patients. Families in these  situations have sometimes found this process challenging, and the Food  and Drug Administration is constantly striving to make improvements to  its expanded access program. Some patients and their families, however,  still have challenges accessing investigational treatments. The  administration believes that the treatment decisions for those facing  terminal illnesses are best made by the patients with the support and  the guidance of their treating physicians. This legislation will  advance those principles.   Mr. Speaker, that is from the Statement of Administration Policy, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, on January 30 of this year, the President of the United  States came to this House and addressed a joint session of the House  and Senate in the State of the Union address, and he said, right from  that podium, ``People who are terminally ill should not have to go from  country to country to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance right  here at home. It is time for Congress to give these wonderful Americans  the right to try.''   Mr. Speaker, I couldn't say it any better than the President has  already put it. The Right to Try Act is before us. It is a good bill.  The House needs to support it, and it will go to the President for his  signature.  [[Page H4363]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  motion.    Mr. Speaker, while the motion to recommit may be well  intentioned, it has a practical effect of killing this bill because the  Senate has rejected House attempts to refine the Senate bill that was  passed by unanimous consent last August. So if you want to provide that  right to try for patients, this is the vehicle.   Now, interestingly enough, the Food and Drug Administration  Administrator, this morning, Dr. Gottlieb, put out a statement. He said  that he is: ``. . . ready to implement it in a way that achieves  Congress' intent to promote access and protect patients; and build on  FDA's longstanding commitment to these important goals.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge people to vote against the motion to recommit and  vote for the underlying bill. Let's give patients that expanded access,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
