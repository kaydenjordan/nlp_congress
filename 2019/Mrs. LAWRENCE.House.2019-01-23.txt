 Mr. Speaker, I rise today addressing the damaging  impact of Trump's senseless shutdown in the State of Michigan and in  the 14th District.   Thirty days and Trump continues to hold the American people hostage  over a wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for. Over 5,000 workers in  the State of Michigan continue to suffer.   My constituents are suffering the hardships because of this shutdown.  A constituent from Southfield, Michigan, wrote:        I have worked for the Federal Government for over 30 years.       I have given 100 percent in my career with the IRS, and now I       am facing the possibility of not being able to pay my       mortgage because of this shutdown.   Our Federal Government is supported by a devoted workforce who are  feeling like they have been taken for granted and used. This is  unacceptable. Our hardworking Federal employees deserve so much better.   This shutdown is causing chaos and pain for our dedicated Federal  workers in America. It must stop.                            ____________________
