 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the work of President  Biden to make our communities safer.   First, the American Rescue Plan provided $350 billion for States and  cities to help Americans. Funding from this plan has been used to hire  more police officers and first responders.   Second, President Biden's work led to the bipartisan efforts to keep  guns out of the hands of criminals. His work expanded background checks  for gun purchases, funded crisis intervention, and protected victims  from domestic violence.   In addition, President Biden has cracked down on illegal gun sales  and the production of ghost guns to keep them off of our streets. He  continues to provide necessary funding for police officers and other  law enforcement officials, and he has made unprecedented investments in  community-based crime prevention initiatives.   As a Congressman committed to reducing gun violence, I applaud  President Biden's successful efforts to make our country safer.  [[Page H2442]]                                ____________________
