 Madam Speaker, as we head into Memorial Day weekend, I  want to honor an American hero who paid the ultimate sacrifice in  service to our country.   Radioman 3rd Class Dante Tini from Virginia, Minnesota, was stationed  aboard the USS Oklahoma in Pearl Harbor on Sunday, December 7, 1941,  when torpedoes ripped through the hull of the ship. Thirteen days  later, he was declared missing in action. He was just 19 years old.   For 77 years, Dante Tini's family prayed for answers and closure.  Just last year, Dante's remains were matched with his family, beginning  the process of returning him home.  [[Page H4112]]    This Saturday, Dante Tini will be laid to rest next to his parents in  his hometown of Virginia, Minnesota, which was his wish when he  enlisted.   It was an honor and privilege for my office to help in coordinating  this effort, and we look forward to this Saturday when we join his  family to welcome him home.   While this Memorial Day is a special day to pay tribute to the  fallen, it is important to keep their memory alive and to pay tribute  to these special Americans like Dante Tini year-round.   God bless the family of Dante Tini, and I ask for continued prayers  for our country.                            ____________________
