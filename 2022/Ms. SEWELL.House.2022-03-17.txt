 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a true civil rights  pioneer, Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, ahead of what would have been his  100th birthday on Friday, March 18.   Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth was a civil rights activist who led the  fight against segregation and other forms of racism as a minister in  Birmingham, Alabama. He was a cofounder of the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference, initiated and was instrumental in the 1963  Birmingham campaign, also known as Project C, for confrontation, to  desegregate the city of Birmingham.   Regarded as one of the most courageous civil rights fighters in the  South by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Reverend Shuttlesworth was a  fearless freedom fighter who always stood up for what is right.   Shuttlesworth participated in the sit-ins against segregated lunch  counters in 1960 and took part in the organization and completion of  the Freedom Riders in 1961.   Throughout his amazing career, despite experiencing violent  intimidation and numerous attempts on his life, Reverend Shuttlesworth  remained vigilant in his fight for civil rights. The noted pastor of  the Bethel Baptist Church is recognized as the key leader and organizer  of the civil rights movement in Birmingham, Alabama.   In recognition of his lifelong dedication, President Clinton awarded  Reverend Shuttlesworth the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2001. Shortly  after, in 2008, the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport was  named in his honor.   Although Reverend Shuttlesworth died at the age of 89 on October 5 of  2011, he has a long list of accomplishments. To that, the city of  Birmingham is designating this Friday, March 18, as the Reverend  Shuttlesworth Day in honor of the 100th anniversary of his birthday.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me and the city of  Birmingham to pay tribute to the extraordinary life and legacy of  Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth as we designate March 18 as Reverend  Shuttlesworth Day.                         Honoring Mrs. Beatrice Price     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable life  and legacy of Beatrice Price, a pioneering Army nurse to the Tuskegee  Airmen during World War II, who passed away at the age of 98 on March  4, 2022.   Joining the military shortly after completing nursing school, Mrs.  Price  [[Page H3782]]  honorably served alongside the legendary Tuskegee Airmen until her  discharge in 1948.   A trailblazer and pioneer in the field of nursing, Mrs. Price had a  stellar 42-year career in nursing, spending more than 34 years working  at the Birmingham VA Medical Center where she once again cared for our  servicemen and servicewomen with great distinction until her retirement  in January of 1988.   On a personal note, Mrs. Price was a source of great inspiration for  me and so many young women. She was devoted to her church, her family,  and her service to this Nation. A woman of tremendous faith, Mrs. Price  served honorably during World War II alongside the legendary Tuskegee  Airmen.   As Alabama's first Black Congresswoman, it was my high honor to  bestow upon her a Congressional Gold Medal for her courage, bravery,  and exemplary service. I was also thrilled to host Mrs. Price in  Washington at the State of the Union in 2013.   For her many accomplishments, Mrs. Price was always gracious, always  compassionate, and always humble. I am eternally grateful for our  friendship, her mentorship, and our special bond. I thank her family  for sharing her with the world.   May we find comfort in knowing that she lived a full and blessed  life. Her legacy will live on in the hearts and actions of those she  impacted. Rest in peace and power, thy good and faithful servant.   On behalf of Alabama's Seventh Congressional District, I ask my  colleagues to join me in recognizing the extraordinary life and legacy  of Mrs. Beatrice Price and her tremendous service to this Nation.                            ____________________
