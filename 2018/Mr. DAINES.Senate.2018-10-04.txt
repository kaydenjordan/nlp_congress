 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Leland Paul Cade of Golden Valley County for his impact on  the surrounding central Montana region.   Leland was born in 1925 on the Cade homestead just North of Lavina,  MT. He was the third child of five. Leland often recalls the days of  having no car and having to harness a team up to the wagon. Years  later, he recalled what a challenge it was for a kid from a homestead  that had no electricity or running water to learn to use flush toilets  with paper on a roll and faucets with hot and cold water.   Leland graduated from Lavina High School in 1942. Directly after  graduation, Leland enlisted in the Army, where his main job was to be a  horse trainer. After being discharged from the Army, Leland attended  Montana State College in Bozeman, graduating in 1950 with a degree in  agriculture. He went on to work as an extension agent for the next 16  years. Later he went and worked as the editor for the Montana Farmer- Stockman, located in Billings. During this time, he continued his  commitment to education and improving the farm and ranch economy  throughout Montana and the West.   Leland has published 11 books on the homestead era. His recognition  of the homesteaders on the eastern Montana plains has helped educated a  great many people. Along with his publications, Leland also helped  found the Museum of the Northern Great Plains in Fort Benton.   Leland Cade is truly a son of Montana, born and raised on that short  grass prairie north of Billings, a testament to all that embodies  Montana. I congratulate Leland on his lifelong commitment to  agriculture and education.                            ____________________
