 Madam President, I would like to thank my friend Senator  Murray for organizing this block of time for us--you have just heard  from Senator Warren--and for all the work Senator Murray has done to  fight for women all across the country.   Today's debate is the latest battle in the continuing assault on a  women's constitutionally protected right to an abortion. As decided by  the Supreme Court in Roe and reaffirmed in Casey, the right to an  abortion is rooted fundamentally in a women's right to privacy, but the  Supreme Court's recognition of this constitutionally protected right  has not prevented continuous efforts to limit that right.   I ask my Republican colleagues who are on a mission to limit a  woman's constitutional right to choose: What is more private than a  person's right to her own body--not just to control her body but to  literally own her body? What could be more private than that? That is  what is at stake as we debate the bill before us today.   My home State of Hawaii was the first State in the country to  legalize abortion, and it continues to be at the forefront of  protecting, expanding, and preserving this constitutional right. But  for every law we fought to pass, we have had to fight just as hard to  beat back a wide range of anti-choice legislation.   Republican-controlled State legislatures have enacted hundreds of  limitations on choice. These efforts have not abated in the States or  even in Congress. Courts have deemed many of these laws  unconstitutional. That is why Donald Trump and the entire conservative  movement have prioritized selecting, appointing, and confirming judges  who are ideologically sympathetic to their views on choice.   The Trump administration is also eroding this right through Executive  action. In one prominent example last year, a senior official at the  Department of Health and Human Services went to court to impose his own  ideological views to prevent a young woman in his care from obtaining  an abortion after forcing her to undergo anti-abortion counseling.  Fortunately, the DC Circuit Court stopped this official from forcing  this young woman to be pregnant against her will.   The Republican Congress is complicit as well. Over the past 7 years  of Republican control, the House and Senate voted to defund Planned  Parenthood more than 20 times.   I understand that this is an emotionally charged issue and that each  of us has strongly held and sincere positions, but it really shouldn't  be too much to ask for my colleagues to stay out of my private life and  the private lives of women all across the country. That is called  respecting each other's views. Why should we institutionally force  other people who do not share your views to basically have to live with  your version of the choices that we all ought to be able to make in our  lives?   The bill we are debating today would jeopardize the health and safety  of women by establishing a nationwide ban on abortion care after 20  weeks. This bill is arbitrary, and it is not meaningfully different  from the Arizona law deemed unconstitutional by the Ninth Circuit in  2014, a case that the Supreme Court let stand.   This bill fails to account for the reasons why a woman might seek an  abortion after 20 weeks, and it restricts the ability of women to make  the best decisions for themselves and their families.   This bill includes no exception allowing for abortion in the case  where the pregnancy is a risk to the woman's health. Instead, a doctor  would only be able to provide care after establishing that a woman  would die--would die--or suffer life-threatening injuries without an  abortion. How cruel can this bill be that the only exception is when a  woman is about to die before she can get the care she needs?   To make matters worse, this bill places additional burdens on women  who survive the horrors of sexual assault. Under this bill, a sexual  assault survivor must provide written proof she had obtained counseling  or medical treatment to receive an abortion. However, a woman's own OB/ GYN could not provide this counseling if he or she provides abortion  services or, even worse, has a practice that provides them.   Adult women who are able to qualify under these outrageous conditions  would still have to wait 48 hours before they could receive abortion  care.   If the survivor is a minor, the law establishes an additional burden  to prove she reported the crime to the authorities. According to the  Department of Justice, only 35 percent of women who are raped and  sexually assaulted report the crime to the police.   Victims of incest who are over 18 would also not be specifically  permitted an exception under this bill.   This legislation would even threaten doctors with fines and/or  imprisonment for providing abortion services to women who do not meet  the bill's narrow exceptions after 20 weeks.   But the outrage doesn't end there. This bill does not contain an  exception for cases where a woman's fetus is not developing properly  and has no chance at living after birth. Many of the women in these  circumstances desperately wanted the pregnancies they are choosing to  terminate.   Last year, I read a moving account from Meredith Isaksen, an English  instructor at Berkeley City College, who shared her personal and  heartbreaking story in an essay in the New York Times.   I ask unanimous consent that a copy of her essay be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Oct. 20, 2016]               Late-Term Abortion Was the Right Choice for Me                           (By Meredith Isaksen)         Berkeley, CA.--I was 21 weeks pregnant when a doctor told       my husband and me that our second little boy was missing half       his heart. It had stopped growing correctly around five weeks       gestation, but the abnormality was not detectable until the       20-week anatomy scan. It was very unlikely that our baby       would survive delivery, and if he did, he would ultimately       need a heart transplant.        In the days that followed, after the poking and prodding,       after the meetings with pediatric cardiologists,       cardiothoracic surgeons and geneticists, my husband and I       decided to terminate our pregnancy. I was 22 weeks pregnant       when they wheeled me into the operating room, two weeks shy       of viability in the state of California.        For us, the decision was about compassion for our unborn       baby, who would face overwhelming and horribly painful       obstacles. Compassion for our 2-year-old son, who would       contend with hours upon hours in a hospital, missing out on       invaluable time spent with his parents, and the death of a       very real sibling. It was about compassion for our marriage.       Perhaps most important, it was about our belief that       parenthood sometimes means we sacrifice our own dreams so our       children don't have to suffer.        As the day of my termination approached and I felt my       baby's kicks and wiggles, I simultaneously wanted to crawl       out of my skin and suspend us together in time. I wanted him       to know how important he was to me, that the well of my grief       and love for him would stretch deeper and deeper into the       vastness of our family's small yet limitless life. He may       have moved inside me for only five months, but he had touched       and shaped me in ways I could never have imagined.        To Donald J. Trump and politicians like him, a late-term       abortion is the stuff of '80s slasher films. ``You can take       the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother,''       Mr. Trump said during Wednesday night's debate, a description       void of consideration for women, medical professionals or the       truth. Such politicians would have you believe that women       like me shouldn't get to make the choice I made. That our       baby, despite his tiny misshapen heart and nonexistent aorta,       should have a chance ``to live,'' even though that life might       have lasted mere minutes. Even though that life would have       been excruciatingly painful. These politicians are ignorant       of the sacrifices and blessings that come with carrying a       pregnancy (let alone a nonviable pregnancy). They do not       understand that a majority of women who have late-term       abortions are terminating desperately wanted pregnancies.        I am fortunate to live in a state that allows abortions       after 20 weeks. At least 13 states restrict such procedures;       15 more have moved to defund Planned Parenthood, where many       low-income women go for reproductive care.        Many women have made the kind of difficult decision I had       to make. When it happens to you, they come out of the       woodwork. Friends, neighbors, colleagues. A friend of my       mother-in-law said to me early on, ``You will always carry       this loss, but someday, it won't define you.''        As the two-year anniversary of my abortion approaches, I       can say without a shadow of a doubt that we made the right       decision for our family--and that our government has       absolutely no place in the anguish which accompanies a late-      term abortion, except to ensure that women and their families       have the right to make their choice safely and privately.  [[Page S535]]         Saying goodbye to our boy was the single most difficult and       profound experience of my life, and the truth is, it has come       to define me. Today I am a better mother because of him. I am       a better wife, daughter and friend. He made me more       compassionate and more patient. He taught me to love with       reckless abandon, despite the knowledge that I could lose it       all.        We named him Lev, the Hebrew word for heart.     Meredith was 21 weeks pregnant when she learned that her  second baby boy was missing half of his heart. It had stopped growing  properly at around 5 weeks, but it wasn't detectable until her 20-week  anatomy scan. Meredith's decision to terminate her pregnancy was an  agonizing one, but as she weighed her options, she reflected on the  meaning of compassion, and she said:         For us, the decision was about compassion for our unborn       baby, who would face overwhelming and horribly painful       obstacles. Compassion for our 2-year-old son, who would       contend with hours upon hours in a hospital, missing out on       invaluable time spent with his parents, and the death of a       very real sibling. It was about compassion for our marriage.       Perhaps most important, it was about our belief that       parenthood sometimes means we sacrifice our own dreams so our       children don't have to suffer.    Meredith asserted--and I agree--that our government has no place in  the anguish that accompanied her decision to have an abortion.   Meredith closed her essay with a very poignant reflection on her own  experience 2 years later. She wrote:         Saying goodbye to our boy was the single most difficult and       profound experience of my life, and the truth is, it has come       to define me. Today I am a better mother because of him. I am       a better wife, daughter and friend. He made me more       compassionate and more patient. He taught me to love with       reckless abandon, despite the knowledge that I could lose it       all.    Meredith and her husband named him Lev, the Hebrew word for  ``heart.''   Meredith was fortunate in that she lived in a State that permitted  abortions past 20 weeks. Thirteen States have established a 20-week  abortion ban, and the women living in those States have suffered as a  result. Think about all the Merediths in those 13 States and many  others.   Recently, I heard from Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi, an OB/GYN who has  practiced medicine in Texas, which has a 20-week abortion ban, and in  Hawaii, a State that has strong protections for women seeking to  exercise their constitutional right to an abortion. Her experience  clarifies why it is so urgent that we defeat this bill.   Dr. Moayedi shared a story of a young woman in her town who sought  medical treatment at a medical provider after her water broke at 22  weeks. This was in Texas. Although she desperately wanted her  pregnancy, her fetus was not viable outside the womb. Because of the  Texas law, this patient's doctors were unable to counsel her on all  medically appropriate options, such as immediate delivery. As she  became increasingly ill, the patient requested an abortion to prevent  her condition from getting worse. The doctors on her case refused.  After spending 2 weeks in a hospital intensive care unit, this woman  was transferred to Dr. Moayedi's care, where she ultimately had to have  both her hands and feet amputated due to severe infection. She also  lost her baby.   Dr. Moayedi recently moved from Texas to Hawaii, where she now  provides lifesaving abortion care to women at all stages of pregnancy.   Recently, Dr. Moayedi had a patient with a desired pregnancy who was  flown in from a neighbor island for management of her pre-viable labor.  Despite the expert, specialist care she received, the patient's water  broke at 22 weeks. At that point, there was nothing Dr. Moayedi could  do to prevent labor. Because abortion is legal after 20 weeks in  Hawaii, Dr. Moayedi was able to provide lifesaving abortion care for  her patient and prevent her from developing a massive infection.   Dr. Moayedi put it plainly in her note: ``Restrictions on abortion  care endanger the lives of my patients.''   ``Restrictions on abortion care endanger the lives of my patients.''  And that is exactly what this bill will do. It will endanger the lives  of millions of women in this country who do not--who do not--make the  decision to have an abortion after 20 weeks lightly. As my colleague  from Massachusetts said, most abortions take place before 20 weeks.   We are passing a cruel, unconscionable, and indeed unconstitutional  law. Why are we doing that? Why these continuing attacks on a woman's  health, her economic well-being, and her ability to control her own  body?   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this unconscionable bill.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.
