 Mr. President, today I honor and pay tribute to American  Dr. Carolyn Bertozzi. Dr. Bertozzi was awarded the Nobel Prize in  Chemistry 2022 for her outstanding work and dedication to chemical  biology research.   Dr. Carolyn Bertozzi is the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of  Chemistry and Professor of Chemical and Systems Biology and Radiology  at Stanford University. She is also the Baker Family Director at  Sarafan ChEM-H at Stanford and an investigator of the Howard Hughes  Medical Institute. She completed her undergraduate education in  chemistry at Harvard University before earning her Ph.D. in chemistry  at UC Berkeley. Following postdoctoral study at UCSF, she returned to  Berkeley as a professor in the college of chemistry and led  groundbreaking investigations published in major scientific journals.  She is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, the  American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the German Academy of  Sciences Leopardine. She has also received countless awards, including  most recently the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.   The Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2022 is a distinguished honor  awarded to Drs. Carolyn Bertozzi, Morten Meldal, and K. Barry Sharpless  for the development of click chemistry and biorthogonal chemistry.  After Meldal and Sharpless laid the foundation of click chemistry,  Bertozzi used click chemistry to study cellular reactions. Cellular  machinery that modifies proteins with specific carbohydrates is now  leveraged for targeted treatment of cancer and other conditions. I  applaud her commitment to this lifesaving invention.   It is a privilege to commemorate Dr. Bertozzi's Nobel Prize in  Chemistry. Her students and peers are inspired by her dedication to her  students and research. As a physician and husband of a breast cancer  surgeon, I admire her exemplary work on click chemistry and its  application to cancer treatment research. I am honored to recognize her  today.                            ____________________
