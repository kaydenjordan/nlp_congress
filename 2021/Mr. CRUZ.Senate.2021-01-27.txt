 Madam President, the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 became public law on  January 1, 2021, and included reforms to the U.S. Agency for Global  Media outlined in section 1299Q. The FY21 consolidated appropriations  act became public law on December 27, 2020, and included language that  would have delayed those reforms had they already been in law, but they  were not. Reserving any concerns about the lawfulness of insulating  Senate-confirmed officers from removal, I believe it is Congress's  intent that these two provisions should not be understood concurrently  and that the reforms outlined in section 1299Q shall take effect on the  date of enactment of the fiscal year 2021 NDAA.                            ____________________
