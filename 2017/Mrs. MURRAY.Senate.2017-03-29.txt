 Mr. President, I am deeply frustrated that Republicans,  in one of their first actions following their and President Trump's  disastrous attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, have decided to  bring to the floor yet another CRA that would hurt workers, hurt the  middle class, and hurt our economy.   Last week, millions of families sent a very clear message to  President Trump and Republicans: Enough with the attempts to turn back  the clock on progress for working families.   Clearly, President Trump and Republicans are not getting the message  because, today, in what can only be described as a truly shameless  giveaway to Wall Street, Republicans are poised to roll back a rule  that would, simply, allow cities to help small businesses provide their  workers access to easy, affordable, and high-quality retirement savings  programs.   Before I continue, I want to reiterate what is at stake if  Republicans roll back this rule. If Republicans pass this anti-worker  resolution that is on the floor today, over 2 million workers in  Philadelphia, in New York City, and in  [[Page S2076]]  Seattle--in my home State of Washington--will lose the opportunity to  access a retirement savings program.   I expect my Republican colleagues to make several claims as to why  they are pushing to repeal this rule, but I want to be very clear that  this is a deliberate attempt by Republicans to deny millions of workers  the opportunity to save for retirement just to ensure that Wall Street  remains in charge of our retirement system and can continue to write  its own rules.   The 2 million workers who are at risk today in these three cities are  part of the nearly 55 million workers across the country, which include  2 million workers in my home State of Washington, who do not have  access to a workplace retirement plan through their employers. That is  about one-third of all of the workers in our country. These are  workers--particularly low-income and young workers--who are putting in  long hours, meeting all of their responsibilities, but who lack access  to an employer-sponsored retirement plan.   Because Congress has been unable to come together to address our  retirement savings crisis, cities and States have now stepped up to  help more workers save for their own retirements. These programs vary,  but they all generally include several things.   First of all, they allow employers to automatically enroll workers  while giving workers the opportunity to opt out. Several studies have  made clear that, when workers are automatically enrolled, they are more  likely to save simply because it is easier to save. We all want that,  and that is a fact.   Secondly, these programs apply only to businesses that do not  currently offer retirement plans, and they, in no way, limit an  employer's ability to seek out and offer its own employer-sponsored  plan.   Lastly, these programs are worker and business friendly. There is  little paperwork required for workers to participate in the programs,  and there are no added burdens to the small businesses. In fact, in  these programs, employers are strictly required to serve only in an  administrative capacity.   Last year, Democrats, in their working with the previous  administration, pushed for guidance to provide certainty to cities and  States that have launched their own retirement programs.   This guidance clarifies an existing safe harbor that allows employers  to establish payroll deduction IRAs, which gives States the clarity  that these programs will not be preempted by Federal retirement law  while still retaining the protections under the Internal Revenue Code.  These retirement programs are safe; they are secure. This guidance  merely provides flexibility to cities and States to move forward with  these programs. Again, this guidance provides clarity for small  businesses, which facilitate these programs for their employees, in  that they may only act in an administrative capacity in operating these  plans.   I think we all know what this repeal is truly about. President Trump  is committed to doing everything he can to put the interests of Wall  Street first. Unfortunately, with this action, Republicans in Congress  are helping him do that.   It does not seem to matter if Republicans need to vote against  policies they are on the record as having previously supported, like  these retirement programs. Apparently, it does not matter if they need  to vote to undermine our States' rights, as this resolution will do. It  is becoming increasingly clear, without having a legislative agenda of  their own, that Republicans are working to undo any and all rules and  protections that had been put forth by the Obama administration.   It is not working. It is not leadership. It is not the kind of  leadership our families deserve. After last week, I had hoped that  President Trump and the Republicans would have dropped their extreme  anti-worker agenda. Families nationwide are sending a clear message in  marches and phone calls and letters and online and in their  communities. They expect their representatives to be committed to  working for them, and they are paying close attention--more than ever  before--and are prepared to hold Members accountable.   This CRA is a critical vote. Families are watching. If you stand with  working families, vote against this resolution. If you say you believe  in States' rights, vote against this resolution. If you want to  meaningfully address our retirement crisis, vote against this  resolution.   I am here to urge all of our colleagues to reject this harmful repeal  and to stand with our working families. That is what is at stake.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
