 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to voice my support  for this amendment to H.R. 8 introduced by Representatives Horn and  Murphy.   This amendment protects people facing the threat of domestic  violence, dating partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, and  domestic abuse.   I am the daughter of a military veteran, and like most Kansans, I  respect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. But also,  like most Kansans, I am tired of politicians doing nothing to stop  senseless killings.   That is why I support commonsense solutions to keep our communities  safe, like expanding background checks and closing dangerous loopholes  in our laws.   In our effort to ensure the safety of our communities, however, we  can't forget the needs of those at risk of domestic violence to protect  themselves from abuse.   According to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, in 2017 a domestic  violence incident was reported every 23 minutes and a domestic violence  murder occurred every 9 days in the State of Kansas.   In the United States, more than 12 million people experience some  form of domestic violence by a current or former domestic partner every  year.   These women and men deserve our support, which means we also need to  reauthorize and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act.   These men and women deserve to be protected. I cannot emphasize that  enough.   Mr. Chair, I am proud to support H.R. 8. It is a critical piece of  legislation that will save lives, and I urge my fellow colleagues to  stand up for survivors and those at risk and support this amendment.
