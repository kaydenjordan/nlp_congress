 Mr. President, today the Senate will continue another  historic week confirming more of President Trump's impressive judicial  nominees to the Federal bench--Steven Grasz, confirmed; Don Willett,  confirmed. And soon we will add James Ho to the list by confirming him  to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.   He is an exceptionally well-qualified nominee whose career in both  public service and the private sector has garnered respect from both  sides of the aisle. The former Democratic mayor of Dallas supported his  nomination, calling him ``among the most brilliant appellate lawyers in  the United States.''   When we vote to confirm Mr. Ho, we will be adding another fair and  impartial judge to the Federal bench, and by doing so, the Senate will  take another important step to ensure that the Federal judiciary  fulfills its proper role in our constitutional system. Each of them  will be an asset to our Nation's courts.   Under Chairman Grassley's leadership, the Senate Judiciary Committee  has done outstanding work to move these judicial nominees to the floor.  I am grateful for his efforts, and I urge all of my colleagues to join  me in voting to confirm Mr. Ho soon.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
