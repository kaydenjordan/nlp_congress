 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  legislation.   As I travel the district and travel across the State, I constantly  get asked two very important questions: What is Washington doing for  Americans? And, what is happening on a bipartisan basis in Washington,  D.C.?   When I travel back home this Thursday, I will be able to answer that  this legislation checks both of those boxes. I am deeply proud to work  with my good friend, Mr. Gottheimer, on this important legislation to  keep our senior citizens safe from fraudsters and hucksters who are  constantly pursuing them.   Much has been spoken already in this Chamber about the ``what'' of  this bill, but I wanted to emphasize the ``why.''   It is for the 74-year-old Hoosier walking through our Jeffersonville  office who has lost her life savings because she thought she was  interfacing with the IRS.   It is for the senior couple walking through our Franklin doors  thinking they were helping get their grandson out of jail but, instead,  were dealing with a huckster.   It is for all the senior citizens across this country who are  constantly getting the calls, constantly getting the phishing emails,  constantly seeing text messages trying to get at their life savings.  Those are the ones who report it. As Mr. Gottheimer said, only 1 in 24  of these crimes gets reported.    This is something we have to end. We have to get one step ahead. I  can't wait to travel back home to the Hoosier State later this week and  tell them this Chamber advanced a piece of legislation to protect our  senior citizens, to protect Americans, and to get us one step ahead of  those fraudsters.
