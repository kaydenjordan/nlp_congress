 Mr. President, I would like to talk about a genetic  condition called Usher syndrome. Usher syndrome is a rare genetic  disease that affects at least 25,000 people in the United States. Usher  syndrome causes deafness or hearing loss, as well as a retinal disease  that progressively leads to blindness. Some children may be diagnosed  at birth, while others are diagnosed at later stages of adolescence,  affecting education, employment, and quality of life.   Usher type 1 individuals are born deaf and then learn, often before  adolescence, that they are also losing their vision. Usher type 2  individuals are born with moderate to severe hearing loss and then in  the prime of their adolescent lives are told that they are losing their  vision. Usher type 3 are usually diagnosed during adolescence, leading  to the slow loss of both hearing and vision.   At present, there are no treatments or cure for Usher syndrome, but  that could change with awareness and support. Finding a cure has never  been more urgent or more achievable. Promising research and positive  clinical trials are occurring right now at universities, medical  centers, and private laboratories across the country.   Even though there is currently no cure for Usher syndrome, I am proud  that Oregonian researchers are leading the way searching for treatments  and therapies. The Casey Eye Institute at Oregon Health & Science  University--OHSU--is conducting the first human study of gene therapy  for Usher syndrome, and researchers at the University of Oregon are  generating animal models that represent the genotypes of the major  Usher patient groups--both necessary steps towards the development of  effective treatments. It is a privilege to serve a State that is home  to such cutting-edge research into Usher syndrome.   To accelerate this research, the Usher Syndrome Coalition, including  Emily Creasy from Oregon, is raising public awareness. Last month, on  September 19, they helped recognize the 6th annual Usher Syndrome  Awareness Day. The day fell near the autumnal equinox, which marks the  start of days that contain more darkness than light, a powerful  metaphor for the threat of Usher syndrome. I am proud to support the  Usher syndrome community and am committed to doing what I can as  Oregon's senior Senator to support researchers hard at work finding  treatments and, hopefully, a cure. I am committed to working with my  colleagues to raise awareness regarding this disease, and I applaud the  hard work of the Usher Syndrome Coalition in making Usher syndrome  research a priority at the National Institutes of Health.                            ____________________
