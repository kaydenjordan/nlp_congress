 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Morelle for yielding  me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this week, Democrats have scheduled a series of bills on  the House floor in the name of combating climate change that are  actually retreads of the programs that are already authorized and  actions that are already being taken by the Federal Government.   H.R. 729 is clear proof that the Democrats have no agency and have no  priorities other than to impeach the President of the United States.   Most of the bills included in this package duplicate existing  authority that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and  the U.S. Fish & Wildlife already have. Most authorizations of  appropriations in the bill package are, therefore, unnecessary and are  higher than current levels being spent.   NOAA, the agency that would be responsible for carrying out most of  this legislation, stated in testimony that it can do and is doing most  all of these functions under current law.   This package also creates a precedent of having a city, Washington,  D.C., and a non-coastal one at that, as participating in the Coastal  Zone Management Act. There is a real threat that this would give D.C.  veto power over Federal actions affecting its coastal zone once it  develops an approved coastal zone management program.   The loan guarantee program under the Working Waterfront program,  section 104, is problematic, because the American taxpayer will be on  the hook for any default.   The National Sea Grant program is popular amongst coastal members,  but the bill makes mandatory a fellowship program that provides free  graduate students to congressional offices at taxpayer expense.   Mr. Speaker, I have concerns about the bills included in this  package. For example, this land package addresses changes to the  Coastal Zone Management Act. The act signed by President Nixon into law  in 1972 provides Federal funds to States to develop plans to preserve,  protect, and develop the resources of our Nation's coastal zones.    This bill that we are debating today contains text from H.R. 2185,  which would allow Washington, D.C., to receive Federal funding to  develop and implement a coastal zone management plan of their own.   This is an odd way to appropriate Federal funds, as the District of  Columbia does not have a coast. Rather, Washington, D.C., borders the  Potomac River, which eventually feeds into the Chesapeake Bay, which  merges into the Atlantic Ocean.   The inclusion of Washington, D.C., in the Coastal Zone Management Act  would no doubt reduce the funding for existing participants. It also  raises the question of whether States that contain rivers that lead  into the ocean, such as Arkansas with the Mississippi River or my home  State of Arizona with the Colorado River, should get Federal funding to  create a coastal management plan.   This is a dangerous precedent to create and a poor use of precious  resources.   This package also authorizes funds to the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration to perform tasks that they already do. For  example, this package contains text from H.R. 2189, which would  authorize NOAA to conduct the Digital Coast program. This program  supplies coastal communities and researchers with up-to-date mapping  information to address coastal issues, such as storm preparation, flood  management, ecosystem restoration, and coastal development.   It should be noted that NOAA has already been conducting this program  under the line item of Ocean and Coastal Management and Services since  2007. In other words, this bill would require Federal agencies to carry  out duties that they have already been doing.   Like I said earlier, this is really not a great use of the public's  time on the House floor.   Another example of this package directing Federal agencies to perform  tasks that they have already been doing can be seen in the text that is  [[Page H9958]]  drawn from H.R. 3541. This legislation would establish a coastal  climate change adaption preparedness and response program to assist  States in developing plans to minimize negative consequences of climate  change and implementation of those plans. NOAA, through the Coastal  Zone Management Act, already funds State programs relating to climate  change and has already been providing assistance to States that H.R.  3541 wants the agency to do.   H.R. 2189 and H.R. 3541 are just two of many examples in this bill  that duplicate existing authority that the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration already has under the Coastal Zone  Management Act.   Further, the cost of this land package to the American taxpayer is  immense. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the  cumulative cost of this package would cost as much as $1.4 billion more  than what is already being spent over the authorized periods.   Even worse, these bills have the potential for an additional cost of  $292 million outside of the bill's authorized windows if certain  conditions are met.   With over $22 trillion in debt, we should not be moving bills that  are duplicative, repetitive, and unnecessarily expensive.                                time  1230    We need to be responsible with the hardworking taxpayers' money.   Why can't we discuss land packages that have more bipartisan support  and do not cost a fortune to the taxpayer?   Back in February 2019, we all voted on S. 47, the John D. Dingell,  Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act. The bill received  overwhelming support from Republicans and Democrats in both Chambers  and was signed into law by President Trump. This bipartisan legislation  permanently reauthorized the Land and Water Conservation Fund and  protected hunting and fishing rights while also reforming various  aspects of the Federal lands governance system.   The CBO estimated that S. 47 would decrease direct Federal spending  by $9 million over a 10-year period. I believe that effectively  balancing conservation practices, resource development, and recreation,  along with saving taxpayer dollars, is very important.   This land package that we are currently debating today does not even  come close to the success that this House had experienced with S. 47.   Ultimately, this package highlights the real opportunity cost of  impeachment. The Democrats have rallied and promised real, sweeping  policies to address what they call the climate crisis. However, they  have been so consumed with attacking our President and with impeachment  that they have nothing to show for it.   This bill is nothing more than an attempt by the majority to portray  themselves as doing something, anything, for the American people, when,  in fact, this bill underscores the truth: They have and are doing  nothing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to my friend Mr. Morelle,  Washington, D.C., does not have a beach on the ocean. Virginia does.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to consider H. Res. 750, which expresses the  sense of the House that it is the duty of the Federal Government to  protect and promote individual choice and health insurance for the  American people and prevent any Medicare for All proposal that would  outlaw private health insurance plans, such as employer-based coverage  and Medicare Advantage plans.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I hear from my constituents regularly--and I  have a lot of senior citizens--that they are afraid of a Medicare for  All approach.   They understand that a one-size-fits-all, government-run healthcare  system will not work. That is because whether it is called a single- payer system or a socialist system, Medicare for All constitutes a  complete government takeover of healthcare in America.   Medicare for All will end, eliminate, private health insurance plans.  It will eliminate the current Medicare. It will eliminate all Medicare  Advantage plans like my mother is on, and replace it, instead, with a  one-size-fits-all, government-controlled healthcare plan. Just like  ObamaCare, even if you like your plan, you will not be able to keep it.   Passage of Medicare for All would push over 150 million Americans off  their health insurance plans and into government health insurance  plans.   Further, while no version of Medicare for All has yet received a  budget score, Senator Bernie Sanders' version of Medicare for All did  receive estimated scores from two outside groups.   In 2016, the Urban Institute calculated that Senator Sanders'  healthcare proposals would increase Federal funding by a whopping $32.6  [[Page H9959]]  trillion over 10 years. Separately, in June 2018, the Mercatus Center  estimated that Medicare for All would increase Federal spending by $32  trillion over 10 years.   Our national debt is a national security crisis, and we must work  together to combat it, not increase costs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. However, I do want to say that  I believe that the amendment, if the previous question is defeated, is  germane because it applies to the rule and not to the bill itself.   In closing, I want to emphasize to my friends across the aisle that  we should be bringing legislation to this floor that showcases how we  can work together. However, this package ultimately highlights the real  opportunity cost of impeachment.   The Democrats have rallied for months now and promised real, sweeping  policies to address what they call the climate crisis. However, they  have been so consumed with attacking our President and impeachment that  they have nothing to show for it. In an attempt to satisfy their base  that they are doing something about climate change, they are, instead,  in this package, just repeating things already being done, but it is at  a higher cost.   Mr. Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question and ``no'' on the  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
