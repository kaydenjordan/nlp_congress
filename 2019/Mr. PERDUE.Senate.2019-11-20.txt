 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:30 a.m.  tomorrow, the Chair lay before the Senate the House message to  accompany H.R. 3055. I further ask unanimous consent that Senator Paul  or his designee be recognized to offer a motion to concur with further  amendment, the text of which is at the desk, and following 2 minutes of  debate equally divided, Senator Shelby or his designee be recognized to  make a motion to table the Paul motion. Further, I ask that following  disposition of the Paul motion, the majority leader or his designee be  recognized to make a motion to concur in the House amendment to the  Senate amendment; finally, that notwithstanding rule XXII, if cloture  is filed on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate  amendment that the vote on the cloture motion occur immediately and  that if cloture is invoked, the postcloture time be yielded back and  the Senate vote on the motion to concur with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, November 21; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, morning business be closed, and that the Senate  proceed to executive session and resume consideration of the  Brouillette nomination.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk,  and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading, and in  order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:20 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, November 21, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
