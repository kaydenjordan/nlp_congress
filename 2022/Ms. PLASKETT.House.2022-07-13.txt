 Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on my amendment to the  National Defense Authorization Act that directs the Department of  Defense, in conjunction with the Department of State and the Department  of Homeland Security, to assess the standing U.S. military force  posture in the Caribbean Basin and the value, feasibility, and cost of  increasing U.S. military capacity in the region.   The Caribbean region has long been a place of geopolitical exertion  of power by foreign forces. Presently, China has planted flags in  numerous Caribbean nations through investment and infrastructure. The  United States is vulnerable from a national security posture.   This amendment is bipartisan, with support from our colleague  representing the island of Puerto Rico, Congresswoman Gonzalez-Colon.  This amendment is warranted, given the importance of the U.S. national  security apparatus to capably fight transnational crime and protect  U.S. national and regional security in the region. Too often, the  Caribbean is ignored, and this amendment ensures that our Third Border  is not forgotten as it confronts increasing regional political  instability, hostile foreign engagement, and transnational criminal  activity.                            ____________________
