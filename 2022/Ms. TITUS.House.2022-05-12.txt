 Madam Speaker, if you are looking for a place to start  stamping out corruption, you need look no further than the Old Post  Office building just down the street.   Yesterday, workers began removing Trump's name from the property,  ending an era of corruption. While in office, the former President was  both landlord and tenant of this establishment, which raised numerous  ethical questions.   After reviewing thousands of pages of records, Chairman DeFazio and I  found that the GSA failed to both enforce the lease, which forbade  involvement from any elected official of the U.S. Government and failed  to conduct oversight on possible violations of the Emoluments Clause.   To prevent this from happening again, I introduced the Outlease  Reform in Public Buildings Act to prohibit any President from  maintaining a GSA outlease and to establish Congressional review of the  outleasing program.   I urge my colleagues to get this signed, sealed, and delivered to the  President's desk, and I hope we don't have to look at that Trump sign  any longer.                            ____________________
