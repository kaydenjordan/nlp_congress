 Mr. Speaker, on this National Pearl Harbor Remembrance  Day, the 80th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, I rise to  honor Charlie Dowd, Montana's last living Pearl Harbor survivor.   Charlie was just a 17-year-old radioman stationed at Pearl Harbor  when he was awakened by the sound of the Japanese surprise attack, a  day which lives in infamy. Charlie immediately raced to the window of  the ship where he saw a nearby hangar go up in a plume of flames.  Wearing just a T-shirt, he grabbed a rifle and climbed on to the roof  where he and other volunteers started firing at the attacking planes,  some of the first shots fired by Americans in World War II.   Charlie's heroism, and that of others on that day, undoubtedly saved  lives, and their bravery and resolve should be commended. He served for  nearly 5 years in the United States Navy.   Charlie lives in Anaconda, Montana, and will be celebrating his 98th  birthday on December 23. On behalf of all Montanans and a grateful  Nation, I want to thank Charlie Dowd for his service and wish him an  early happy birthday.                            ____________________
