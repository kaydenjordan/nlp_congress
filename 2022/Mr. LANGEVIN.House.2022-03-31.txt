 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the legacy of my  good friend and colleague, Congressman Don Young from Alaska, who sadly  passed away the evening of March 18.   Don was an inspirational man who served the people of Alaska in the  House of Representatives for nearly half a century and did so with a  giant heart and tremendous passion.   Don cherished this institution. He was a strong proponent of  bipartisanship and civility, and he consistently sought to find common  ground. It is something I always admired about him.   There is something I want the country and the world to know: He was  also a champion for the disability community, and I was proud to work  closely with Don as co-chairs of the Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus.   Together, we worked across the aisle to break down barriers and  provide opportunities for Americans with disabilities and to raise  awareness of disability issues for our colleagues.   Don was a problem solver. He was a dedicated public servant. And, in  many ways, he was larger than life. I was devastated to learn of his  passing, and I am really going to miss him. He made a difference.   His wife, Anne, and his children, Dawn and Joni, are in my prayers,  as well as his entire family.   Rest in peace.                            ____________________
