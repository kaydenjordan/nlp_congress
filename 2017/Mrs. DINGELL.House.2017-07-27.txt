 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of Mr. Delaney's  bipartisan amendment included in this en bloc that would increase  funding for the Fisher House Foundation.   Fisher House has now served our veterans and their families for 26  years providing valuable housing opportunities as veterans receive  medical treatment at military and VA medical centers across the  country. When I first learned of them--longer than I want to admit-- there were just a few of them. Now there are 72 and many more in the  pipeline. They have served 305,000 military families.   For many veterans and their families, the distance to their nearest  VA medical center can be too far to travel on a routine basis, and the  cost over time means many veterans are alone--nobody by their side-- during their treatment or hospital stay--a situation no one should be  in.   No veteran who has served their country should have to face medical  care or a hospital stay without the support of their loved ones by  their side. Fisher Houses provide the lodging and transportation  resources to help families stay together throughout the treatment  process.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
