 Madam Speaker, I stood here nearly a month ago to  deliver a very similar message: once-in-a-lifetime storms are becoming  our reality in Michigan.   In the last month, southeast Michigan has flooded three times in the  city of Dearborn, nearly 20,000 homes have been impacted. My  constituents can't recover from one flood before it worsens and another  one hits and there is more damaged property, more lost valuables.   People are angry. People are scared. And they have every right to be.  That is because we have known the solution to these disasters for a  while. The time for climate action is now. This starts with investing  in resilient infrastructure to protect our communities from the impacts  of climate crisis.   We need to invest in infrastructure that can withstand natural  disasters and make it easier on the American people to recover. We  can't continue to have these floods couched as once-in-a-lifetime, if  you call them that, when people are dealing with unimaginable damages  in my city for the third time in 4 weeks.   We need a strong infrastructure package that takes bold action and  addresses change head-on.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2278) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to  designate the September 11th National Memorial Trail, and for other  purposes, as amended.

(2) Route.--        (A) In general.--The Trail Route shall consist of a series       of trails as generally depicted on the Map.        (B) Availability of map.--The Map shall be available in the       appropriate offices of the National Park Service.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2278, introduced by Representative Gerry Connolly,  would designate the September 11th National Memorial Trail Route to  honor the family members and loved ones who were victims of that day's  attack, as well as the heroes of September 11.   The route will consist of a series of trails and roadways linking the  three  [[Page H3858]]  sites of the September 11 attack: the World Trade Center in New York;  the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia; and the Flight 93 Memorial near  Shanksville, Pennsylvania.   As we approach the 20th anniversary of this horrific act of  terrorism, this bill would honor the memory of the nearly 3,000  Americans who lost their lives and would serve as a lasting reminder of  the heroism and perseverance of our Nation's first responders.   I thank Representative Connolly for introducing this important  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the author of this important piece of  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1029) to Waive the application fee for any special use  permit for veterans' special events at war memorials on land  administered by the National Park Service in the District of Columbia  and its environs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1029         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Free Veterans from Fees       Act''.       SEC. 2. WAIVER OF SPECIAL USE PERMIT APPLICATION FEE FOR                     VETERANS' SPECIAL EVENTS.         (a) Waiver.--The application fee for any special use permit       solely for a veterans' special event at war memorials on land       administered by the National Park Service in the  [[Page H3859]]       District of Columbia and its environs shall be waived.        (b) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) District of columbia and its environs.--The term ``the       District of Columbia and its environs'' has the meaning given       that term in section 8902(a) of title 40, United States Code.        (2) Gold star families.--The term ``Gold Star Families''       includes any individual described in section 3.2 of       Department of Defense Instruction 1348.36.        (3) Special event.--The term ``special events'' has the       meaning given that term in section 7.96 of title 36, Code of       Federal Regulations.        (4) Veteran.--The term ``veteran'' has the meaning given       that term in section 101(2) of title 38, United States Code.        (5) Veterans' special event.--The term ``veterans' special       event'' means a special event of which the majority of       attendees are veterans or Gold Star Families.        (6) War memorial.--The term ``war memorial'' means any       memorial or monument which has been erected or dedicated to       commemorate a military unit, military group, war, conflict,       victory, or peace.        (c) Applicability.--This section shall apply to any special       use permit application submitted after the date of the       enactment of this Act.        (d) Applicability of Existing Laws.--Permit applicants       remain subject to all other laws, regulations, and policies       regarding the application, issuance and execution of special       use permits for a veterans' special event at war memorials on       land administered by the National Park Service in the       District of Columbia and its environs.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1029, the Free Veterans  from Fees Act, introduced by my colleague, Representative Greg Steube.   This bill would honor the sacrifices made by our veterans and Gold  Star families by waiving application fees for veterans' special events  at war memorials on land administered by the National Park Service in  our Nation's Capital.   Although the National Park Service has a longstanding practice of  waiving application fees for special use permits for most veterans'  events at war memorials, veterans' organizations have often had to pay  administrative fees and associated costs to obtain permits for events,  such as honor buses.   By codifying a version of this practice in law, we can ensure that  veterans and the Gold Star families are not required to pay when  visiting the national war memorials that were built to commemorate  their bravery and sacrifices and our country's fallen heroes.   I would like to thank Representative Steube for introducing this  important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Kind).    Mr. Speaker, we have heard all the reasons why this  bill matters. We even did an Honor Flight with the Rosies from  Michigan, which was memorable.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1154) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct  a study to assess the suitability and feasibility of designating  certain land as the Great Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1154         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Great Dismal Swamp National       Heritage Area Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

SEC. 3. STUDY.         (a) In General.--The Secretary, in consultation with State       and local organizations and governmental agencies, Tribal       governments, non-profit organizations, and other appropriate       entities, shall conduct a study to assess the suitability and       feasibility of designating the study area as a National       Heritage Area, to be known as the ``Great Dismal Swamp       National Heritage Area''.        (b) Requirements.--The study shall include analysis,       documentation, and determinations on whether the study area--        (1) has an assemblage of natural, historic, and cultural       resources that--        (A) represent distinctive aspects of the people and       cultures of the United States;        (B) are worthy of recognition, conservation,       interpretation, and continuing use; and        (C) would be best managed--        (i) through partnerships among public and private entities;       and        (ii) by linking diverse and sometimes noncontiguous       resources and active communities;        (2) reflects traditions, customs, beliefs, and folklife       that are a valuable part of the story of the United States;        (3) provides outstanding opportunities--        (A) to conserve natural, historic, cultural, or scenic       features; and        (B) for recreation and education;        (4) contains resources that--        (A) are important to any identified themes of the study       area; and        (B) retain a degree of integrity capable of supporting       interpretation;        (5) includes residents, business interests, nonprofit       organizations, and State, local, and Tribal governments, and       other appropriate entities that--        (A) are involved in the planning of the Heritage Area;        (B) have developed a conceptual financial plan that       outlines the roles of all participants in the Heritage Area,       including the Federal Government; and        (C) have demonstrated support for the designation of the       Heritage Area;        (6) has a potential management entity to work in       partnership with the individuals and entities described in       paragraph (5) to develop the Heritage Area while encouraging       State and local economic activity; and        (7) has a conceptual boundary map that is supported by the       public.       SEC. 4. REPORT.         Not later than 3 years after the date on which funds are       first made available to carry out this Act, the Secretary       shall submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and       Natural Resources of the Senate a report that describes--        (1) the findings of the study under section 3; and        (2) any conclusions and recommendations of the Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1154, the Great Dismal Swamp  National Heritage Area Act, introduced by the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. McEachin), my Natural Resources Committee colleague.   This bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a  study assessing the suitability and the feasibility of designating the  Great Dismal Swamp in the States of Virginia and North Carolina as a  national heritage area.   The Great Dismal Swamp is an area of great historical, cultural, and  environmental importance, and has been home to indigenous people since  time immemorial. The swamp includes the ancestral lands of the  Nansemond Indian Nation and the historic lands of the Haliwa-Saponi and  Meherrin tribes.   The swamp was also one of the only known water-based stops on the  Underground Railroad and home to a thriving community descending from  early colonial free people of color whose families resisted American  slavery by finding refuge within the swamp.   In 1974 the swamp was designated as a national wildlife refuge due to  its ecological significance, and today it holds the largest intact  remnant of a vast forest that once covered more than a million acres.   Designating the Great Dismal Swamp as a national heritage area will  help share the often untold stories of some of our Nation's  underrepresented communities.   From the indigenous communities who first called the swamp home to  the enslaved African Americans who endured the swamp's hardships in  their fight for freedom, these are stories worth sharing with current  and future generations.   I would like to thank my friend and colleague, Representative  McEachin, for championing this important legislation. I urge all my  colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation. I am glad that my colleague's thoughts came through the  swamp, and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H3861]]     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1664) to authorize the National Medal of Honor Museum  Foundation to establish a commemorative work in the District of  Columbia and its environs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1664         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION TO ESTABLISH COMMEMORATIVE WORK.         (a) In General.--The National Medal of Honor Museum       Foundation may establish a commemorative work on Federal land       in the District of Columbia and its environs to honor the       extraordinary acts of valor, selfless service, and sacrifice       displayed by Medal of Honor recipients.        (b) Compliance With Standards for Commemorative Works.--The       establishment of the commemorative work under this section       shall be in accordance with chapter 89 of title 40, United       States Code (commonly known as the ``Commemorative Works       Act'').        (c) Prohibition on the Use of Federal Funds.--        (1) In general.--Federal funds may not be used to pay any       expense of the establishment of the commemorative work under       this section.

(d) Deposit of Excess Funds.--        (1) In general.--If, on payment of all expenses for the       establishment of the commemorative work under this section       (including the maintenance and preservation amount required       by section 8906(b)(1) of title 40, United States Code), there       remains a balance of funds received for the establishment of       the commemorative work, the National Medal of Honor Museum       Foundation shall transmit the amount of the balance to the       Secretary of the Interior for deposit in the account provided       for in section 8906(b)(3) of that title.        (2) On expiration of authority.--If, on expiration of the       authority for the commemorative work under section 8903(e) of       title 40, United States Code, there remains a balance of       funds received for the establishment of the commemorative       work under this section, the National Medal of Honor Museum       Foundation shall transmit the amount of the balance to a       separate account with the National Park Foundation for       memorials, to be available to the Secretary of the Interior       or the Administrator of General Services, as appropriate, in       accordance with the process provided in paragraph (4) of       section 8906(b) of that title for accounts established under       paragraph (2) or (3) of that section.       SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1664, introduced by the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Veasey), would authorize the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation  to establish a monument in the District of Columbia commemorating the  extraordinary acts of valor, selfless service, and sacrifice displayed  by the Medal of Honor recipients.   The Medal of Honor is our country's highest military decoration, and  since its creation during the Civil War, the medal has been awarded to  more than 3,500 members of the armed services.   This bill would honor the unparalleled bravery and sacrifices of  Medal of Honor recipients and ensure that the medal's values of  courage, sacrifice, patriotism, citizenship, integrity, and commitment  are shared for generations to come.   I would like to thank Representative Veasey for his leadership on  this important legislation and urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Veasey).    Mr. Speaker, my colleague said it well. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2365) to extend the authority for the establishment of a  commemorative work in honor of Gold Star Families, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2365         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Gold Star Mothers Family       Monument Extension Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF                     COMMEMORATIVE WORK.         Notwithstanding section 8903(e) of title 40, United Sates       Code, the authority provided by section 2859 of the Military       Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (division       B of Public Law 112-239; 126 Stat. 2164; 40 U.S.C. 8903 note)       shall continue to apply through January 2, 2027.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2365, introduced by the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Kim), would extend the authorization for the establishment of a  commemorative work to Gold Star Mother Families until January 2, 2027.   The Gold Star Mothers Family National Monument would honor the  mothers and families of those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in  service of our Nation.   The Gold Star is a widely recognized tradition that dates back to  World War I when families would display service flags bearing a blue  star for each family member serving abroad and a gold star for each  family member who had been lost in combat.   Although this commemorative work was originally authorized in the  National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2013, the  authorization expired in January 2020. In November 2015, the U.S.  Commission of Fine Arts approved a location for the memorial on the  National Park Service property west of the Arlington National Cemetery  visitor center.                                time  1515    Following that approval, the National Capital Memorial Advisory  Commission has engaged in consultation with the Gold Star Mothers  National Monument Foundation regarding the memorial's design.   This bill would build on these efforts by extending the authorization  needed to establish the monument. While we can never truly repay the  debt that America owes to our Gold Star Mothers and their families,  H.R. 2365 would bring us closer toward fully honoring the sacrifices  that they have made.   I would like to thank Representative Kim for introducing this  important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation and the Gold Star families, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2497) to establish the Amache National Historic Site in the  State of Colorado as a unit of the National Park System, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2497         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Amache National Historic       Site Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.          In this Act:        (1) Map.--The term ``Map'' means the map entitled ``Amache       National Historical Site Proposed Boundary'', numbered 100/      175348 and dated July 2021.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2497, the Amache  National Historic Site Act, introduced by the chair of the Subcommittee  on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands, my colleague from  Colorado, Representative   Joe Neguse.   H.R. 2497 would establish the Amache imprisonment site in southeast  Colorado as a national historic site to ensure permanent protections  and provide for the interpretation of the Amache site of Japanese- American incarceration.   Following the United States' entry into World War II, President  Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order forcibly removing more  than 120,000 people, primarily of Japanese descent, to 10 remote  military-style prisons across the Nation.   The Granada Relocation Center, commonly known as Amache, was one of  those 10 centers and was the only one located in the State of Colorado.  Although Amache was the smallest of the relocation centers, it became  the tenth largest city in Colorado with more than 10,000 people passing  through the camp between 1942 and 1945, nearly two-thirds of whom were  American citizens.   Most had never been to Japan and most were given a week or less to  leave their homes and dispose of everything they owned, everything they  had worked hard to build up for themselves. This unjustifiable,  horrific, and unconstitutional incarceration of Japanese Americans is,  without doubt, one of the darkest chapters in our country's history.   And while these incarceration sites no longer hold prisoners, many of  the wrongfully imprisoned are still with us today, even as anti-Asian  rhetoric continues to permeate our country. As we continue to reckon  with our Nation's painful legacy of systemic racism, it is critical  that we honor and share the stories of those who came before us. It is  vital that we remember and learn from their fights against injustice  and for equity.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2497, and join me in  working to ensure that we remember this dark time in our Nation's  history so we may honor those who lived it, share their stories, and  continue to heal as a country. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4300) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to make free  National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Passes available to  members of the Armed Forces, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4300         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Alexander Lofgren Veterans       in Parks (VIP) Act''.       SEC. 2. RECREATION PASSES.         Section 805 of the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act       (Public Law 108-447; 118 Stat. 3385; 16 U.S.C. 6804) is       amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(4), by striking ``age and disability       discounted'' and inserting ``age discount and lifetime''; and        (2) in subsection (b)--        (A) in the heading, by striking ``Discounted'' and       inserting ``Free and Discounted'';        (B) in paragraph (2)--        (i) in the heading, by striking ``Disability discount'' and       inserting ``Lifetime passes''; and        (ii) by striking subparagraph (B) and inserting the       following:        ``(B) Any veteran who provides adequate proof of military       service as determined by the Secretary.        ``(C) Any member of a Gold Star Family who meets the       eligibility requirements of section 3.2 of Department of       Defense Instruction 1348.36 (or a successor instruction).'';       and        (C) in paragraph (3)--        (i) in the heading, by striking ``Gold star families parks       pass'' and inserting ``Annual passes''; and        (ii) by striking ``members of'' and all that follows       through the end of the sentence and inserting ``members of       the Armed Forces and their dependents who provide adequate       proof of eligibility for such pass as determined by the       Secretary.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4300, the Alexander Lofgren  Veterans in Parks (VIP) Act introduced by my colleague Representative  Miller-Meeks from Iowa.   This bill would provide free annual America the Beautiful Passes to  current military servicemembers and free lifetime America the Beautiful  Passes to veterans and members of Gold Star families, ensuring that  those who have sacrificed so much in the service of our Nation are able  to access our national parks and public lands at no cost.   Anyone who has visited America's public lands understands the  significant mental and physical health benefits of getting outside and  connecting with nature. It is time that we ensure our military  servicemembers, veterans, and Gold Star families are able to access  these beloved places at no cost.   Although the annual America the Beautiful Pass became free for  veterans and Gold Star families in 2020, the change for veterans has  never been codified in law.   While we will never be able to repay the debt owed to them for their  service and their sacrifice, H.R. 4300 will ensure that this benefit is  protected in perpetuity and that all of our American heroes are able to  recreate and find comfort and solace on the lands that they fought so  hard to protect.   I would like to thank Representative Miller-Meeks for her service and  for her work on this important legislation, including working with  Committee on Natural Resources chair, Mr. Grijalva, to rename the bill  in honor of Alexander Lofgren.   Alexander Lofgren served for 4 years in the U.S. Army as a combat  engineer, including a deployment to Afghanistan. Afterwards, he served  in Chair Grijalva's office as part of the Wounded Warrior Fellowship  Program, handling issues and constituent casework concerning veterans'  health and benefits.   As a congressional staffer and veteran, Mr. Lofgren was a great  proponent for his community, veterans, and our Nation's public lands,  often encouraging returning veterans to reconnect with nature to heal.   Tragically, his life was lost during a recent outing in Death Valley  National Park. Our hearts go out to his family. Renaming this  legislation after Mr. Lofgren is a fitting tribute to his legacy and  service to our Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague from Iowa for her  leadership on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 325) to amend the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff  Commission on Native Children Act to extend the deadline for a report  by the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff Commission on Native  Children, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 325         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ALYCE SPOTTED BEAR AND WALTER SOBOLEFF COMMISSION                     ON NATIVE CHILDREN REPORT.         Section 3(f) of the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff       Commission on Native Children Act (Public Law 114-244; 130       Stat. 987) is amended, in the matter preceding paragraph (1),       by striking ``3 years'' and inserting ``5 years''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 325, introduced by Senator Lisa Murkowski from  Alaska, provides a 2-year extension for the Alyce Spotted Bear and  Walter Soboleff Commission on Native Children to publish its report and  make policy recommendations for Federal, State, and Tribal programs  that serve Native children.   Native children experience severe health and socioeconomic  disparities compared to all other racial and ethnic groups in the  United States due to the cycles of intergenerational trauma. It is the  Federal Government's trust responsibility to provide for the health and  well-being of Native children. However, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed  much of the Commission's essential work.   Passage of S. 325 will grant the Commission an extension of time and  ensure that the report best addresses the needs of Native children  through much-needed expertise and cultural wisdom.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Senator  Murkowski, for introducing and championing this critically important  legislation, as well as my dear friend and Committee on Natural  Resources colleague,   Don Young, for leading the House companion bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 325, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank the leadership of the dean  of the House, Mr. Young, on this, and Senator Murkowski for the Native  children.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
