 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   As chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 1065, the Social Media Use in Clearance  Investigations Act, bipartisan legislation that I introduced earlier  this month. It had passed this House previously, last session, with no  opposition.   I commend our full committee chairman, Mr. Cummings of Maryland, for  his continued leadership on this issue of security clearance reform and  for his work to advance H.R. 1065 to the floor today.    I also thank the new ranking member of our subcommittee, Mr. Hice of  Georgia, for his support as well.   In order to enhance the Federal security clearance process, H.R. 1065  will require the Office of Management and Budget to examine the extent  to which Federal agencies are reviewing publicly available social media  profiles as they conduct background investigations for security  clearance applicants.   This bill will also require OMB to submit recommendations to Congress  on how we can implement this examination of social media activity in  clearance investigations across the Federal Government while also  safeguarding individual privacy rights.   Our bipartisan oversight of the security clearance process has  already revealed that Federal agencies have too often missed red flags  in determining an individual's eligibility to access classified  information and facilities.  [[Page H1499]]  We need only recall the tragic shooting at the Washington Navy Yard in  2013 to underscore the devastating impact of a failure to effectively  vet security clearance holders such as Aaron Alexis, a defense  contractor with a marked history of gun violence who was still issued a  secret-level clearance.                                time  1615    Chief among the recommendations offered by the interagency council  that President Obama convened to identify lapses in security clearance  reviews was the need for agencies to have ``access to relevant  information from a variety of sources.''   As noted by William Evanina, the head of counterintelligence for the  U.S. government since 2014, his quote is:         Social media has become an integral and very public part of       the fabric of many Americans' daily lives. And we cannot       ignore this important open source in our effort to safeguard       our national interests.    Moreover, a public social media profile adds to the ``mosaic'' of a  person and may reveal to background investigators evidence suggesting a  change in ideology, ill intent, vulnerability to blackmail, and  allegiance to another country.   The integration of social media into security clearance background  investigations falls in line with the unprecedented exploitation of  Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other networking services by  terrorist organizations, including the Islamic State.   As reported by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, the  prolific use of social media by terrorist groups has not only  facilitated the dissemination of propaganda, but also served as a  primary global recruitment and financing tool.   Foreign governments are also increasingly relying on social media to  advance their espionage efforts. According to open source reports,  Chinese spy agencies have routinely resorted to using fake LinkedIn  accounts to try to recruit Americans with access to government and  commercial secrets.   ``60 Minutes'' recently reported that former CIA officer Kevin  Mallory, who has been convicted on espionage charges, was first  approached by his Chinese government handlers through the LinkedIn  career networking site.   In advance of our 2016 subcommittee hearing on this issue, then- Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directed Federal  agencies to integrate public social media reviews into the security  clearance process. While this directive was a step in the right  direction, it has been incorporated quite unevenly and on a limited  basis.   Our bill, H.R. 1065, will advance the full integration of this  important reform to better ensure that our national security framework  is adapting to evolving technologies much faster than the usual pace  that is characteristic of the Federal Government.   I would note that, according to the annual job recruitment survey  issued by CareerBuilder, an online employment resource, seven out of 10  private sector employers have already incorporated social media reviews  into their hiring process.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind remarks in reference  to this bill, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support H.R. 1065.
