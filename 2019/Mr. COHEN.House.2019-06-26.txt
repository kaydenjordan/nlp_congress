 Mr. Speaker, I was very pleased, and America should be  very pleased, that Robert Mueller is responding to a subpoena that was  issued through the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Nadler, and  through HPSCI, Mr. Schiff.   On July 17 Robert Mueller will appear before our two committees for 2  hours of questioning by each committee and let us know more about the  Mueller report.   The Mueller report is the most important book or document in this  country. Everyone should look at it, read it, and learn about contacts  that the Trump administration and campaign had with the Russian  Government and how Russia influenced our elections and will try to do  it again. That is what is in the Mueller report. Attempts to obstruct  justice that did not exonerate our President and specifically that Mr.  Mueller said that if he could say he didn't commit a crime, he would.   It is important that he testify, and it is important that people  learn about the Mueller report and the danger that lurks not only  beyond our House and Senate but within our government.    Mr. Chair, this should be bipartisan because this is  protecting America and protecting our Constitution, which we have all  sworn an oath to uphold.   This amendment will require the Trump administration to abide by the  Emoluments Clause. The Emoluments Clause to the Constitution says that  the President shouldn't be getting moneys from the Federal Government  over and beyond his salary. Yet, money spent at the Trump Hotel, at the  Trump Hotel in Ireland where they went to Doonbeg, and at the Trump  Hotel in Scotland and other places where Trump makes his journeys,  whether they are within the scope of his original overseas purpose of  going to London and D-day but diverting to Doonbeg to play golf and to  let people know about his golf course and his hotel there, charging the  government for the golf carts that the Secret Service uses, and the  rooms, drinks, and food at his hotel, et cetera.   The Washington Post reported nearly $1 million in revenue already  spent by Federal Government agencies at Trump properties.   The Constitution does not permit it. It should be bipartisan.   The gentleman says that these are attacks and that the administration  needs certain types of latitude. It needs resources.   Well, the Trump family doesn't. If this President did like every  other President and divested himself of ownership of his properties,  then we wouldn't have this problem, but he didn't do it. From day one,  they have been making money, and they have also been advertising their  product.                                time  1245    Every time they advertise Trump properties, they are using the  government as a way to expand the President's wealth.   So I would ask that we abide by our oaths, enforce the Emoluments  Clause, and stop the Trump businesses from taking money from the  Federal Government, which they are not supposed to do.
