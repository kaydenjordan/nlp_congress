 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5378, the Lower  Costs, More Transparency Act.   As a pharmacist for over four decades, I have seen firsthand how our  healthcare system treats patients with unaffordable prices and  inaccessible care.   Under the leadership of Chairwoman Rodgers and Health Subcommittee  Chairman Guthrie, we can do something about it by reining in the PBMs  and putting patients before profits.   Included in this bill is my Drug Price Transparency in Medicaid Act  which puts an end to the PBM games by prohibiting spread pricing in  Medicaid and increasing transparency and fairness to community  pharmacies by allowing them to be reimbursed at an appropriate rate for  dispensing medications to Medicaid patients.   I am also pleased to see my PBM Accountability Act is also included  in this bill.   The Lower Costs, More Transparency Act is such an important first  step towards bringing down prescription drug prices by addressing the  root cause: the middlemen who prey on patients for profits.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Lower Costs, More  Transparency Act.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  the Support for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act, which  reauthorizes important programs that bolster prevention, treatment, and  recovery services for Americans with substance use disorders and mental  illnesses.   Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that the opioid and mental health crises  are continuing to tear our families and communities apart. In 2022, a  record number of our sons' and daughters' lives were taken by opioid  overdoses, the majority of which were caused by illicit fentanyl  poisoning.   Every day we are losing almost 300 Americans as a result of drug  overdoses and poisonings. This is impacting every single one of us in  the communities we call home. Fortunately, we have an opportunity here  today to pass one of the single largest congressional efforts to  address our opioid and mental health crises.   The SUPPORT Act is responsible for increasing access to prevention,  treatment, and recovery services for opioid and substance use  disorders, including fentanyl.   Another important part of this legislation is making opioid overdose  reversal agents, like naloxone, easier to obtain. The SUPPORT Act also  includes my Responsible Mental Health Medications Prescribing Act,  which standardizes the oversight and reporting of antipsychotic  medications prescribed to Medicaid recipients.   This reauthorization ensures that programs supporting our most  vulnerable Americans do not lapse and can reach all communities. I urge  my colleagues to support the reauthorization of this bill, which will  help save lives and help us fight the opioid crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the PREEMIE  Reauthorization Act of 2023, which will reauthorize critical programs  to expand research and education into premature birth prevention.   Every year, 10 percent of babies are born prematurely, putting them  and their mothers at an increased risk of complicated health problems.   In 2022, there were over 380,000 preterm births, and every year,  almost 20,000 babies in the United States will die before their first  birthday, many of them from complications of premature birth.  Unfortunately, Georgia has one of the highest preterm birth rates in  the country.   Babies born prematurely shouldn't be at a disadvantage because of a  lack of resources. Every single baby born deserves a healthy start and  a fair chance at life.   That is why it is so important for us to reauthorize the PREEMIE Act,  which will continue lifesaving research to prevent premature births and  give mothers and babies healthy starts in both motherhood and life.    The bipartisan effort will reauthorize critical Federal research,  education, and intervention activities to reduce preterm birth and  infant mortality.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the reauthorization  of this bill and support maternal health.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Braedan Steven Pence.   Braedan passed away this past October after courageously fighting  multiple medical conditions for his entire life. Braedan's life was cut  tragically short, but the impact that he left on others, his friends,  his family, and members of our community will be felt forever.   He was known for his kindness and the joy that he confidently  displayed to others. You could often find Braedan outside enjoying the  sunshine or on a walk with his nurse, Bonnie, waving at everyone he  passed.   Braedan should be an example to all of us on how we should live our  lives. Even in the face of adversity and challenges, it is important to  always stay positive and to be kind to others. I, again, express my  deepest sympathies to Braedan's family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and hosting this Special Order tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Bible Week. As the  Christmas season approaches and with all the conflict going on in our  world right now, I can't think of a better time to discuss the good  news that is our Bible.   For many Americans, the Christmas season is a time of giving, a time  of joy, and a time for family. For many Christians across the world,  this season looks a lot different, conflict rages in Eastern Europe and  Israel. Many lives have been lost. Here at home fentanyl plagues our  country with Americans being poisoned daily.   Sometimes it is easy for us to get lost in the bad, and we forget who  is really in control. I am certainly guilty of this, and I am sure you  are too, Mr. Speaker. Fortunately, we can turn to the Word of the Lord  for comfort in these troubling times.   The Book of Romans 8:38-39 remind me that no matter what we go  through as individuals or as a nation or as a planet, it cannot  separate us from Christ's love.   The verse says, For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels  nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor  height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to  separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.   This Christmas season, pray for our world, pray for our country, pray  for our leaders, and pray for our military. Remember that God loved us  all so much He sent His one and only Son to die for our sins so that we  may be forgiven. It is for that reason that we celebrate this Christmas  season.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Colorado for inviting me to  speak today and for hosting this.
