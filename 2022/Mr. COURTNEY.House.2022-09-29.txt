 Mr. Chair, for years, leaders in mental health and  addiction have been sounding the alarm that despite the best  intentions, our Nation's mental health parity laws are not meeting the  needs and expectations of patients.   Existing mental health parity laws were supposed to ensure that  patients access mental health benefits with the same ease as medical  benefits under their insurance.    Unfortunately, we know that patients and their families are  continuing to struggle with barriers to needed treatment that should be  prohibited under existing law.   The 2022 mental health parity report to Congress from the U.S.  Department of Labor, HHS, and Treasury found that health plans and  insurers are failing to comply with our Federal parity laws at an  alarming rate, meaning that plans are illegally denying claims for  treatment associated with mental or behavioral health conditions at a  time when substance use disorder, depression, anxiety, and other mental  health conditions are rising rapidly, especially for children.   The legislation we are considering today would implement  recommendations to fix this. The Mental Health Matters Act includes my  legislation, the Strengthening Behavioral Health Benefits Act, which  would bolster the ability of the Department of Labor to effectively  enforce the mental health parity laws and provide resources to the  Department of Labor to help bring plans into compliance. The goal here  is compliance, not retribution.   In their 2022 report, DOL made a series of recommendations for ways  Congress can amend ERISA to empower the Department and patients to hold  insurance companies accountable to the law. In this legislation today,  we are codifying those recommendations.   This will help patients recover funds spent on treatment that their  insurance company should have paid for and will empower DOL to require  insurance companies to revisit claims that they wrongly denied. It will  also allow penalties to be levied against plans that are found in  violation of law, which does not exist today. As the old ancient legal  maxim says, without a remedy, there is no right.   That is what this bill is doing. It is enhancing people's rights for  mental health parity.                                time  1145     Mr. Chair, this is not the first time the executive  branch has asked for additional authority from Congress. President  Trump's Commission on Opioids issued a report in 2017 which asked for  exactly the same reforms. DOL must be given the real authority to  regulate the health insurance industry.   ``The health insurers are not following Federal law requiring parity  in the reimbursement of mental health and addiction. They must be held  responsible.'' That is a quote from Chris Christie, the chairman of  President Trump's opioid task force.   We are executing on bipartisan recommendations that came from the  prior administration and from the Biden administration to create a real  mental health parity system in our Nation.  [[Page H8238]]    Mr. Chair, I urge passage of the bill.
