 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressman from Pennsylvania  for yielding.   As a former manufacturer, I have experienced firsthand the importance  of career technical education in promoting meaningful work. It is  especially helpful for helping people transition from a social safety  net or a second-chance program, but I have seen it firsthand. For high  school students and for adults who change careers, it can truly change  lives.   I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. I am confident  it can do for our country what it has done in the Eighth District of  Ohio.
