 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my heartfelt gratitude  to our Colorado firefighters and first responders.   This year in Colorado, in my district, we have experienced a  devastating and relentless wildfire season; the Cameron Peak fire in  Larimer County, the East Troublesome fire in Grand County, the Calwood  fire, and the Williams Fork fire.   With over a half a million acres burned, Colorado has experienced  great loss, damage, and destruction. For months, our firefighters and  first responders have worked around the clock to save lives, save  homes, and to protect our communities. We know this work is not easy,  especially in the midst of a pandemic, and we are so grateful for the  service, the sacrifice, and the commitment of our firefighters, our  first responders, our local emergency management officials and law  enforcement in Grand County, in Larimer County, in Boulder County, and  across the State of Colorado.   Together, we will rebuild and we will continue to work together.  Thank you for your work. We are so incredibly grateful.                            ____________________
