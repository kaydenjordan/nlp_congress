 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate my friend and  constituent, Mallory White, of Union County, Kentucky, on her recent  election as a national FFA officer.   Mallory is coming off a term as Kentucky State FFA president, a  position I was honored to hold back in the day. In this role, Mallory  put her leadership skills to good use in serving as an outstanding  ambassador for Union County and Kentucky agriculture.   But never one to stop climbing the ladder of success, Mallory didn't  stop there. In successfully seeking a national FFA office, Mallory  demonstrated that she has all the qualities to be a successful leader  for years to come.   With this impressive achievement, Mallory personified the positive  difference that FFA makes in young people's lives. This extraordinary  achievement makes Union County and the entire First Congressional  District of Kentucky proud.   Mr. Speaker, I am eager to see what Mallory White accomplishes in the  years to come.                            ____________________
