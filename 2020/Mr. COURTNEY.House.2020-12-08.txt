 Mr. Speaker, in a few hours, the House of  Representatives will be voting on the National Defense Authorization  Act of 2021.   This bill is our Nation's annual defense policy law that the U.S.  Congress has approved every year for the last 59 years. It establishes  the legal basis for thousands of operations of the Department of  Defense, including military pay, the startup of new technologies, and  investment in planes, ships, logistics, and infrastructure at military  installations at home and abroad.   This year's bill, like the 59 bills that preceded it, represents 11  months of bipartisan work at the House and Senate Armed Services  Committees, whose members and professional staff have worked with the  entire Congress to produce a bill that will strengthen our security,  support our servicemembers, and boost our economy in countless ways.   As House chair of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, a  body I have served on for 14 years, I want to spend a moment on our  section of the bill which I believe is remarkable.   The Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee is vested with  jurisdiction of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps as set forth in Article  I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. Those services today are engaged  in the highest operational tempo in our military.   In every part of the globe, the Indo-Pacific, the Atlantic, and the  Middle East, our sailors and marines are in heel-to-toe operations that  are straining our fleet and manpower. Our chief competitors, China and  Russia, in these regions have been steadily growing their naval forces  in both numbers and quality.   China's navy grew to 355 ships and submarines this year, versus 292  in our fleet. Russia's Navy continues to grow under Putin, particularly  with the new, lethal Severodvinsk-class submarines.   With this backdrop, it was quite surprising when, last February, the  Trump administration submitted a budget with the lowest number of  requested Navy ships since 2009. As the Congressional Research Service  noted, the Trump budget asked for just seven new ships and, incredibly,  cut one of the two planned Virginia-class submarines, a program that  has successfully sustained a two-per-year build rate that began in 2007  under the Obama administration.   This baffling cut ignored all the warnings from commanders who  testified at Seapower that our declining, aging fleet of 1980s-era  submarines risk losing the one clear tactical advantage that we as a  nation retain--namely, our superiority in the undersea domain.   This chart shows the steep decline in the sub fleet in the 2020s,  even with a 2-per-year build rate, and the red dotted line shows that  the Trump plan worsens that slide.   This cut would also disrupt the skilled workforce that has been  assembled over the last decade to execute this highly complex  production. At committee, administration witnesses, such as Secretary  Esper, gave completely unsatisfactory explanations for this cut,  leaving us in Congress with the job to clean up their mess.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that today's bill, in fact, does  reverse this cut. Working with Ranking Member  Rob Wittman, Seapower  led the way in restoring the second submarine with offsets and savings  as required by the spending cap in the 2019 bipartisan budget law.   We worked with our colleagues on the Defense Appropriations  Subcommittee to ensure that this $2.6 billion change will be funded in  their bill. And I want to thank retiring Chair Pete Visclosky for his  strong support of this effort, as well as HASC Chair Adam Smith and  Ranking Member Mac Thornberry.   Having the two House defense committees united on this measure  ensured that our position would prevail in conference negotiations  since the Senate did not initially vote for full restoration.   Ironically, late last month, with Congress deep in the process of  negotiating this agreement, the Trump administration suddenly disavowed  its own budget  [[Page H6908]]  and sent a letter to Congress asking us to fully fund the second  submarine it wanted to cut just last February. Thankfully, the House  had already acted responsibly to do just that earlier this year.   Mr. Speaker, I want to salute Admiral Michael Gilday, Chief of Naval  Operations, who foot-stomped the second submarine as the Navy's top  unfunded priority this year and also wrote a powerful support letter to  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record that support letter.                                             Department of the Navy,                                       Chief of Naval Operations,                                  Washington, DC, November 13, 2020.      Hon. Joe Courtney,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces,           Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to follow up on our phone       call of November 12, 2020. As I detailed in the Navy's       February 19, 2020 Unfunded Priorities List, the second       Virginia Class Submarine in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 remains my       top unfunded priority. The FY 2021 shipbuilding budget       reflected a balance between requirements, capability,       affordability, and the need to sustain the industrial base       while maintaining a reasonable degree of risk.        Increased funding to enable the Navy to procure a second       Virginia Class Submarine in FY 2021, the 10th under the       current contract of the Block V submarine build is critical       for a number of important reasons: it supports stability       within the industrial base and the workload ramp up for       COLUMBIA Class construction and helps mitigate the SSN trough       in the late 2020s. Additionally, recent DoD studies       highlighted the need to increase the number of submarines to       counter the threat.        The Navy supports the President's FY 2021 budget request       and will consider the potential for restoring the submarine       in future budget submissions, ensuring the proper balance of       resources between investing in tomorrow's fleet and       sustaining today's fleet. However, if Congress has the       opportunity to add one ship to the FY 2021 budget, my       recommendation would be an attack submarine. Thank you for       your continued support for the United States Navy and its       submarine force. Please let me know if I can be of further       assistance.            Sincerely,                                                       M.M. Gilday,                                                Admiral, U.S. Navy.     Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Navy League and the AFL-CIO metal  trades unions, whose members do such amazing work at our Nation's  shipyards, also provided critical advocacy throughout this fight.   Seapower's professional staff Phil MacNaughton, Dave Sienicki, Kelly  Goggin, and Navy fellow Lieutenant Commander Cam Massey rose to the  challenge and did the hard work to make this plus-up fit within the  overall bill.   In my 14 years on Seapower, this act of bipartisan congressional  independence and leadership to pass a shipbuilding plan that faithfully  addresses our Navy's needs stands out as its finest hour.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the NDAA today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 2021  William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act.   I want to begin by congratulating Chairman Smith and Mr. Thornberry  for their persistent teamwork in bringing this bill to fruition. It is  the way Congress is supposed to work.    Mr. Speaker, the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces made  a significant mark in this year's bill. Last February, the President's  budget, out of nowhere, cut the Navy's shipbuilding budget by 17  percent, including the removal of an entire Virginia-class attack  submarine, with no rationale or 30-year shipbuilding plan, as required  by law.   Our subcommittee led the way in fully restoring that submarine,  having listened to the combatant commanders who have articulated the  need for that repeatedly, and adding a fast transport ship, bringing  the total new ships in this bill to nine, two more than requested in  the Trump budget.   We also focused attention on our domestic sealift fleet. The final  bill authorizes half a billion dollars for the Maritime Security  Program to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on our domestic sealift  fleet and creates a new tanker security fleet aimed at addressing  alarming gaps in at-sea logistics.   The bill enhances crucial airlift programs by funding our next- generation refueler, the KC-46A, and rejecting harmful cuts in our  refueling fleet.   The final agreement also includes a provision that sets a firm floor  in support of more than a dozen State Governors' requests to preserve  the C-130 aircraft for the Air National Guard.   Mr. Speaker, this is truly a bipartisan bill that represents the hard  work and input of Members on both sides of the aisle.   Thank you to my friend, Ranking Member  Rob Wittman, for his amazing  friendship and work, and our colleagues on the subcommittee for their  hard work in crafting this year's bill.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote today.
