 Mr. Chair, I am in strong support of H.R. 734, the  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, which I am proud to  cosponsor. I thank the Congressman from Florida, Mr. Steube, for his  leadership on this effort.   Over 50 years ago, Title IX was enacted to level the playing field,  and ensure that women and girls were given fair opportunities to  participate, perform, and achieve in education. One of the primary  areas that has been impacted by this law is in the area of women's  sports. Since then, female participation in sports has increased by  1,057 percent at the high school level, and 614 percent at the  postsecondary level.   Women and girls deserve the confidence of stepping up to the plate,  onto a field, into a court, or on a track, knowing that the competition  will be rule-bound and fair and that their safety has been prioritized.  They deserve to have confidence that they are fairly competing against  another biological woman.   And most of all, they deserve the chance to be champions.   The actions of the Biden Administration have entirely sacrificed  equality in the service of their political agenda; and today I hope my  colleagues will join me in voting in favor of this legislation, and  restoring the soul of Title IX, that has given so many women and girls  life-changing opportunities.
