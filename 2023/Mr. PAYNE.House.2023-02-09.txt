 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to question my Republican  colleagues' continued support of Donald Trump. He does not support our  country nor their party.   He rejects our American Constitution. He steals Republican funds. For  example, he raised $150 million for Republican candidates and then kept  all the money for himself and his rallies.   He insults Americans of faith and used the Bible as a prop during a  promotional shoot. He attacks Republican officials and works to remove  them from office. Now he could face Federal prosecution for his role in  the January 6 insurrection.   I am proud to be part of the Democratic Party that works for the  American people, not one person. Yet, too many Republicans support  Donald Trump more than our country. It does not make sense to me nor  the American people.                            ____________________
