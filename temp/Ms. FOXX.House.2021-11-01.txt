 Madam Speaker, the American people are wondering: What is  the Biden administration thinking?   Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Department of  Justice is negotiating a settlement that would give $450,000 per person  to illegal immigrants. For a parent and child, the payout increases to  $900,000.   To put this in context, if a servicemember is killed in action, their  next of kin receives an insurance payment of $400,000. What this means  is that the Biden administration will pay illegal immigrants more than  the families of America's fallen heroes.   That fact alone is repulsive. These people broke the law by illegally  entering our country, and now they are about to receive a payout from  the government.   That is the kind of welfare mentality that is corrupting this country  and will do nothing but encourage more illegals to try to enter our  country.   Shame on President Biden and his administration.                Recognizing Military Family Appreciation Month     Madam Speaker, behind every man and woman in uniform are  family members who exhibit great resilience while their loved ones  serve this great country.    No matter their backgrounds or where life's journey has taken them,  these families are all connected by service and their collective love  for America.  [[Page H6038]]    Madam Speaker, November is Military Family Appreciation Month, a  solemn time when we recognize the innumerable military families from  all corners of America.   We recognize their support for their loved ones in uniform and the  sacrifices that they continue to make every day.   I salute particularly those from the Fifth District of North Carolina  and thank them for their service.   The simple truth is that every American owes them and their loved  ones both at home and abroad a profound debt of gratitude.   May we never forget that.                         Where is the Accountability     Madam Speaker, if I laid over 1,500 pages of text in front  of you right now, would you be able to tell me quickly what is on every  single page? If the answer is no, that is not surprising.   Yet, that is exactly what happened last week when the majority  decided to drop the text of the massive socialist tax and spending  package at a moment's notice.   Does this sound familiar? It is what happened when House Democrats  passed ObamaCare, and nobody had the time to read its text either,  although Republicans made an earnest effort to read every page. It is  the same irresponsible tactic of passing a bill to find out what is  lurking beneath its pages.   Madam Speaker, this process is making a mockery of the people's  House, and it is downright shameful. It is time to stop it.                            ____________________
