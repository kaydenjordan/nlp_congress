 Madam President, first, I want to say I want to thank  the Senator from Oregon for objecting to the previous motion, and I  share his concerns.   I rise today to speak about some big choices our Nation has to make.  Will we continue to limp along with an economy that works for only a  few wealthy people or will we invest in making things in America and in  our infrastructure and, most importantly, in our people?   Will we continue to allow other countries to outpace us on technology  while remaining dependent on critical parts made on the other side of  the globe or will we seize a future that is made in America?   And will we continue to ignore the climate crisis and leave it for  the next generation to deal with and leave an even bigger catastrophe  or will we take action right now--right now--to put our Nation on a  path to a future of good-paying jobs fueled by clean energy?   I have often said that in Michigan we don't have an economy unless  someone makes something and somebody grows something. That is what we  do in Michigan. We make things and grow things. And I know that my  friend, the Presiding Officer from Minnesota, feels the same--making  things, growing things. That is how we have an economy. It has been the  secret to our success in Michigan and in so many other places around  the country. We need to make things, and we need to grow things.   Unfortunately, while we have been talking about making things for a  long time, the rest of the world has actually been acting.   It is estimated that the Chinese Government has invested at least  $100 billion to support its electric vehicle industry. That might be  why they have hundreds of companies making electric vehicles.   You can't build a competitive auto industry without electric  vehicles, and you can't build electric vehicles without a whole lot of  batteries and a whole lot of other component parts. They could all be  made here, but most of them aren't.   Right now, none of the major electric vehicle battery providers are  American companies. They could be if we helped partner with them to  make that happen.   And we have seen what happens when our automakers depend on  semiconductors made overseas. Over the past few months, a shortage of  computer chips no bigger than a Kellogg's cornflake have idled multiple  plants and led to layoffs in Michigan and across the country.   In fact, the Alliance for Auto Innovation estimates that U.S.  automakers will produce a million fewer cars this year because of this  shortage of this little chip.   It is not enough to say we need to build things in America. We all  know that. But we can't build things here without first investing in  our capacity and having a national strategy to build things here in  America. Thankfully, we have a President of the United States who  understands that. He understands the moment we are in and is ready to  meet the moment.   Now it is time for Congress to step up. Senate Democrats are excited  and ready to take action, working with the President of the United  States and hopefully working with our colleagues across the aisle, in  this moment for America and America's future.   It is important to note that it won't be the first time that actions  we have taken here have had lasting consequences. More than 100 years  ago, Henry Ford and Thomas Edison partnered to build an affordable  electric car. That was the first kind of car they wanted to make--an  electric car. They even built several prototypes in Dearborn, MI. The  challenge, Ford told the New York Times in 1914, was ``to build a  storage battery of light weight which would operate for long distances  without recharging.'' Sound familiar? That is a challenge most of our  automakers are very familiar with.   Interestingly, around the same time, in 1916, Congress passed a  change to the tax laws that in effect provided oil and gas companies  interest-free loans. It was America's first fossil fuel subsidy.   Perhaps it is no surprise, then, that given the various issues and  struggles and costs, Ford chose to focus on an internal combustion  engine.   Just thinking about it, more than 100 years later, we are still  lighting prehistoric plants and animals on fire to get to the grocery  store and to get to work.   Now, it is true that my home State of Michigan benefited from these  choices. We put the world on wheels. We are extremely proud of our  place in history and extremely proud of the wonderful workers, the  skill and ability of our workers. But I also understand that we would  have been better off today if the issues of carbon pollution had been  addressed at the very beginning.   The good news is that we have the opportunity now to fulfill Ford and  Edison's electric vision. Just last week, I toured GM's new Factory  ZERO, which soon will be building electric Hummers and electric Chevy  Silverado trucks. These are big vehicles, and they are going to be all  electric. It is very exciting. Stellantis has plans to build four new  electric hybrid Jeeps in Detroit, and Henry Ford's company is investing  more than $22 billion to introduce electric versions of its vehicles,  including Mustangs, Ford F-150 trucks, and commercial vans--all very  exciting.   These changes are what we need right now, but our car companies can't  do it without a partnership with us, with the Federal Government. Just  as companies around the world have not had to do it alone, we need to  make sure we are partnering with them to actualize this vision for the  future.   You know, the oil companies like to say--whenever we talk about  various incentives for wind or solar or electric vehicles or batteries,  they always like to say: We shouldn't be picking winners and losers in  our country. But I would argue that in 1916, with the first fossil fuel  subsidy, our country picked a winner, and they have been subsidized  over and over again and winning the energy race ever since. In fact,  that subsidy is to the tune of at least $20 billion every year. Even in  the tax cuts in 2017, the Republican tax cuts for the wealthiest and  most well-connected people in the country, there was even another new  foreign oil tax break in there.   I would argue it is time to give equal opportunity to competing  technology and level the playing field. At the same time, we can create  good-paying jobs here at home, revitalize American manufacturing, and  put America in the driver's seat of the clean energy future. That, we  can do--that is so exciting to do--if we work with our President to get  this done.   If we are going to build back better, it is time to start building.  The first thing we can do is to pass the American Jobs Plan, which  invests in American manufacturing, creates an American supply chain for  products and technologies, and strengthens ``Buy American'' laws. This  plan has been long overdue, I can tell you, and it is just the start of  what we need to do.   My bipartisan American Jobs in Energy Manufacturing Act, which I  introduced with Senator Manchin and Senator Daines, would provide  incentives for manufacturers to build and retool existing plants to  make advanced energy parts like semiconductors and batteries and retool  for electric vehicle  [[Page S1929]]  facilities. It builds on the successful 48C advanced energy  manufacturing tax credit, which I authored in 2009. That helped boost  U.S. manufacturing and create good-paying jobs then, and we can do it  now.   On the Finance Committee, we are also working on legislation that  would provide an investment tax credit for building American battery,  semiconductor, and solar cell plants and a corresponding tax credit for  producing these key components.    I am so pleased that President Biden's American Jobs Plan includes  electric charging stations as part of our infrastructure investment--it  certainly is part of our infrastructure for the future, for today and  tomorrow--and consumer incentives to purchase electric vehicles.   We also need to make sure that American taxpayer dollars are spent on  American products. You know, that sounds simple, but that is actually  not what is being done in every case right now, even though we have had  laws on the books for decades and decades and decades.   My bipartisan Make It in America Act with Senator Braun makes it  harder for Federal Agencies to use waivers to get around ``Buy  American'' rules to purchase foreign-made products. Right now, there  has not been enough accountability and structure to make sure that  waivers are not being given so that purchases can be made of foreign  cars. That needs to stop.   I also want to thank Senator Tammy Baldwin for her leadership on  these ``Buy American'' issues as well.   The Federal Government is an enormous consumer, and we are set to  make big infrastructure investments. ``Buy American'' rules means that  American dollars flow into local economies when we purchase American- made PPE and American-made iron and steel and great American-made  electric vehicles. These rules also create good jobs, and we will need  highly trained workers to fill them. By investing in our workforce,  which is an important part of this plan, we will help the 18 million  Americans currently on unemployment find new opportunities--and others  as well--new opportunities for good jobs and will ensure that our young  people are on a path for good-paying jobs, including skilled trades,  after high school.   I am laser-focused on supporting our community colleges and uplifting  and expanding registered apprenticeship programs because these  institutions and programs help build our middle class and ensure  working people have the skills they need to thrive, not just survive.  These are great-paying jobs, professional jobs, licensed, highly  skilled jobs, and we need to be encouraging more and more young people  to be able to choose these jobs.   Henry Ford once said this, one of my favorite quotes:         What's right about America is that, although we have a mess       of problems, we have great capacity--intellect and       resources--to do something about them.    There is no doubt that we face big challenges, but Henry Ford was  right: We do have great capacity, intellect, and resources to do  something about them. Now is the time to do that, to act. People in  Michigan have been waiting long enough, waiting way too long, and  people across the country have waited far too long for us to act on  what we know we can do to make things in America, to remake things in  America, to build back better. We can make this an American moment, or  we can sit back and wait for the future to happen to us.   This is the moment to invest in our workers who build our country's  infrastructure, including those things we need today that they didn't  need 100 years ago, like high-speed internet and electric charging  stations, and the things that we will need to make us successful and  global leaders moving forward.   We need to rebuild our supply chains in America so we are not being  held up because of a really important part that is made only in one  country halfway around the world. That is absurd. We can do that. We  can do that. We can do that by deciding we are going to invest in  America. And we need to use the power of American ingenuity to ensure a  livable and prosperous future for everyone.   This is the moment to act. I am excited about that. I know that we  have this moment right now to be able to jump-start the future, to be  able to build our economy back better, to make things in America, and I  hope we will seize this moment   I yield the floor.
