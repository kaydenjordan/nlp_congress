 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support Senate Amendment to H.R.  1957. The Great American Outdoors Act is landmark legislation that will  clear the maintenance backlog at our National Parks, protect our  country's ecosystems, and permanently fund the Land and Water  Conservation Fund (LWCF). The permanent funding of the LWCF has been  one of my longtime goals. When I was Chairman of the Natural Resources  Committee, I introduced the Conservation and Reinvestment Act (CARA)  with my dear friend, the late Chairman John Dingell by my side. Today  marks the culmination of our work, and I am proud to have accomplished  this with the help of John's wife, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. My  enthusiasm for permanent LWCF funding is as strong now as it was then.  In recognition of this day, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the  following op-ed that I authored in the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner on  July 4, 2000 in support of CARA.        [From the Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-Miner, July 4, 2000]                 Legislation Bestows Lasting Alaska Returns                               (By Don Young)         There's been a lot of interesting speculation about my       legislation called the Conservation and Reinvestment Act.       Numerous stories and editorials have been written about what       this landmark bill would do and why I led the effort to pass       such a major conservation package.        Even News-Miner columnist Fred Pratt has devoted a       significant amount of attention to CARA and my participation       in this process. In his most recent column, he speculated       that I wrote the bill to benefit Alaska Native corporations.       This was a new and novel theory, but unfortunately, not       accurate.        The truth is actually very simple--CARA is good for all       Alaskans.        In Alaska and throughout the nation, CARA will increase       funding for federal and state conservation and recreation       programs, urban parks, historic preservation, and wildlife       conservation. The bill also resolves a major inequity       regarding the disposition of funds generated from Outer       Continental Shelf activities.        Currently, states receive 50 percent of the revenues for       onshore oil production but nothing from the federal waters       six miles and beyond a state's coast. CARA corrects this       problem by creating new programs that benefit coastal states       with the OCS revenues, which have averaged between $4 to $5       billion annually. Under CARA, $2.8 billion of this funding       will go toward important recreation, wildlife and       conservation programs each year.        In addition, CARA creates new private property protections       which go beyond existing law.        Alaska will receive about $2.5 billion during the 15-year       period included in CARA for these programs. Each year, Alaska       would receive: $87 million for coastal conservation programs;       $38.5 million for state and federal land conservation under       the Land and Water Conservation Fund; $17.5 million for       wildlife conservation; $9.8 million in PILT payments; $9       million for federal and Native land restoration; and about       $1.5 million for historic preservation and endangered species       programs.        In previous years, the LWCF has helped fund several popular       Alaska projects including Alaskaland in Fairbanks, the       Coastal Trail in Anchorage and Eagle Crest in Juneau. The       increased funding for the state programs under the LWCF will       allow for local communities to determine how these funds are       spent in their own communities based upon their local       priorities, rather than federal dictates.        Despite inaccurate claims by fringe groups like the       American Land Rights Association, CARA also includes new       private property protections that go beyond existing law. No       new federal land can be acquired under CARA without the       specific approval of Congress. The federal government can       only purchase land from willing sellers--condemnation is not       allowed under CARA unless it is specifically approved by       Congress. CARA also created new requirements to protect land       owners who do not want to sell their land from new       regulations.        Additionally, the administration must seek to use land       exchanges and conservation easements as alternatives to       acquisition. These new protections were included to enhance       private property rights in all 50 states.        Despite the noisy opposition by some fringe groups, CARA is       supported by thousands of organizations and officials       throughout the nation. Last month, CARA was overwhelmingly       approved by the U.S. House by a 315 to 102 vote with a       majority of both Republicans and Democrats voting for passage       of the bill. CARA is supported by all 50 governors, the U.S.       Conference of Mayors and the National Association of       Counties. CARA has also been endorsed by more than 4,500       organizations including numerous conservation, hunting,       fishing, and recreation groups like the National Rifle       Association, and other organizations like the U.S. Chamber of       Commerce and the National Association of Realtors.        Alaskans know that over the past 27 years, I have lead the       effort for the authorization of the trans-Alaska pipeline,       oil development in Prudhoe Bay and the Coastal Plain, a       strong mining industry, and numerous other economic programs       in every region of the state.        During this same period, I have also authored numerous       important conservation bills including the reauthorization of       the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act and a       comprehensive improvement of America's national wildlife       refuge system.        In addition, I have authored and supported dozens of bills       to promote hunting, fishing and outdoor recreation in our       state and the entire nation.        Fred Pratt is correct. CARA and its expanded conservation,       wildlife and recreation programs is consistent with my 27-      year congressional record of working for Alaskans.        Don Young has served as Alaska's sole representative in       Congress since 1973.
