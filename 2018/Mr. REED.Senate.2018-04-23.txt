 Mr. President, this week we solemnly observe the 103rd  anniversary of the Armenian genocide.   Over a century ago, one of the greatest tragedies of the 20th century  began when the Young Turk leaders of the Ottoman Empire executed more  than 200 prominent Armenians. What followed was an 8-year systematic  campaign of oppression and massacre. By 1923, an estimated 1.5 million  Armenians were killed, and over a half a million survivors were exiled.   These atrocities affected the lives of every Armenian living in Asia  Minor and, indeed, across the globe. The U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman  Empire during this dark time, Henry Morgenthau, Sr., unsuccessfully  pleaded with President Wilson to take action and later remembered the  events of the genocide, saying, ``I am confident that the whole history  of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this. The great  massacres and persecutions of the past seem almost insignificant when  compared to the sufferings of the Armenian race in 1915.'' Clearly, the  suffering of the Armenian people must never be forgotten.   The survivors of the Armenian genocide, however, persevered due to  their unbreakable spirit and steadfast resolve and went on to greatly  contribute to the lands in which they found new homes and communities,  including the United States. That is why we not only commemorate this  grave tragedy each year, but we also take this moment to celebrate the  traditions, the contributions, as well as the bright future of the  Armenian people. Indeed, my home State of Rhode Island continues to be  enriched by our strong and vibrant Armenian-American community.   This genocide has been denied for far too long. To honor the memory  of this tragedy, I have joined with several of my colleagues on  resolutions over the years to encourage the U.S. to officially  recognize the Armenian genocide.   As we remember the past, we remain committed to forging a brighter  future. We must continue to guard against hatred and oppression so that  we can prevent such crimes against humanity.   As ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I remain  committed to supporting assistance to Armenia to strengthen security,  promote economic growth, and foster democratic reforms and development.   We must find a way to come together to recognize the truth of what  happened and to provide unwavering support and assistance to those  facing persecution today.                            ____________________
