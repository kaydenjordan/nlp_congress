 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of  Willie Mims.   Mr. Speaker, throughout Mr. Mims' life he has shown his commitment to  educating, serving, and empowering residents of the community that I  have represented for some time now in Contra Costa County in the San  Francisco Bay Area.   In 1963, Willie began engaging in local politics, advocating for the  Rumford Fair Housing Act, which aimed to combat racial discrimination  in housing in California. He went on to obtain his teaching credentials  and had a long career in teaching with the Vallejo City Unified School  District.   Willie is also an original member of Pittsburg's Black Political  Association and part of the executive committee of the East Contra  Costa County Branch of the NAACP. He was instrumental in the creation  of the Antioch Unified School District's African American Male  Achievement Initiative, which sought to address racial disparities in  education. Willie received the Dr. Martin Luther King Freedom Fighter  Award in 2008 in recognition of his many efforts to promote racial  justice and equity.   Willie is a true leader and friend. We are grateful for the positive  impact that his work has had across our community. Please join me in  recognizing Willie for his many years of devoted service to his  community.                            ____________________
