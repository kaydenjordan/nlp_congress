 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 732, the inaptly titled Stop  Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017, which would flatly ban the  enforcement of any settlement agreement that seeks to remedy the  general harms caused by unlawful conduct.   This prohibition would broadly apply to all civil and criminal  settlements with limited exception, encroaching on the Justice  Department's longstanding legal authority to negotiate and enter  settlement agreements.   Since its establishment in 1870, the Justice Department has possessed  plenary authority to litigate on behalf of the government in all civil  and criminal litigation except as otherwise provided by law.   Since at least as early as 1888, the Supreme Court has upheld this  broad grant of authority, holding that it extends to settling  litigation on behalf of the government or making enforcement decisions  in light of priorities and resources.   In Heckler v. Chaney, for example, the Court held in 1985 that, in  many cases, enforcement decision within the Justice Department's  expertise make it ``far better equipped than the courts to deal with  the many variables involved in the proper ordering of its priorities.''   This rationale also extends to the terms of settlement agreements,  which ``involve numerous complicated technical issues as well as  important judgments respecting the use of limited prosecutorial  resources'' and are ``best left in the hands of expert agencies and  prosecutors, rather than dictated by Congress or the Federal courts,''  as environmental law professor Joel Mintz has noted.   H.R. 732 undermines this longstanding policy by strictly curtailing  the enforcement discretion of the Justice Department and the other  enforcement agencies when resolving a party's civil or criminal  liability on behalf of the Federal Government.   As the Justice Department observed last Congress in the context of a  substantively similar bill, ``limiting the Department's discretion to  negotiate appropriate terms of settlement, which are voluntary and  agreed to by the parties, may result in fewer settlement agreements,  protracted litigation, and delays for victims who need the relief.''   Without this discretionary authority, the Department concluded that,  ``the government may not be able to adequately address the full scope  of the harms that a defendant's illegal actions caused.''   In contrary to the arguments of the gentleman from Virginia, despite  2 years of investigation by the Judiciary Committee into the Justice  Department's use of settlement agreements, no evidence was found to  show that the mortgage fraud settlements contain terms that were  politically motivated. But we did learn that the sole mission of the  Justice Department's settlements under the prior administration was to  aid the families whose economic security was jeopardized by reckless  Wall Street behavior and prevent them from losing their homes due to  fraudulent mortgage practices.   There are many examples where generalized harm is impossible to  calculate or impractical to quantify in the courts. Without this  ability by the Justice Department to enter into these settlement  agreements, corporate wrongdoers are going to be free to do whatever  they want.   I give you one example: Deepwater Horizon, which destroyed the  coastline. As part of that settlement, there was State-based cleanup  that was provided. There was funding for the National Fish and Wildlife  Foundation for remediation; things that were directly responsive to the  harm caused. But you couldn't quantify to an individual person, and  that is what this legislation will prevent.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I just want to ask the gentleman a  question.   You made reference to the decision of--I forget the word you used to  describe bureaucrats.    I think you said some pejorative word describing  bureaucrats.   But I just want to ask the gentleman--the settlements that are  described or the subject of this legislation, of course, are  settlements that would require court approval and enforcement. So I  think in fairness, when you say it is so that a bureaucrat doesn't get  to decide this, this is pursuant to litigation which the parties come  to an agreement that then the court must approve.   So this is really about respecting the ability of the court to assess  the propriety of a judgment. And I think there was a very famous  decision where one of the courts said the purpose of the Clean Water  Act was not to endow the Treasury, but to prevent harm. So the idea is  not just to generate money for the government, but to actually  remediate and respond to the harm that was caused by the corporate  wrongdoer.   I think that is why Mr. Johnson's amendment is important, brilliant,  and deserves our support.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 3, line 11, insert after ``settlement agreement'' the       following: ``(except as provided in subsection (g))''.        Add at the end of the bill the following:        (g) Exception.--The provisions of this Act do not apply in       the case of a settlement agreement that resolves the criminal       or civil liability of a financial institution for the       predatory or fraudulent packaging, securitization, marketing,       sale and issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 577, the gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment, which  would exempt from H.R. 732 any settlement agreement that directs funds  to reduce the effects of the mortgage foreclosure crisis through  foreclosure prevention assistance programs.   There is little debate that predatory and fraudulent activity in the  residential mortgage securities market was the primary cause of the  mortgage foreclosure crisis.   As U.S. District Court Judge Max Cogburn observed in 2014, one need  not ``be an expert in economics to take notice that it was the trading  of toxic RMBS''--residential mortgage-backed securities--``between  financial institutions that nearly brought down the banking system in  2008.''   The financial crisis blighted entire cities and communities,  resulting in more than 13 million Americans losing their homes between  2006 and 2014, an average of 850,000 per year.   Beyond the life-changing hardship and stress placed on families by  unlawful conduct in the housing market, the exponential rise in  foreclosures imposed significant external costs on families and  communities across the Nation.   Fraudulent activity in the housing market depressed home and  commercial real estate values, undermined economic development and  municipal revenue, deprived communities of public services, and  resulted in increases of violent crime in communities of significant  foreclosure activity.   Leading studies have also documented the contagious effects of  foreclosures, and not just the neighborhood immediately affected by the  foreclosures, but nearby vicinities as well, underscoring the diffuse  and systemic impacts of unlawful mortgage securities practices.   In response to the financial crisis, President Obama announced in  2012, the creation of an investigatory unit within the Justice  Department to: `` . . . hold accountable those who broke the law, speed  assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of  recklessness that hurt so many Americans.''   This unit secured more than $40 billion in civil penalties,  compensation, and consumer relief through settlement with five  financial institutions for alleged misconduct involving the packaging,  marketing, and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities.   Geoffrey Graber, who directed this effort within the Justice  Department,  [[Page H8124]]  testified in 2015 that these settlements meaningfully addressed the  vicious cycle of harm caused by fraud in the housing market by  achieving accountability from financial institutions that engaged in  wrongdoing related to residential mortgage-backed securities, and to  the extent possible, bringing some measure of relief to homeowners who  suffered as a result of the financial crisis.   In addition to civil penalties, these settlements included statements  of fact describing the pervasive fraud that permeated the mortgage  market. In just one example, a bank employee stated that he would not  be surprised if half of these loans went down, and that the banks  should start praying.   The settlements also included consumer relief provisions designed to  enable many Americans to stay in their homes by directing funds to  distressed homeowners, community reinvestment and stabilization, and  income-based lending for borrowers who lost homes to foreclosure.   The Department's settlement with Citigroup and Bank of America  additionally directed $50 million in funds to charitable housing  council programs and legal aid organizations to provide counsel to  homeowners entitled to relief under the settlement because they were  directly affected by the fraudulent and predatory conduct of the  settling banks.   As the Center for American Progress has noted, these funds account  for less than 1 percent of the overall amount of each settlement, and  will support services provided by housing counselors and other trusted  intermediaries that enable consumers to access the consumer relief to  which they are entitled under the settlements.   We should be doing everything in our power to keep American families  in their homes and off the streets, not letting big banks off the hook  for their predatory and fraudulent practices, and so I urge my  colleagues to adopt this amendment that will address this very  important issue.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, if I might just say briefly, the notion  that Congress can just do these appropriations itself sort of misses  the point. It is the responsibility of Article III courts to hear  disputes, supervise litigation, and enforce settlements.   It is an odd moment for Congress to take on the work of another  branch of government when we can't even do our own work here.   Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Conyers    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6  printed in part B of House Report 115-363.
