 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 803, the  Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act.   This legislation includes the text of my bill, H.R. 693, the San  Gabriel Mountains Foothills and Rivers Protection Act, which is the  result of decades of grassroots advocacy and community engagement to  improve protections and access for these treasured lands of southern  California.   The San Gabriel Mountains provide 30 percent of the Los Angeles area  water, comprise 70 percent of the county's open space, and are home to  historic habitats of species like the California condor and Nelson's  bighorn sheep.   This immense natural beauty exists right in the backyard of one of  the densest urban areas of our country, offering recreation  opportunities like hiking, fishing, and camping to the more than 15  million Americans that live nearby. That is so important because the  Los Angeles region is among the most park-poor areas in the country,  which means that too many communities are deprived of the well- documented public and mental health benefits that result from access to  outdoor recreation opportunities in their own neighborhood.   After President Obama granted my request to designate the San Gabriel  Mountains a national monument in 2014, we immediately began to see  cleaner rivers; improved facilities, like picnic areas; safer hiking  trails; and more rangers to interact with visitors.   Most importantly, it brought the entire community together to develop  a management plan for the monument with over 40 Members representing a  variety of stakeholders, such as water agencies, local governments, the  business community, and environmental advocates.                                time  1800    That is why this same level of protection is needed throughout the  mountains and in the communities that serve as their gateway.   This legislation would make that a reality by expanding the  Monument's boundaries to include the western Angeles National Forest,  establishing new and expanded wilderness areas, and protecting more  than 45 miles of wild and scenic rivers. It would also establish the  new San Gabriel Mountains National Recreation area to bolster the  connection between urban and wild spaces.   Mr. Speaker, for nearly two decades, so many stakeholders have worked  together with a common vision of a community seamlessly connected to  the beautiful wild lands in its backyard. Today, we have an opportunity  to realize that vision.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation.
