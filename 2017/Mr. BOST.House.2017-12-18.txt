 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Peoria, Illinois,  for hosting this Special Order on the State's bicentennial year.   You know, Illinois is a State of threes. You know, we had three State  capitals: Kaskaskia, Vandalia, and Springfield. We have three State  seals. A lot of people don't know that.   If you know Illinois well, you know that there is three distinct  parts of Illinois involved. Whether you are in politics or business, it  is always referred to as Cook County, the Collar counties, and southern  Illinois. In southern Illinois, we like to capitalize the ``S'' on  ``southern.''   There is one other thing that is in threes. If you listen to the  Illinois song, three people are mentioned: Lincoln, Grant, and Logan.   Now, the reason why I bring those up is because, tied with southern  Illinois and Illinois' 12th Congressional District--the district that  is the most southern and most western of the State of Illinois, which I  am proud to represent--actually was and had the first State capital.  Also, it has John A. Logan in that mentioning of those three names.   John A. Logan, if you heard that name before, if you are in D.C.,  there are many things that are named after Logan, including ``Logan  Circle.'' Logan was actually the gentleman who was laid in state--the  eighth person laid in state here in this Capitol, and that was because  he had established himself from deep southern Illinois. As a matter of  fact, his hometown was--my hometown was his farm, which was subdivided  to make that hometown.                                time  1945    As a matter of fact, the deed in abstract of the home that I was born  and raised in and the house that I later bought from my parents and  raised my children for the first 10 years of my marriage in that home,  my great-grandmother actually bought that property from his father.   John Logan established himself, which is really wild, and he actually  was such a large part of Illinois history. He first ran as a Democrat;  he was a district attorney. He then became a State representative, then  a State senator, then went on to be a Member of the U.S. Congress and  later a U.S. Senator.   It was during the time of the Civil War, when the Civil War broke  out, that there were questions on what would happen, because deep  southern Illinois was split during the war, though stayed united as a  State.   John Logan came back and led troops for the North. What is really  wild is after becoming a field grade general and a decorated war  general, he came back to southern Illinois, then went back into  politics as a Republican, and stayed a U.S. Senator but as a Republican  and was part of the reconstructionists.   The amazing thing about John Logan is that he actually ran for vice  president. They lost, he and Blaine. He then was running for president  and gave a long speech, actually, in the gentleman's hometown who is  hosting this tonight, for about 8 hours in the rain, got on a train,  came back to the capital here, and passed away with pneumonia.   Another great thing that happened in deep southern Illinois in the  Illinois 12th is the Lincoln-Douglas debates. I am blessed to have the  only district in the State of Illinois that has two Lincoln-Douglas  debate sites.   I am being questioned here that maybe there is one other.   Jonesboro, September 15, 1858; Alton, October 15, 1858. Very proud of  that. And, you know, these two went on after Douglas wins as Senator,  but then Lincoln ends up winning the Presidency.   There are several other things, but one other thing about deep  southern Illinois, look, many people don't realize that deep southern  Illinois has the smallest national forest in the Nation. The Shawnee  National Forest is located in John Shimkus' and my district. We share  it. It is truly a beautiful part of Illinois, wonderful rolling hills,  deep forests, much good there.   Also the Illinois 12th has Murphysboro, my hometown, which is the  barbecue capital of Illinois. We have teams that have won as many as  four grand championships and went on to create businesses all over this  Nation in that business and in the barbecue business, and we are very  proud of that. I would argue that maybe it is the barbecue capital of  the world. There may be others that would argue different with that.   How many of you, as children, remember the cartoon ``Popeye'', who  came from Chester, Illinois, in the Illinois 12th?   I am sure many of the other people who speak here tonight, Mr.  Speaker, are also proud of their home districts in the State of  Illinois, and should be, because I am going to tell you, whether it is  from Cairo, to Galena, to Chicago, to Mulkeytown, from Danville, to  East St. Louis, the State of Illinois is a great State. We love it.   We have good things and bad things that happen, but it has been a  great State that has helped this Nation, provided great leaders,  provided great people involved in all kinds of fields throughout this  Nation and this world.   I have no reservations in saying, and I am sure others would say this  about theirs, but I am so blessed, because I live in the most beautiful  part of Illinois, the most beautiful part of Illinois where it starts  out as the flatlands, what is commonly known as the prairies of  Illinois up around St. Louis and Alton, and it comes south. When you  get down to my area, it turns into rolling hills, rolling hills that  produce peaches and apples and grapes, the beautiful wineries, areas of  tourism, the land between the lakes, the land known as Little Egypt,  and I am so privileged to be able to represent that part of the State  of Illinois.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I know we are going to have a lot of other speakers  tonight, but I do want to tell you that Illinois, as I said, has had  good times and bad times, but there are a whole lot more good times to  come. It is a great place to live, it is a great place to raise your  children, and I thank God that I had the opportunity to be born and  raised there.
