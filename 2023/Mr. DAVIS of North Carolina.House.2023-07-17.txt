 Mr. Speaker, I missed votes due to a  death in the family. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 329, S. 111--Providing Accountability Through Transparency  Act, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 330, H.R. 813--Global Investment in  American Jobs Act of 2023, as amended.                            ____________________
