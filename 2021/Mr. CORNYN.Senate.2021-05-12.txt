 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, more than 4 million Texans, including half  of the children in my State, depend on the stability of the State's  Medicaid Program to provide healthcare for themselves and their  families. Everything from emergency room visits to mental health care,  Medicaid funding  [[Page S2466]]  is vital to the health of our most vulnerable friends and neighbors.  The same is true in virtually every State across the country.   Unfortunately, a recent move by the Biden administration has put the  healthcare of these vulnerable citizens in jeopardy. A few weeks ago,  the Biden administration rescinded approval of Texas's 1115 waiver  extension. I know that is an obscure reference to most folks, but,  basically, here is the long and short of it. The previous  administration reached an agreement with the State that will enable  billions of dollars to flow to Texans in need. Now, for some reason,  the Biden administration is trying to stop it.   The real question is, Why? Why would the Biden administration try to  jeopardize the healthcare for 4 million Texans, while the President has  consistently talked about ensuring every American has access to quality  healthcare. Just 2 weeks ago in his joint session to Congress, he said:         Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege in America.    So why would the administration take an unprecedented action to  reduce access to healthcare for some of the most vulnerable people in  my State?   Well, the official answer from CMS is to correct an administrative  error. But two Federal health officials did an unusual thing in  Washington, DC, albeit anonymously. They told the truth. They told the  Washington Post that this was done to ``push State officials toward  accepting the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion.'' It is pretty  bold to admit that this was not about an administrative error at all  but about forcing Medicaid expansion onto the State of Texas.    Many people will recall that this was a portion of the Affordable  Care Act which was held unconstitutional in an opinion written by Chief  Justice Roberts. Chief Justice Roberts said that the Federal Government  cannot put a gun to the head of the State and force it to accept the  Medicaid expansion since it is a joint program between the Federal  Government and the State. Now the administration is engaged in a game  of political chicken, with 4 million Texans on the line, and the only  ones who are getting hurt are the low-income and uninsured Texans whose  healthcare relies on this safety net.   This move by the administration would have been damaging during  normal times, but it is even more damaging after this unprecedented  year for our healthcare providers. In fact, it is downright reckless.  Hospitals and providers in Texas have been pushed to the brink during  the pandemic. On top of the additional expenses associated with COVID- 19, they have faced serious financial shortfalls from the pause on  nonessential medical procedures as well as the hesitancy of patients to  seek care because they have been worried about contracting the virus.   Now, more than ever, hospitals and healthcare providers need reliable  funding to plan ahead for their financial stability and uncompensated  healthcare costs. If this funding stream goes away or is disrupted, it  will directly threaten the healthcare for uninsured Texans and harm the  livelihoods of healthcare providers as a whole.   In rural areas and those that are already underserved, the  consequences of this move could not be more dangerous. Let's say the  Biden administration refuses to change course and Texas loses billions  of dollars in Medicaid funding. If uninsured patients in small towns go  only to local hospitals for emergency care, they will receive that  emergency care because that is another Federal law, called EMTALA. But  without the Federal funding to offset those costs, how would these  hospitals make ends meet? If these patients aren't paying out of their  pockets and the Federal Government is not helping to cover the costs,  what will happen?   It is pretty simple, actually. Without funding, the rural hospital  will close.   So those same uninsured patients will start visiting the second  closest hospital. In my State--it is a big State--that is, maybe, 30  minutes down the road. Maybe it is more than an hour away. Once again,  without Federal funding to help cover the costs of treating rising  numbers of uninsured patients, what will happen?   Well, that hospital will close too. We will descend into a death  spiral of hospitals and healthcare providers that close their doors  because they can no longer afford to provide healthcare. The hardest  hit patients won't be those with private health insurance; they will be  those low-income and uninsured patients, especially in rural and  underserved areas.   So the consequences of this irresponsible move by the Biden  administration could not be more serious, and they will be felt far and  wide because this funding is vital to our healthcare system as a whole.   It is not hyperbole to say that these are going to have life-and- death consequences. While patients in Texas may be the first to get  caught in the game of political chicken, they will not be the last.  There are only four States that don't have approved or pending 1115  waivers. Four--only four--don't have approved or pending 1115 waivers.  Every other State could find itself in the same situation as my State  in the coming months.   Florida was granted a waiver around the same time as Texas. What will  happen to vulnerable Floridians? Tennessee is already facing legal  challenges to its waiver. Will its providers be in jeopardy too? North  Carolina, South Carolina, Missouri, Idaho--the list of States that  could be impacted by this life-or-death game of chicken goes on and on.  The most vulnerable patients in States across the country could lose  access to healthcare because of the Biden administration's  irresponsible and reckless actions. Something must be done.   To state the obvious, the nominee to lead the CMS, Ms. Brooks-LaSure,  did not rescind the Texas Medicaid waiver approval. In fact, she has  not been confirmed as yet, but before her nomination can advance,  Members of the Senate deserve a commitment from the administration that  it won't try to force the hand of States by putting the healthcare of  millions on the line.   If we don't step up now and push back against this reckless move,  what State will be next? How far will the administration go--in the  words of Chief Justice Roberts--to put a gun to the heads of the  States, forcing them to dance to Washington's tune?   I have asked the administration to work with Texas to ensure that  millions of impacted individuals won't lose access to healthcare, but,  so far, there has been zero progress. The administration has been  unwilling to provide any assurance that an agreement with Texas could  be reached before the end of this fiscal year--something that would  have dire consequences for our providers, especially those in mental  and behavioral health.    As a reminder, the CMS said the only issue with the Texas waiver was  an administrative error. Now it won't even commit to providing reliable  care for these patients. This unprecedented action by the CMS threatens  the security of the Texas Medicaid Program. It disrespects the  continuity of this agreement, and it erodes the partnership between the  State and the Federal Government.   I think it also violates the constitutional authority of the States.  The Federal Government is one of delegated powers, with the rest  retained by the States and we the people. That was the basis upon which  the Supreme Court of the United States struck down the compulsory  Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Yet now the  administration seeks to do through the backdoor what it could not do  through the front door. This sets a dangerous precedent of the  administration's undoing of agreements, negotiated in good faith  between the States and the Federal Government, for purely political  reasons, and it could have cascading consequences across the country.   I appreciate Ms. Brooks-LaSure's experience in working with States to  develop these waivers as well as her willingness to talk to me about  this issue, but she doesn't have any authority to force the Biden  administration to undo its terrible and reckless mistake, at least not  yet. Until Texas can receive a waiver and an assurance that this action  will be rectified and the rug will not be pulled out from under our  poorest patients, I cannot support this nomination.   I urge my colleagues to stand up for the healthcare of their most  vulnerable populations and push the administration to find an alternate  path forward.  [[Page S2467]]  If they are willing to do this to my State, they will do it to your  State and every other State in the country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
