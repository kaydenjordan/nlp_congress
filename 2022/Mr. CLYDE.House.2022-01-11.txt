 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my sincere concern  for the falsehoods Democrats are spreading across the country regarding  Americans' ability to vote.   Over the last year, Democrats have repeatedly alleged that the 2020  election was the most secure election in American history, bludgeoning  any dissent or legitimate election integrity concerns as ``the big  lie.''   Yet in the same breath, the left has also spent the last year  championing an election reform bill, the so-called For the People Act,  that aims to federalize our elections processes, ban voter ID, and fund  incumbent campaigns with Americans' hard-earned tax dollars--in the  name of improving election security.   In fact, the Senate Democrats are attempting to destroy 200 years of  precedent by removing the filibuster to solidify Democrat control of  elections, thinly veiled as election reform.   But why is it necessary for the Federal Government to take over our  elections process--a role specifically designated to the States by our  Founding Fathers--if that process is working soundly and securely?   You see, Democrats are willing to put political gains above morality  in order to quench their ever-longing thirst for power. This is a  perfect example of ``the ends justify the means.'' And that is wrong.   It is really quite simple: Republicans want to make it easier to  vote, but harder to cheat. We should all want that. But no, Democrats  are tenaciously gearing up to destroy our Republic as we know it by  making it easier to cheat.   Take my home State of Georgia. Today, the Vice President and the  President will travel to Atlanta to spread more misinformation about  voting rights as an attempt to pressure the Senate to eliminate the  filibuster. Yet, Biden will conveniently leave several facts out of his  remarks:   He will refuse to admit that before this year his home State of  Delaware denied voters in-person early voting, and now only requires 10  days of early voting--less than Georgia's minimum of 17.   Why? Because this reality flies in the face of Biden's false  narrative that our democracy is under attack by Republican efforts.  This is more hypocrisy.   He will fail to mention that just last week, Georgia finally launched  an investigation into alleged illegal ballot harvesting in the 2020  election.   Why? Because this truth does not support Biden's vilification of  Republicans that raise concerns about the 2020 election.   He will ignore the fact that New York is attempting to grant more  than 800,000 noncitizens the right to vote in municipal elections.   Why? Because Biden is willing to overlook illogical and dangerous  solutions to obtain control over Americans' lives. Instead, he will  comically claim that many Republican States, including Georgia, are  attempting to disenfranchise Americans when in fact their State voting  laws strengthen election integrity to ensure every solitary American  has free, fair, and honest elections. One citizen, one vote.   I firmly reject Democrats' dangerous and deceptive ploy to centralize  elections in Washington. It is wrong for Americans. It is wrong for  election security. And it is wrong for the future of our Republic.         Congratulating University of Georgia's College Football Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 2022 College  Football Playoff National Champions, my alma mater, the University of  Georgia.    During a thrilling game last night, the Bulldogs defeated the  University of Alabama 33 to 18. This exciting win marks the first time  the University of Georgia will bring home the College Football Playoff  national championship trophy to Athens and our second national  championship trophy in the history of Georgia Collegiate Football. What  a triumphant ending to an exceptional season.   Congratulations to the talented young men that put their all into the  game, and to head coach, Kirby Smart, and the coaching staff for  leading the Dawgs to a monumental win. May God bless the great State of  Georgia as we now hail two champions from the 2021 season--the Atlanta  Braves and the Georgia Bulldogs.   Go Dawgs. Soli Deo Gloria.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 75th  anniversary of the Carroll Daniel Construction Company in Gainesville,  Georgia.   Since Carroll Daniel launched the company in 1946, the family-owned  construction business has grown exponentially. Currently, Carroll  Daniel Construction is led by a third-generation  [[Page H33]]  Daniel, Mr. Brian Daniel, who prides the company's success on his  family's decision to focus on people.   It is no wonder that his business in Hall County enjoys numerous  accolades, such as one of the ``Best Places to Work'' award, in  addition to other awards recognizing the company's remarkable projects,  including being named one of the ``Top Contractors in the Southeast.''   While Carroll Daniel Construction has strong roots in Gainesville,  the company has built some of the most impressive buildings across  northeast and southeast Georgia. Some of its well-known projects  include the observatory on Brasstown Bald and Lanier Technical College.  Additionally, the Carroll Daniel Construction Company had the  incredible privilege of pouring the concrete for the launching pad at  the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.   I am truly honored to represent such an outstanding family-owned  business that improved the communities in Georgia's Ninth District one  project at a time.   Congratulations, Carroll Daniel, on 75 strong and successful years.  May you have many more to come. Thank you. Soli Deo gloria.                            ____________________
