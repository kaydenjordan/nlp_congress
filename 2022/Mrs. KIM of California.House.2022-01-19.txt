 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, 1 year ago, I joined several of my colleagues-- especially the freshman Republican colleagues--in a letter to President  Biden showing our willingness to work with him on behalf of the  American people and to bridge the partisan gridlock, because our  President's success is our Nation's success.   While I am proud that 1 year later I have been able to get 12  bipartisan bills out of the House and four signed into law, I am  disappointed that the policies from the Biden administration encourage  more division, more Federal spending, and more crises hurting American  workers, families, and small businesses as we continue through the  COVID-19 pandemic.   Inflation is at a 40-year high, driving up prices everywhere from the  grocery store to prices at the gas pump. We have record high numbers of  migrants and illicit drugs at our southern border  [[Page H245]]  straining our resources and empowering drug cartels. Our disastrous  withdrawal from Afghanistan resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S.  servicemembers, and we still have left the lives of Americans and our  allies and military arsenal in the hands of the Taliban.   In the latest edition of partisan politics last week, one of my  bipartisan bills was taken over and instead became over 700 pages of  nationalizing elections and letting public funds be used for political  campaigns.   I will keep working through this gridlock, sticking to my  conservative policies and principles and fighting back against Big  Government and big spending policies.
