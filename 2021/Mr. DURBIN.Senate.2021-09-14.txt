Mr. President, this week, the Senate will continue the  important work of confirming President Biden's judicial nominees.   From the moment President Biden entered office, Senate Democrats have  worked closely with his administration to identify nominees with  impeccable credentials and extensive experience. Together, we have  worked to restore balance to our Nation's Federal courts by confirming  nominees with diverse professional and demographic backgrounds.   Today, I would like to speak in support of three such nominees: David  Estudillo, nominated to the Western  [[Page S6479]]  District of Washington; Angel Kelley, nominated to the District of  Massachusetts; and Veronica Rossman, nominated to the Tenth Circuit  Court of Appeals.   Judge David Estudillo is a native son of Washington State who has  devoted his entire legal career to serving his community. He was born  in Sunnyside, WA, where his parents run a small grocery store bearing  the family's name. His mom and dad first arrived in the United States  in the 1960s as agricultural workers through the Bracero program.  Inspired by his family's determination and tenacious work ethic, Judge  Estudillo decided to pursue a career in law. He received his  undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Washington and has  since practiced law in the State where he is now nominated to serve.   Since 2015, Judge Estudillo has served as a Grant County Superior  judge. When he ran for reelection in 2016, his record as a litigator  and a judge earned him broad support within Grant County and throughout  the State. He received endorsements from the Grant County Democratic  and Republican Parties, as well as all nine State supreme court  justices.   Before his appointment to the bench, Judge Estudillo served as a  litigator for 16 years. He spent much of that time as an immigration  attorney, a role in which he assisted his neighbors with asylum  applications and helped explain the complexities of immigration law at  a host of community forums.   Over the course of his judicial career, Judge Estudillo has presided  over nearly 50 jury and bench trials that have gone to final verdict or  judgment. He will be more than prepared to take on the demanding work  of the district court from day one. Judge Estudillo has the strong  support of his home State Senators, Senators Murray and Cantwell, and  received a ``Qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. He  also received a strong, 15-7 bipartisan vote in the Judiciary  Committee.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his nomination to the  Western District of Washington.   Today, the Senate will also vote on Judge Angel Kelley's nomination  to the Federal District Court of Massachusetts. A graduate of  Georgetown University Law Center, Judge Kelley has the credentials,  experience, and temperament needed to effectively serve the people of  Massachusetts.   Prior to her appointment to the Massachusetts State court in 2009,  Judge Kelley was a prolific litigator who devoted her practice to  public service. She worked as a Federal prosecutor, an attorney for  indigent juvenile defendants, and as a senior litigator for the Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey, where she helped represent the  families of the 87 Port Authority employees who tragically lost their  lives on 9/11.   With 13 years of judicial experience, Judge Kelley has handled both  civil and criminal cases and presided over more than 100 trials. At  every turn, Judge Kelley has demonstrated the qualities we expect from  the best of jurists: thoughtfulness, evenhandedness, and impartiality.   Judge Kelley has the strong support of her home State Senators,  Senators Warren and Markey, and received a unanimous ``Well Qualified''  rating from the American Bar Association. Like Judge Estudillo, Judge  Kelley received a bipartisan 15-7 vote in committee, a testament to her  qualifications and commitment to the rule of law.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting Judge Kelley's  nomination.   Finally, the Senate will also consider today the nomination of  Veronica Rossman to a Colorado seat on the Tenth Circuit Court of  Appeals. With her extensive appellate experience in both private  practice and as a Federal public defender, Ms. Rossman will be an  outstanding addition to the Tenth Circuit.   She has spent the majority of her career at the Office of the Federal  Public Defender for the Districts of Colorado and Wyoming, where she  has handled and supervised over 100 criminal appellate matters arising  out of every judicial district in the Tenth Circuit.   As I have said many times, former public defenders, like Ms. Rossman,  offer a crucial perspective that is often underrepresented within our  Federal judiciary. And I applaud President Biden and Senators Bennet  and Hickenlooper for supporting her nomination.   In private practice, Ms. Rossman specialized in complex civil  litigation, including appellate cases and matters involving antitrust  law and intellectual property law. She has received a ``Qualified''  rating from the American Bar Association and earned bipartisan support  in the Judiciary Committee.   Ms. Rossman is a seasoned practitioner in Federal courts, and she is  well prepared to serve on the Tenth Circuit. I look forward to  supporting her nomination, and I encourage my colleagues to join me.   During the first 8 months of the Biden administration, this Senate  has made tremendous progress in confirming to the bench individuals who  have dedicated their careers to defending the rule of law.   With the three nominees before the Senate today, we can continue  building on that progress and bring our Federal judiciary closer to  reflecting the full diversity of the American experience.                          Vote on Kelley Nomination     I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) is  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) is  necessarily absent.
