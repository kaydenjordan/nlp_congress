 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to send an unequivocal, simple  [[Page H1261]]  message to the transgender community: We have your back.   The dangerous rhetoric we have seen across the country--including in  this very body--in the last week is nothing short of reprehensible, and  I for one will not allow this hateful and vitriolic rhetoric to go  unanswered.   Transgender people don't need to be changed, criminalized, or  eradicated. They need to be loved, they need to be supported, and they  need to be able to look to their leaders in Washington and trust that  we will protect their rights to live freely and safely, just as we  would any other person in America.   Oregon has consistently led the way in the fight for transgender  rights, and I am so proud to be from a State that prizes support over  suspicion, compassion over culture wars, and humanity over hatred.   In Oregon we say gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans, nonbinary, two  spirits, queer, intersex, and asexual.   Oregon is proof that we can be better than this, and for the sake of  the transgender community we must be.                            ____________________
