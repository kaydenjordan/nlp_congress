 Mr. Speaker, despite the saturation of negative  media coverage of President Trump, the people have spoken. A recent  poll found that President Trump is thought more trustworthy than the  news media.   The administration is considered truthful by 49 percent of registered  voters, but the media is less trusted than the administration, with  only 39 percent finding it honest. So President Trump is more credible  than the liberal national media.   That is no surprise. If the media wants to increase their  credibility, they should report the news fairly, objectively, and  without malice.                            ____________________
