 Mr. Speaker, it is with profound honor and great  humility that I rise on this historic floor to recognize and honor the  great Chairman John Dingell--the day after the birthday of the great  President Lincoln, might I add.   It is clear that John Dingell's life manifested Michigan. He depicted  that rich legacy that our State symbolizes. Mr. Dingell was a veteran,  a man of dignity, honor, and great fortitude. He most assuredly  represented a great America, that great generation. It was his life,  this long life, that is compounded by its beginning and its end and  that arc of progress that he certainly represents.   Mr. Dingell loved life, and he loved this body. He loved this House  of Representatives. He was the man of the House. He was the dean of the  House. I lovingly referred to him as ``The Dean.''   As we remember the Honorable John Dingell and reflect on what he  meant to this body, to this Nation, and to our great State of Michigan,  as somebody who is now representing parts of southeastern Michigan that  touched the auto industry he so loved, we can remember his steadfast  support of our domestic automakers over the decades.   John Dingell understood the fate of the auto industry and the fate of  southeastern Michigan and Michigan as a whole as being forever  intertwined, that so many Michigan workers depend on the success of our  auto industry, from General Motors to Ford, Chrysler, all the way down  the supply chain.   I had the privilege, not as a Member of the House of Representatives,  but as a White House appointee in the administration of Barack Obama in  the United States Department of the Treasury, on the team that was  responsible for saving General Motors and Chrysler--we were called the  auto rescue team--10 years ago when Mr. Dingell was raising his voice  and leading conversations in standing up for that auto industry. Just  as he always has been a ferocious advocate, he was then a ferocious  advocate for the Federal initiative to save our automakers from  liquidation, to save over 200,000 Michigan jobs, and to stand up for  Michigan and everything we represent.   Today, there are thousands of families in Michigan who have kept  their jobs because of John Dingell, whose value of work is respected  and understood because of John Dingell. To him, that was just another  day of work. To him, public service and doing right by his constituents  was simply second nature.   Any elected official in our country--and there are 535 of us who sit  in the House of Representatives and the Senate--would all be wise to  study John Dingell's passion, his mastery of legislating, his  dedication to public service.                                time  1830    In an era that has sometimes felt very polarizing, somehow this man,  this great dean of ours, is the great unifier. And we saw that in his  passing. We saw that when we welcomed his casket to the Capitol, and we  will see that tomorrow at his funeral in Washington, D.C.   John Dingell knew how important it was to bring industry and labor to  the table during the policymaking process. He knew that the auto  industry needed a friend, needed a champion for everything that was  right by our country and, frankly, our State's origin. He made our Big  Three stronger by pushing them to adopt fuel emission standards.   You see, complicated policymaking brings all the stakeholders to the  table, and John Dingell knew how to do that. He knew how to do that for  the environment; he knew how to do that on safety; and he certainly  contributed to a safer, more sustainable industry that has its moonshot  views of the future, the visions of the future around zero emissions  and zero accidents that are now being shepherded by the workers and  innovation and the talent in our State.   John Dingell also strived to do the most good. He understood what  service meant. He understood what doing the most good for the most  people meant. He fought for our water; he fought for our infrastructure  guarantee; and he fought for universal healthcare every day he was  here.   He had such a profound respect for his colleagues, even when he  disagreed with them. And he loved his wife. He loved his wife for all  40 years.   And we heard howlings from this Michigan delegation. We celebrate and  we share that love for the great Debbie Dingell, who has been such a  pillar of strength, of openness, of vulnerability.   I told Congresswoman Dingell: You are every woman today. You are  every woman in your grief.   And as we recognize her incredible husband, as we recognize him here  [[Page H1568]]  today in this codified moment and as we carry his torch forward-- because that is what we do through the generations is we pick up the  torch and keep carrying it forward--we will also continue to carry  Congresswoman Dingell forward in her grief and in her adjustment and in  the memory of her husband.   As such, John Dingell most assuredly will also be remembered in our  great State of Michigan, watching the people come to pay their  respects, the servicemen and -women, the thousands of people who felt  connected to his life and his life's work. It is what Vice President  Biden referred to as his great dignity: his respect for his friends,  for his neighbors, for his fellow man.   His contributions to this Nation will not be forgotten, and they will  certainly be felt for generations to come.   So today, in a very official way, I say good-bye to the chairman, to  the dean, to the Congressman, to the veteran John Dingell.   Thank you. We will miss you dearly.
