 Mr. Speaker, it is hard to believe Tuesday will mark 10  years since my dad passed away from cancer at the age of 54.   When I think back on that moment in my life, I will never forget the  last conversation that we had when he told me to always keep my moral  compass, to always do God's work, and that to whom much is given, much  is required.   Hopefully, over the last decade since his passing, I have lived up to  his expectations as a person, as a son, as a brother, and now as a  husband and father.   My dad was a recovering alcoholic. He had been sober for 20 years  when he passed.   What was remarkable at his death was that over 1,300 people showed  up--half of whom I had never met in my life. Almost all of them said  how much ``Kevin L.'' helped them to become sober and to live their  life in a purposeful way.   I can think of no better way to honor his memory than to see the  lives that he impacted during his lifetime.    So, Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to enter his name, ``Kevin A.  Lawler,'' into the Congressional Record and remember him on what will  be the 10th anniversary of his passing.                            ____________________
