 Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the  comments of my colleague from Delaware with respect to Senator Enzi. He  is absolutely right. Senator Enzi, who will be laid to rest in Wyoming,  was a wonderful public servant and someone who there weren't any  pretensions about him. He was a ``what you see is what you get'' type  of individual, somebody who worked hard every day, was solutions- oriented, results-oriented, and brought with him a humble spirit and  demeanor that we all benefited from here, and something that I think  all of us could aspire to here as well.   And I was reminded as my colleague from Delaware was speaking, of a  verse in the Old Testament Book of Micah, where it says:         He has told you, old man, what is good. And what does the       Lord require of you but to do justice, to love kindness, and       to walk humbly with your God.    And I think that certainly describes Senator Mike Enzi. And we think  about him and his family and keep them in our prayers as they prepare  for that ceremony tomorrow.                                  Broadband    Mr. President, as a Senator from a rural State and a member and  former chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, expanding broadband  access to rural areas has long been a priority of mine. Given our  economy's increasing reliance on broadband in the digital age, it makes  sense, as part of this infrastructure bill, that we are prioritizing  expanding broadband access to unserved areas.   But I have to say I am concerned, because a lot of the money  allocated for expanding access--more than $42 billion--would be  funneled not through the Federal Communications Commission, where the  majority of the Government's broadband experience resides, but through  the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information  Administration, or NTIA, which has previously fumbled attempts to bring  broadband access to more communities.   Back in 2009, a government stimulus bill allocated $4.7 billion to  NTIA to expand broadband access in rural and underserved areas. It  didn't go very well. The Agency struggled with implementation. There  were serious issues with a number of the projects the Agency approved.  In fact, 14 projects were either temporarily or permanently halted.   Other projects resulted in a significant amount of overbuilding,  meaning that they resulted in the construction of additional broadband  infrastructure in areas that already had access to reliable broadband.  A Government Accountability Office report found that the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration lacked the data it  needed to determine whether areas were genuinely underserved.   More recently, just last month, the NTIA called for ``volunteers''-- volunteers--to evaluate grant proposals. That is right. The NTIA has  called for volunteers to help determine how to allocate the $1.5  billion Congress has provided to NTIA over the past year to improve  broadband access.   Now, we should think long and hard before giving the Agency the  authority to administer more than $42 billion in grants when it has to  call on volunteers to help allocate a tiny fraction of that money.   NTIA simply has not demonstrated its ability to administer a grant  program of this size and complexity. A much better alternative would be  to put the Federal Communications Commission in charge of disbursing  broadband funds.   In contrast to NTIA which has just 157 employees, the Federal  Communications Commission employs more than 1,400 people. It has the  staffing resources it needs in-house to administer this grant program.  The FCC also, crucially, has the necessary expertise to identify truly  unserved areas so that Federal dollars go to communities with the most  significant lack of broadband access.   I have proposed an amendment to the infrastructure legislation before  us that would strike the NTIA grant program and redirect that money to  the bipartisan legislation I have introduced--the Rural Connectivity  Advancement Program Act.   The Rural Connectivity Advancement Program Act would mandate that 10- percent of the net proceeds of any spectrum auctions mandated by the  Federal Government go to building out broadband networks with the goal  of strengthening connectivity in rural and Tribal areas. Redirecting  the proposed $42 billion in grants to this program would allow the  Federal Communications Commission to administer these funds, which  would make it more likely that this funding would actually go to meet  the broadband needs of unserved communities.   On a related note, I have also introduced an amendment to strike a  provision of the infrastructure bill that would allow NTIA to make  changes to the formula that Congress is providing to determine what  areas of the country are eligible for grants.   Why is Congress bothering to put funding guardrails in this  legislation if it is going to allow the NTIA to change them at will?   As I have said, NTIA lacks adequate expertise when it comes to  identifying what areas of the country are truly unserved. And I am not  sure why we give NTIA the authority to change Congress's guidelines and  possibly further diminish the chances that this grant program will  deliver on its objective.   Unfortunately, just yesterday, the Senate voted down an amendment  offered by the ranking member of the Commerce Committee that would have  provided critical safeguards should NTIA establish this program. The  proponents of this legislation have reportedly received assurances from  the Secretary of Commerce about how NTIA will implement the bill.   If this bill is enacted, the Secretary should expect close scrutiny  from the Commerce Committee and be prepared to explain how she will  prevent a repeat of the Agency's past missteps. As I said, there have  been problems in the past with government broadband dollars going to  overbuilding of broadband in areas that already have a substantial  amount of access, and I am concerned that this bill could result in the  same problem.   In addition to the NTIA grant program, the infrastructure bill would  authorize the Department of Agriculture to improve grant funding of  areas where 50 percent of the homes lack adequate access to broadband  services. While this may sound like an appropriate percentage, the  truth is that a grant for building out broadband in an area where 50  percent of the homes already have adequate access is likely to result  in significant overbuilding at taxpayer expense.   We seem to have forgotten that Federal resources are--or at least  should be--limited. There are plenty of areas where broadband access is  almost nonexistent and where there is almost no available broadband  infrastructure to build on. And those are the first places where we  need to direct available government funding, which is why I am offering  an amendment to change the formula to require that proposed grants  cover an area where at least 80 percent of homes lack broadband access.  This bipartisan amendment deserves a vote.   I am also concerned that we are advancing this bill without any of  the provisions, particularly the broadband components, going through  regular committee consideration. The Commerce Committee has a long  history of  [[Page S5898]]  advancing legislation to expand access to broadband services. Rushed  legislative efforts that bypass the committees of jurisdiction and the  subject matter expertise that they offer could lead to billions of  dollars being spent with little to show.   I am appreciative of the efforts of the bipartisan negotiators who  crafted this bill. I know they share my goal of targeting broadband  resources to those most in need. I am very pleased that my  Telecommunications Skilled Workforce Act amendment received a vote the  other day and passed the Senate by an overwhelmingly bipartisan margin.  This amendment would help ensure that we develop the workforce  necessary to meet the demands of the next generation of mobile  broadband internet, 5G.   But I hope--I hope--that we will also have a chance to vote on my  other amendments--those I just mentioned--and amendments being offered  by my colleagues. Infrastructure legislation is tremendously important  to our economy, and we need to take the time to get this legislation  right. And that means giving Senators, who are not part of the working  group, adequate time to offer amendments and, hopefully, improve this  product. We have made some progress on that front this week, and I hope  to make more before finishing this bill.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
