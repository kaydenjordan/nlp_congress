 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Bill Lewis, who retired on Monday, August 12, after nearly 40 years  working in the Chatham County judicial system.   Chatham County's chief assistant public defender, Mr. Lewis found his  calling in 1980 after trying out a number of other careers first. The  combination of helping people while also being able to stand up,  arguing in the courtroom, drew him to the career.   And it paid off. In his own words, Mr. Lewis loved every day of his  job, and he liked defending people's freedom rather than fighting over  their money.   It also paid off for Chatham County because of Mr. Lewis' exceptional  reputation for being a calming voice in the courtroom and his care of  his clients.   During his tenure, he earned some of the most prestigious awards in  the Savannah area: the Robbie Robinson Award for his success in public  defense and the Thomas More Award for his religious affiliation and  commitment to humanity.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Lewis for his service to our community.  His work will be missed.                            ____________________
