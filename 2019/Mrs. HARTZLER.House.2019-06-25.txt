 Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure and personal  blessing to be able to congratulate and thank my friends Keith and Emma  Swartz for serving the Lord for over 40 years.   Pastor Keith Swartz has been a leader in my community, making a  difference in the lives of countless families, achieving 13 years as  principal and coach at the Harrisonville Christian School, as an elder  for over 20 years, and 26 years as associate pastor at my church, the  Harrisonville Community Church.   Emma Swartz inspired and equipped students from kindergarten to sixth  grade for 19 years at Harrisonville Christian School, as both principal  and teacher. She used her gift of teaching beyond the classroom as a  respected Sunday school teacher and a leader of adult Bible studies.   Together, they have ministered to countless individuals, visiting  them in the hospital and being by their side during the final days of  an illness, as well as supporting the families afterwards.   The foundation of their service began at home, where they raised four  beautiful children to love God and to love others; and, now, this  legacy of faith and service is being lived out in the lives of their 10  grandchildren.    Keith and Emma are special people individually, but, together, they  make a remarkable team that I have been blessed to know over the years,  and our church has been blessed by their service.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Keith and Emma on their retirement. I  hope they enjoy the days which they have worked so hard to earn, and I  wish them continued health and happiness in this new phase of life and  pray God's richest blessings on them.        Congratulating Rich Hill High School Boys Track and Field Team     Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Rich  Hill High School boys track and field team for winning the Class 1  State championship.   As a former track runner and track and field coach, I am thrilled to  have a school in my district take home the State championship. This  truly is a feat due in no small part to the hard work and talent of the  team and its leadership.   A Class 1 State record was also broken during the State competition.  Rich Hill, sophomore, Clifton Bridgewater, threw 177 feet to win the  boys javelin competition, breaking the previous record of 169 feet set  last season.   The outstanding performances by these Tigers mark a great milestone  for Rich Hill High School, and I would like to ask all Missourians to  join me in congratulating these Tiger teammates on this momentous  achievement.                            ____________________
