 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remind our constituents of  the work that we have been doing on their behalf. The House of  Representatives has passed nearly 400 bills this Congress for the  people.   For our Dreamers and TPS recipients, we passed an immigration reform  bill, the American Dream and Promise Act.   For our workers, we passed the Raise the Minimum Wage Act, to  increase the Federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, and the Butch Lewis  Act, to protect the pensions of more than 1 million workers and  retirees.   For the personal and financial security of America's women, we passed  a strong reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.   For our elections, we passed H.R. 1, which restores transparency and  accountability to our elections, which included my own legislation to  restrict foreign lobbying.   To strengthen our defenses against foreign attacks, we also passed  the SAFE Act and the SHIELD Act.   And for our LGBTQ community, we passed the Equality Act.   All of these bills have been ignored. Mitch McConnell brags about  being the grim reaper, and that is exactly what he has been for the  hopes and the dreams of the American people.   I would like to call for us to remind every single American of the  work that we have been doing.                            ____________________
