 Amendment II:   ``A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free  State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be  infringed.''    Mr. Speaker, we are about to vote on  the REINS Act, which will hold our agencies accountable to the people  of America. I am a proud cosponsor of this regulation, this  legislation. If a regulation has a high economic cost, then the people,  through Congress, have to approve it before it goes into effect.   The REINS Act is one of several bills we will be considering this  week to stop business as usual in Washington. We will be saying ``no''  to the overregulations of the last 8 years, ``no'' to the radical anti- coal agenda that has closed coal mines and cost my State of West  Virginia thousands of jobs, ``no'' to a Federal Government that won't  even come to West Virginia to hear how their regulations affect us.   West Virginians have had enough. They want change. They want their  voice to be heard. They want to work hard and put food on their table.   I am here to stand up for West Virginians: families, miners, and  small businesses. I urge my colleagues to support the REINS Act.                            ____________________
