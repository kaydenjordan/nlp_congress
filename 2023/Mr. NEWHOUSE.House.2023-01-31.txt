 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me say that I associate  myself with the remarks from the gentleman from Arizona and hope that  many people listen to his important messages that he provides for us.   Mr. Speaker, standing here in front of, what some would say, a  beautiful picture, this is a photo of a fire that occurred near Grand  Coulee Dam in my district about 1\1/2\ years ago to help depict  something that I want to bring some attention to this evening in this  Special Order.   My friend from Montana, Mr. Rosendale, and I, and several others,  will be talking about something that is critical to the people in the  Western United States. The communities across this country who will be  absolutely devastated if a radical environmental group gets its way in  a courtroom in the State of Montana.   Now, for those of you who may be unfamiliar with the Western part of  the United States, let me just tell you a couple things.   In many parts of the West, it gets very, very dry. And in the  summertime, that dryness is coupled with extreme heat. And this can-- although it makes for some gorgeous, beautiful days, but you may have  heard it often leads to catastrophic wildfires that devastate forests,  lives, property, and even full communities.   Now, fire in the forest is a natural occurrence and it is an  important part of that forest's lifecycle. But as many of us have been  saying for many years, and many of you know, much of our forest has  been poorly managed, if managed at all. There are decades of buildup of  dead trees, and brush, that are on our forest floors so that fires in  recent years have been truly catastrophic, leaving swaths of our  National Forest, nothing but ash, dead trees, blackened trees laying  all over the Earth, scorched Earth that cannot produce another crop of  trees.   In my district, in Okanogan County, the Whitmore fire back in 2021,  burned through almost 60,000 acres destroying several structures on the  Colville Indian Reservation and had as many as 500 residences under  level 2 evacuations. It was devastating.   But through the hard, backbreaking work of firefighters doing  everything that they absolutely could do to protect those communities,  I am happy to say that no lives were lost and it was successfully  contained.   I think I can say that everyone in this room agrees that we have to  do something about these catastrophic fires. And also, I think I can  say that when faced by fire, we can all agree that we must utilize  every tool in our toolbox to help prevent those fires from endangering  human lives.   I cannot say the same about a group that calls themselves the FSEEE.  For some reason, this organization, the FSEEE, have decided to use a  provision of the Waters of the United States Rules, or WOTUS, and put  the lives of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people, at risk  by removing one of the most important tools that we have to fight fires  in the West, and that is, aerial fire retardant.   For those who don't know, aerial fire retardant is dropped around a  wildfire's edges in an effort to contain its spread and allow ground  crews, those that are fighting fires by hand, the time that they need  to help extinguish the blaze. Firefighters calls this painting the box,  and use the respite that the retardant line gives them to safely build  a defensible line to hold the fire.   Aerial fire retardant is generally considered non-toxic but the  Forest Service prohibits placing these fire retardants directly into  water bodies or into buffer zones that surround water bodies with one  allowed exception: to protect human life and safety.   Between 2012 and 2019, less than 1 percent of Forest Service  retardant drops were made into water that was allowed under this  exception.   According to the FSEEE, by protecting human life and safety, the  Forest Service has violated the Clean Water Act for discharging aerial  fire retardant into navigable waters without an NPDES, or a National  Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit.   Even though the regulations for administering the NPDES system  specifically state that fire control is  exempted and communications  from EPA dating back all the way to 1993 indicate a permit was not  required for firefighting efforts.    Now, if this group wins this case or even receives an injunction, the  Forest Service and other firefighting organizations would be prevented  from aerially dropping fire retardant nationwide during the coming 2023  fire season, and even beyond, until they acquire this permit, the NPDES  permit, which as many of you know, can literally take years to secure.   Now, if you haven't already connected the dots, this would be  catastrophic for Western communities who routinely experience  wildfires.   The 2023 fire season, if you didn't know, has already started in the  drier parts of the country. It has already burned through over 11,000  acres this month, January, alone. The FSEEE claims to be doing this for  environmental reasons. I asked them:   How environmentally friendly is it to release millions of tons of  carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when these fires can't be  controlled?   How environmentally friendly is it to have burned soil, ash choke our  rivers and our streams?   How environmentally friendly is it to wipe out entire ecosystems,  plant life, wildlife, the trees, the birds, the wild animals?   And even if the FSEEE were able to prove me wrong on every single one  of these points, is all this worth the cost of human life?   Firefighters risk their lives to protect our communities, other  people, and our forests, and we should listen to them when they tell us  that fire retardant makes their job safer, and it truly is an essential  tool to protect lives.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in truly utter disbelief that I even  have to make this statement. That, no, the value of a human life is far  beyond that of some possible incidental disruption to aquatic  ecosystems that would be equally, or more accurately, more damaged by  the toxic runoff of ash following a wildfire.                                time  2000    We did ensure that fire retardant remains available to our  firefighters for this 2023 fire season and beyond.   Mr. Speaker, I turn to my friend from Montana, Mr. Rosendale, who is  co-leading this Special Order with me, for his comments from his great  State.    Mr. Rosendale, I appreciate that, especially coming  from the State of Montana. Your State, just like mine, has seen record  catastrophic fires over the last several years.   Thousands of acres have been destroyed throughout the Western United  States, millions of dollars of damage, lives lost, and communities that  have been totally destroyed. Untold numbers of wildlife have been lost.  These fires have literally changed the landscape of our national  forests for generations.   The carbon dioxide being emitted from these devastating fires  surpasses the auto emissions in just 1 year. The smoke from these fires  has even recently come as far as Washington, D.C. I had hoped that that  would get people's attention.   We are dealing with that on a regular basis all summer long in the  communities that I represent and that Mr. Rosendale represents, causing  health issues and tainting agricultural crops. It truly is an issue  that is hurting our quality of life.   If this court case is lost, the situation is going to get much worse.  We cannot let this happen.   To help tell the story that we are facing in the Western United  States, another Western Caucus member from the great State of Idaho,  the Gem State, Mr. Russ Fulcher, is here.    Mr. Fulcher, thanks for relating your experiences in  the great State of Idaho.   Mr. Speaker, fires are a huge problem in this country. We have been  working hard over the time I have been here in Washington, D.C., to  make this problem better.   This action, if this court decision moves forward, as we think it  might, is going to take us back years. It is going to make the problem  considerably worse. We must not let this happen.   I thank Mr. Rosendale from Montana for helping lead this Special  Order and Mr. Fulcher from Idaho for sharing with us his thoughts from  his home State. I thank members of the Western Caucus, almost a hundred  of us strong in this Congress, for focusing on this issue and bringing  to the attention of the American people how important this court  decision could be for the future of our national forests.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 12 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, February 1, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
