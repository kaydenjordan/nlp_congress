 Mr. President, today the Senate passes my annual  resolution to designate May 5 as National Day of Awareness for Missing  and Murdered Native Women and Girls, for the fifth year in a row. We  hope to continue drawing attention to this crisis as we work together  to find a solution.   I would also like to commend the work that the Trump administration  has done to address this crisis. In particular, they have established  the Lady Justice Program at the Department of the Interior and issued a  proclamation on November 26, 2019, to sustain public attention on this  ongoing and important situation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Jill LeBlanc of Broadwater County for her tremendous  efforts to support the community during the ongoing coronavirus  pandemic.   Jill is a certified physician assistant working on the frontlines of  the coronavirus pandemic at the Broadwater Health Center.   During the early stages of the pandemic, when the State of Montana  was responding to its first cases and health clinics were still  navigating procedures on how to handle the COVID-19 outbreak, Jill  dropped everything to go serve. She moved out of her home to keep her  children safe and spent countless hours at the hospital educating  herself and the staff at Broadwater Health Center with the necessary  information and up to date procedures on how to handle the outbreak.   Jill spent one-on-one time with each nurse on her shift to provide  consistent updates and guidance on CDC guidelines, proper protective  equipment protocols, how to handle isolated patients, and methods to  conduct testing for COVID-19, both inside the Broadwater Health Center  and through the drive-thru triage system.   When Jill is not working at Broadwater Health Center, she spends  additional time sharpening her skills at Deer Lodge Medical Center and  Benefis, where volumes of patients are higher.   It is my honor to recognize Jill as a health care hero working to  protect the health and safety of all Montanans during these uncertain  times. I know that the staff and the patients at Broadwater Health  Center are grateful for Jill's selflessness and leadership during this  pandemic. I am grateful to Jill for the extraordinary work she is doing  to support her community.                            ____________________
