 Mr. President, we yield back the time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.   The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1178.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of  the amendment be dispensed with.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The amendment is as follows:     (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to    providing tax benefits to patriot employers that invest in American             jobs and provide fair pay and benefits to workers)         At the end of title III, add the following:       SEC. 3___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO PROVIDING                     TAX BENEFITS TO PATRIOT EMPLOYERS THAT INVEST                     IN AMERICAN JOBS AND PROVIDE FAIR PAY AND                     BENEFITS TO WORKERS.         The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate       may revise the allocations of a committee or committees,       aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution,       and make adjustments to the pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or       more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, amendments between       the Houses, motions, or conference reports relating to income       taxes paid by businesses, which may include measures       providing tax breaks for companies that have not moved       overseas to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, have       maintained or expanded their United States workforce, or have       provided fair wages and quality health insurance, prepared       workers for retirement, hired veterans and workers with       disabilities, and provided paid family medical leave, by the       amounts provided in such legislation for those purposes,       provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit       over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2018       through 2022 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2018       through 2027.    Mr. President, I ask for support of the Patriot  Corporation Act amendment. It is all pretty simple. Over the years, we  have seen companies shut down production in Mansfield, OH, or Dayton,  OH, and move to Tijuana, Mexico, or Hunan, China, and then sell their  production back in the United States.   Under this simple idea, the Patriot Corporation Act, companies that  do the right thing--companies that pay their workers decent wages;  companies that do the right thing by their workers in terms of  benefits, healthcare, and pensions; companies that make their products  and keep their production in the United States--will get a tax break.  They will pay a lower tax rate.   Yesterday at the White House, about 15 Senators met with President  Trump. I talked to him about the Patriot Corporation Act. He said he  likes the idea.   It is about time that U.S. companies that do the right thing should  be rewarded instead of those companies that shut down production and  move overseas and sell their products back. It is the right thing to  do. It is a simple idea. Its time has come, Mr. President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.  [[Page S6621]]         I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.
