 Madam President, I rise today to extend my most sincere  gratitude to Rima Khabbaz, MD, the director of the National Center for  Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. Dr. Khabbaz is retiring  after spending 38 years at NCEZID, where her work focused on fighting  the spread of infectious diseases.   For the past 5 years at NCEZID, Dr. Khabbaz has led staff who monitor  and work to control dangerous pathogens in the United States and across  the world. Her time as NCEZID director concludes three decades of  leadership at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is  headquartered in the great State of Georgia, beginning with her role as  chief of the Human Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit in CDC's  Hantavirus Task Force in 1993 and 1994.   Dr. Khabbaz began her career at CDC as an epidemic intelligence  service officer in CDC's Hospital Infections Program from 1980 through  1982. She returned to CDC in 1986 and a year later became a medical  epidemiologist in the Retrovirus Diseases Branch. She quickly took up  leadership roles in historic outbreak responses, including those for  hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, anthrax, SARS, monkeypox, Ebola, Zika,  and COVID-19.   Over the past two decades, Dr. Khabbaz has led CDC's infectious  disease activities through some turbulent times and at the highest  levels. She was CDC's deputy director for infectious diseases and  director of the Office of Infectious Diseases from 2010 to 2017, where  she also temporarily served in dual roles as interim acting director of  the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and  interim acting director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral  Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.   Previously, she has served as director of the National Center for  Preparedness, Detection, and Control of Infectious Diseases; director,  acting director, and associate director for epidemiologic science in  the National Center for Infectious Diseases; and deputy director and  associate director for medical science in NCID's Division of Viral and  Rickettsial Diseases.   Dr. Khabbaz's departure from NCEZID marks the end of a truly  distinguished career. She will be especially missed by her colleagues,  who unfailingly describe her as an exceedingly insightful and caring  leader. Dr. Khabbaz's contributions to the health of the State of  Georgia, the United States, and the world are greatly appreciated. I  wish her a restorative and gratifying retirement following her nearly  40 years of government service.  [[Page S1830]]                                ____________________
