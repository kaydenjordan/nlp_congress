 Madam President, I understand there are two bills at the  desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc.    Madam President, I wish to first address the vote we held  yesterday--one that unfortunately failed but I believe was important  nonetheless. It would have set in motion a series of spending  reductions--not on bills where we had appropriated money for programs  and we knew where it was going to be used, but these were essentially  surplus funds which were not being used for the intended purpose and  which I believe should have been used to reduce our annual deficits and  ultimately our national debt.   I want to express my gratitude to Senator Lee, the Senator from Utah,  who spearheaded the effort to take up a bill that the House had already  passed.   What we were attempting to do was rescind nearly $15 billion in  previously appropriated money that has gone unspent, as I said a moment  ago. This was just one small way to show the American people that we  are serious--as the majority leader put it yesterday--about tightening  our belts financially and taking small steps that hopefully would add  up to big steps to live within our collective means.   I voted for the rescissions package because I believe strongly that  the government should prioritize keeping its fiscal house in order, one  that constantly works to improve and implement fiscal discipline.   I am concerned now that as interest rates are starting to rise, we  are going to see more and more Federal spending go to pay debt service  or interest payments on bonds that have been issued to secure our  national debt.   So I hope we can come back to the table soon with new ideas, and I am  disappointed in the outcome of that particular vote.                Keep Families Together and Enforce the Law Act    Madam President, I have also been speaking this week about the  ongoing situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. Of course, this is my  backyard. I come from Texas, and Texas has a 1,200-mile common border  with Mexico. We know, because we have all seen in the news and been  moved by these scenes of people illegally crossing the border with  children or individuals they claim to be their children and being  separated as they have been processed, consistent with current law,  including laws Congress had passed, signed by the President--not  necessarily this President, in fact--consent decrees, and other court  judgments that necessitated that children be treated differently than  people who illegally enter the country as adults.   I will be traveling to the Rio Grande Valley tomorrow. Senator Cruz  and I both will be in Brownsville and McAllen so we can learn from the  people who are working on behalf of all of us to make sure everybody is  treated with dignity and compassion. But we also enforce our laws  against illegal immigration.   President Trump yesterday issued an Executive order, which I viewed  as an emergency measure, that does not substitute for congressional  action. In fact, I am confident that the Executive order will be the  target of lawsuits. I think the only thing that could really settle the  matter once and for all is legislation, which I know the Presiding  Officer and I and others have cosponsored, to keep families together  and to maintain enforcement of our laws.   Executive orders, of course, as I said, are always subject to legal  challenge, and I think we ought to view this as more of a belt-and- suspenders. The President decided he wanted to do what he could on a  temporary basis, but it is just a temporary basis, and we need to make  sure, as I said, that this is finally settled so that no parent will be  separated from their child even if they enter the country illegally.  They will be treated both humanely and with compassion while they are  presented to a judge who will make a decision on whether they qualify  for a legal immigration benefit like asylum, for example.  [[Page S4320]]    The legislation I am referring to is led by the junior Senator from  North Carolina and is called the Keep Families Together and Enforce the  Law Act. As the title of the bill suggests, there are two parts:  treating families with compassion while allowing them to remain  together and enforcing the laws on the books. They don't have to be  mutually exclusive, and our bill would ensure that they are not. It  will allow children to stay with their families in a safe facility  while they await their court proceedings.   It will also set mandatory standards of care for family residential  centers where immigrant families are placed and keep children safe by  requiring that they are removed from the care of any individual who  poses a danger to them. Just as importantly, it will require more than  200 new immigration judges and require the Department of Homeland  Security to expedite the court proceedings for these children and  families.   Some have rightfully asked questions about the families who have  already been separated: What happens now to the children who have  already been separated from their parents?   I can tell you our bill requires the administration to take steps to  reunify as many families as possible who remain in the custody of  Immigration Customs Enforcement or Health and Human Services.   I have to tell you, this is an old movie in many respects. We have  seen this movie before, particularly in 2014, when we saw a flood of  unaccompanied children coming across the southwestern border. President  Obama, at the time, called it a humanitarian crisis, and I agree. We  simply weren't prepared for this flood of children from Central America  coming to our border and seeking refuge or asylum. We worked hard to  try to make sure they were treated compassionately and humanely, but  the law, similar to the law in effect now before the President's  Executive order and the law that would be modified by the new bill I  mentioned a moment ago--the current law requires those children to be  processed by the Border Patrol, to then be handed over to Health and  Human Services, and ultimately placed with a sponsor in the United  States pending their hearing on their immigration case. Because of the  huge backlog of cases, it could be literally months or years before  those cases are heard.   It shouldn't surprise anybody that the overwhelming majority of  individuals don't show up for their court hearing. That is why it is  important for us to move these cases to the head of the line, to  maintain a humane detention while they are awaiting their court  hearing--hopefully, in a matter of days or weeks, at most.   This is a huge problem that frankly was exposed, in part, by the New  York Times. It recently reported that based on the tens of thousands of  children who came across the border as unaccompanied minors who had  been placed with sponsors, in a check of where those children are now,  at least 1,500 of them are unaccounted for.   That should surprise no one because the sponsors were not required to  be citizens. They weren't required to be relatives. They weren't even  required to have a criminal background check. When the U.S. Government  places these children with sponsors in the United States with such  inadequate supervision and review, it should not surprise anyone that,  unfortunately, some of them will be unaccounted for; hopefully not  recruited into gangs, hopefully not trafficked for sex, hopefully still  alive. This is a huge humanitarian crisis, and the latest episode  having to do with separation of families is just the latest version of  that story.   Who benefits from status quo when we fail to correct our laws to make  sure that both individuals coming across the border are treated  humanely and that we enforce our immigration laws? Who benefits the  most? It is the transnational criminal organizations, the cartels,  which make money off the status quo. As one person called it the other  day, when they were referring to the situation, these organizations are  commodity agnostic. As long as they can make money, they will traffic  in people, drugs, weapons, and other contraband. They don't really care  as long as they make money.   Until Congress acts, as we must, these cartels, these criminal  organizations, will continue to exploit these gaps in American law, and  the people who will be hurt the most are these children and immigrants  who do have a case to make before the immigration courts.   I hope we will act. Frankly, our track record is not good when it  comes to fixing our broken immigration system, but I know Mrs.  Feinstein, the Senator from California, and Senator Tillis have been  talking, and a lot of us have been putting our heads together to figure  out how we can come up with a narrow bill that will keep families  together and allow us to enforce the laws of the land. I hope we keep  trying until we get it done and get it done right.   Other proposals have been made, including one by our friend the  senior Senator from California. She and I have worked together on many  issues, but on this one, I think her bill has a lot of problems. In  fact, there is a huge question about what sort of enforcement, if any,  would ever be permitted under her bill. In effect, her bill would make  it impossible to enforce the law against an adult illegally crossing  the border unless the child is able to go to jail with that adult. I  don't want a child to have to go to jail and be exposed to hard and  potentially violent criminals. This is a big problem with our friend's  bill, Senator Feinstein.   By the way, every single Democrat on that side of the aisle has  signed on to that bill. Did they intend this result? No, I don't think  they intended it, but it is a big problem with their bill. Children  should not go to a jail run by the Bureau of Prisons. No one, I would  think, would think that is a good idea. So that is essentially what the  bill results in.   Again, I am not saying this was their intention, but the result is to  reinstate this catch-and-release program, which has been a failure of  our immigration system for a long time. When there is nowhere for the  families to be detained and when they can't go to Department of Justice  facilities, basically, the authorities simply have to let them go and  say: Come on back in a few months, maybe a couple of years, when your  case comes up on the immigration court docket.   That is the result. As I said earlier, in the vast majority of cases,  people do not reappear because they understand, if they made it that  far, they are basically off scot-free. The cartels and the  transnational criminal organizations that traffic in people and  facilitate this sort of illegal immigration are the ones cashing in on  these vulnerabilities and on these gaps in American law. We need to fix  it.   Let me correct one other misconception from all of the emotional news  we have seen recently. Sometimes the facts get lost. If an immigrant  family crosses the border outside of a designated port of entry, they  have broken the law, unless they are authorized. If you release these  individuals without any consequences, you send a clear message that it  is acceptable to cross our borders illegally. Once you have sent the  message to the criminal organizations--to people in Central America and  elsewhere--that it is OK to break the law and you will be released  without any consequence, it should come as no surprise that a huge  percentage of illegal immigrants fail to show up at immigration court  hearings and that it is a magnet attracting more illegal immigration if  there are no consequences associated with it.   With all due respect to my friend, the senior Senator from  California, her bill has these unintended effects, and I think simply  will not do. I want to be clear, we want to work together to try to  address what she wants to accomplish and what we want to accomplish.  Let's keep families together, but let's not inadvertently or  unintentionally reinstate the broken catch-and-release policies, which  simply serve as a magnet for more illegal immigration.   Some commentators have pointed out the problem I have identified. It  is not just me. They have said Senator Feinstein's bill would present  law enforcement with a terrible choice of either keeping children with  parents or criminals in the middle of being prosecuted or not  prosecuting those violations of the law at all. That is not really a  choice. We know what the decision would be. Those cases would not be  prosecuted. There would not be enforcement. Then, again, the  [[Page S4321]]  transnational criminal organizations, the people who try to take  advantage of our laws, will have won.   With these and other shortcomings, I think the much better option  would be the bill introduced by Senator Tillis, which I, the Presiding  Officer, and others have cosponsored. It would achieve two important  goals: continued enforcement of our immigration laws and the  unification of families. Some of our friends on the left seem to want  one but not the other. They want to unify families, but they don't want  to enforce our immigration laws. They say they want to see zero  tolerance ended--zero tolerance for violating immigration laws, and, of  course, they cast a lot of aspersions on the President and the Attorney  General for implementing this policy, along with the Secretary of the  Department of Homeland Security.   Let's think about their criticism for a second. What does that really  mean? If you aren't happy with zero tolerance of violating our  immigration laws, that means you are happy with tolerating exemptions  for lawbreakers. You tolerate not enforcing immigration laws under  some, perhaps many, circumstances. We can all see where that leads us.  It encourages illegal immigration by sending a message by saying we  will not enforce our laws. We should not stand for that and neither  should the American people. It would be a big mistake.   Tomorrow Senator Cruz, my colleague from Texas, and I will be  traveling to Brownsville and Weslaco, once again, so we can get eyes on  the situation there and learn from the people who are charged with  making sure our policies are carried out.   As I mentioned, Texas has 1,200 miles of common border with Mexico,  and we are ground zero when it comes to the border security challenge.  I look forward to talking with our Federal and local officials about  the situation, along with faith-based organizations and other groups  who are trying to help out. We need their help and welcome their help.   Ultimately, I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue  talking urgently and to support the bill Senator Tillis and others have  introduced. We can come together, we can fix this problem swiftly, and  ensure these children are kept together with their families.   I yield the floor.
