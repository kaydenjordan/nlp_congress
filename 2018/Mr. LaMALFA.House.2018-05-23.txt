 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove my name  as a cosponsor of H. Res. 774.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the passage of  the Right to Try Act--better late than never.   After months of jumping through parliamentary hoops to pass this  legislation out of both the House and the Senate, we are finally able  to put the Right to Try Act on the President's desk.   This bill would allow very sick or terminally ill patients to request  access to drugs and treatments that have yet to be approved by the FDA.  This is a bipartisan issue. So far, 40 States have already adopted  Right to Try laws but are unable to actually enforce them. This bill  changes that.   While giving terminally ill patients the right to try experimental  medicine won't always be successful, it does give patients one final  avenue of hope. For those who have exhausted all other possibilities of  conventional treatment, they deserve the opportunity to leave no stone  unturned. Also, the industry can learn from their experience.   I am disappointed that some in the Senate chose to delay this very  time-sensitive bill, but I am pleased the President now can make Right  to Try the law of the land.                            ____________________
