 Madam President, for too long many in America's  middle-class families felt left behind by the Obama economy. Paychecks  seemed to stagnate, good-paying jobs seemed harder to find, and  opportunities seemed difficult to come by.   Our country can do better for hard-working families, and that is  exactly what we are working to deliver as we continue our efforts to  pass tax reform. It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and it is  the most important thing we can do today to get our economy really  growing again and going again.   Last week, the House Ways and Means Committee passed its proposal to  lower taxes and to boost economic growth. I would like to commend  Chairman Brady for his efforts to get the bill approved by the  Committee and to the floor of the House.   Here in the Senate, we also remain focused on tax reform this week.  Today, the Finance Committee began its mark-up of the tax reform  proposal released last week. Under the leadership of Chairman Hatch,  the committee will consider this plan that really has been many years  and dozens of hearings in the making.   The Finance Committee's tax plan will help hard-working Americans  keep more of their own money. It will help create more jobs here at  home, and it will help increase opportunities for the middle class.  Consider this from a recent news report titled: ``Middle class biggest  winners in Senate tax plan, study says.''   ``Moderate-income people would consistently see the largest  percentage declines in their tax bills,'' the article says, ``according  to an analysis released late Saturday by the official, nonpartisan  Joint Committee on Taxation.''   ``In 2019,'' the article continues, ``people in the middle of the  income spectrum earning, between $50,000 and [$75,000], would see their  taxes fall by 7.1 percent. Those earning between $20,000 and $30,000  would see a 10.4 percent decline.''   Here is another recent article, titled: ``Senate bill would cut taxes  by $1.78 trillion, create [925,000] new jobs, study finds.''   The article noted that the Finance Committee's bill ``would boost the  economy, creating 925,000 new jobs and raising wages by 2.9 percent  over 10 years, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the Tax  Foundation.'' According to that study, families in my home State of  Kentucky can see a boost to after-tax incomes for middle-income  families,'' of nearly $2,000.   Earlier today, I had an opportunity to meet with a number of Kentucky  small business owners and workers to hear from them about the  importance of tax reform. We discussed how this effort can help provide  relief to small businesses and middle-class families by making taxes  lower, simpler, and fairer. Tax reform can help provide real relief to  families and small businesses that felt left behind by our economy.   The proposal that the committee will take up today is the product of  years of listening to people across the country who are calling out for  relief. It is from careful study of our current Tax Code, understanding  what it gets right and what it too often gets wrong.  [[Page S7170]]    The Senate's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act represents the consensus views of  the Finance Committee members and it reflects the values shared by the  House, the Senate, and the Trump administration, put forward in our  unified framework earlier this year. Chairman Hatch has shown  impressive leadership to craft this proposal, and I look forward to his  continued guidance of the committee under regular order.   Today, members will have the opportunity to give opening statements  and provide their insights on the proposal. During this process, the  committee will consider amendments from both sides. As of this morning,  more than 300 amendments have been filed by both Republican and  Democrat members. Additionally, all Senators will have the chance to  share their opinions here on the Senate floor. This is an open process.   It is time to reform our Tax Code and provide much needed relief to  the hard-working men and women of this country. The Finance Committee's  proposal would do just that.   In a related action this week, the Senate Energy and Natural  Resources Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Murkowski, will  begin to mark up legislation supporting our Nation's energy security.  Further developing Alaska's oil and gas potential in an environmentally  responsible way is an important effort to help create new jobs,  generate new wealth, and provide for our energy future and energy  security.   These committee markups are positive steps toward growing our economy  and helping the middle class.                            ____________________     Madam President, the Senate will continue its progress  in confirming the President's nominees. Last week we confirmed multiple  nominees to a number of Federal agencies. Soon they will get on the job  for our country.   This week we will start by considering two nominees for the  Department of Transportation. Later today, the Senate will vote to  confirm Derek Kan to serve as the Under Secretary of Transportation for  Policy. Mr. Kan has experience in a wide range of transportation  matters, from Amtrak to ride-sharing platforms. His career in both the  private and public sectors will serve him well as he works to develop  important policies related to our Nation's infrastructure. I will be  supporting Mr. Kan's nomination, and I would urge all Senators to join  me.   Next, we will consider the nomination of Steven Bradbury to be  general counsel of the Department of Transportation. During Mr.  Bradbury's service at the Justice Department in the Bush  administration, he advised the executive branch on various legal and  constitutional questions. I am grateful that he has chosen to serve our  Nation once again.   Next up will be David Zatezalo to serve as the Assistant Secretary of  Labor for Mine Safety and Health and, then, Joseph Otting to be the  Comptroller of the Currency. Finally, we have two more talented and  qualified nominees to serve as Federal district court judges, Donald  Coggins and Dabney Friedrich.   Thoughtful consideration of President Trump's nominees is an  important responsibility of the Senate, and we will continue to move  swiftly so they can get to work for the American people. I look forward  to considering each of them this week, and I would urge all of our  colleagues to join me.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
