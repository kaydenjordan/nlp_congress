 Mr. Speaker, in 2018, more than 2 million Americans will  suffer from addiction to prescription opioids.   As I have traveled across my district, I have seen firsthand the  devastating effects these drugs can have on families, friends, and  loved ones. There is no barrier for these drugs. They strike at every  level of society and across every geographic region. It touches all of  us.   In North Carolina, we have 4 of the top 25 worst cities for opioid  abuse in the country. This truly is the crisis next door, and I am  proud of the collective effort the House of Representatives has  undertaken in a bipartisan way to address this epidemic.   One important piece of this effort is a bipartisan bill I worked on  with my colleague G.K. Butterfield, the SOUND Disposal and Packaging  Act, which will direct the FDA to work with manufacturers to help  reduce diversion, overprescribing, and abuse of schedule II or III  opioids.   I focused on packaging and disposal because it seemed everyone I  talked to had sort of a lightbulb go off. So many of us have unused  opioids in our medicine cabinets from surgeries, accidents, or hospital  visits.   With 70 percent of heroin addictions beginning in the medicine  cabinet, attacking this oversupply with packaging on the front end and  disposal on the back end was a logical place to start. We need to  reduce the supply of opioids that find their way out of the medicine  cabinet, and this legislation is the first step.   I appreciate the leadership of my friend, G.K. Butterfield, for  working with me in a bipartisan manner in authoring this bill. I want  to thank the leadership of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Health  Subcommittee, Chairman Walden and Chairman Burgess, and Ranking Members  Pallone and Green for their partnership and help to ensure this could  be a reality today.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from DisposeRx in  support of H.R. 5687, the SOUND Disposal and Packaging Act.                                                       DisposeRx,                                                      June 18, 2018.      Hon. Richard Hudson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Hudson: As our country continues to       combat the opioid epidemic, we commend the United States       House of Representative for voting on your legislation, H.R.       5687, the ``the ``SOUND'` Disposal and Packaging Act.''       Opioid overdoses kill tens of thousands of people each year,       and this landmark legislation is pivotal to saving lives and       overcoming the opioid crisis.        Our mission at DisposeRx is to empower the consumer to       safely and permanently dispose of unused medications,       including opioids and drugs with abuse liabilities, with at-      home solutions that render drugs non-retrievable. Research       has shown that take-back and kiosk strategies are       inconvenient and encourage diversion, whereas at-home       solutions that empower consumers to destroy their drugs in an       environmentally friendly manner are a better solution to       preventing opioid abuse, overdoses and deaths that begin in       the medicine cabinet.        For years, the federal government has recommended       substandard methods of disposal for controlled substances,       such as placing them in coffee grounds or kitty litter, and       even flushing them down the toilet for eventual transport to       our nation's waterways. With the passage of H.R. 5687,       Congress will be taking a crucial leap to change how we deal       with drug disposal. In particular, section 2(f) of H.R. 5687       will require the General Accounting Office (GAO) to provide       an independent report to Congress on the benefits of in-home       disposal of controlled substances. We believe that the bill       represents a clear recognition that immediate disposal of       prescription medications within the home will reduce the       number of new addictions and deaths.        We are grateful for your leadership, and that of your       cosponsors, including Representative G.K. Butterfield, in       this critical area and we congratulate you on this pioneering       legislation. We thank your staff and that of the House Energy       and Commerce Committee, especially Preston Bell, who has       tirelessly championed deterrent solutions to prevent abuse       before it begins.        We are passionate about providing a solution to our       country's epidemic of overdose and death brought about by the       misuse and abuse of opioids. Thank you for your       consideration, and we look forward to working with you and       your colleagues to confront and reverse this crisis.            Sincerely,                                                       Wm. Simpson,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to please support  this legislation.
