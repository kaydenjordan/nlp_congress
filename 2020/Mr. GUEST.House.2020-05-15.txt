 Mr. Speaker, this bill would forever fundamentally alter  our elections. It would provide a bailout to unsustainable pensions. It  would release criminals from jail. It would provide protection and  payments to illegal aliens. And it would discourage individuals from  returning to work as we seek to reopen the economy. Furthermore, the $3  trillion price tag should be greatly concerning to every American.   It is disappointing that the Democrats developed this legislation  behind closed doors and without consulting their Republican  counterparts. The Speaker has presented a partisan bill that does more  to divide our Nation than to address the current national crisis.   The coronavirus outbreak is not a time for political posturing but  is, instead, a time to put country before party. Congress has worked in  a bipartisan way to respond to the needs of Americans, and I hope that  future negotiations will return to that level of cooperation.   Mr. Speaker, I intend to vote against this legislation, and I  encourage my colleagues to do the same.
