 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the left's  widespread misinformation and hypocrisy surrounding the coronavirus  pandemic.   After repeatedly promising to shut down COVID-19 and vowing that all  Americans would have access to regular, reliable, and free testing, the  Biden administration has added a new crisis to its growing list of  failures: the COVID crisis.   As our Nation faces a testing shortage, which began before the  holiday season, I find it appropriate to quote President Biden himself  from 2020: ``Where are the tests, Mr. President?''   Considering all the coronavirus funding that Congress has provided  the administration, that is the multitrillion-dollar question that has  only been answered with deflection and poor leadership.   Interestingly, now that the coronavirus death count is higher under  President Biden than President Trump, the Centers for Disease Control,  or the CDC, is apparently separating the data now to reveal how many  Americans have died with COVID compared to how many have died from  COVID.   Republicans have been shouting this difference from the rooftops for  over 2 years, during which the left quickly labeled our valid concerns  as conspiracies. Yet, when the important difference can provide cover  to the President, Democrats jump on board, and the leftwing media hides  the hypocrisy. How convenient.   In fact, CDC Director Walensky recently admitted that 75 percent-- yes, 75 percent--of COVID deaths occurred in people with at least four  comorbidities.   Every life is precious, and families deserve the truth. The question  must be answered: How many Americans died with COVID compared to how  many died from COVID? Our government agencies should have been  reporting health data accurately from the beginning, not as a matter of  political cover.   Since Biden can't shut down COVID, suddenly, this data is being  shared publicly. It is no wonder polling indicates that public trust in  the CDC is plummeting.   Science is respected when people are skeptical, when people ask  questions. None of that is happening now. Nobody questions the  outcomes. And we wonder why the CDC has lost credibility. We wonder why  people think the new meaning of the acronym is the center for Democrat  control.   Keep in mind, this is all unfolding as we discover more evidence that  Dr. Fauci, the highest-paid government official--an unelected one, I  might add--has continuously concealed the truth concerning gain of  function research at the Chinese Wuhan Institute of Virology, including  his own knowledge and his own involvement.   Meanwhile, the administration continues to seek his deceptive  guidance to push the narrative that we need more government control.  Fauci's lies, the CDC's total lack of credibility, and the President's  inability to rise to the moment and effectively lead all contribute to  the COVID crisis, causing great damage and harm to the American people.                      Supporting Sanctity of Human Life     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the sanctity of  human life.   Later this week, on January 22, our Nation will mourn the 49th  anniversary of Roe v. Wade, a treacherous decision that has led to the  murder of more than 62 million innocent babies. That is more than 62  million dreams never achieved, talents never realized, and lives never  lived. In the blink of an eye, their chance of a happy life and a  promising future has vanished. May God have mercy on their unborn  souls.   What an unspeakable tragedy that corrupts the morals and values that  our great country was founded on over two centuries ago. I am proud to  have cosponsored H. Res. 58, led by my good friend Jody Hice, to  memorialize the anniversary of Roe v. Wade as the day of tears by  lowering our flag to half-staff each year in honor of the unborn lives  lost to the evils of abortion.   After being involved with the crisis pregnancy center in Athens,  Georgia, for nearly two decades, I can confirm to you that the  consequences of abortion go well beyond the murder of millions of  precious lives. Despite being portrayed as a simple and quick solution,  abortion ultimately alters at least three lives instead of one: a child  that is lost forever, a mother that is scarred for life, and a father  that is burdened with lifelong guilt.   We must never downplay the evils of abortion. As an unapologetic pro- life advocate, I am proud to defend the unborn and fight for the  sanctity of life because every life is invaluable, worthy, and made in  the perfect image of God.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary of  President Biden's inauguration. Many Americans have now endured 365  days of an absent administration, 52 weeks of policy failures, 12  months of utter turmoil, and a year of constant, crippling crises.   Earlier today a Rasmussen Poll revealed that 60 percent of the  country considers the President's first year in office unsuccessful.  Fifty percent said it was very unsuccessful, with one third of  Democrats believing Biden's first year was a failure. All of this has  contributed to his abysmal 33 percent rating, the lowest since Jimmy  Carter.   Madam Speaker, in all sincerity, I didn't imagine this much damage  could be done in just one year, but here we are, facing an economic  crisis with hyperinflation, a supply chain crisis, a labor shortage  crisis, a border crisis, a national security crisis, an energy crisis  with incredible gas prices, an education crisis, a COVID crisis, a  crime crisis, and an election integrity crisis with Democrats trying to  push through election reforms that would federalize our election and  eliminate voter ID. Ultimately, these all stem from a leadership crisis  in the White House, a leadership crisis that has caused Americans  unnecessary hardship.   Madam Speaker, as we enter the second year of the Biden  administration's rule, the President has an important decision to make.  Will he continue to sidestep from the crises he has created, destined  to inflict more destruction? Or will he confront these crises head-on  and implement successful solutions?   Mr. President, the American people demand successful solutions. They  deserve successful solutions.
