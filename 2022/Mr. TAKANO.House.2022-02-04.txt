 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember Lulamae Clemons,  a champion for social justice and a longtime Riverside community  activist.   I knew Lulamae in the 1980s when I was getting involved in the  Greater Riverside Urban League. To this day, I remember her graceful  yet determined presence and her efforts to advance racial equality in  our community.   Lulamae was a true pioneer. She devoted herself to her community and  was persistent in her fight for quality education and fairer housing.   As the first Black administrator hired by the Riverside Office of  Education and vice president of the Fair Housing Council of Riverside  County, Lulamae empowered minorities and broke barriers.   Lulamae understood the preciousness of civil rights, equality, and  opportunity for all.   To the family of Lulamae Clemons and all those who knew, loved, and  respected her, I offer my deepest condolences. Her legacy will continue  to live on.                            ____________________
