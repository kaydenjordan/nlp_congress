 Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who will be joining  me this evening--Senator Baldwin, Senator Hassan, and Senator Schumer-- to advocate for much needed action to protect workers, to provide  relief to State and local governments, and to bolster our public health  system.   I rise to speak about the steps we need to take to invest in  childcare and education. COVID-19 has upended childcare and schools in  a way that truly is unprecedented. It has created chaos across our  education system.   Since we passed the CARES Act over 3 months ago now, Senate  Republicans have not done anything to address the countless challenges  that our childcare providers, our educators, our schools, and, of  course, our students and families are facing. Instead, they have chosen  to pretend that this crisis is over and that we should just return to  business as usual, which for them means most often voting on partisan  judges and not much else.   As my Republican colleagues continue to delay any response, urging  Democrats to pump the brakes and ``wait and see,'' we are hearing from  parents who aren't sure if they can go back to work because their  childcare provider closed. We are hearing from teachers who aren't sure  if they will even have a job to return to in the fall. We are hearing  from college students who might be forced to drop out because they  desperately need financial assistance during this economic downturn.   We don't need to wait and see to know we need to provide relief  immediately. In our childcare system alone, we are now at risk of  losing millions of childcare slots because providers across the country  are struggling to keep their doors open.   As Senate Republicans are burying their heads in the sand on this,  our K-12 schools are now facing some of the biggest cuts to State and  local revenue we have seen in a long time, all while struggling with  the increased cost of dealing with how to reopen safely and to continue  to provide quality education during a pandemic. We know this crisis is  hitting, especially hard, students of color, students from low-income  families, students who are experiencing homelessness, students with  disabilities, and many other students who are marginalized in our  education system.   Our higher education system is under serious financial pressure as  colleges across our country, especially our Nation's HBCUs and our  Tribal colleges and our minority-serving institutions, struggle with  the consequences of this pandemic. Many students have been forced to  drop out of higher education because they lost their job or they can't  meet their basic needs. To address all of these problems, we need a  massive investment in our childcare system, in our schools, and in our  students and families now.   This is why, today, I am introducing the Coronavirus Child Care and  Education Relief Act. This bill creates a Child Care Stabilization  Fund, which will provide grants to make sure providers can stay open  and that working families get the tuition relief they need. It will  provide K-12 schools with the funds they desperately need to help  students with increased academic and social emotional supports to  address learning loss, to put in place public health measures to make  our schools safer for students and educators, to make sure specific  funding goes to support students with disabilities, and to address the  other growing inequities for students of color and many others.   The bill will also make a $132 billion investment in our higher  education system to provide emergency financial aid grants to students  for expenses like food and housing, childcare, technology supplies, and  to help our colleges to confront the increased cost and financial  pressures they are now facing during this COVID-19 pandemic.   Additionally, this bill will reverse Secretary DeVos's cruel attempts  to prevent millions of students, including our undocumented students  and DACA recipients, from receiving emergency aid, block her from  giving special favors to colleges that don't need taxpayer dollars, and  stop her from taking funding that was meant for public schools to  advance her privatization agenda.   There is a long road ahead to fully address the education and  childcare crisis, but this bill is an important step for childcare  providers, our students, our families, and our educators. Our schools  cannot wait any longer.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. 4112, the Coronavirus Child Care and Education  Relief Act introduced earlier today. I further ask that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I am sorry that the Senator has objected  this evening. This is an issue that is critical to every family in this  country. We all want our economy to open. I assure everyone that if  people can't get childcare, they cannot go back to work. Our schools  are going to be looking immediately into how they are going to be  opening. Without the additional resources they need, they will not be  able to do it. Our kids and our families are worth this bill.   I know that several colleagues will be speaking here tonight on this,  but I want the Senate to know that these are priorities that we are  going to be fighting for. I urge the Senate to bring up the next COVID  package. I am willing to work with everybody on it, to hear what  everybody has to say, but our kids, our families, and the future of  this country has to have our support at this critical time.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes on the floor  today to celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community and their long march toward  equality, as well as talk a little bit about how the actions of this  President and his administration have threatened our hard-fought  progress.   As Pride Month comes to a close--a month that has seen communities of  every size, in every State, protesting against our Nation's long legacy  of police brutality and systemic racism, while also navigating impacts  of a global health pandemic.   I am reminded of the Black and Brown transgender women who 51 years  ago, stood against the bigotry and violence of the police after they  raided the Stonewall Inn and then sought to suppress 6 days of protest.   I am reminded of their courage and how their struggles mirror the  intersectional challenges people are facing today and the demands  ringing out from protesters in the streets.   I am reminded of Tony McDade, an unarmed Black transgender man killed  by police in Tallahassee in late May, and of Nina Pop, a transwoman  murdered in her Missouri apartment earlier in May--a fate that meets  countless Black transwomen and other transwomen of color.   Mr. President, a half century after Stonewall, I am reminded that  while we have made some critical progress, we are still fighting so  many of the same battles, and we still have so much, much more work to  do.   Thre is no denying President Trump and Vice President Pence have made  this work far more difficult. This administration's far-reaching  ideological agenda seems aimed at relegating LGBTQIA+ people to second- class citizens.   Back in June of 2017, I sent a letter to President Trump outlining  the multitude of ways his actions in the first 100 days of his  administration had already threatened to cause harm to LGBTQIA+ people  in Washington State and around the Nation.   Three years later, it is sad but safe to say that President Trump has  built those threats into an all-out attack on members of the community,  from the administration's efforts to strip protections from LGBTQIA+  people seeking access to health care--during a public health emergency,  no less--to eliminating protections for Federal contractor and  subcontractor LGBTQIA + workers, to rolling back the Obama-era HUD  equal access rule, allowing shelters to discriminate against  transgender people now, and banning transgender servicemembers inour  military.   This is all in addition to this administration's proposed QUOTE  ``faith-based'' rules that have allowed multiple federal agencies to  begin discriminating against LGTBQIA+ people seeking access to vital  taxpayer services and the parade of homophobic and transphobic judicial  and executive appointments that have been jammed through with the help  of Senate Republicans.   I unfortunately could go on because the list of offenses is long, but  let me  [[Page S4029]]  say, in closing: As a proud ally of the LGBTQIA+ community in  Washington State and across the country and as a voice for our State  here in the Senate, I will never stop shining a spotlight on efforts  from President Trump or any President to discriminate against our  LGBTQIA+ loved ones, friends, neighbors, and coworkers, and I won't  stop fighting against hatred in our laws and standing up for what is  right, as well as encouraging others to make their voices heard, too,  as we work to help our Nation live up to its ideals of justice and  equality.   So, Mr. President, this may not be the celebratory Pride we expected  or one like we have ever seen before, but it is one we should take as  motivation and inspiration for the work ahead this June and in the  coming months and years.   Happy Pride, everyone.                            ____________________
