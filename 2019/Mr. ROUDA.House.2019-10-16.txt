Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bipartisan legislation that  will make technical changes to the reauthorization of the Office of  National Drug Control Policy included in last year's SUPPORT Act.   As we all know, we are in the midst of a substance use disorder  epidemic fueled by the proliferation of opioids, exacerbated by  synthetic opioids like fentanyl, and increased use of methamphetamines,  among other threats.   This year, Americans will lose close to 70,000 friends and family and  loved ones due to drug overdoses. More Americans are now dying annually  due to overdose than at the height of the AIDS crisis or during the  entire Vietnam war.   No community is unaffected by the crisis. In my home of Orange  County, California, drug and alcohol overdose deaths have increased by  82 percent since 2000. Across our country, our constituents are asking  us to advance solutions to address this epidemic.   Last year, Congress passed and President Trump signed the SUPPORT for  Patients and Communities Act, a wide-ranging, bipartisan bill aimed at  addressing treatment, prevention, recovery, and enforcement.   The SUPPORT Act represents an important step in the right direction  to reverse the tide of overdose deaths. The SUPPORT Act included  provisions to reauthorize and reform the Office of National Drug  Control Policy, a component of the Executive Office of the President.   ONDCP plays a critical role in overseeing the Federal Government's  drug control efforts. However, there were several technical issues in  the SUPPORT Act that must be corrected to ensure that the office can  properly carry out its duties as Congress intended and improve the  Federal Government's response to this crisis.  [[Page H8167]]    The ONDCP Technical Corrections Act of 2019 would ensure the  integrity of the performance measurement system, help ONDCP hire the  best people to address the addiction crisis, and improve the  effectiveness of grant programs. These corrections would help ONDCP's  efficient and effective execution of its mission: preventing,  combating, and treating the effects of drug proliferation throughout  our Nation.   I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows), my fellow  Member, for joining me in introducing this bill and the committee staff  on both sides of the aisle for working diligently to develop and  advance it. I look forward to the House of Representatives passing this  bill today.   There is much more to be done to address the addiction crisis, and I  look forward to continued work with all of my colleagues on this  important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                   Washington, DC, October 15, 2019.      Hon. Elijah E. Cummings,      Chair, Committee on Oversight and Reform,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Cummings: I write concerning H.R. 3889, the       ``ONDCP Technical Corrections Act of 2019,'' which was       additionally referred to the Committee on Energy and       Commerce.        In recognition of the desire to expedite consideration of       H.R. 3889, the Committee on Energy and Commerce agrees to       waive formal consideration of the bill as to provisions that       fall within the Rule Xjurisdiction of the Committee on Energy       and Commerce. The Committee takes this action with the mutual       understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       that the Committee will be appropriately consulted and       involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so       that we may address any remaining issues within our       jurisdiction. I also request that you support my request to       name members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce to any       conference committee to consider such provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter       into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of       H.R. 3889.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                               Committee on Oversight and Reform,                                   Washington, DC, October 16, 2019.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 3889, the ONDCP Technical Corrections Act of 2019. As       you know, the bill was referred primarily to the Committee on       Oversight and Reform with an additional referral to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce.        I thank you for allowing the Committee on Energy and       Commerce to be discharged from further consideration of the       bill to expedite floor consideration. This discharge in no       way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the       bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on Energy and Commerce represented on the conference       committee.        I would be pleased to include this letter and any response       in the Congressional Record during floor consideration to       memorialize our understanding.            Sincerely,                                                Elijah E. Cummings,                                                          Chairman.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1496 would amend the former President's Act of 1958  to cap a former President's annual pension at $200,000, indexed to  inflation. The bill also would provide an additional annual allowance  for expenses that would start at $200,000.   Under this bill, the annual allowance would be reduced dollar for  dollar in instances in which a former President's adjusted gross income  in a taxable year exceeds $400,000.   Taxpayers should not have to pay for a former President's allowance  if the former President is making a comfortable living earning millions  of dollars a year, as many former Presidents do.   This legislation would not affect any funding for the security and  protection of former Presidents and their spouses. This legislation  would update the pension amount for surviving spouses of former  Presidents, which has been unchanged since 1958, by increasing it from  $20,000 to $100,000.   Mr. Speaker, I believe this bill makes fiscal sense and urge Members  to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice).   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my  bill, H.R. 1833, which would rename a postal facility in Floral Park,  New York, after FDNY Lieutenant Michael R. Davidson, who tragically  lost his life in the line of duty a year and a half ago.   My district on Long Island has a long and proud tradition of service  in the New York City Fire Department. For generations, young men and  women from New York's Fourth Congressional District have joined the  FDNY, following in the footsteps of their parents and grandparents.  They choose a life of service and sacrifice and dedicate their lives to  protecting others.   Lieutenant Michael Davidson was a part of that tradition. Lieutenant  Davidson joined the FDNY in May of 2003. Assigned to Harlem Engine  Company 69, Michael had the opportunity to serve side by side with his  father, Robert, who spent most of his 26-year career at that same  firehouse.   Michael was known among his colleagues for his bravery and lifesaving  actions, and he received four citations for valor during his career.   As a ``nozzle man,'' he fought fires from the front of the hose and  was often the first sent into burning buildings.   On March 22, 2018, Lieutenant Davidson was called to battle a five- alarm fire on a movie set in Harlem. And, as usual, Davidson was the  point man on the team that entered the building's basement to fight the  blaze.   Conditions quickly became too dangerous for the firefighters to  withstand, and, though the unit was ordered to retreat, Lieutenant  Davidson was separated from his team in the thick smoke. His colleagues  later found him unconscious, and he tragically passed away the next day  at Harlem Hospital.   Lieutenant Davidson's death was a devastating and unshakeable loss  for the FDNY; for Engine Company 69; for Floral Park; but, most of all,  for his family and friends.   That is why this bill is not just about honoring a fallen hero. It is  also about honoring a highly respected member of our community; a  beloved neighbor; and, above all, a devoted husband to his wife,  Eileen, and a loving father of four young children.   Renaming our post office in Floral Park will ensure that Lieutenant  Davidson's treasured memory is always in our hearts and minds and that  his service and sacrifice are never forgotten.   I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in honoring a hero and  supporting H.R. 1833.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service  located at 1715 Linnerud Drive in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, as the Fire  Captain Cory Barr Post Office Building.   Captain Barr first volunteered with the Sun Prairie Fire Department  at the age of 18, which earned him the distinction of being the  youngest firefighter in the department's history.   On July 10, 2018, Captain Barr was a first responder at the scene of  a natural gas leak in downtown Sun Prairie. As Captain Barr was  shutting off service and evacuating people nearby, an explosion  occurred, killing him. His heroic actions saved over 100 people.   Captain Barr was a beloved member of the Sun Prairie community for 30  years. Beyond his contributions to the fire department, he is  remembered as an outgoing and dedicated man. Captain Barr is survived  by his wife of 6 years, Abby, and twin 3-year-old daughters, Hailey and  Aubrey.   Naming a post office after Captain Barr is the least this country can  do to honor his sacrifice and the contributions he has made to his  local community.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
