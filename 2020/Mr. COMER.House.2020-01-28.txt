 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the Trump  administration's recent proposed rulemaking for school meals and the  Summer Food Service Program.   As a member of the Agriculture Committee, and ranking member on the  Education and Labor Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the child  nutrition programs, I have consistently heard from school food service  administrators in my district about their frustrations with the  heavyhanded Obama-era regulations.   I am glad to see the administration is seeking input from those who  administer these programs every day. This new rule will provide needed  flexibility for food service supervisors to adapt their menus to teach  students proper  [[Page H576]]  nutrition habits that they will adopt during crucial periods of growth  and into adulthood.   These food service professionals know the needs of their students  best, and I look forward to seeing this rule finalized and our schools  and communities become even stronger.             Updates on Agriculture and the Trade War with China     Mr. Speaker, I think most people in this body know that I  am a farmer by trade, and I represent a southern Kentucky district that  is one of the biggest agricultural districts in America.   I am very pleased today to give an update on the accomplishments that  the Trump administration and Congress has made over the past 3 years  with respect to agriculture.   Anyone that keeps up with President Trump knows that he sincerely  cares about the farmers in America; and he realizes that the farmers,  through no fault of their own, have been on the front lines of this  trade war with China.   But if you talk to any farmer, as I do on a regular basis when I am  home in Kentucky, the farmers still strongly support the President and  they understand why we are in this trade war. They also understand the  efforts that have been made and the accomplishments that have been  achieved with respect to agriculture from this administration and from  this Congress over the past 3 years.   I want to touch on three areas where we focused in Congress, where I  focused as a member of the Agriculture Committee, to improve our  agriculture for our family farmers who are struggling, again, on the  front lines of this trade war with China.   First of all, regulations. As with many other industries in America,  one of the first things that President Trump looked at, and then the  Republicans and the majority of this body looked at 3 years ago, was  the regulations. Many industries, especially in agriculture, felt like  there were burdensome regulations that were holding farmers back,  holding agriculture back.   So, one by one, this administration, whether it was through the U.S.  Department of Agriculture, or the EPA, has looked at every regulation  to deem whether that regulation was necessary, or whether that  regulation was excessive and needed to be scaled back.                                time  1045    I am very pleased to report that the biggest regulation that scared  most people in agriculture was the WOTUS rule from the Obama  administration. I am very pleased, last week, this administration  completely eliminated the WOTUS rule with respect to navigable streams.  Under the Obama regulation, every mud puddle in Kentucky would have  been defined as a navigable stream, therefore, creating a situation  where farmers would be breaking the law to farm the land that they  farmed for many generations.   Next is tax policy. We focused very heavily on passing the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act, which helped cut taxes overall, but one thing that helped  agriculture is the accelerated depreciation rule, which encouraged  farmers to make a bigger investment.   And, lastly, trade. We have had huge success on the trade front over  the past couple of weeks here in Washington, and I applaud the Trump  administration for their efforts to not only sign the USMCA, which is  the new modern NAFTA deal that puts workers on a level playing field in  America with workers in Mexico and Canada, but it also enhances  agriculture opportunities.   Also, the phase one trade deal that the President signed recently  with China, this focuses on agriculture. It brings back those markets  that we lost in agriculture because we were on the front lines of this  trade war, and it also increases new markets for agriculture.   I am very pleased with the achievements that have been made in  agriculture, but I realize that our farmers are struggling and we have  a lot more work to do. I pledge to continue to work with the Trump  administration to see that our farmers are treated fairly and that we  can continue to grow our Nation's most important industry: agriculture.                            ____________________
