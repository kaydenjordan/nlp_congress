 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life and service of Captain Jake Ringering, a beloved member of the  Godfrey Fire Protection District who tragically lost his life in the  line of duty on March 5.   While responding to a fire in Bethalto, members of the Godfrey Fire  Protection District were attempting to suppress the fire from outside  when the building partially collapsed. Captain Ringering and  Firefighter Luke Warner both sustained injuries from the collapse.   Captain Ringering served as a firefighter for more than 18 years,  beginning with the East Alton Fire Department before joining the  Godfrey Fire Department in 2010. He was promoted to captain in May  2014.   The Godfrey fire chief described him as ``gold'' and leaving a legacy  that will be remembered for a long time. Godfrey's mayor, and my  friend, Mike McCormick, said his passing leaves ``hard boots to fill.''   Captain Ringering is survived by his wife and three young children.  Please join me in keeping his family, as well as the Godfrey community,  in your thoughts and prayers.                            ____________________
