 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  legislation to protect our students' access to hunting, archery, and  similar programs across the country.   Virginians are passionate about these outdoor sports, and school  programs are a wonderful way to cultivate that passion while teaching  aspiring outdoorsmen how to safely exercise their Second Amendment  rights.   That our action is necessary today to fight back against the radical,  activist Department of Education is a testament to how much the Biden  administration hates our constitutional rights and wants to use every  means possible to restrict those rights and impose gun control on law- abiding citizens.   Currently, the leftist Department of Education interprets the law to  restrict funding for hunting and archery programs in the schools.  Congress never intended this, and we shouldn't even have to clarify it  to the agenda-driven, unaccountable bureaucrats in the Biden  administration.   Nevertheless, today's bill provides that clarification and ensures  that Federal dollars can continue to go to schools with hunting and  archery programs.   The genesis of this problem comes from a law that I opposed last  Congress, the so-called Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which was  actually a gun-grabbing effort by the left that prevents States and  districts from hardening schools to protect their students, teachers,  and staff.   We should do more to repeal and reverse the harmful impacts this  legislation has had on our schools. If we permit teachers to be armed  and trained, it will discourage the threat and reduce the potential  impact of bad guys with guns attacking our schools.   Instead of blocking funding for defensive training, we should support  training teachers and staff to use the Second Amendment to protect our  children.   I believe our schools will be safer if we prosecute criminals,  support our law enforcement, including SROs, and support teachers and  staff who want to be trained and permitted to concealed carry in  schools.   Federal investment and resources can play a key role, but Congress  must also reduce and eliminate Federal legal barriers so that States  and communities can protect their own students in the most effective  way possible.   Mr. Speaker, I support the legislation today because it is a step in  the right direction, but we should go further and also permit teachers  to be trained to defend their students in schools. I urge my colleagues  to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5110.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, here we are trying to fund our government for the year  at a time when we have $33 trillion in national debt and we are on  track for a $2 trillion deficit this year, and so we are literally  borrowing some $2 trillion to fund the government this year. It is  incumbent upon us to be careful with how we spend hard-earned taxpayer  dollars.   Mr. Speaker, within that context, the Biden administration continues  to weaponize every level of the Federal Government, abusing their power  to push their harmful leftist agenda on Federal employees and the  American people.   Exhibit A would be the Department of Defense abortion travel policy  which violates current law, but this harm that is being done to the  American people by this administration manifests itself in other ways,  as well. The Biden administration continues pushing diversity, equity,  and inclusion policies through all Federal agencies largely enforced by  the Office of Civil Rights.   My amendment would reduce funding for the Office of Civil Rights  within the USDA by 50 percent, permitting necessary functions to  continue but sending a much-needed message on behalf of the American  people that they cannot use their taxpayer dollars to implement their  radical leftist agenda.   DEI initiatives promote hiring quotas rather than merit-based  policies for selection and promotion. The Federal Government should be  hiring and firing--now there is a concept for the Federal Government.   The Federal Government should be hiring and firing employees based on  the quality of their performance or lack thereof, not based on the  color of their skin or the gender they claim to be identifying as on  whatever particular day.   My amendment cuts a little over $8 million. When we have $33 trillion  in national debt and we are on track for a $2 trillion deficit, my  amendment would cut a little over $8 million from the Department so  that taxpayer dollars can be appropriately used rather than promoting  the leftist radical agenda of the Biden administration.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the justification of the gentleman  from Georgia just enumerated there is already protected by law. It is  already illegal to discriminate on the basis that he is talking about  there. Thanks to the Supreme Court, we are moving to a post- discrimination society. We are going to no longer discriminate based on  race. The Supreme Court is moving us that way in education. We ought to  be doing it with the Office of Civil Rights in the USDA, as well.   We should be using taxpayer dollars for those farmers and programs  that actually benefit the American people and have the highest return  or at least a return and one that is not harmful for the American  people.   If the Office of Civil Rights were simply ensuring that people were  protected as required by law, again, there wouldn't be a problem, but  the Biden administration has subverted these types of offices to  promote their divisive radical leftist agenda.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the Biden administration has  completely lost touch with the idea of hiring and firing people  according to their performance and the work that they do, and instead  wants to base those decisions on a person's immutable characteristics  and achieving quotas in the name of equity.   My amendment will hold these individuals accountable to simply do  their jobs instead of promoting a radical agenda and wasting taxpayer  dollars--again, dollars that are borrowed from our kids and grandkids.   I urge my colleagues to vote in support of my amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to reduce to $1  the salary of the director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and  Research within the FDA.   As part of the Republican House majority, conservatives were able to  secure important reforms to the House rules, including reinstating the  Holman rule. The Holman rule dates back to the 1800s and was created to  reduce spending, but it has also been used as a measure of  accountability to exercise oversight over unelected bureaucrats by  reducing the salaries of Federal employees.   I have concerns that the position of director for the Center for Drug  Evaluation and Research has been politicized because of decisions it  has been involved in related to abortion.   In January, the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for the main  chemical abortion drug, mifepristone, was updated. A multidisciplinary  team within the FDA approved changes that eliminated the in-person  distribution requirement of mifepristone and allowed for retail  pharmacies to dispense the abortifacient.   A Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is required by  the FDA for certain drugs with ``serious safety concerns to help ensure  the benefits outweigh its risks.'' It is baffling to me that these  bureaucrats would acknowledge that mifepristone is inherently dangerous  yet advance policies that discourage a woman from even having to show  up at a doctor's office.   This office was complicit in these dangerous updates that impact  women's health. My amendment provides needed scrutiny over the  bureaucrats who issue documents, not laws, that literally carry the  power of life or death.   Whatever value these offices provide to drug safety has been clouded  by political judgment. Congress should take a serious look at these  offices, and we can start by holding pro-abortion officials accountable  for such a destructive decision.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to stand for life and support this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Harris).    Mr. Chairman, FDA administrators who originally  approved mifepristone knew it had risks attached to it. In the  following years, those risks have been confirmed and proven time and  again to the mother and, obviously, ultimately to the child.   Between 2002 and 2015, the rate of chemical abortion-related  emergency room visits increased by more than 500 percent.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, at least seven offices within the  FDA are responsible for administering the decision that made the  chemical abortion drug easier to access. My amendment reduces to $1 the  salary of the director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.   Congress has a responsibility to not just appropriate money but to  also conduct oversight for the use of taxpayer dollars. My amendment  does both.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to stand up for life and support my  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my  amendment to reduce to $1 the salary of the director of the Office of  Surveillance and Epidemiology within the FDA.   As part of the Republican House majority, conservatives were able to  secure important reforms to the House rules, including reinstating the  Holman rule, which dates back to the 1800s and was created to reduce  spending, but it has also been used as a measure of accountability to  exercise oversight over unelected bureaucrats by reducing salaries of  Federal employees.   I invite my colleagues to consider this amendment as a form of  oversight, transparency, and accountability--what value does this  office provide, and is the person who occupies it using their position  for political purposes?   Earlier this year, the FDA updated the risk evaluation and mitigation  strategy for the main chemical abortion drug, mifepristone. This  document changed the policy surrounding the distribution of the drug,  making it easier to access, and, therefore, more dangerous for women.   Many peer-reviewed studies show that women who take chemical abortion  pills are at risk of severe side effects, including hemorrhaging, the  need for follow-up surgery, and even death. Yet, this FDA guidance  would formally eliminate the in-person distribution requirement.   My amendment provides scrutiny over the bureaucrats who issue  documents--not laws--that literally carry the power of life or death.  Whatever values these offices provide to drug safety has been clouded  by political judgment, and Congress should take a serious look at those  offices, and we can start by holding pro-abortion officials accountable  for such a destructive decision.   I urge my colleagues to stand for life in support of this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I rise today in support of my amendment to reduce to $1 the  salary of the director of the Office of Risk Management within the FDA.   This amendment asks the question: Is this person who oversees the  Office of the Director of Risk Management actually protecting women and  children from risk?   The office is one of at least seven within the FDA that helped  develop a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, for the  chemical abortion drug mifepristone. These REMS documents are required  by the FDA for certain drugs with serious safety concerns to help  ensure the benefits outweigh its risks.   It is baffling to me that these bureaucrats would acknowledge that  mifepristone is inherently dangerous, yet advance policies that  discourage a woman from even having to show up at a doctor's office.   Earlier this year, the FDA updated the risk evaluation mitigation  strategy for the main chemical abortion drug mifepristone, and this  document changed the policy surrounding the distribution of the drug.                                time  0240    Chemical abortion has four times the complication rate of surgical  abortion. These risks would only increase with advanced pregnancy and  lack of medical supervision.   Of course, mifepristone REMS doesn't factor into the risk evaluation  process, and the drug ends the life of the precious, innocent child in  the womb.   Mifepristone deprives the developing child of the hormones that he or  she needs to grow and then is paired with another drug to violently  expel the child from the womb.   My amendment provides needed scrutiny over bureaucrats who issue  documents that literally carry the power of life or death.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to stand for life and support this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to reduce to $1  the salary of the director of the Office of New Drugs within the FDA.   This amendment provides accountability on behalf of the 63 million  children lost to abortion since 1972. If our Federal agencies are not  protecting the most vulnerable among us, we should not give them more  of our hard-earned taxpayer dollars.   This year, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine brought a lawsuit  against the FDA with evidence that the original approval process for  mifepristone was incomplete. This case argues that the FDA wrongfully  fast-tracked approval and neglected the pediatric study requirement.  The case is still ongoing, but the details show a pattern of the FDA  systematically removing any meaningful safeguard from the drug to make  it as widely used as possible.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to stand for life and support this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to reduce to $1  the salary of the director of the Office of Compliance within the FDA.   Americans don't want their taxpayer money funding bureaucrats who  make decisions contrary to their values. In this case, this director  was complicit in harming women and their unborn children by loosening  restrictions on  [[Page H4563]]  mifepristone, the chemical abortion drug.   The FDA has even looked the other way to permit chemical abortion  drugs to be distributed via mail, which clearly violates the Federal  law outlined in the Comstock Act.   Americans expect Federal regulators to value women's safety and  children's lives more than profits for the abortion industry.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to stand for life and support this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to reduce to $1  the salary of the director of the Office of Medical Policy within the  FDA.   In 2020, chemical abortions became the number one abortion method for  ending an unborn child's life. In that year, we lost 492,210 children.   Instead of making it easier for women to get access to the abortion  pill, the FDA should be banning it. We should work to make every  pregnancy a happy one and support the fantastic pregnancy resource  centers, churches, and families that help women in difficult situations  choose life for their children.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to reduce to $1  the salary of the director of the Office of Regulatory Policy within  the FDA.   Mr. Chair, between 2007 and 2019, total FDA employment increased 79  percent. Today, there are over 18,000 employees. The FDA actually makes  it very difficult to discern the exact number among the thousands of  employees who were responsible for the updates to the abortion pill  Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy.   We can glean from FDA documents that multidisciplinary teams,  including at least these seven offices I have mentioned across my  debate time, played a role in approving the changes that eliminated the  in-person distribution requirement of mifepristone and allowed for  retail pharmacies to dispense the abortifacient.   The names of specific individuals responsible are shrouded in  mystery. The names are redacted from public documents related to this  massive policy change, but we can reasonably conclude that the  directors were indirectly or directly responsible.   Whatever value these offices provide to drug safety has been clouded  by these political judgments, and Congress should take a serious look  at these offices. We can start by holding these pro-abortion officials  accountable for such a destructive decision.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    I have an amendment at the desk, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   My amendment will defund three radical executive orders issued by  President Biden. These executive orders are intended to combat so- called discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual  orientation.   The weaponized bureaucratic regime wants to promote everything  regular Americans stand for: freedom of speech, marriage as being  between one man and one woman for life, and other values that so many  people outside of Washington hold dear.   The Biden administration wants to instill fear in the hearts of  regular Americans. My amendment would block any taxpayer dollars that  would be used for the implementation of these woke executive orders in  any agency. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the Civil Rights Act of 1964  which, by the way, saw significant Democrat opposition, clearly  outlines who is protected from discrimination.   Now, the left wants to impose extra requirements on businessowners  and the American people and force them into either having to walk on  eggshells or face being sued for a supposed incorrect statement.   This amendment will defund President Biden's directives to promulgate  woke ideology throughout the entire government instead of serving the  American people. This culture of fear is not what made America the  Nation that it is.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge strong support for my  amendment for the values that have made America the country we love  today.   Democrats are opposed to the very idea of America so much that they  oppose the values that Americans know and love.   My amendment will preserve that America and fight back against the  left's woke agenda. I urge my colleagues to support this effort and  vote in favor of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
