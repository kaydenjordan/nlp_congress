 Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate Representative Collins  of Georgia's leadership on this issue. There is really no one in this  body--maybe with the exception of Representative Carter of Georgia--who  can tell the story of community pharmacists the way Representative Doug  Collins does.   I thank Representative Collins of Georgia for putting this Special  Order hour together. He has been such a strong leader on pharmacy  issues. He has been a great partner on the legislation that we will be  discussing this evening.   I am proud to say that this is a bipartisan issue, one of the few in  this Congress at this point. It is one of the few in Washington, D.C.,  at this point. We have been able to find a consensus on this, at least  with respect to one bill, and I think we are probably going to be able  to do it with respect to others as well.   We know for a fact that pharmacists across the country serve as the  first line of healthcare services for so many patients around this  country.                                time  1845    People count on pharmacists' training and expertise to stay healthy  and to stay informed and, most importantly, to stay out of urgent care  centers and out of hospitals. That is why I am proud to stand here  today with my colleagues to recognize the quality and the affordable  and the personal care that pharmacists provide every day.   Within that group of pharmacists, we have got a subset of  pharmacists, and that is the community pharmacists and their  pharmacies. They are also a great source not only of the expertise they  provide, but economic growth in rural communities like those in my  district and across the State of Iowa.   As Mr. Collins mentioned, rural areas are very important in this as  well. I am a member of the Small Business Caucus. I recognize how  challenging it can be for some of these small pharmacists to compete  with the bigger companies. I appreciate their hard work to serve our  communities.   Like most small-business owners, community pharmacists, they have to  face challenges to compete and negotiate on a day-to-day basis with  large entities as far as their business transactions are concerned. I  frequently visit community pharmacists and I see the great job they are  doing.   One pressing challenge facing many of our community pharmacists in  particular that will be discussed tonight is the ambiguity and the  uncertainty surrounding the reimbursement of generic drugs. Generic  prescription drugs account for the majority of drugs dispensed by  pharmacists, making transparency in reimbursement absolutely critical  to the financial health of these small pharmacies.   But we know that pharmacists are reimbursed for generic drugs through  what is called maximum allowable cost, or MAC. And this is a price list  that outlines the upper limit or the maximum amount that an insurance  plan will pay for a generic drug. These lists are created by pharmacy  benefit managers, as Mr. Collins mentions, PBMs. This is the drug  middleman.   There are lot of problems, but one of the problems is that the  methodology used to create these lists are not disclosed. There is no  transparency.   Further, they are not updated on a regular basis either, resulting  often in pharmacists being reimbursed below what it costs them to  acquire the drugs themselves. It is a major problem, because when PBMs  aren't keeping the cost of generic drugs consistent, those price  differentials can be a serious financial burden for local pharmacies.  And we know when they have a financial burden, that will affect their  business, that will affect the economy in the area, and that is going  to affect their patients as well. And we can't have that as we are  moving forward, especially in this country, doing what we can to reform  health care.   When we talk about reimbursement uncertainty for pharmacies, we are  talking about uncertainty for those patients, as I just said.   So, look, when we deal with this issue, I think we have to be very  transparent about it. We are going to be introducing later this week,  on a bipartisan basis, this Prescription Drug Price Transparency Act.  Specifically, what this act will do, it will increase transparency of  generic drug payments in Medicare part D, in Medicare Advantage, the  Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and TRICARE pharmacy  programs, by requiring that PBMs do three things; and Mr. Collins will  flesh this out, and I think Mr. Carter will as well.   First, provide pricing updates at least once every 7 days. Second,  disclose the sources used to update maximum allowable cost--or MAC-- prices. Third, notify pharmacies of any changes in individual drug  prices before these prices can be used as a basis of reimbursement.   This is commonsense, bipartisan legislation. We are going to hear  more about that in just a couple of minutes, but I am very thankful to  be here to talk about these issues.   There is one more I want to talk about, if I might, Mr. Collins, and  that is the importance of access to local pharmacies and Medicaid  beneficiaries in particular. We know that Medicaid beneficiaries depend  on their pharmacies as a provider of convenient, trusted care in their  communities.   In addition to dispensing vital prescription drugs, pharmacies  provide additional services to Medicaid enrollees, including  immunizations, medication therapy management--a really big issue--and  point-of-care testing like flu or strep tests. These are preventive and  maintenance care services that help to fill in the gaps where provider  shortages exist.   I know we are looking at reform and maybe replacing the Affordable  Care Act, but we have to be very careful, too. We all recognize the  importance of Medicaid, I think, going forward, and it is really  important, certainly, for these pharmacies and these community  pharmacists, and for their patients as well.   I thank the gentleman from Georgia. I really appreciate him including  me in this process. This is bipartisan. It is important to so many  communities, so many patients around America, and I am just happy to be  here to say a few words.
