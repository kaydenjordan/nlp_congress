 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Ali  Mayorkas's nomination to be Secretary of Homeland Security.   I believe Ali is uniquely qualified to face the challenges our Nation  is facing on day one. He brings to this office a diverse background and  set of experiences in both the private and public sectors that will  serve him well.   I have known Ali for many years and am proud to have recommended him  to President Clinton for the position of U.S. Attorney for the Central  District of California. I also worked very closely with Ali while he  served as President Obama's Director of U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services and later Deputy Secretary of DHS.   We all know that the role of Secretary of the Department of Homeland  Security is challenging. Recent history has shown the threats facing  the United States are diverse and ever-changing.   Over my many years working with Ali, I have witnessed his  intelligence, kindness, and thoughtfulness, as well as the compassion  and morality he brings with him to work every day. In many ways, Ali's  life story reflects the spirit of the American dream, and I would like  to briefly pass along some of that story today.   Born in Havana, Cuba, Ali and his family fled to the United States in  1960. He attended the University of California-Berkeley, where he  earned a bachelor's degree with distinction in 1981. He went on to earn  his law degree from Loyola Law School in 1985. From 1989 to 1998, he  served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Central District of  California where he prosecuted a wide array of Federal crimes. Ali  became the first U.S. Attorney in the Central District of California to  be appointed from within the office when he was appointed in 1998.   He created the Civil Rights Section in the office to prosecute hate  crimes; he developed an innovative program to address violent crime by  targeting criminals' possession of firearms; he led the prosecution of  street gangs; and he still had time to develop an afterschool program  to help at-risk youth.   Ali's approach to enforcing our Nation's laws demonstrates a much- needed holistic view that understands the complexity of the challenge.  He further developed his sharp legal skills as a partner at O'Melveny  and Myers from 2001 to 2009 where he represented companies in high- profile and sensitive government enforcement cases. He was recognized  by his worldwide firm for his leadership and was named by the National  Law Journal in 2008 as one of the ``50 Most Influential Minority  Lawyers in America.''   When Ali took over as Director of USCIS in 2009, he worked to  administer our immigration laws while preserving our legacy as a nation  of immigrants. He helped ensure integrity of our immigration laws by  decreasing fraud and bringing accountability to our immigration system.   Significantly, under President Obama's directive to grant deferred  action to immigrants who arrived in this country as children, Ali  successfully implemented the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,  known as DACA.   This program played a critical role for hundreds of thousands of  young people who were able to get jobs, acquire driver's licenses,  purchase homes and go to college. I am proud that Ali will continue to  play a role in allowing these young people to pursue the American  dream.   When Ali became the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security under  President Obama in 2013, he took on even more responsibility. He led  the DHS response to the Ebola and Zika virus epidemics, as well as  cybersecurity negotiations with China.   He oversaw the agency's complex efforts to combat terrorism and  enhance the security and management of our borders. He worked to  facilitate trade and travel, and he oversaw the enforcement of our  immigration laws.   And he was responsible for coordinating efforts to safeguard  cyberspace and oversee disaster coordination with Federal, State,  local, international, and private sector partners.   The United States faces new threats to our security every day. We  need experienced, intelligent, and moral leadership at DHS to combat  those threats.   I have full confidence that Ali Mayorkas will bring all of those  qualities to the role of Homeland Security Secretary. I strongly urge  my colleagues to vote to confirm Alejandro Mayorkas for the position of  Secretary of Homeland Security.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Kobe  Bryant and Gianna Bryant Helicopter Safety Act''.   I'm pleased to be joined today by Senators Schumer, Blumenthal, and  Markey in reintroducing this bill.   Nearly one year ago today, on January 26, 2020, a helicopter carrying  nine Californians flew into foggy weather and crashed minutes later.  Los Angeles and the world soon learned that among the crash victims  were basketball legend Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna.   After the crash, we soon learned the names and stories of John,  Alyssa, and Keri Altobelli; Sarah and Payton Chester; Christina Mauser;  and Ara Zobayan. These were spirited friends and family members  connected by their love of sport, traveling to a weekend basketball  tournament.   The sudden and shocking nature of the accident touched many, and the  public remembrances in Los Angeles and around the world to honor the  victims are proof that their memories will not soon be forgotten.   But this tragedy is one that could have been averted. A preliminary  report and investigatory documents released by the National  Transportation Safety Board indicate the helicopter was flying through  thick clouds and fog, yet was not equipped with a terrain awareness and  warning system. This technology provides pilots with real-time,  inflight warning signals and an image of surrounding terrain.   Since 2006, the National Transportation Safety Board has recommended  to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that all new and existing  helicopters capable of carrying six or more passengers be equipped with  terrain awareness and warning system technology. However, FAA has only  required these warning systems for air ambulances.   Nevertheless, this technology has become standard on new helicopters  from Airbus, Bell, Leonardo, and Sikorsky since December 2018. But  older helicopters remain vulnerable.   Our bill also requires crash-resistant flight data and voice  recorders. Otherwise known as black boxes, this technology is important  for when accidents do happen and mistakes are made. It would allow  agencies like the NTSB to have a better understanding of the incident  and provide more information to the FAA to prevent future accidents.   It is clear that additional steps are needed to ensure that  helicopters can fly safely, both for the sake of passengers and those  on the ground.   Our bill offers a common-sense approach to preventing further  accidents like this one. It would simply direct the FAA to implement  the NTSB's recommendations to require terrain awareness and warning  systems and flight data and voice recorders on all helicopters carrying  six or more passengers.   I appreciate the hard work of the National Transportation Safety  Board in developing these important recommendations, and it is long  past time that the FAA heeds its call.   My thoughts continue to be with the victims and their loved ones  impacted by this heartbreaking accident. It is critical that Congress  pass our bill swiftly to ensure that such loss of life was not in vain.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                            ____________________
