 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for hosting  this very important Special Order, and I am so glad that we are talking  about the tremendous benefits that we have seen from the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act passed just over 6 months ago.    During the last 6 months, we have heard a lot of impressive  statistics about the national economy. We have heard about unemployment  being down to 3.8 percent. We have heard about second quarter GDP being  projected at in excess of 4 percent. We have heard about there being  more available jobs than there are available workers in this country  for the first time since the Labor Department has been keeping that  statistic.   It is really impressive what the national economy has been doing over  the past 6 months, but what matters most to me and what matters most to  Hoosiers back home in the Ninth District is, what it is doing for them;  what it is doing for their small businesses; what it is doing for their  pocketbooks; what it is doing for their families; and what it is doing  for their communities.   In Ellettsville, Joe said:         Per month, my wife and I alone will receive over $200, and       for our family, that really helps us out. That is groceries       for an entire week.    Down in New Albany, Will said:         As a small businessowner, I am now able to invest more in       our company and employ more qualified people.    These are just two stories of what I hear day in and day out when I  am traveling about the district.   When I go to townhalls, I hear about the tax reform. When I go to  small businesses, I hear about the tax reform. When I go and visit  families at their farms, I hear about tax reform's impact.   I want to ensure that we continue to see the impressive national  statistics, but also continue to hear the great stories about how this  bill, how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, made a difference in individual  Hoosiers' lives.
