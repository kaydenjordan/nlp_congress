 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize October as  Breast Cancer Awareness Month.   As a physician, and also as a member of our society and country and  the female gender, we are all familiar with the amazing work the Komen  Foundation and Komen Race for the Cure have done to raise awareness,  education, and research in breast cancer.   I would like to take the time to recognize an extraordinary group in  my district that has found a creative way to help underserved women in  the Ottumwa community receive annual mammogram screenings and breast  ultrasounds.   Founded in 2011 by two-time breast cancer survivor and River Hills  Community Health Center nurse Laurie Hornback, Bras for a Cause is an  annual fundraising event held in Hedrick, Iowa, where donated and  decorated bras are modeled by local firefighters and auctioned off.  Over the past 10 years, the event has raised a total of $174,000 to  help women receive breast cancer screenings or treatment.   This year, Bras for a Cause raised a total of $27,000, and they will  be donating $15,000 to help Ottumwa women receive breast cancer  screenings at River Hills Community Health Center in Ottumwa.  Additionally, a portion of the remaining funds was donated to the  Mahaska Health Partnership, while the rest is being saved to help women  currently diagnosed with breast cancer undergo treatment.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Laurie and Bras for a Cause for coming together  to put on this fantastic event and for their service to our community.              Recognizing Sara Russell, Iowa Teacher of the Year     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a teacher  from my district who recently received a prestigious Iowa award for her  work to inspire the next generation.   Last week, Sara Russell, who has been teaching social studies for  nearly 20 years at Pleasant Valley High School in Bettendorf, was  awarded the Department of Education's 2022 Teacher of the Year Award by  Governor Kim Reynolds.   The Iowa Teacher of the Year Award was established in 1958 to  recognize educators who go above and beyond to motivate and inspire  students to achieve at their highest levels.    Sara was selected for this award for her leadership in helping  students build life skills while also being a mentor for new teachers  in the Pleasant Valley School District.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Sara and all educators who work to inspire the  next generation of American leaders and make Iowa the best place to  learn, live, work, and raise a family.                        Recognizing Eric Vander Velden     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to share a story about  educators in my district literally going the extra mile to ensure their  students' success.   For the last few months, the Newton School District in Jasper County  has reported a shortage of bus drivers, leaving many parents and  students uncertain about how they would be able to make it to school  each morning. In a rural area, our bus transportation to school is  extremely important.   With the importance of education and safety in mind, Eric Vander  Velden, a physical education teacher in the Newton School District,  answered the call for help by driving a school bus when needed. This is  part of a larger effort by the Newton staff, in concert with parents,  to do whatever they can to help their students succeed.   It is stories like these that remind us that our teachers are the  backbone of this country, and I couldn't be more confident in our  future, knowing that the next generation is in their capable hands.                            ____________________
