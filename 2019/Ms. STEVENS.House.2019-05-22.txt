 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to  H.R. 1500, the Consumers First Act.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an essential agency that  has protected millions of consumers and put more than $12 billion back  in Americans' pockets.   I worked in the Obama administration, in the United States Department  of the Treasury, when the CFPB was first established in the wake of the  financial crisis and saw firsthand how this agency has grown to serve  as a force for accountability, transparency, and fairness on behalf of  working Americans. That is why it is so important to restore and  protect the CFPB from the attempts to weaken this critical agency.   My amendment to the Consumers First Act ensures that community banks,  credit unions, small business owners, or economic growth experts are  appointed to serve as members of the Bureau's Consumer Advisory Board.   The Consumer Advisory Board is a resource for the CFPB, providing the  agency with expertise, analysis, and recommendations.   We must keep the channels open to small businesses, smaller banks,  credit unions, and community advocates. This amendment gives community- oriented small businesses a seat at the table when it comes to the  CFPB's decisionmaking, while furthering the goal of ensuring our  financial system works for everyone.   We need that on-the-ground information. We need to hear from our  small businesses.   In my district, credit unions and community banks offer helpful  resources to individual borrowers as they look to purchase a home,  start a small business, or expand a manufacturing order.   These institutions have invaluable knowledge that we should take  advantage of as we work to protect consumers from fraud and abuse.   My district, Michigan 11, is also home to several thousand small  businesses, including manufacturers and the country's most robust  automotive supply chain.                                time  1515    We have got retail, we have got restaurants, and we have the  capability to continue to unlock the channels of innovation, but we  need a CFPB that works for us, and we need the voice of the small  business at the table.   Our small business owners contribute so much to our communities, and  they have a finger on the pulse of our economy more than anyone else.  We should welcome the expertise of these key stakeholders at the CFPB  as they continue to do incredible work for the American people and our  economy.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank my colleague from North Carolina  for his celebratory remarks. This is an important day in Congress  because this is the role that we play; overseeing agencies,  strengthening their work and delivering for the American people.   I have got to applaud our chairwoman of Financial Services for the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau work that she has done,  particularly with this act. It is long overdue.   We are thrilled to introduce this amendment that will bring the voice  of small business to the table.  [[Page H4101]]    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
