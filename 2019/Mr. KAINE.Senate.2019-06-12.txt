 Mr. President, Our Nation's public health system needs  high quality, timely, and accurate data to protect the public from  health threats like opioid overdoses, influenza, measles, and more.  Effective prevention and response to health threats requires  coordinated efforts between health care providers and public health  officials across all levels of government.   Unfortunately, the public health data systems we rely on for our  health and safety are antiquated and fragmented. Systems lack the  interoperability needed to facilitate timely, secure information  exchange. Too often, public health departments are forced to rely on  systems with manual processes that are time consuming and error prone,  such as paper records, faxes, and phone calls. Only two jurisdictions  have begun the process to receive electronic case reports directly from  health records, and only for a small number of diseases. Our public  health data infrastructure lacks the automation, security,  interoperability, and skilled workforce we need to confront the public  health threats of today and tomorrow.   Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleagues, Senator Isakson  and Senator King, the Saving Lives Through Better Data Act to assist in  building the 21st Century public health data infrastructure our Nation  needs. The Saving Lives Through Better Data Act awards grants to State,  local, Tribal, and territorial public health departments to improve  data collection and analysis, simplify provider reporting, enhance  interoperability, promote electronic case reporting, and support  earlier disease detection and response. Grant recipients must support  interoperability standards endorsed by the National Coordinator for  Health Information Technology or those adopted by the HHS Secretary.   The Saving Lives Through Better Data Act also requires the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct activities to improve its  public health data systems. The CDC must also develop and utilize  public-private partnerships to support State, local, Tribal, and  territorial public health departments in modernizing and expanding  electronic case reporting and public health data systems. The  legislation calls for reporting on barriers public health authorities  may face in implementing electronic case reporting or interoperable  public health data systems as well as an assessment of the potential  public health impact of making such improvements. We make the necessary  investment to improve our public health infrastructure by authorizing  $100 million per year for each of fiscal years 2020-2024.   The Saving Lives Through Better Data Act will strengthen our public  health data systems so we can be well-equipped to identify and respond  to public health threats, which will save lives.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Tester, Mr. Tillis,          and Ms. Sinema):   S. 1802. A bill to provide a work opportunity tax credit for military  spouses and to provide for flexible spending arrangements for childcare  services for military families; to the Committee on Finance.    Mr. President, today I am introducing the Jobs and  Childcare for Military Families Act, with my colleagues Senators  Boozman and Tester. Enacting this bill would improve financial  stability for Gold Star families across the Nation.   The families of America's servicemembers make sacrifices that often  go unrecognized. Among them is packing up and moving frequently, with  military spouses regularly having to quit stable employment to move to  a new area and start over. This is compounded by the complex system of  State licensing and certification requirements, which can limit these  spouses' from taking jobs that utilize their expertise and experience.  Because of this, military spouses have unemployment rates substantially  higher than the national average, and are often underemployed when they  do have jobs. Adding to the financial struggle that frequent periods of  unemployment and underemployment cause, the rising cost of childcare  puts a substantial burden on many military families.   The Jobs and Childcare for Military Families Act would help these  families  [[Page S3366]]  in two ways. First, the bill makes military spouses an eligible  population for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. This tax credit has  been proven effective in improving the employment prospects for other  groups, and extending it to military spouses would help them find  employment easier after moving to new areas. Second, the bill instructs  the administration to implement dependent care flexible spending  accounts for all servicemembers. These accounts would allow military  families to contribute pre-tax dollars to accounts that they can then  use to pay for childcare services, helping ease the financial burden of  childcare.   I hope my colleagues will support this bill to help families who have  made the greatest sacrifice for our Nation.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms. Baldwin, Mrs. Capito, and Mr.          Tester):   S. 1803.
