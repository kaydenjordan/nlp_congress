 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the upcoming  100th birthday of Irma Roberts, probably the most famous high school  librarian in the history of Memphis City Schools.   Irma Roberts was the librarian at White Station High School from 1963  to 1986. Aside from being the librarian, she was the school's student  council sponsor. She planned the homecoming and directed the annual  Queen of Clubs.   Without a doubt, Irma Roberts had a great influence on my life and on  so many other students at White Station High School. She is truly an  inspiration to a couple of generations of students at White Station  High School. She was a tremendous educator.   Dodson, DeAnn, Dabney, Bob, Bill, and Ryan know how terrific their  mother and grandmother is as a person. Now, so does everyone else.   Irma Roberts, congratulations on your 100th birthday.                            ____________________
