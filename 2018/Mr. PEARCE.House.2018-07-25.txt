 Mr. Speaker, in June, New Mexico's unemployment rate  ticked down to 4.9 percent. This is the first time the State's  unemployment rate has gone below 5 percent since September of 2008. And  just for perspective, one year ago, in 2017, the unemployment was at  6.1 percent.   When we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs bill, New Mexico didn't  immediately feel the results, but now people are being filled with  confidence, businesses are hiring, they are expanding, and people are  going back to work.   But an even more remarkable development was the right to export our  oil. Two counties in New Mexico are driving a surplus that is causing  America to extend above and beyond where Saudi Arabia is currently  producing. We are on track to become number one. That is after decades  of saying that we had reached peak oil in the country.   When we release the ingenuity of the American worker, America can  compete with anyone. These things are happening. America is better off  today because of what we have done here in Congress as the Republicans.                            ____________________
