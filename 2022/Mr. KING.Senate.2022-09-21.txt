 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the career one  of Maine's most dedicated, respected leaders: Dana Connors. Dana is  part of the fabric of Maine, and it is almost impossible to concisely  recognize the impact he has had on our State.   Dana, a proud native of Aroostook County, started his career as a  municipal manager in Presque Isle after graduating from the University  of Maine. Here, he served as city manager for 16 years, where he built  a reputation as an advocate for common sense, a consensus builder, and  a good listener. His exceptional ability to put a fine point on issues  and present a case for the greater good brought him to State  government, where he served as Maine's Commissioner of the Department  of Transportation under both a Democratic and Republican Governor--a  true testament to his bipartisan values.   In the time I have known him, it has always been clear that Dana  served the people, not any party. It is due to this unimpeachable  dedication, that people have always trusted him implicitly. I am one of  those people, and when I was lucky enough to serve as Governor of the  great State of Maine, Dana was my first and only choice to be my  transition director. Shortly after in 1994, he became president of the  Maine State Chamber of Commerce, where he has served our business  community admirably for nearly 30 years.   It is here at the chamber where perhaps he has left his largest  legacy. There has never been a greater advocate for Maine's businesses,  and his legacy will continue to echo throughout our State for  generations. Because of Dana, thousands of Maine businesses have been  able to thrive, employ hard- working Maine people, and make our State  the greatest in the Nation.   While his retirement will undoubtably leave a large void in the  business community, Dana has instilled the same work ethic and  understanding of the needs of Maine businesses in his team. They will  continue Dana's legacy and ensure the growing success of the State that  Dana devoted his career to.   Dana has made the Maine State chamber a shining example of  professionalism. His instincts--and his fashion sense--may be a hard  act to follow, but his ability to lead always includes a path for  others to succeed. Thank you, Dana, for your friendship, your  leadership, and your dedication to public service. Maine is better for  it.                            ____________________
