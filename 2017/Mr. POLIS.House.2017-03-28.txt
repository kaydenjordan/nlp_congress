 Mr. Speaker, the time for immigration reform is now.   If we want to increase the growth rate of our economy, fixing our  broken immigration system will do that.   If we want to restore the rule of law and improve our national  security so we know who is here, immigration reform will do that.   If we want to prevent undocumented workers from undermining wages for  American workers, immigration reform will do that by making sure that  people who work here are registered and get right with the law and can  move forward in a legal manner.   There are so many reasons to pass a bipartisan immigration reform  bill similar to the one that passed the United States Senate with more  than two-thirds support just a few years ago.   I hope that my Democratic and Republican colleagues hear the outcry  from across this country that says enough is enough. Let's fix our  broken immigration system.   We are, after all, a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. It is  the work of this body to reconcile those two to make sure that, moving  forward, we can do immigration in a legal way rather than an illegal  way, a way that benefits our economy, American workers, and American  businesses.   Let's move forward on comprehensive immigration reform now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying  legislation. First, when the gentleman from Georgia said there were no  amendments brought forward on this in the Rules Committee, that is  partial truth but not the entire truth.   The entire truth is, when we have a process whereby Members believe  that there might be an amendment process, there is something called a  call for amendments which is issued. Often our chair, Mr. Sessions, and  my friend from Georgia has heard Mr. Sessions come down to the floor  and say: We are calling for amendments on this bill. Submit them. The  Rules Committee will consider them and allow some of them to advance to  the floor. At least you know you have a fair shot.   In this particular case, there was no call for amendments issued,  which means, yes, Members could have spun their wheels, and sometimes  you feel like a hamster doing that, just running around and not moving  anywhere in one of those circles. And if we thought there was any  realistic hope that amendments could be included, I, myself, would have  been happy to submit one, as would many of my colleagues.   Chairman Smith actually requested a closed rule on this. So, again,  the chairman of the committee and the Rules Committee gave every  indication that we are not allowing any amendments to this bill; and  that is what discourages Members from going through the work of  submitting an amendment if they have a good idea what the outcome is  already going to be.   So this is a closed rule. This is an antiscience bill. It is another  example of how we go around the ability of Members to improve bills  and, instead, work in a partisan, smoky, backroom manner where this  bill emerges fully formed. The chair of the committee of jurisdiction  himself didn't want any amendments or any changes to this rule, and the  Rules Committee never called for those amendments.   Now, if the goal of this bill is somehow to increase government  transparency, why don't we start with the lawmaking process and have an  open rule that allows Democrats and Republicans to improve a bill and  offer their best ideas forward? And if they are good ideas, they will  be incorporated into the bill. If they are bad ideas and can't command  a majority of this body, they will be defeated.   But, unfortunately, these partisan tactics that were seen trying to  ram through legislation last week that failed when the Speaker and the  President refused to work across the aisle with us on healthcare reform  and now on improving the process at the EPA, instead of working with us  to improve science, they are seeking to undermine the integrity of the  important scientific work done at the Environmental Protection Agency  and bury the Environmental Protection Agency in red tape.   The underlying legislation that this rule talks about has a lot of  problems, Mr. Speaker, and so many problems, in fact, I won't even be  able to talk about them all during my limited time for debate here.  Hopefully they will be able to cover some more during the debate on the  bill.   The first issue I want to address that is highly problematic with  this bill, and it is something that is so important to the American  people--liberal, conservative, and moderate--and that is the issue of  privacy.   This bill would undermine the privacy of American families in a  number of ways. What it would do is prohibit the Environmental  Protection Agency, an agency that exists to protect our health, from  taking any action unless it is based on data that is fully available to  the public. Now, that sounds good, ``fully available to the public.''  But what does that mean?   You see, normally the EPA has relied on peer-reviewed, scientifically  valid research to inform its actions. Now that is something that the  process of science across the world informs. It is a very important,  well-founded process that respects the efforts of scientists everywhere  and the diligence of a peer-reviewed process.   Much of these bodies of work utilize personal health information and  confidential data which, currently, are legally protected from public  disclosure. The EPA identifies the academic papers that it uses in the  Federal Register so we have that transparency, but it doesn't release  the legally protected private data--participants in studies, health of  people--to the general public nor is there any scientific value to that  personal information.   The value is in the studies, which are done scientifically and are  already made public. This bill would force the EPA to either ignore  these valuable studies because they utilize private  [[Page H2473]]  data or violate Federal law by sharing confidential patient information  with the general public. We are talking about everything ranging from  Social Security numbers, to whether you got cancer from something you  were drinking as a child, to our most intimate health or lifestyle  issues that are researched by the agency.   The majority here, the Republicans, are trying to include a provision  in the bill that allows personally identifiable information to be  redacted prior to the EPA making the information available. I am sure  my colleague from Georgia will cite that, but that is woefully  inefficient because it has a loophole in that very provision that  basically negates that provision in another section by allowing the EPA  administrator to allow any person who signs a confidentiality agreement  to have access to all the redacted data.   So, again, basically, at the whim of the administrator, they can  allow companies and people in there--the information can be put in  front of people who have access to it, to use it in any way they want,  and that is highly personal information.   Again, whether it is under the coverage of a confidentiality  agreement or not, it is shown with unknown partners. This is not the  Federal agency itself. This is perhaps even the company that caused the  pollution that wants to come in and look at it or just various  Americans with prurient interests who want to know intimate health  details, and there is effectively no protection for that. It is  entirely at the whim of the administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency.    So that is an enormous setback for the privacy of American families  and a woefully insufficient privacy protection with a loophole that is  big enough to drive a truck through. There is not even a numerical  limit on the amount of people or corporations that would be allowed  access of that data. There could be a blanket permission from the  administrator allowing thousands, tens of thousands of people, again,  to see the individually identifiable data, including your Social  Security Number, including your health details or medical records,  including things that affect property value and affect health.   Another major issue with this bill, major fault, is it actually  undermines the goal of the Agency itself. The Environmental Protection  Agency, which has the congressional mandate to keep our air and water  clean, to protect our health, this bill actually does the opposite by  burying the Agency under a mountain of red tape and bureaucracy.   This bill removes sound, scientific, objective decisionmaking and  replaces it with ridiculous amounts of red tape, adding to the process  of regulations, adding to the process of rules, requiring the  Environmental Protection Agency to jump through additional bureaucratic  hoops to use certain information, and making their entire goal of  fulfilling their mission less efficient than if this bill were not the  law.   The Environmental Protection Agency already uses a peer-reviewed  scientific process. They publish in the Federal Register the reference  of the works that they are basing their opinions on, just as the rest  of America's scientific community does. This bill undermines the  scientific process, is unscientific, and is opposed by so many  scientific advocacy organizations, including opposed by the Union of  Concerned Scientists who are strongly opposed to this legislation.   Now, on top of the red tape and antiscience aspects of the bill, this  would also cost the government $1 billion of EPA funds; that is  according to analysis of a very similar bill last Congress. These are  funds that would be diverted away from protecting our health and  safety, which is what they are doing now, toward creating more red tape  and bureaucracy for the very agency that the American people entrust  with the goal of keeping our air and water clean and the American  people healthy.   Look, we all know what this bill is. It is a thinly veiled attack on  science, part of the antiscience agenda that we are seeing from the  Republican Party.   The budget that the President offered earlier this month cuts science  funding to the bone. Enormous setbacks in the very research into  lifesaving science in the future that would help improve our quality of  life and duration of life and help our economy boom are being  devastated under the President's budgets.   Scientific research creates billions of dollars of economic impact  and innovation in States like mine, Colorado, and every other State.  Science helps keep us healthy. It keeps crops alive and productive. It  keeps our businesses open and keeps America as a global leader in  innovation.   I also want to take a moment to highlight that, while this bill is  being heard on the floor today, President Trump is signing an executive  order that effectively repeals all of the work that the Environmental  Protection Agency and other Federal agencies have done in the last 8  years to protect our planet from the impacts of climate change.   Unfortunately, while we focus on a bill that forces scientists to not  use the best science available, the President has signed an executive  order that will essentially begin the repeal process of the Clean Power  Plan. The Clean Power Plan is a basic requirement for States to bring  their emissions down to a sustainable level to protect Americans'  health, to reduce the amount of pollution in our air and water, and to  reduce the human impact on climate change.   The executive order also, unfortunately, undermines some of the  commonsense protections we have with regard to fracking, something that  is near and dear to my constituents and people in Colorado, as an area  that is impacted by extraction activities.   This repeal, for example, would allow oil and gas companies to hide  the chemicals that they use when producing oil and natural gas. Picture  that: fracking wells near homes and schools who would no longer have to  report what chemicals could potentially be leaking into drinking water  or groundwater. How can that possibly further our goal to protect the  health and welfare of the American people?   So, at the same time, we have this legislation undermining the  scientific process of the Environmental Protection Agency and burying  the Environmental Protection Agency under red tape, coordinated the  same week with the President's disastrous executive order that will  hurt the health of the American people and, ultimately, cost lives.   These are just another step in the undermining of science and the  work to improve and protect the health of the people of our country.  The Environmental Protection Agency relies on the best science  available when developing new standards, and they are fully transparent  about posting those scientific studies.   However, because many of the studies that this bill requires would  impact legally protected private data, like personal medical records,  to reach their findings, the Environmental Protection Agency could even  be prohibited from considering that research.   This ridiculous restriction would force the EPA to ignore a lot of  relevant information because of the desire of the researchers and the  legal imperative of the researchers to protect the private data of the  participants, ultimately leading to policies that are ineffective and  are not based on sound facts or science.   Mr. Speaker, facts exist. Science and the pursuit of truth is an  incredibly important human endeavor, and we can't afford to disregard  that quest for truth in the name of a fiction-based reality that we  increasingly seem to be headed toward as a nation.    Without sound and strong science, America will fall behind in the  world. Americans will--our lifespans will be of lower quality and lower  duration, and our economy will be hurt as we cede our leadership role  to more forward-looking countries willing to invest in the future.   If this bill had been in place over the last few decades, I am pretty  sure that the cloud of smog over Denver, Colorado, would probably still  be there. Rivers and lakes across this country would suffer from  pollution in a significantly worse way, and that is not the future that  the American people want.   If the EPA is prevented from using the best available peer-reviewed  research data on air quality, asthma will be causing more attacks and,  yes, even deaths of children across our country.   Let's see this legislation for what it is--an attack on science, a  giveaway to corporations who benefit from pollution, who don't like the  fact that the EPA is using sound silence, who want to create and live  in their own fictional  [[Page H2474]]  reality, where the externalities of their actions somehow don't matter.   We need the truth. The American people deserve the truth. We deserve  the benefit of the outcome of the process of objective science, and  this bill undermines that by burying the Environmental Protection  Agency under immense red tape, while preventing them from using some of  the very peer-reviewed studies that would lead to the very best  decisionmaking possible to protect the health of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have some scoring from the Congressional Budget  Office, dated March 11, 2015, that I include into the Record.                H.R. 1030--Secret Science Reform Act of 2015     As ordered reported by the House Committee on Science, Space, and                        Technology on March 3, 2015                                   SUMMARY         H.R. 1030 would amend the Environmental Research,       Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1978 to       prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from       proposing, finalizing, or disseminating a ``covered action''       unless all scientific and technical information used to       support that action is publicly available in a manner that is       sufficient for independent analysis and substantial       reproduction of research results. Covered actions would       include assessments of risks, exposure, or hazards; documents       specifying criteria, guidance, standards, or limitations; and       regulations and regulatory impact statements.        Although H.R. 1030 would not require EPA to disseminate any       scientific or technical information that it relies on to       support covered actions, the bill would not prohibit EPA from       doing so. Based on information from EPA, CBO expects that EPA       would spend $250 million annually over the next few years to       ensure the transparency of information and data supporting       some covered actions.        Enacting H.R. 1030 would not affect direct spending or       revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.       H.R. 1030 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector       mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act       (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or       tribal governments.                   ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT         This legislation would direct EPA to implement H.R. 1030       using up to $1 million a year from amounts authorized to be       appropriated for other activities under current law. Although       H.R. 1030 would not authorize additional appropriations to       implement the requirements of the bill, CBO estimates that       implementing H.R. 1030 would cost about $250 million a year       for the next few years, subject to appropriation of the       necessary amounts. Costs in later years would probably       decline gradually from that level. The additional       discretionary spending would cover the costs of expanding the       scope of EPA studies and related activities such as data       collection and database construction for all of the       information necessary to meet the legislation's requirements.                              BASIS OF ESTIMATE         Under current law, EPA typically spends about $500 million       each year to support research and development activities,       including assessments to determine the potential risk to       public health from environmental contaminants. The number of       studies involved in supporting covered actions depends on the       complexity of the issue being addressed. For example, when       addressing a recent issue with flaring at petroleum       refineries, EPA relied on a dozen scientific studies. In       contrast, when reviewing the National Ambient Air Quality       Standards, the agency relied on thousands of scientific       studies. In total, the agency relies on about 50,000       scientific studies annually to perform its mission--although       some of those studies are used more than once from year to       year.        The costs of implementing H.R. 1030 are uncertain because       it is not clear how EPA would meet the bill's requirements.       Depending on their size and scope, the new activities called       for by the bill would cost between $10,000 and $30,000 for       each scientific study used by the agency. If EPA continued to       rely on as many scientific studies as it has used in recent       years, while increasing the collection and dissemination of       all the technical  [[Page H2475]]       information used in such studies as directed by H.R. 1030,       then implementing the bill would cost at least several       hundred million dollars a year. However, EPA could instead       rely on significantly fewer studies each year in support of       its mission, and limit its spending on data collection and       database construction activities to a relatively small       expansion of existing study-related activity; in that       scenario, implementing the bill would be much less costly.        Thus, the costs of implementing H.R. 1030 would ultimately       depend on how EPA adapts to the bill's requirements. (It       would also depend on the availability of appropriated funds       to conduct the additional data collection and database       construction activities and related coordination and       reporting activities under the legislation.) CBO expects that       EPA would modify its practices, at least to some extent, and       would base its future work on fewer scientific studies, and       especially those studies that have easily accessible or       transparent data. Any such modification of EPA practices       would also have to take into consideration the concern that       the quality of the agency's work could be compromised if that       work relies on a significantly smaller collection of       scientific studies; we expect that the agency would seek to       reduce its reliance on numerous studies without sacrificing       the quality of the agency's covered actions related to       research and development.        On balance--recognizing the significant uncertainty       regarding EPA's potential actions under the bill--CBO expects       that the agency would probably cut the number of studies it       relies on by about one-half and that the agency would aim to       limit the costs of new activities required by the bill, such       as data collection, correspondence and coordination with       study authors, construction of a database to house necessary       information, and public dissemination of such information. As       a result, CBO estimates the incremental costs to the agency       would be around $250 million a year initially, subject to       appropriation of the necessary amounts. In our assessment       that figure lies near the middle of a broad range of possible       outcomes under H.R. 1030. CEO expects that the additional       costs to implement the legislation would decline over time as       EPA became more adept and efficient at working with authors       and researchers to ensure that the data used to support       studies are provided in a standardized and replicable form.                         PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS         None.                 InTERGOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE-SECTOR IMPACT         H.R. 1030 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector       mandates as defined in UMRA and would not affect the budgets       of state, local, or tribal governments.                            ESTIMATE PREPARED BY:         Federal Costs: Susanne S. Mehlman; Impact on State, Local,       and Tribal Governments: Jon Sperl; Impact on the Private       Sector: Amy Petz.                            ESTIMATE APPROVED BY:         Peter H. Fontaine, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.     This is based on H.R. 1030 from last session, the Secret  Science Reform Act of 2015, effectively the same operating provisions  as this new bill. If there are any cost-saving elements in this new  bill that weren't in H.R. 1030, I would encourage my colleague from  Georgia to let us know because we are voting without scoring or costs  on the newest version of this legislation. The previous version of this  legislation, as I mentioned earlier, would cost $250 million annually  over the next several years, $1 billion to implement, and that is the  scoring from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office whose director  was appointed by the Republicans on a substantially similar bill.   Mr. Speaker, we are deeply concerned by reports from our intelligence  community regarding Russian interference in last year's election. Even  more troubling is FBI Director Comey's sworn testimony that the FBI is  now investigating the possibility of collusion between members of  President Trump's campaign team and Russia.   Mr. Speaker, the legitimacy of our electoral system is at stake; and,  frankly, it is time that we rise above partisanship and that we get our  job done and get to the bottom of this.   Unfortunately, recent actions by the House Intelligence Committee  chairman have left many Members of both sides of the aisle convinced  and the American public convinced that the committee is unable to  conduct an impartial investigation of this critical matter of national  security.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer up an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Swalwell's and  Representative Cummings' bill which would create a bipartisan  commission to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Swalwell), a member of the Intelligence Committee, to  discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Swalwell), a member of the Intelligence Committee, to  discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the EPA protecting our quality of life, our air, and our  water has nothing to do with Heaven or God. It is based on science.  Individual Americans like Mr. Gohmert and myself have our own faith  traditions. I don't think there is anybody in the country whose faith  tradition is to worship the EPA.   We have created the EPA for a purpose: to protect the health of the  American people and protect our air and water. There are people alive  today and people who are healthier today because of the work of the  EPA. The converse of that, without the Environmental Protection Agency,  some of us wouldn't even be here and others of us would be sickly.   It really doesn't make any sense to talk about people worshipping the  EPA. We respect the scientific work of the EPA, and maybe this  confusion between faith and science is what is leading to the  undermining of the scientific aspects that the EPA reaches their  conclusions on.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that shows the strong  opposition from those who advocate for our health against this bill.  Alliance of Nurses, American Lung Association, American Public Health  Association, National Medical Association, Asthma and Allergy  Foundation of America, and others have all signed a letter in  opposition to this bill because this bill threatens the health of the  American people.                                                    March 27, 2017.        Dear Representative: The undersigned health and medical       organizations are writing to express our opposition to the       EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017 and the Honest       and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017. Our       organizations are dedicated to saving lives and improving       public health.        Science is the bedrock of sound medical and public health       decision-making. The best science undergirds everything our       organizations do to improve health. Under the Clean Air Act,       EPA has long implemented a transparent and open process for       seeking advice from the medical and scientific community on       standards and measures to meet those standards. Both of these       bills would restrict the input of scientific experts in the       review of complex issues and add undue industry influence       into EPA's decision-making process.        As written, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would       make unneeded and unproductive changes that would:        Restrict the ability of scientists to speak on issues that       include their own expertise;        Block scientists who receive any EPA grants from serving on       the EPA Scientific Advisory Board, despite their having the       expertise and conducted relevant research that earned them       these highly competitive grants;        Prevent the EPA Scientific Advisory Board from making       policy recommendations, even though EPA administrators have       regularly sought their advice in the past;        Add a notice and comment component to all parts of the EPA       Scientific Advisory Board actions, a burdensome and       unnecessary requirement since their reviews of major issues       already include public notice and comment; and        Reallocate membership requirements to increase the       influence of industry representatives on the scientific       advisory panels.        In short, EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would limit       the voice of scientists, restrict the ability of the Board to       respond to important questions, and increase the influence of       industry in shaping EPA policy. This is not in the best       interest of the American public.        We also have concerns with the HONEST Act. This legislation       would limit the kinds of scientific data EPA can use as it       develops policy to protect the American public from       environmental exposures and permit violation of patient       confidentiality. If enacted, the legislation would:        Allow the EPA administrator to release confidential patient       information to third parties, including industry;        Bolster industry's flawed arguments to discredit research       that documents the adverse health effects of environmental       pollution; and        Impose new standards for the publication and distribution       of scientific research that go beyond the robust, existing       requirements of many scientific journals.        Science, developed by the respected men and women       scientists at colleges and universities across the United       States, has always been the foundation of the nation's       environmental policy. EPA's science-based decision-making       process has saved lives and led to dramatic improvements in       the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the       earth we share. All Americans have benefited from the       research-based scientific advice that scientists have       provided to EPA.        Congress should adopt policy that fortifies our scientists,       not bills that undermine the scientific integrity of EPA's       decision-making or give polluters a disproportionate voice in       EPA's policy-setting process.        We strongly urge you to oppose these bills.            Sincerely,      Katie Huffling, RN, CNM,        Director, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments.      Harold P. Wimmer,        National President and CEO, American Lung Association.      Georges C. Benjamin, MD,        Executive Director, American Public Health Association.      Stephen C. Crane, Ph.D., MPH,        Executive Director, American Thoracic Society.

Richard Allen Williams, MD,        117th President, National Medical Association.      Jeff Carter, JD,        Executive Director, Physicians for Social Responsibility.     Last Congress, we considered a bill called the Secret  Science Act, which was nearly identical to this bill. That was a bill  that I submitted was at a cost of billion dollars. If the gentleman  from Georgia has any evidence that this bill will cost less, I  encourage him to bring it forward.   This bill, frankly, would force the EPA to be dishonest, to not use  the best available science, and threaten the privacy of the American  people.   Our goal should be to help the agencies that we charge with  protecting our health to use the best possible science to do the best  possible job that they can. We should not be throwing up roadblocks and  red tape and bureaucratic mazes that hurt the quality of work and the  science that we base our protections on.   We need to protect American lives from things like dirty air, dirty  water, and pollution. We should protect the privacy of all Americans,  but this bill doesn't protect the privacy of Americans. It undermines  the goal of the Environmental Protection Agency.   My colleague, Mr. Swalwell, brought forward a very important motion.  When we defeat the previous question, we have a motion to create a  bipartisan commission to investigate Russian interference in the 2016  election.   That is what I hear about from my constituents. I haven't heard from  any constituents that say: We want our personal data to be revealed by  the Environmental Protection Agency or we want to stop them from citing  scientific papers.   That is simply not on the minds of the American people.   What is on the minds of the American people is that we need a full  accounting for the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which is  why we have a bill to create a bipartisan commission to investigate  that Russian interference in a manner that has credibility with the  American people, that can end this increasingly bizarre spy novel that  seems to be unfolding in this city that we are meeting in now, and  replace it with investigations and facts and a full accounting for the  American people as to what happened and who was involved.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to inquire if the gentleman from Georgia has any  information as to why the new bill would cost any different amount than  the prior version of the bill from the last Congress that was scored?    I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.    Reclaiming my time, what the bill essentially does is two  things in this regard. One, it will foist an unfunded mandate onto  those who are conducting the research to go through the effort  themselves of releasing the data. But more perniciously, it will  prevent data and scientific studies that there are legal protections  from even being looked at by the Environmental Protection Agency. They  won't even be able to consider that data.   I think it is important that we get back to the topics that the  American people care about. I hope that we can move forward with  Representatives Swalwell's and Cummings' bill to create a bipartisan  commission to investigate the Russian influence in the 2016 election  rather than attack and undermine science, attack and undermine privacy,  and attack and undermine the American people.   This bill undermines our privacy protections and opens the door for  more Americans to get sick and hurt by pollution in our air and water.  I hope that we can stand up against that.   Mr. Speaker, I ask Members to vote ``no'' on this bill and vote  ``no'' on this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, up until now, every President since Gerald  Ford has disclosed their tax return information. These returns provide  a basic level of transparency that helps ensure the public's  interest is placed first. The American people deserve the same level of  disclosure from this administration. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the  previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up  Representative Eshoo's bill that would require Presidents and major  party nominees for the Presidency to release their tax returns.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo) to discuss this proposal and also the important  aspects of the underlying bill that need to be responded to.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman has 4 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman has 4 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the resolution.   This resolution undermines fundamental privacy for every internet  user. You hear my colleague on the other side trying to conflate  different things. When your broadband provider can sell your  information, and there is no rule prohibiting them from doing so-- effectively that includes all of your browsing history, data entered in  forms, everything that you have done on the internet that has  absolutely nothing to do with a relationship with a particular content  provider or e-commerce company; you can enter information, obviously,  for the express purpose of them optimizing your experience or selling  you a product--they are then the owners of that information, and you  have choice in the marketplace. Whereas, with our broadband providers,  most of us don't have a choice. You either sign up for the local cable  company or you don't.   Before I discuss the many disastrous facets of this resolution, I  also want to point out that this is yet another closed rule. There have  been absolutely no open rules that allow Democrats and Republicans to  bring forward amendments. No amendments are allowed under this rule  here on the floor of the House of Representatives. Sadly, that has  become the norm.   The FCC recently took steps to reevaluate their rule. Commissioner  Pai even paused their implementation to examine the FCC doing their  job.  [[Page H2481]]    Now, why would Congress step in and use the CRA authority, a very  cumbersome authority, that also prohibits future implementation of  similar rules?   In many ways, it hamstrings the agency.   What we are worried about is that, if this bill were to become law,  it would essentially be impossible for the FCC to act to protect the  privacy of Americans who use broadband ever again. So it is not a  matter of a nuance under this rule. If we go through the process of  passing a CRA, the FCC wouldn't be able to pass any rule--or if they  did, it would be under a legal cloud--to protect the privacy of the  American people. That is the danger: that CRAs are effectively  permanent.   The second aspect is that the FCC has already established a notice  and comment period that allows for comment on the new rules. By going  around that, we would avoid government transparency.   So here is what is at stake. On October 27, 2016, after a 6-month  rulemaking process that was open to public comment and received  comments, the FCC developed a commonsense rule to protect our privacy.  The rule that we are talking about undoing basically does three things,  which are great.   It requires broadband internet access service providers to obtain  opt-in consent before using or sharing sensitive information. Sounds  obvious that we would want that. We wouldn't want information that  doesn't have an opt-in consent to be sold or used. That includes things  like web browsing history or data that is entered on forms.   It would also require broadband providers to use reasonable measures  to protect the cybersecurity of our data. Again, of course.   Third, it requires that broadband providers notify consumers in the  event of a breach of information. Again, just like we have with credit  card companies, we want some kind of affirmative information that is  given to consumers that your information may be breached if there is a  cybersecurity threat that might do that.   This bill undoes all those things. It says that you don't have to  notify people if there is a breach, you don't need to have reasonable  measures to protect cybersecurity, and, most importantly, with regard  to privacy, it will no longer require opt-in consent before using,  sharing, or selling your most intimate personal data that you use on  the internet.   Now, look at the implications of this rollback. It is not just a  collection of internet data usage, but bulk collection of all of your  network traffic. A broadband provider could collect every search, every  website visited, every email written and received, every piece of data  entered, every article read, see how often you log in and how you use  various accounts for all members of your family, including minors, and  even your location, sell that information, and use that information  without restriction and without opt-in.   Think about what someone can conclude about this information--your  political affiliation, preferences, your health.   What could they do with it?   They could charge pricing of goods and services discriminating  against you based on your income or your past purchasing behavior. Your  sensitive financial information could be used to steer you to higher  costs and worse financial products. This rule would literally change  how broadband providers have access to your entire personal life. It  would make the broadband providers the most valuable part of the  internet value chain.   Now, we all want broadband providers to have compensation for the  infrastructure costs and a reasonable profit. There is no doubt about  that. Those of us who advocate for net neutrality, as I do, or those  who advocate for privacy, we want them to have a reasonable return on  investment so that we can all have access to broadband. And we have  that largely through user fees and subscription fees.   Have you seen your cable bill, Mr. Speaker?   I have seen my cable bill. It ain't cheap anymore. But many families  pay for it because it is the best way to have fast access to the  internet.   And guess what?   The cable companies are able to justify broadband in many areas.   Again, maybe there are some tweaks, and it would be great if there is  a way we could have greater value for rural broadband and have them  have an ROI. We would love that. But the answer is not to turn over the  keys to the internet and all your personal data to cable companies and  say: You own it all. You are more powerful than Amazon, more powerful  than Google, more powerful than every consumer site because you own  everything that is entered into every one of those and more, and you  can sell it and use it as you see fit without restriction, without even  requiring that users opt in.    The value conveyance from the content side to the infrastructure side  of this bill would be game-changing and game-destroying for the free  and open internet. It simply makes no sense.   Look, consumers should have the right to choose with who and how they  share their personal information. When it comes to a broadband  provider, we simply don't have that choice that you do with consumer  websites like Facebook or Google, which are governed under a separate  set of laws.   Proponents of this bill are arguing that, because there is not  adequate protection somehow in social media and the edge providers  here, somehow the standard should be lower for broadband internet  services. It makes no sense. In today's day and age, not having  internet access is simply not an option for many Americans. To say you  can choose not to have broadband, maybe in some places you can pay more  for satellite and you might have some reasonably fast download but not  upload that may be spotty, maybe you want to use dial-in over your  phone. But for most of us--I use broadband. Most of us use broadband  through our cable because it is the most cost-effective way to have  high-speed internet access, and that is the case for most American  families.   So this is not the time to get rid of privacy rules and convey the  vast ecosystem that is the internet away from the content and dynamism  that exists there to the broadband side. That is absurd.   People can choose not to use social media accounts, can choose what  they share, and can choose who to enter contracts with with regard to  searches or purchases. Social media is an optional platform that you  can choose between many providers, but the broadband access side  frequently looks and acts more like a monopoly.   Supporters of this bill also mention how this somehow levels the  playing field for broadband providers. What it does is it tilts the  playing field entirely in their favor. Internet service providers are a  gateway to the internet. They do not own the internet.   The second protection the rule offers is to require reasonable  measures be taken to protect the data that they want to collect. Again,  we all value cybersecurity and protection of this data. Given the  countless incidents of cyber hacking incidents, how can we entertain  the idea of rolling back a rule that requires reasonable measures to  protect consumer data? What are proponents advocating for? No measures  to protect consumer data?   The third important protection under this rule is the consumers whose  data has been breached should be notified. Again, that is important. I  had my credit card stolen a few years ago and got notified that it was.  I used it at another location where it might have been compromised and  I received notification. This eliminates that notification from users  of broadband. It would do away with that.   I would like to know, as would consumers, if my credit card  information was hacked. I want to know if my personal profile or  medical records or emails were hacked. If someone is able to attain my  children's names, our home address, information about the schools they  attend, or the homework they do, I would want to know.   Now, look, this bill moves entirely the wrong direction. It basically  seizes the value of the internet from content, from e-commerce, from  all of the important dynamism that occurs there and tries to apply that  to the broadband side rather than simply find a reasonable way for  broadband providers to see a return on investment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the evaluation is as it should be. Again,  when infrastructure is laid, we want a reasonable ROI. It is like  utility infrastructure or water infrastructure. I would never expect  that the world's most valuable companies would be the pipes in the  people's homes. The magic of the internet is the content. That is what  drives the desire for broadband access. And, of course, there are other  ways that people can access the internet, but broadband and cable have  a technical advantage on price and speed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Capuano).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire if the gentleman has  any remaining speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is no surprise that nobody wants to come to the floor and talk in  favor of this bill because it is such an awful bill. This bill would  allow your broadband provider of internet services to sell all of your  personal information.   So, again, the other side is trying to conflate two entirely  different things. When you do a transaction within an e-commerce site  or search site, you are agreeing to their terms of service, and you are  engaging in a discrete transaction, and the information that you enter  is subject to their terms of use--completely appropriate. A competitor  is only a click away.   Whether there are any monopolistic content providers is a different  matter for a different day, and a different Federal agency--the FTC.  What we are talking about here is the access piece, the broadband  access piece. They actually, through the pipes, get to see all of the  information that is entered that you see: every email; all of your  credit card information; if you use the internet for any personal  medical research, all of your personal medical research; your kids'  information, everything your kids and minors in the family do. And what  this bill says is: you don't have to require people to opt in to have  their information used.   Consumers should be in control of their own information. They  shouldn't be forced to sell and give that information to who knows who  simply for the price of admission for access to the internet.   Again, we all want there to be a reasonable capital return on  infrastructure and on broadband. That is something we can agree on. If  there is a case to be made that we can do better in providing an  economic return to encourage rural broadband, I am for it. I know many  of my colleagues on the other side would be for it. Let's do it.   What we don't want to do in that process is turn over the entire  value chain of the internet to the infrastructure and provider side,  rather than the dynamic innovative content and e-commerce side.   I would like to read an excerpt from two letters from groups who are  opposed to this bill. The first is a coalition of 19 media, justice,  consumer protection, civil liberties, and privacy groups.   Their concern that: ``Without these rules, ISPs could use and  disclose customer information at will. The result could be extensive  harm caused by breaches or misuse of data.''   They remind us that: ``The FCC's order simply restores people's  control over their personal information and lets them choose the terms  on which ISPs can use it, share it, or sell it.''   Consumers should be in control of their own information.   The second letter is from Consumers Union, the policy arm of Consumer  Reports. They say, in part, that this bill ``would strip consumers of  their privacy rights and . . . leave them with no protections at all.''   I include in the Record those two letters, Mr. Speaker.                                                   January 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Senator McConnell, Representative       Pelosi, and Senator Schumer: The undersigned media justice,       consumer protection, civil liberties, and privacy groups       strongly urge you to oppose the use of the Congressional       Review Act (CRA) to adopt a Resolution of Disapproval       overturning the FCC's broadband privacy order. That order       implements the mandates in Section 222 of the 1996       Telecommunications Act, which an overwhelming, bipartisan       majority of Congress enacted to protect telecommunications       users' privacy. The cable, telecom, wireless, and advertising       lobbies request for CRA intervention is just another industry       attempt to overturn rules that empower users and give them a       say in how their private information may be used.        Not satisfied with trying to appeal the rules of the       agency, industry lobbyists have asked Congress to punish       internet users by way of restraining the FCC, when all the       agency did was implement Congress' own directive in the 1996       Act. This irresponsible, scorched-earth tactic is as harmful       as it is hypocritical. If Congress were to take the industry       up on its request, a Resolution of Disapproval could exempt       internet service providers (ISPs) from any and all privacy       rules at the FCC. As you know, a successful CRA on the       privacy rules could preclude the FCC from promulgating any       ``substantially similar'' regulations in the future--in       direct conflict with Congress' clear intention in Section 222       that telecommunications carriers protect their customers'       privacy. It could also preclude the FCC from addressing any       of the other issues in the privacy order like requiring data       breach notification and from revisiting these issues as       technology continues to evolve in the future. The true       consequences of this revoked authority are apparent when       considering the ISPs' other efforts to undermine the rules.       Without these rules, ISPs could use and disclose customer       information at will. The result could be extensive harm       caused by breaches or misuse of data.        Broadband ISPs, by virtue of their position as gatekeepers       to everything on the internet, have a largely unencumbered       view into their customers' online communications. That       includes the websites they visit, the videos they watch, and       the messages they send. Even when that traffic is encrypted,       ISPs can gather vast troves of valuable information on their       users' habits; but researchers have shown that much of the       most sensitive information remains unencrypted.        The FCC's order simply restores people's control over their       personal information and lets them choose the terms on which       ISPs can use it, share it, or sell it. Americans are       increasingly concerned about their privacy, and in some cases       have begun to censor their online activity for fear their       personal information may be compromised. Consumers have       repeatedly expressed their desire for more privacy       protections and their belief that the government helps ensure       those protections are met. The FCC's rules give broadband       customers confidence that their privacy and choices will be       honored, but it does not in any way ban ISPs' ability to       market to users who opt-in to receive any such targeted       offers.        The ISPs' overreaction to the FCC's broadband privacy rules       has been remarkable. Their supposed concerns about the rule       are significantly overblown. Some broadband providers and       trade associations inaccurately suggest that this rule is a       full ban on data use and disclosure by ISPs, and from there       complain that it will hamstring ISPs' ability to compete with       other large advertising companies and platforms like Google       and Facebook. To the contrary, ISPs can and likely will       continue to be able to benefit from use and sharing of their       customers' data, so long as those customers consent to such       uses. The rules merely require the ISPs to obtain that       informed consent.        The ISPs and their trade associations already have several       petitions for reconsideration of the privacy rules before the       FCC. Their petitions argue that the FCC should either adopt a       ``Federal Trade Commission style'' approach to broadband       privacy, or that it should retreat from the field and its       statutory duty in favor of the Federal Trade Commission       itself. All of these suggestions are fatally flawed. Not only       is the FCC well positioned to continue in its statutorily       mandated role as the privacy watchdog for broadband telecom       customers, it is the only agency able to do so. As the 9th       Circuit recently decided in a case brought by AT&T, common       carriers are entirely exempt from FTC jurisdiction, meaning       that presently there is no privacy replacement for broadband       customers waiting at the FTC if Congress disapproves the       FCC's rules here.        This lays bare the true intent of these industry groups,       who also went to the FCC asking for fine-tuning and       reconsideration of the rules before they sent their CRA       request. These groups now ask Congress to create a vacuum and       to give ISPs carte blanche, with no privacy rules or       enforcement in place. Without clear rules of the road under       Section 222, broadband users will have no certainty about how       their private information can be used and no protection       against its abuse. ISPs could and would use and disclose       consumer information at will, leading to extensive harm       caused by breaches and by misuse of data properly belonging       to consumers.        Congress told the FCC in 1996 to ensure that       telecommunications carriers protect the information they       collect about their customers. Industry groups now ask       Congress to ignore the mandates in the Communications Act,       enacted with strong bipartisan support, and overturn the       FCC's attempts to implement Congress's word. The CRA is a       blunt instrument and it is inappropriate in this instance,       where rules clearly benefit internet users notwithstanding       ISPs' disagreement with them.  [[Page H2484]]         We strongly urge you to oppose any resolution of       disapproval that would overturn the FCC's broadband privacy       rule.

House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: Consumers Union, the policy and       mobilization arm of Consumer Reports, writes regarding House       consideration of S.J. Res. 34, approved by a 50-48 party line       vote in the Senate last week.        This resolution, if passed by the House and signed into law       by President, would use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to       nullify the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) newly-      enacted broadband privacy rules that give consumers better       control over their data. Many Senators cited ``consumer       confusion'' as a reason to do away with the FCC's privacy       rules, but we have seen no evidence proving this assertion       and fail to understand how taking away increased privacy       protections eliminates confusion. Therefore, we strongly       oppose passage of this resolution--it would strip consumers       of their privacy rights and, as we explain below, leave them       with no protections at all. We urge you to vote no on S.J.       Res. 34.        The FCC made history last October when it adopted consumer-      friendly privacy rules that give consumers more control over       how their information is collected by internet service       providers (ISPs). Said another way, these rules permit       consumers to decide when an ISP can collect a treasure trove       of consumer information, whether it is a web browsing history       or the apps a consumer may have on a smartphone. We believe       the rules are simple, reasonable, and straightforward.        ISPs, by virtue of their position as gatekeepers to       everything on the internet, enjoy a unique window into       consumers' online activities. Data including websites       consumers visit, videos viewed, and messages sent is very       valuable. Small wonder, then, that ISPs are working so hard       to have the FCC's new privacy rules thrown out through use of       the Congressional Review Act. But we should make no mistake:       abandoning the FCC's new privacy rules is about what benefits       big cable companies and not about what is best for consumers.        Many argue the FCC should have the same privacy rules as       those of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). FCC Chairman       Ajit Pai went so far as to say ``jurisdiction over broadband       providers' privacy and data security practices should be       returned to the FTC, the nation's expert agency with respect       to these important subjects,'' even though the FTC currently       possesses no jurisdiction over the vast majority of ISPs       thanks to the common carrier exemption--an exemption made       stricter by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in last year's       AT&T Mobility case. We have heard this flawed logic time and       time again as one of the principal arguments for getting rid       of the FCC's strong privacy rules. Unfortunately, this is       such a poor solution that it amounts to no solution at all.        For the FTC to regain jurisdiction over the privacy       practices of ISPs, the FCC would first have to scrap Title II       reclassification--not an easy task which would be both time-      consuming and subject to judicial review, and jeopardize the       legal grounding of the 2015 Open Internet Order. Congress, in       turn, would have to pass legislation to remove the common       carrier exemption, thus granting the FTC jurisdiction over       those ISPs who are common carriers. We are skeptical Congress       would take such an action. Finally, the FTC does not enjoy       the same robust rulemaking authority that the FCC does. As a       result, consumers would have to wait for something bad to       happen before the FTC would step in to remedy a violation of       privacy rights. Any fondness for the FTC's approach to       privacy is merely support for dramatically weaker privacy       protections favored by most corporations.        There is no question that consumers favor the FCC's current       broadband privacy rules. Consumers Union launched an online       petition drive last month in support of the Commission's       strong rules. To date, close to 50,000 consumers have signed       the petition and the number is growing. Last week, more than       24,000 consumers contacted their Senators urging them to       oppose the CRA resolution in the 24 hours leading up to the       vote. Consumers care about privacy and want the strong       privacy protections afforded to the them by the FCC. Any       removal or watering down of those rules would represent the       destruction of simple privacy protections for consumers.        Even worse, if this resolution is passed, using the       Congressional Review Act here will prevent the FCC from       adopting privacy rules--even weaker ones--to protect       consumers in the future. Under the CRA, once a rule is       erased, an agency cannot move forward with any       ``substantially similar'' rule unless Congress enacts new       legislation specifically authorizing it. Among other impacts,       this means a bare majority in the Senate can void a rule, but       then restoration of that rule is subject to full legislative       process, including a filibuster. The CRA is a blunt       instrument--and if used in this context, blatantly anti-      consumer.        We are more than willing to work with you and your fellow       Representatives to craft privacy legislation that affords       consumer effective and easy-to-understand protections. The       FCC made a step in that direction when it adopted the       broadband privacy rules last year, and getting rid of them       via the Congressional Review Act is a step back, not forward.       Therefore, we encourage you to vote no on S.J. Res. 34.            Respectfully,      Laura MacCleery,        Vice President, Consumer Policy & Mobilization, Consumer       Reports.      Jonathan Schwantes,        Senior Policy Counsel, Consumers Union.      Katie McInnis,        Policy Counsel, Consumers Union.     I also include in the Record an op-ed that I had the  opportunity to publish last week on this topic. My piece is entitled  ``Why Americans should be worried about their online broadband  privacy,'' talking about this very bill that Congress has the tenacity  to try to bring to the floor under this rule to force the most personal  information pieces of information about every aspect of your internet  behavior, and that of your family members, to be given to the broadband  provider to do whatever they want with.                 [From the Huffington Post, March 22, 2017]   Why Americans Should Be Worried About Their Online, Broadband Privacy                              (By Jared Polis)         Over the last couple of months, the dialogue surrounding       government surveillance and consumer privacy has shifted in a       troubling direction. While news outlets are covering       everything from false claims of wiretaps to outlandish claims       of reconnaissance microwaves, Republicans are quietly taking       real and dramatic steps to protect corporate profits at the       cost of your privacy. A few weeks ago, Senator Jeff Flake (R-      Ariz.) and Representative Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) filed       bills in both the House of Representatives and the Senate       that, if passed, will permanently eliminate broadband users'       privacy protections, affecting nearly everyone who uses the       Internet.        The legislation allows broadband providers to access and       sell consumers' information without their permission. As our       gateway to the Internet, Broadband Internet Service       Providers--commonly referred to as ISPs--have access to a       wealth of personal information, from our physical location to       our shopping habits and the medical issues we research--can       reveal potentially sensitive details about our personal       lives.        Every search, every website visited, every article read       online, see how often you log into and use your various       online accounts and even, in some cases, collect your       location. Think about what someone could conclude from this       information about you--your overall health, risk activity,       political affiliation, preferences. What could they do with       that information? Could they change pricing of goods and       services depending on your income and past purchasing       behaviors? Could you face challenges obtaining insurance due       to perceptions on your health or risk behavior based on your       search activity? This rule change will literally allow       broadband providers to have access to your entire personal       life on a network and sell it.        After years of advocating for further consumer protections,       in October 2016, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)       took a responsible and commonsense step to establish       broadband privacy protections--but only months later       Republicans are trying to roll back the progress made and       repeal the existing rules, fighting alongside corporate       broadband providers.        The legislation is unnecessary, as the FCC has already       taken steps to review the rules, pausing implementation to       conduct a careful examination of the complexities of       implementation. The Republican legislation, would stop this       process, bypass public comment, and eliminate the privacy       protections permanently and irrevocably.        That is why I am drawing attention to this critical issue,       before it's too late.     Like these groups, I also believe that privacy is worth  defending. In the wrong hands, information can be damaging and used for  the wrong reasons.   Simply put, this bill is about conveying the value of the internet to  the infrastructure side rather than the content side. And rather than  finding common ground to establish reasonable ROI for broadband and  internet investments, this bill would hurt the entire internet  ecosystem by breaking down the trust between consumers and service  providers.   What they are really trying to do here is shift the reasonable burden  for cybersecurity measures from the internet servers onto consumers. At  the  [[Page H2485]]  same time, they want to eliminate the requirements of cybersecurity  measures, even notify consumers of violations, and they want to collect  more and more consumer data without any protections to do what they  want with.   Supporting this bill would make each and every user of the internet  vulnerable to violations of our privacy and vulnerable to cybersecurity  threats without even receiving notifications of when our own intimate  information, like credit card numbers, is compromised.   The FCC took a responsible, deliberate, and commonsense step to  establish broadband privacy protections in October 2016. If they need  to be tweaked or changed, let's have a process to do that. This bill is  not that process. It not only undoes those privacy protections but  prevents the FCC from ever issuing a rule that has those privacy  protections in it.   Mr. Speaker, if passed, this bill would be an irrevocable step in the  wrong direction. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule and  the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
