 Madam Speaker, I am here today to honor an outstanding  member of south Jersey.   Recently in Vineland, New Jersey, we celebrated the naming of  Sergeant Dominick Pilla Middle School. Sergeant Pilla was a brave soul  who loved this country enough to enlist in the Army to serve to protect  it.   Tragically, he was killed while saving a fellow soldier in Somalia  during the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993 and was posthumously awarded the  Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.   The naming of this school is to honor Sergeant Pilla's love and  sacrifice for  [[Page H3187]]  his country. Now he will be remembered by every student who walks  through those halls. He will be honored by these students as they grow  and learn to dedicate themselves to do what they do and love the way  that Sergeant Pilla did.   I thank Sergeant Dominick Pilla for his service.   To all of the men and all of the women in the Armed Forces who serve  our country so bravely and so selflessly, may God bless them.                            ____________________
