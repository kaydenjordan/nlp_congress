 Mr. President, fraudulent and abusive phone scams plague  thousands of Americans each year. These deceitful practices cause  serious financial harm to victims, and have even led to tragedy in a  few cases. Both the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,  where I serve as Ranking Member, and the Special Committee on Aging,  where I previously served as Chairman, have explored the continuing  severe impact of these scams. Consumers continue to lose millions of  dollars each year to fraudulent phone scams, many of which originate  from other countries. And the impacts of these scams are very real to  the consumers who suffer. According to an October 2015 press report  from CNN, one poor soul took his life earlier that year after being  tricked into spending thousands of dollars in a vain attempt to collect  on his winnings in the Jamaican lottery--winnings that were non- existent because it was all a scam perpetrated by phone-based  fraudsters.   Nearly all of us have trained ourselves to ignore phone calls and  text messages from numbers that are not familiar to us. But these  sophisticated scammers know that--and have changed their tactics.  Scammers today impersonate government institutions, promote fraudulent  lottery schemes, and tailor their calls to individuals in order to  coerce victims into paying large sums of money. Many scammers use  spoofing technology to manipulate caller ID information and trick  consumers into believing that these calls are local or come from  trusted institutions.   In 2009, I introduced the Truth in Caller ID Act to prohibit caller  ID spoofing when it is used to defraud or harm consumers. That law  provided important tools for law enforcement and the Federal  Communications Commission, FCC, to go after fraudsters and crack down  on these phone scams. I was pleased when my Congressional colleagues  joined with me to pass that legislation and the President signed it  into law. This was a huge win for consumers and the first step toward  ending these abusive practices.   Recognizing the pace at which phone scam technologies evolve, the law  directed the FCC to prepare a report to Congress outlining what  additional tools were needed to curb other forms of spoofing. In 2011,  the agency provided its recommendations to Congress on how to update  the law to keep pace with new spoofing practices, such as text  messaging scams.   The bill Senators Fischer, Klobuchar, Blunt and I have introduced  today responds to the FCC's recommendations and builds on the 2010 Act  to ensure the law keeps up with these spoofing scams. As these scams  become increasingly sophisticated, we need to make sure that consumer  protections and tools for law enforcement  [[Page S318]]  keep up. That is why this legislation is so important.   The Spoofing Prevention Act of 2017 would extend the current  prohibition on caller ID spoofing to text messages, calls coming from  outside the United States, and calls from all forms of Voice over  Internet Protocol services.   Additionally, for the first time, this bill would ensure consumers  have access to information on a centralized FCC website about current  technologies and other tools available to protect themselves against  spoofing scams.   Finally, the Act directs the Government Accountability Office, GAO,  to conduct a study to assess government and private sector work being  done to curb spoofing scams, as well as what new measures, including  technological solutions, could be taken to prevent spoofed calls from  the start. I know industry, in cooperation with the FCC through its  Robocall Strike Force, already is making great strides in this area,  and I would expect the GAO to review that work closely.   I urge my colleagues to join Senators Fischer, Klobuchar, Blunt, and  me in supporting the Spoofing Prevention Act of 2016 to ensure that law  enforcement and consumers have the updated tools they need to protect  against this fraudulent activity. And make no mistake, I will press the  FCC to continue to use its full authority under the Truth in Caller ID  Act to stop these scams, including consideration of technical  solutions--like call authentication--to protect consumers.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 134         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
