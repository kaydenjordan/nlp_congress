 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, after listening to all  that I have heard this evening, I still have the faith and belief that  we can come together as a unit.   I was reading my Bible the other day and saw that it said: Come and  let us reason together. Otherwise, we shall all be destroyed by the  edge of the sword.   I say to my colleagues: Let's reason together. You cannot erase truth  with a lie. You cannot pretend that what has happened did not happen.  Yes, we ought to have a President, but it is time for this one to go.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this resolution and agree  wholeheartedly.
