 Mr. President, we stand today on the precipice of the most  sweeping change to our Nation's tax system in over 30 years. This is a  historic moment, as this distinguished body begins final consideration  of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act--tax reform that will help boost America's  economy, create more jobs, and leave more money in people's paychecks.   The last time we considered tax reform similar to this magnitude was  1986. To help remind us how much our country, its economy, and the  people have changed since that time, let's review some of the events of  that year.   In 1986, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 1,895--sure that  20,000 would never be broken, and it wasn't until after the last  election. It now stands at over 24,000.   A gallon of gas cost just 89 cents. Today it is close to $2.50. We  still used land lines to phone our loved ones. Iconic movies such as  ``Top Gun'' and ``Aliens'' opened. Americans were watching TV shows  like ``Dynasty'' and ``Hill Street Blues.'' The Associated Press chose  NBA star Larry Bird as one of the Athletes of the Year.   President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Tax Reform Act of 1986,  which ushered in deep tax rate cuts for American families and an  overhaul of our complicated Tax Code. When he signed the bill, Reagan  commented on the length of the journey and noted that some people  thought it would never happen.   Today, too, some have asserted that tax reform either cannot or  should not happen, but as our strongly optimistic President said in  1986--and as I continue to believe--the American people ``haven't made  this the freest country and the mightiest economic force on this planet  by shrinking from challenges.'' Reagan noted:         This country was founded on faith in the individual, not       groups or classes, but faith in resources and bounty of each       and every separate human soul. Our Founding Fathers designed       a Democratic form of government to enlist the individual's       energies.    For that reason, I want to remind my colleagues about the hard work  that brought us here. It is a journey that has been years in the making  under the leadership of both sides of the aisle. It is one we started  and will finish for the benefit of the American people and the health  of the U.S. economy.   I am proud of the work of the Finance and Budget Committees, and I  have had the honor to play a role with both. The Finance Committee held  more than 70 hearings on how the Tax Code can be improved and  streamlined to work better for all Americans.   Almost 3 years ago, Finance Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden  convened bipartisan tax reform working groups to analyze challenges of  our outdated Tax Code and develop policy recommendations for  comprehensive tax reform. The conclusions reached by these groups  helped identify the issues for reform and shape the contours of the  legislation we are considering now. It is worth noting that the entire  fiscal year 2018 budget reconciliation process has been open,  transparent, and subject to regular order, starting with the passage of  the Senate budget resolution.   The Senate Budget Committee marked up the bill over 2 days and  accepted amendments from both sides of the aisle to make the resolution  stronger. In fact, for the first time ever, the minority received a  copy of the chairman's budget document 5 days prior to the start of the  markup. According to many of my colleagues, it was one of the most  transparent budget resolution markups in history.   The budget resolution--complete with the document reconciliation  instructions--was then debated on the floor. This was an open floor  process that allowed every Senator the opportunity to offer and vote on  amendments to improve the resolution before its final passage.   Last month, the Senate Finance Committee held a 4-day markup before  approving tax reform legislation designed to modernize our Tax Code.  The markup lasted 23 hours and 34 minutes over the course of those 4  days. Of the more than 350 amendments filed, 69 were considered in  committee. Amendments offered by both Democrats and Republicans were  adopted.    Since then, both Chambers of Congress have passed similar versions of  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and over the past 2 weeks, conferees worked  tirelessly to resolve and bridge the differences between the two bills  and  [[Page S8089]]  come to an agreement on a final piece of legislation.   In this Chamber, the legislation reflects the outstanding work and  leadership of Finance Chairman Hatch and Energy Committee Chairman  Murkowski in developing legislative recommendations that adhere to the  budget resolution's reconciliation instructions, and I thank them for  their efforts.   I also thank my Senate colleagues who earlier this month supported  the Senate passage of the Tax Cuts and Job Act and whose advice and  consent during the conference has shaped the final bill. The  legislation is truly a reflection of the broad range and consensus of  Members who engaged with this process.   Throughout my work on this bill, I have carried with me the many  lessons I have learned from when I owned and operated a small business  or when I worked as an accountant. I have been led by one singular  purpose, to help improve the lives of millions of hard-working American  families, especially the residents of my own State of Wyoming.   I am pleased with the outcome of our work because I believe it  includes meaningful changes that will help individuals and families  struggling to move up the economic ladder. The tax plan includes  reforms that will help grow the economy, that will create more jobs,  and that will simplify taxes. It provides American workers and families  with an across-the-board tax cut and puts more money in people's  pockets. It lets Americans have a greater say as to how to use their  hard-earned money. The changes will help small businesses in our  communities thrive and encourage the largest multinational companies to  remain in the United States, investing profits here instead of  overseas--not a bad wish list for Santa.   Under the plan, Americans will reap tax savings from reduced tax  rates, tax savings from a higher standard deduction, which creates a  larger zero tax bracket for low-income individuals and increases many  people's tax refunds. It also includes a child tax credit that doubles  in size to $2,000 to help struggling families and all this while  preserving important deductions for medical expenses, charities,  homeowners, and State and local taxes. Our farmers and ranchers will  receive stronger protections from the reach of the death tax to help  them more easily pass on their businesses to future generations-- eliminating a double taxation.   Businesses small and large will benefit from a range of tax breaks,  including lower tax rates, expanded opportunities to expense the  purchase of capital assets, a new 20-percent deduction for many  unincorporated businesses, and international tax reforms to give the  U.S.-headquartered global companies a strong competitive footing in the  global marketplace. These are changes you can take to the bank.   Now it is time for us to act. It is time for us to modernize our  outdated Tax Code so our Nation can remain competitive in the 21st  century economy. The code, as it now stands, hurts American workers and  hampers economic growth.   Along with reforms to the code, this bill will also promote economic  growth. For too long, some have accepted the presumption of a U.S.  economy that will not grow as strongly as it has in the past. As a  supporter of this bill, I reject that false narrative.   Better tax policy will boost the value of everything we produce, and  this will mean more revenue for the Federal Government. I am tired of  the accusations that Republican budget hawks--and that definitely  includes me--are willing to throw in the towel and accept a $1.5  trillion deficit over the next 10 years. I am still a deficit hawk.  Here is why. Claims to the contrary that this bill will go unpaid for  are based on an incomplete analysis of the tax bill.   We have a Congressional Budget Office tasked with impartially  evaluating any legislation we do. Unfortunately, its evaluations are  tied to static scoring. That means it is evaluated without considering  the underlying economic effects of these changes. Let me repeat that.  The Congressional Budget Office is tied to static scoring. That means  it is evaluated without considering the underlying economic effects of  these changes.   The problem really isn't how much revenue we will have under the new  bill. I believe it will increase revenue as the tax cut did in the  1980s. The problem is spending. We never make budget cuts. In  Washington, a cut in the budget brings screams if an agency or program  doesn't get as much as it requested, even if it gets more than it ever  had before. That is not a budget cut, but that is how it works in  Washington. If we continue this way, we will not ever get our spending  in line.   For years, I have tried to institute the Penny Plan, where we just  cut one penny in real cuts from where we have been. It gets lip service  but not votes. It is a lot easier to give away money than it is to take  away money, even pennies. So we need a new approach. We need to grow  the economy. We need businesses to do well so more tax money will come  in. We need individuals to make more so more tax money will come in.  That has been done before with tax cuts. Unfortunately, when the tax  cuts performed to provide more revenue, we spent twice what we brought  in.   So here is what I have done as Budget chairman. A good economy brings  in more tax money. Our economy has been limping along. Last year, it  grew at a mere 1.6 percent GDP--which is private sector growth, not  government growth. The norm for the United States is 3.2 percent  private sector growth--not like we saw during the past 8 years when  this growth remained below 3 percent. In fact, since this President got  elected, the growth has been 3.2 percent already. In the fourth quarter  of 2017, we may almost hit 4 percent. There is a lot of hope in  America. Every tenth-of-a-percent increase in GDP brings in $273  billion in taxes over 10 years. If we could raise that anemic 1.9  percent to a mere 2.4 percent GDP, we can recover the deficit effect of  the tax cuts. If we can bring up the productivity in the private  sector--the GDP--to its norm of 3.2 percent, we will pay down  significant debt over the 10-year window.   The Council of Economic Advisers and some 130 economists have agreed  with me. They say the balancing point of 2.4 percent is way too low,  and 3.2 percent GDP is much more reasonable. Some even predict 4  percent growth to our economy. That is how you can be a deficit hawk  and cut taxes. You just have to bet America can do better. Actually, we  are just betting that we can be as good as we used to be. Our American  spirit should say: ``We can do a lot better than that.''   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help our economy expand. It will  provide tax relief to hard-working Americans and make changes to our  Tax Code that businesses large and small need to boost the economy and  create jobs.   Ultimately, we know increased revenues alone are not going to solve  our long-term budget and debt problems because Washington's real  problem isn't revenue; Washington has a spending problem.   I urge my colleagues today to finish the task before us. Let's pass  this bill to make critical and long overdue changes to our Tax Code  that will jump-start our economy. Our country needs it, hard-working  American families need it, and they deserve to have the opportunity to  make more choices about how their hard-earned money should be used.   In closing, I again remind my colleagues of the words of President  Reagan:         Let's not let this magnificent moment slip away. Tax relief       is in sight. Let's make it a reality. . . . We can do it. And       if you help, we will do it this year.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget  resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act and  applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the conference report to  accompany H.R. 1, and I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The waiver is debatable for 1 hour, equally  divided.   Who yields time?   If no one yields time, the time will be equally divided.   The Senator from Alaska.    Mr. President, I yield back all remaining time for the  majority.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican time is yielded back.   The Senator from Oregon.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 3003 of H. Con. Res. 71, the  concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, allows the  chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations,  aggregates, and levels in the budget resolution for legislation  considered under the resolution's reconciliation instructions.   I find that the conference report to accompany H.R. 1 fulfills the  conditions found in section 3003 of H. Con. Res. 71. Accordingly, I am  revising the allocations to the Committee on Finance, the Committee on  Energy and Natural Resources, and other enforceable budgetary levels to  account for the budgetary effects of the amendment.   This adjustment supersedes the adjustment I previously made for S.  Amdt. 1855 on December 1, 2017.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.
