 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4981) to amend the Fentanyl Sanctions Act, to modify certain  deadlines relating to the Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid  Trafficking.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4981         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN DEADLINES FOR COMMISSION                     ON COMBATING SYNTHETIC OPIOID TRAFFICKING.         Section 7221(f)(2) of the Fentanyl Sanctions Act (133 Stat.       2273) is amended by striking ``270 days'' and inserting ``390       days''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4981.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4981, a bill to modify  certain deadlines relating to the Commission on Combating Synthetic  Opioid Trafficking.   I want to thank my colleague and friend, Mr. Trone from Maryland, for  authoring this bipartisan bill. Mr. Trone has been an invaluable voice  in Congress for combating our country's opioid crisis. Far too many  families in my community, Pennsylvania's greater Lehigh Valley, have  endured indescribable heartbreak and loss as a result of this crisis.   When I first started serving in Congress back in 2018, I made a  solemn commitment that I would do everything within my power to end the  devastation of the opioid crisis once and for all. I am dedicated to  keeping that promise.   Earlier this year, I was proud to see Mr. Trone elected as Democratic  co-chairman of the Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid  Trafficking. Mr. Trone, working alongside his co-chair, Senator Tom  Cotton, in a bipartisan manner is developing a strategic approach to  combat the flow of synthetic opioids into the United States.   Last year, the Centers for Disease Control released data indicating  that the surge in overdose deaths from 2018 to 2019 was the greatest  year-over-year increase. Tragically, far too many Americans have  witnessed the horrific effects of this opioid crisis.   Just as we must also take on the greed of the pharmaceutical  industry--which has done a great deal to lead us to this point  domestically when it comes to the opioid crisis writ large--most of the  fentanyl consumed in the United States is manufactured outside of the  country, so it is crucial that we engage closely with our international  partners to address this scourge. The Commission on Combating Synthetic  Opioid Trafficking aims to do just that.   Synthetic drugs, unlike plant-based drugs such as cocaine or heroin,  are not limited by climate-growing restrictions. Any country can  produce synthetic drugs, and according to a January 2020 Drug  Enforcement Administration report, this may lead to a rapidly  diversifying list of synthetic drug-producing countries and suppliers.   With such an imposing task ahead of us, strong, bipartisan  cooperation is critical. We must work together to do what is right and  find a solution that can help save countless American lives.   This bill will amend the Fentanyl Sanctions Act to extend the amount  of time granted to the Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid  Trafficking. The commission was originally slated to start in 2020 but  could not get underway until March of this year. It is incumbent upon  us to do everything we can to get this right.   I thank Mr. Trone again for being a strong champion for bipartisan  collaboration in the fight against opioid abuse.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Trone), the author of this bill and a champion in  combating the opioid crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   According to the National Institutes of Health, in 2018, 128 people  died each day from opioid overdoses. We must not lose sight of the  devastating toll these drugs are taking on our country. We need to  tackle the opioid crisis from every angle. I am hopeful that passing  this bill will take us one step closer to ending this epidemic.   I again thank Mr. Trone for authoring this important legislation. I  urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4981, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4250) to amend the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956  to provide for rewards for the arrest or conviction of certain foreign  nationals who have committed genocide or war crimes, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4250         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``War Crimes Rewards Expansion       Act''.       SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF STATE REWARDS PROGRAM.         Paragraph (10) of section 36(b) of the State Department       Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2708(b)) is amended       by striking ``defined under the statute of such tribunal;''       and inserting the following: ``defined under--        ``(A) the statute of such country or tribunal, as the case       may be; or        ``(B) United States law;''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4250.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 4250, the War Crimes Rewards  Expansion Act, authored by Representative Foxx.   The bill broadens the State Department rewards program for  individuals or whistleblowers who come forward with and provide  information on genocide or war crimes. It clarifies that the rewards  can also be provided for prosecutions that fall under domestic law,  including American law or the law of another nation, in addition to  international law.   We have seen, time and again, that whistleblower programs are the  most effective type of compliance mechanism, and the State Department  rewards program itself is a proven tool for bringing the perpetrators  of atrocities to justice.   The United States must continue to demonstrate that we are steadfast  in our commitment to holding war criminals accountable and that the  mechanisms we have in place to bring about their arrest are flexible  and robust.   This bill is straightforward. By expanding the scope of what rewards  can be paid for information, we will incentivize more individuals to  come forward and gain more information with which to find and prosecute  these criminals.   This legislation has passed the House in previous Congresses, and we  hope  [[Page H5483]]  this bill can make it across the finish line this time around.   This is an important measure. I support it, and I urge my colleagues  to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mrs. KIM of CALIFORNIA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mrs. KIM of CALIFORNIA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   The Department of State's rewards program serves an important purpose  by turning the tables on dangerous foreign terrorists and human rights  violators so they face the justice they so rightly deserve.   I want to thank Dr. Foxx for her work on this bill and Chairman Meeks  for bringing this bill to the floor and giving us the opportunity to  clarify this important authority.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, the War Crimes Rewards Expansion Act would broaden the  State Department's rewards program by clarifying that rewards can also  be provided for prosecutions that fall under domestic law, whether it  be American law or the law of another nation. This would further  incentivize individuals to come forward with valuable information,  leading to the arrest and prosecution of some of the worst perpetrators  of human rights abuses and war crimes.   I thank Representative Foxx for authoring this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1228) to advance a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Libya  and support the people of Libya, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1228         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

TITLE IV--DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS  Sec. 401. Determination of budgetary effects.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The stability and territorial unity of Libya is       critical to the security of the United States, Europe, North       Africa, and the Sahel, as well as maritime routes in the       southern Mediterranean Sea.        (2) United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) has identified       containing instability in Libya as one of its six main lines       of effort in Africa and works to support diplomatic efforts       to reconstitute the Libyan State and to disrupt terrorist       organizations that impede that process or threaten United       States interests.        (3) According to the Defense Intelligence Agency, the       Islamic State in Libya (ISIS-Libya) is ``degraded''. However,       AFRICOM continues to ``keep pressure on ISIS and other       violent extremist organizations as they seek to take       advantage of the security vacuum created by the civil war in       Libya''.        (4) According to the United Nations, since April 2019, the       conflict in Libya has led to the deaths of more than 500       civilians and the displacement of more than 200,000 people.        (5) Parties to the conflict in Libya have killed civilians,       committed torture and abuse, committed mass extrajudicial       killings, requisitioned the houses of civilians, targeted       medical facilities, and blocked humanitarian access to food,       health, and other life-saving services, worsening       humanitarian conditions.        (6) According to the United Nations, as of November 2020,       more than 574,000 migrants and refugees remained in Libya and       the ``continued arbitrary detention of migrants and refugees       in formal detention centers and at informal smuggler sites       remains a critical concern in Libya''. Migrants and refugees,       including women and children, are routinely subjected to       discrimination, arrest, arbitrary detention, torture and       other human rights violations and abuses. The United Nations       has called for the immediate release, evacuation, and       protection of refugees and migrants detained in conflict       zones.        (7) In November 2019, the Government of the National Accord       (GNA) and the Government of Turkey signed a Memorandum of       Understanding on maritime boundaries in the Mediterranean       Sea.        (8) The Department of State's 2020 Trafficking in Persons       Report states with regard to Libya ``Trafficking victims--      including men, women, and children--are highly vulnerable to       extreme violence and other human rights violations in Libya       by governmental and non-state armed groups, including:       physical, sexual, and verbal assault; abduction for ransom;       extortion; arbitrary killings; inhumane detention; and child       soldiering. . ..Migrants in Libya are extremely vulnerable to       sex and labor trafficking [and . . .] are vulnerable to       exploitation by state and non-state actors, including       employers who refuse to pay laborers' wages.''.        (9) A November 2020 Department of Defense Inspector General       report estimated there are approximately 2,000 mercenary       forces affiliated with the Wagner Group, a Russian private       military company, as well as approximately 2,000 Russian-      backed Syrian fighters, advanced equipment, and advanced       capabilities supporting Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army       (LNA) and Russian objectives in North Africa.        (10) The most recent AFRICOM posture statement claims,       ``Russia continues to harvest benefits from the instability       in Libya--its military meddling has prolonged the conflict       and exacerbated casualties and humanitarian suffering.''.        (11) The Department of Defense Inspector General reported       that, ``Turkey has hundreds of regular military personnel       deployed to Libya in order to train GNA-aligned militias and       to operate Turkish military equipment'' and sent thousands of       Syrian mercenaries to Libya in support of the GNA.        (12) On January 19, 2020, at a peace conference in Berlin,       representatives of the Governments of Algeria, China, Egypt,       France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey, the Republic of       Congo, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the       United States, as well as regional and multilateral       organizations, agreed to refrain from interference in Libya's       internal affairs, abide by the United Nations arms embargo,       and advance a 55-point communique to resolve the conflict in       Libya.        (13) On February 13, 2020, the United Nations Security       Council adopted Resolution 2510, which endorses the       Conclusions of the International Conference on Libya held in       Berlin, affirms the need for a lasting ceasefire, demands       full compliance by all member states with the United Nations       arms embargo, and expresses unequivocal support for the       United Nations Special Representative and the ongoing United       Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL)-facilitated intra-      Libyan dialogue.        (14) On October 23, 2020, the warring parties in Libya       agreed a ceasefire, which called for the withdrawal of all       armed forces from conflict lines and the departure of all       mercenaries and foreign fighters within three months, and was       hailed by United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres       as ``a fundamental step toward peace and stability in       Libya''.        (15) On January 19, 2021, United Nations Secretary General       Guterres recommended that regional and international powers       ensure the ``departure of all foreign fighters and       mercenaries from Libya and full and unconditional respect for       the Security Council arms embargo'' and urged the Security       Council to ``give UNSMIL a clear but flexible mandate to       enable the Mission to support the Libyan-led and Libyan-owned       ceasefire monitoring mechanism''.        (16) On January 21, 2021, the United States joined the       Governments of France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom       to remind all Berlin Conference participants of the need to       ``continue to support a ceasefire, restore full respect for       the UN arms embargo, and end the toxic foreign interference       that undermines the aspirations of all Libyans to reestablish       their sovereignty and choose their future peacefully through       national elections''.        (17) On March 11, 2021, the United States joined with       France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom to welcome       Libya's Government of National Unity and reiterate it will       ``have the primary tasks of organizing free and fair       elections on December 24, 2021, followed by a transfer of       authority to Libya's democratically chosen leaders''.        (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United       States--        (1) to advance a peaceful resolution to the conflict in       Libya through a United Nations-mediated Libyan-led and       Libyan-owned political process as the best way to secure       United States interests and to ensure the sovereignty,       independence, territorial integrity, and national unity of       Libya;        (2) to support the implementation of United Nations       Security Council Resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011),       which established an arms embargo on Libya, and subsequent       resolutions modifying and extending the embargo;        (3) to enforce Executive Order 13726 (81 Fed. Reg. 23559;       relating to blocking property and suspending entry into the       United States of persons contributing to the situation in       Libya (April 19, 2016)), designed to target individuals or       entities who ``threaten the peace, security, and stability of       Libya'';        (4) to oppose attacks on civilians, medical workers, and       critical infrastructure, including water supplies, in Libya,       and to support accountability for those engaged in such       heinous actions;        (5) to support Libya's sovereignty, independence,       territorial integrity, and national unity consistent with       United Nations Security Council Resolution 2510 (2020) and       all predecessor resolutions with respect to Libya, including       by--        (A) taking action to end the violence and flow of arms;        (B) rejecting attempts by any party to illicitly export       Libya's oil; and        (C) urging the withdrawal of foreign military and mercenary       forces;        (6) to leverage diplomatic relations to convince the       parties to the conflict in Libya to maintain the current       ceasefire and persuade foreign powers to stop providing       personnel, including mercenaries, weapons, and financing that       threaten to reignite the conflict;        (7) to support the Libyan Political Dialogue and advance       the inclusive Libyan-led and Libyan-owned political process,       including elections planned for December 2021;        (8) to support a negotiated and peaceful political solution       that includes a single, unified, inclusive, and effective       Libyan Government approved by the Libyan House of       Representatives, the end of a transitional period achieved       through free, fair, inclusive, and credible elections planned       for December 2021, a fair and transparent allocation of       resources, interim security arrangements, and a process for       the reunification of Libyan government ministries and Libyan       sovereign institutions, including the Central Bank of Libya,       the National Oil Corporation, and the Libyan Investment       Authority;        (9) to help protect Libya's civilian population and       implementing humanitarian and international organizations       from the risk of harm resulting from explosive hazards such       as landmines, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and       unexploded ordnance (UXO);        (10) to support constant, unimpeded, and reliable       humanitarian access to those in need and to hold accountable       those who impede or threaten the delivery of humanitarian       assistance;        (11) to seek to bring an end to severe forms of trafficking       in persons such as slavery, forced labor, and sexual       exploitation, including with respect to migrants;        (12) to advocate for the immediate release and safe       evacuations of detained refugees and migrants trapped by the       fighting in Libya;        (13) to encourage implementation of UNSMIL's plan for the       organized and gradual closure of migrant detention centers in       Libya;        (14) to support greater defense institutional capacity       building after a comprehensive political settlement;        (15) to support current and future democratic and economic       development; and  [[Page H5485]]         (16) to discourage all parties from heightening tensions in       the region, through unhelpful and provocative actions.           TITLE I--IDENTIFYING CHALLENGES TO STABILITY IN LIBYA       SEC. 101. REPORT ON ACTIVITIES OF CERTAIN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS                     AND ACTORS IN LIBYA.         (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in       consultation with the Director of National Intelligence,       shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a       report that includes--        (1) a description of the full extent of involvement in       Libya by foreign governments, including the Governments of       Russia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Sudan, Chad,       China, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, including--        (A) a description of which governments have been linked to       drone and aircraft strikes since April 2019;        (B) a list of the types and estimated amounts of equipment       transferred by each government described in this paragraph to       the parties to the conflict, including foreign military       contractors, mercenaries, or paramilitary forces operating in       Libya;        (C) an estimate of the financial support provided by each       government described in this paragraph to the parties to the       conflict, including foreign military contractors,       mercenaries, or paramilitary forces operating in Libya; and        (D) a description of the activities of any regular,       irregular, or paramilitary forces, including foreign military       contractors, mercenary groups, and militias operating inside       Libya, at the direction or with the consent of the       governments described in this paragraph;        (2) an analysis and determination of whether the actions by       the governments described in paragraph (1) violate the arms       embargo with respect to Libya under United Nations Security       Council Resolution 2473 (2019) and other relevant Security       Council resolutions;        (3) a list of the specific offending materiel or financial       support transfers provided by a government described in       paragraph (1) that--        (A) violate the arms embargo with respect to Libya under       United Nations Security Council Resolution 2473 (2019) and       other relevant Security Council resolutions;        (B) contribute to civilian death, harm, or other violations       of international humanitarian law; or        (C) involve weapons of United States origin or were in       violation of United States end user agreements;        (4) a description of the activities of affiliates of ISIS,       al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), and Ansar al-Sharia,       in Libya;        (5) a description of efforts by the European Union, North       Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the Arab League, and       their respective member states, to--        (A) enforce the arms embargo with respect to Libya under       United Nations Security Council Resolution 2473 (2019) and       other relevant Security Council resolutions;        (B) facilitate a ceasefire;        (C) monitor a ceasefire; and        (D) support forthcoming elections;        (6) a description of any violations of the arms embargo by       European Union member states; and        (7) a description of United States diplomatic engagement       with the European Union, NATO, and the Arab League regarding       enforcement of the United Nations arms embargo, ceasefire       monitoring, and election support.

SEC. 102. REPORT OF RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES AND OBJECTIVES IN                     LIBYA.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) General Stephen Townsend, Commander of United States       Africa Command (AFRICOM), warned in January 2020 that in       Libya, Russia seeks to ``demonstrate itself as an alternative       partner to the West'' and seeks to position itself alongside       the southern flank of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization       (NATO).        (2) AFRICOM has also stated that the Russian military       presence in Libya threatens future United States military       partnerships and counterterrorism cooperation by impeding       United States access to Libya.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1228, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Libya Stabilization Act,  H.R. 1228, sponsored by Congressman Ted Deutch and Congressman   Joe  Wilson, chairman and ranking member respectively, of the Middle East,  North Africa and Global Counterterrorism Subcommittee of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee.   This important legislation responds to years of instability and  violence created by the conflict in Libya, which has laid the  groundwork for the proliferation and growth of violent extremist  groups. As various powers converge on Libya to expand their influence  in the country and across North Africa, the lives of the Libyan people  are at stake. Far, far too many have seen their fundamental rights and  dignity trampled as a result of the chaos unleashed on the country over  the past decade.   The neocolonialist mindset that treats countries as pawns on a  geopolitical chess board must end. No country has the right to unleash  violence and chaos on another or to seize resources that belong to the  Libyan people. This bill is not yet another attempt to infringe on the  sovereignty of the Libyan people; rather, it is an effort to protect  that sovereignty.   Today, though a nascent ceasefire facilitated by the U.N. has held  and Libya continues on its path to building democratic institutions and  constitutional reforms, violence and impunity for past and current  human rights violations continue. Dangerous militia groups remain  prevalent throughout the country.   The bill addresses such threats by sanctioning outside actors who  fuel the growth of the conflict or are perpetrators of human rights  abuses.   The bill also directs additional U.S. support to humanitarian relief  and assistance efforts to help strengthen democratic governance, build  a better, peaceful future for Libya, and ensure the security of the  U.S. and our allies.   Such assistance and important measures are even more important as  Libya faces a critical moment for its transitional path with  presidential and parliamentary elections approaching this December.   Libya cannot be allowed to continue to spiral into lawlessness. A  vacuum of leadership in Libya gives way to further extremism, which  poses threats to the United States and our allies and partners.   I thank Mr. Deutch and Mr. Wilson for their work on this measure, and  I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, September 27, 2021.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       1228, Libya Stabilization Act. I appreciate your willingness       to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Financial Services under       House Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on       H.R. 1228 to expedite floor consideration. I further       acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with respect       to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I also acknowledge that your Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward, and will support the appointment       of Committee on Financial Services conferees during any       House-Senate conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill.

Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,                                                          Chairman.  [[Page H5489]]                                          ____                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, September 27, 2021.      Hon. Gregory W. Meeks,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Meeks: This letter is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 1228, the ``Libya Stabilization       Act,'' that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate       your consulting with us on those provisions. The Judiciary       Committee has no objection to your including them in the bill       for consideration on the House floor, and to expedite that       consideration is willing to forgo action on H.R. 1228, with       the understanding that we do not thereby waive any future       jurisdictional claim over those provisions or their subject       matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, September 27, 2021.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       1228, Libya Stabilization Act. I appreciate your willingness       to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.R.       1228 to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge       that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I also acknowledge that your Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward, and will support the appointment       of Committee on the Judiciary conferees during any House-      Senate conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch), the author of this bill and chairman of the  Middle East, North Africa and Global Counterterrorism Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I continue to  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   It is vital that Libya's path toward rebuilding democratic  institutions, after years of conflict, is not upended by those who seek  to fuel violence and instability.   H.R. 1228 sanctions outside actors responsible for human rights  abuses and creating conflict as well as directing additional United  States' assistance efforts to strengthen Libya's democratic governance.   I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) and the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) for this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4686) to promote free and fair elections, political  freedoms, and human rights in Cambodia, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4686         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cambodia Democracy Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Prime Minister Hun Sen has been in power in Cambodia       since 1985 and is the longest-serving leader in Southeast       Asia. Despite decades of international attention and       assistance to promote a pluralistic, multi-party democratic       system in Cambodia, the Government of Cambodia continues to       be undemocratically dominated by the ruling Cambodia People's       Party (CPP), which controls every agency and security       apparatus of the state.        (2) The Government of Cambodia has taken several measures,       particularly since 2017 and during the COVID-19 pandemic, to       restrict Cambodia's space for civil society and media       environment, especially through politicized tax       investigations against independent media outlets.        (3) On September 3, 2017, Kem Sokha, the President of the       Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), was arrested on       politically motivated charges and faces up to 30 years in       prison. On November 16, 2017, Cambodia's Supreme Court       dissolved the CNRP, eliminating the primary opposition party.       While Kem Sokha is no longer in prison, his movements are       restricted, he is prohibited from engaging in political       activity, and his charges remain pending. The CNRP's previous       leader, Sam Rainsy, remains in unofficial exile, and has been       prevented from returning to the country.        (4) Since the CNRP's dissolution, the Government of       Cambodia has arrested, imprisoned, or brought politically       motivated charges against CNRP leaders and activists.       Starting in November 2020, the Government of Cambodia has       held a series of mass trials for over 100 individuals       affiliated with the CNRP.        (5) Since 1991, the elections that have taken place in       Cambodia were conducted in circumstances that were not free,       fair, and credible or were marked by fraud, intimidation,       violence, and the government's misuse of legal mechanisms to       weaken opposition candidates and parties.        (6) The United States is committed to promoting democracy,       human rights, and the rule of law in Cambodia. The United       States continues to urge the Government of Cambodia to       immediately drop charges against Kem Sokha, reinstate the       political status of the CNRP and restore its elected seats in       the National Assembly, and support electoral reform efforts       in Cambodia with free, fair, and credible elections monitored       by international observers.       SEC. 3. SANCTIONS RELATING TO UNDERMINING DEMOCRACY IN                     CAMBODIA.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4686, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4686, Cambodia  Democracy Act of 2021, introduced by Representative   Steve Chabot,  ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the  Pacific, Central Asia, and Nonproliferation.   The situation in Cambodia has been alarming for several years now. We  have witnessed the widespread suppression of democracy and human rights  in the country, as the Cambodian Government places severe limits on  fundamental freedoms of the press, speech, and association.   In 2017 the president of the opposition party, the Cambodian National  Rescue Party, CNRP, Kem Sokha, was arrested and indefinitely imprisoned  on spurious and politically-motivated charges. Kem's arrest was  followed by a government decision to dissolve the opposition party on  fictitious claims that it was colluding with the United States  Government to overthrow the Cambodian Government. The unprecedented  move crippled the only viable opposition ahead of nationwide elections.   The ruling Cambodian People's Party, under the leadership of Hun Sen,  continues to erode Cambodia's democracy by ordering the arrest and  harassment of hundreds of CNRP leaders, civil society leaders,  prodemocracy activists, and government critics.   We must demonstrate our support to the Cambodian people as they fight  against the growing authoritarianism in their country and struggle for  the restoration of democracy and respect for human rights.   With the passage of this legislation, the House sends a strong,  bipartisan message raising the costs on Cambodian officials who  continue to suppress freedoms and undermine democracy of Cambodia.   Congress must take concrete steps to hold the Cambodian Government  accountable for its backsliding of democracy and human rights and steer  the country back on the path towards free and fair elections.   This is an important measure. I support it, and I urge my colleagues  to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, September 27, 2021.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       4686, the Cambodia Democracy Act. I appreciate your       willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation.

I also acknowledge that your Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward, and will support the appointment       of Committee on the Judiciary conferees during any House-      Senate conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, September 27, 2021.      Hon. John Yarmuth,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Yarmuth: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       4686, the Cambodia Democracy Act. I appreciate your       willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Budget under House Rule X,       and that your Committee will forgo action on H.R. 4686 to       expedite floor consideration.

Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I have no speakers, and I continue to  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   For many years now, Cambodians have struggled under an increasingly  authoritarian and undemocratic regime. H.R. 4686, introduced by my  colleague Representative   Steve Chabot, would direct the President to  impose sanctions on Cambodian officials who are responsible for acts  that undermine democracy in Cambodia.   This bill sends a strong and unequivocal message that the United  States stands firmly with the Cambodian people in their struggle for  democracy and human rights. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
