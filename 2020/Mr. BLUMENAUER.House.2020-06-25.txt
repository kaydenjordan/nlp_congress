 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand for the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act, an important step for racial justice. I  hope our approval will soften the hearts in the Senate because there is  much to do.   I am honored to work with another champion for justice, Congresswoman  Barbara Lee, whose Marijuana Justice Act would be the next step,  repealing Nixon's blatantly racist prohibition of marijuana with its  selective enforcement against young Black men, which continues to  ensnare tens of thousands of young Black men every month for something  that Americans think should be legal.   Let's approve the MORE Act, already passed out of the Judiciary  Committee, the next critical step in racial justice reform and  protecting young Black men from oppression.
