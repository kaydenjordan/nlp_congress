 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Right to  Contraception Act.   The overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court was a wake-up  call. We cannot leave our right to privacy and our most fundamental  freedoms up to chance.   The government has no place inserting itself into the personal and  private healthcare decisions of Americans, including access to  contraceptives.   Ongoing extreme attacks on women's freedom and control of our own  bodies make clear that Congress must take action to protect our most  basic right to medical care and contraception. There are countless  reasons for patients to access contraception and why healthcare  providers prescribe. These reasons are nuanced, complicated, and,  frankly, none of the government's business.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and to protect  the privacy and freedom of millions of Americans.                                time  0945
