 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the life of Major  General Dan Helix.   Dan grew up in West Berkeley, California, and enjoyed a distinguished  41-year career with the United States Army and Army Reserve.   On top of his service in the military, he served on the Concord City  Council for 8 years before serving as a director of the Bay Area Rapid  Transit District.   After being away for some time, Dan eventually returned to the city  council and served two terms as mayor during both of his tenures.   In 1989, Dan retired from the U.S. Army as a major general. As a  Korean war veteran, Dan earned numerous recommendations including: the  Army Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit,  the Bronze Star with ``V'' device, and the Purple Heart with Oak Leaf  Cluster.   Sadly, Dan passed away last month at the age of 91. He was a  cherished resident of Concord who dedicated his life to helping others.  He was a mentor to me and to many others.   Please join me in honoring Major General Dan Helix for his many  contributions to my community and to this country.                            ____________________
