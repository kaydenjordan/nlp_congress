 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my privilege to recognize  a unique Florida small business for its valuable contributions to the  local economy and its dedicated efforts to sustainability and dignified  work. Today, I am pleased to honor Two Sisters New Beginnings, LLC of  Monticello, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Founded in 2013 by sisters Sandra Hood and Pat Marchman, Two Sisters  New Beginnings is an eclectic antique and repurposed furniture shop.  After purchasing and refinishing a chest, Pat and Sandra discovered a  passion for repurposing vintage furniture and decided to create a place  for local artists to sell their unique items. Today, Two Sisters New  Beginnings has become an asset to the Monticello community, supplying  locally sourced repurposed furniture, antiques, collectibles, and more  to both residents and visitors. Since its establishment, the business's  customer base has grown steadily, as has the number of local artists  and craftsmen who seek to showcase their products in the store. The  storefront has become such a popular destination that Two Sisters New  Beginnings expanded into additional retail space next-door.   Two Sisters New Beginnings has been a long supporter of the  Monticello community, participating in local events such as the  Mainstreet Monticello Christmas Kickoff and Jefferson County Historical  Association Home and Heritage Tour. It is a member of Monticello Main  Street, a business development and nonprofit organization that promotes  local businesses, historic preservation, and tourism within the  community. Two Sisters New Beginnings consistently donates to numerous  charitable events in the local community, including the Big Bend  Hospice Joyful Noise Concert and the David Hobbs Memorial Barrel Race.  They have served as a silver sponsor of the Teal Magnolias Ladies Golf  Tournament, an event that raises awareness for ovarian cancer each  year. Additionally, the vendors of Two Sisters New Beginnings share in  this charitable mindset, often donating a portion of their sales to  local charities like Refuge House. Two Sisters New Beginnings is an  unparalleled example of how small businesses can strengthen and support  a community by giving back and creating dignified jobs.   Two Sisters New Beginnings is a prime example of the integral role  small businesses play in our local communities. Its community first  mindset and dedication to dignified work make it a notable and integral  member of the city of Monticello. Congratulations again on being named  the Senate Small Business of the Week. I look forward to watching your  continued growth and success.                            ____________________
