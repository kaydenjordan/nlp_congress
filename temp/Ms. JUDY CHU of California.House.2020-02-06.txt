 Mr. Chair, before I begin, I enter into  the Record letters in support of the PRO Act from the American  Federation of Musicians and the International Alliance of Theatrical  Stage Employees.           American Federation of Musicians of the United States and             Canada,                                    New York, NY, February 4, 2020.        Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of 80,000 members of the       American Federation of Musicians, I write urging your support       of H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (``PRO       Act'') and ask that you oppose any amendments or any       offensive motions that may be offered during House       deliberations.        The PRO Act strengthens the National Labor Relations Act by       supporting the ability of working people to have a voice on       the job. The bill would update the National Labor Relations       Act to allow workers to have a greater say in such important       workplace issues as higher wages and retirement security.       Once workers vote to form a union, the National Labor       Relations Board could seek enforcement and relief in federal       court allowing for swifter justice. In addition, the bill       would prohibit employers from forcing workers to attend       captive audience meetings designed to encourage workers from       voting against the union. Companies and corporate officers       would be confronted with stiff financial penalties for       violating the law.        The PRO act also establishes a mediation and arbitration       process to prevent employers from avoiding the completion of       a first contract. Historically, many employers attempt to       stall first-contract negotiations in an effort to frustrate       and in some cases stop the collective bargaining process,       often after union organizers and negotiators have worked for       years to finalize a first contract.        The bill also supports workers' right to picket or withhold       their labor in order to push for workplace changes. It also       protects employees' right to strike and prevents an employer       from hiring permanent replacement workers and allows       unrepresented workers to participate in collective action and       class action lawsuits against unscrupulous employers.        Finally, HR 2474 eliminates state right to work laws which       over the years have given more power to billionaires and       special interest groups at the expense of lowering worker       wages, eroding pensions and healthcare coverages in states       where such laws have been enacted.        We urge you to support the PRO Act. Thank you.            Sincerely yours,      Raymond M. Hair, Jr.,          International President,         American Federation of Musicians of the United States and       Canada.                                   ____                                     New York, NY, February 3, 2020.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the approximately 125,000       American members of the International Alliance of Theatrical       Stage Employees (IATSE), I urge you to support the Protecting       the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, H.R. 2474, and to oppose       weakening amendments and any Motion to Recommit when the       House of Representatives considers the bill. The PRO Act will       restore fairness to the economy by strengthening the federal       laws that give working people a voice on the job so they can       negotiate for higher wages, better benefits, a more secure       retirement and a safer workplace.        Too often, when workers choose to form a union, employers       stall the bargaining process to avoid reaching an agreement--      as evidenced by riggers in the Pacific Northwest employed by       Rhino Staging Northwest who voted in 2015 to be represented       by Local 15 of the IATSE, but today still don't have a       contract.        These riggers--who work high above stages, on scaffolding       or catwalks, installing complex lighting and audio       equipment--followed state and federal labor laws, and over       many years organized themselves. Fed up with low pay, no       employer-funded healthcare, and unsafe working conditions       they voted to unionize.        Yet, after these workers voted for the union, Rhino refused       to bargain in good faith as required by federal labor law.       Rhino challenged the union before the National Labor       Relations Board (NLRB) and in federal court. It lost. It has       stalled and delayed and still today has not entered into a       contract.        This is just one example of how some employers have been       able to violate the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) with       impunity, routinely denying workers their basic right to join       with coworkers for fairness on the job. Time after time,       employers get away with it.        The PRO Act would establish a process for mediation and       arbitration to help the parties achieve a first contract.       This important change would make the freedom to negotiate a       reality for countless workers who form unions but never get       to enjoy the benefits of a collective bargaining agreement.        The PRO Act would modernize the NLRA by bringing its       remedies in line with other workplace laws. In addition to       imposing financial penalties on companies and individual       corporate officers who violate the law, the bill would give       workers the option of bringing their case to federal court.        Under the bill, once workers vote to form a union, the       National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) would be authorized to       order that the employer commence bargaining a first contract.       These orders would be enforced in district courts to ensure       swift justice. In addition, the bill would ensure that       employees are not deprived of their right to a union because       their employer hides behind a subcontractor or other       intermediary, or deliberately misclassifies them as       supervisors or independent contractors.  [[Page H884]]         The bill would also eliminate ``right to work'' laws;       prohibit mandatory ``captive audience'' meetings; and protect       the right to strike, among other provisions.        The PRO Act is a top priority for the IATSE, we urge you to       support this bill and help us build an economy that works for       all working families.            Sincerely,                                                   Matthew D. Loeb,                                           International President.     Mr. Chair, when I was a young college  professor in the Los Angeles Community College District, the board of  trustees passed a measure that would lay off over 100 of us, even  though we had tenure.   It was my union, the American Federation of Teachers, that organized  the protests and stood up for us. The union saved my job.   Yet, today, we see that there is a decline in union membership. It is  not because workers don't want to be in a union. It is because  employers have been allowed to use antiunion tactics, such as paying  millions of dollars to professional union busters who come into the  workplace to intimidate workers in captive audience meetings.   Even when workers vote to approve a union, more than half of them  still do not have a collective bargaining agreement 1 year later. That  is because employers face few penalties for bargaining in bad faith,  while employees can be fired for striking and exercising their rights.   The PRO Act is the best way to protect the right to organize and to  help workers have the quality of life they deserve.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, President  Trump delivered his State of the Union address in this very Chamber. At  one point, he praised the Second Amendment and gun rights, but  neglected to even mention the 100 Americans who are killed with guns  every day. That number is only part of it.   This week is National Gun Violence Survivors Week and their stories  fill out the picture of the reality of guns in America. Over half of  adult Americans have or know someone who has experienced gun violence,  and about 3 million children experience gun violence every year.   That doesn't even include the millions more students who go to school  afraid that they could be the victim of a mass shooting, all because  the NRA and the Republican lawmakers they fund refuse to even allow the  most commonsense gun legislation, like H.R. 8.   This legislation would ensure that no one could buy a gun without a  background check, and a bipartisan majority of Americans agree.   It is time to end the NRA stranglehold, and end gun violence.                            ____________________
