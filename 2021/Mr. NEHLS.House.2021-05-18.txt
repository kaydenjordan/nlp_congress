 Mr. Speaker, for months now, our country has witnessed the  never-ending horrific images and stories coming from our southern  border. We have seen young children thrown over a 14-foot fence like a  rag doll. We have seen children wandering alone, abandoned in south  Texas. We have seen thousands of children packed like sardines into  holding facilities meant for 250. And we have seen countless horrific  tales of young women sexually assaulted by coyotes on their trek up  here.   When I traveled to the southern border in March and again in May, I  saw the Biden border crisis firsthand. I spoke to Border Patrol agents  who said they are beyond spread thin trying to juggle securing the  border with an inadequate number of agents, while simultaneously  babysitting the unprecedented number of migrant children who continue  to flood across our southern border daily. While they are busy  babysitting, violent criminal aliens are slipping through undetected.   These stories are indisputable. They are entirely based in fact and  truth. But rather than recognize and address the reality of the  situation, Democrats and the Biden administration are downplaying,  distracting, and denying. They are downplaying the severity of this  crisis by refusing to call it a crisis; saying, instead, it is a  challenge. They are denying the crisis by refusing to visit the  southern border in person.   It has been 55 days since President Biden tapped Kamala Harris to be  the lead on the border, and she still has not visited. And they are  distracting from this crisis by talking about anything but the border.   Love him or hate him, under President Trump, we finally had a leader  willing to step up and fix the mess at our southern border, a mess our  country has failed to deal with for decades, under both Republican and  Democrat leadership. President Trump was the only President who truly  took the necessary steps to not only stop the flow of illegal aliens  across our borders, but to deter caravans from ever forming.   He instituted commonsense policies, like the remain in Mexico policy,  ending catch and release, and building a big, beautiful wall with  beautiful gates because, as we all know, this isn't about legal  immigration; it is about illegal immigration.                                time  1030    We are a nation of laws and law and order, or at least we used to be.  Ever since President Biden assumed control of the White House, there  has been an outright refusal from his administration to put the  American people first and address the growing crisis at our southern  border. Their inaction will cost American lives, will cost billions of  American taxpayer dollars, and will once again put the responsibility  of the Federal Government on individual States.   And I know. I saw it firsthand as a county sheriff for 8 years in  Texas. I had to look victims of crime in the eyes after their loved one  was killed or their homes were burglarized and tell these individuals:  I am sorry for what happened to you, but we caught the guy. And I am  sad to tell you that he has been deported four, five, six times.   I had to tell this specifically to dozens of residents in my home  county whose homes were burglarized by a burglary ring of illegal  aliens from, yes, Honduras and Colombia, many of whom had been deported  several times.   In January 2020, I had to tell the son of an elderly Texas woman who  was killed in a hit-and-run that the illegal alien who ran his mother  over had been deported six times prior. How on Earth does anyone ever  get deported more than one time from our country? It happens because  the Federal Government is failing to secure the southern border.   It is mind-boggling to me that the Democrat Party has accepted that  American lives will be lost and billions of taxpayer dollars wasted so  illegal aliens can flood into our country simply because their home  country is corrupt or crippled. Economic hardship or struggle in your  home country is not justification for breaking the law and skipping the  line of millions of people patiently waiting to legally immigrate here.   We are not the world's charity. We are not a nation of open borders.  We are a nation of laws, and it is past time the current administration  wakes the hell up and remembers that fact. But I won't hold my breath,  and neither should the American people. Democrats have demonstrated  right to our faces that they don't care about putting the American  people first.   Members of Congress and the American people need to speak up and  speak out about the Biden border crisis and hold this administration's  feet to the fire until they reverse course.                            ____________________
