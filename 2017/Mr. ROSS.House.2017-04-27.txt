 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1694.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 280 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1694.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1419                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 1694) to require additional entities to be subject to the  requirements of section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly  referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), and for other purposes,  with Mr. Collins of Georgia in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross) and the gentleman from Missouri  (Mr. Clay) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1694, the Fannie and  Freddie Open Records Act of 2017.   Mr. Chairman, transparency is critical. It is critical to oversight  and accountability of the Federal Government and how it spends taxpayer  dollars. The American public has a right to know how their tax dollars  are spent.   The Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, is a key tool for citizens  to access information about their government. Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac are not subject to the requirements of FOIA, despite taxpayers'  substantial investment into both entities and the government's implicit  guaranteed backing of these entities.   Taxpayers have spent $187 billion to bail out Fannie and Freddie, the  most sweeping government intervention into private financial markets in  decades. Taxpayers are on the hook for $400 billion in lost investments  and $5 trillion in mortgage liabilities.   At the same time, the American public is unable to seek  accountability from these entities under FOIA. It is far past time we  apply FOIA to Fannie and Freddie. There is precedent for applying FOIA  to non-traditional quasi-governmental entities. Congress subjected  Amtrak to FOIA in recognition of sizeable taxpayer funding.   To stabilize the housing market in the aftershock of the 2008  financial crisis, the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed Fannie and  Freddie into conservatorship to return them to financial viability and  stockholder control. FHFA is a government entity subject to FOIA. Under  the terms of its conservatorship over Fannie and Freddie, FHFA  exercises the titles to their books and records, as well as the powers  and privileges of Fannie and Freddie.   Despite this government intervention and explicit guarantee,  taxpayers, however, are unable to obtain any information from Fannie  and Freddie.   H.R. 1694, the Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017, sponsored  by Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz, will allow  the American public to submit FOIA requests to Fannie and Freddie as  long as the entities remain under FHFA's conservatorship. H.R. 1694  reflects FOIA's presumptions of openness, granting taxpayers  information unless an exemption applies.   This bill is a commonsense measure to allow the American public  access to basic information regarding entities that they fund with  their tax dollars.   The American public should not be in the dark when it comes to what  Fannie and Freddie are doing.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support for the legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arkansas.    Mr. Chairman, as you can see, this is a bill that I think  has broad bipartisan support. It is something that we need to do for  the taxpayers who have invested so much into Fannie and Freddie over  the years. Let's make them subject to FOIA.   I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment  under the 5-minute rule.   In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by  the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, printed in the bill,  it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of  amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a  substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-14  modified by the amendment printed in part A of House Report 115-96.  That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as  read.   The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as  follows:                                 H.R. 1694         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fannie and Freddie Open       Records Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. APPLICABILITY OF FOIA.         (a) Applicability to Government Sponsored Entities in       Conservatorship.--Section 552 of title 5, United States Code       (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), is       amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(n) The Federal National Mortgage Association or the       Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation shall comply with       agency requirements under this section during any period such       enterprise is under conservatorship or receivership pursuant       to section 1367 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial       Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 4617).''.        (b) Effective Date; Applicability.--The amendment made by       subsection (a) shall be effective on the date of the       enactment of this Act and shall apply with respect to any       request filed under section 552(a)(3) of title 5, United       States Code, on or after such effective date, relating to any       record created before, on, or after the date of the enactment       of this Act.       SEC. 3. COMMERCIAL REQUESTERS.         For purposes of subsection (n) of section 552 of title 5,       United States Code, as added by section 2(a), each enterprise       described in such subsection shall establish a fee schedule       such that in the first year the fees collected from requests       for records intended for a commercial use cover the costs of       administering such subsection (n), which shall be estimated       as $40,000,000 in the first year. In each subsequent year,       each such enterprise shall evaluate whether the fees       collected under the prior year's fee schedule were sufficient       to recover all actual costs of administering subsection (n)       and revise the fee schedule to recover the costs of       administering subsection (n) in the following year and any       outstanding costs of administering subsection (n) from the       prior year not collected through fees in the prior year. Each       such enterprise shall make the revised fee schedule and a       detailed explanation of the prior year's costs and       projections of future costs that were used to justify the fee       schedule publicly available online for 10 days prior to the       fee schedule going into effect.    The CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a  substitute shall be in order except those printed in part B of House  Report 115-96. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order  printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be  considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the  report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,  shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand  for division of the question.                     Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Ross    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in  part B of House Report 115-96.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, as the  designee of the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz).   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 1, strike line 10 and all that follows through line 16       and insert the following:        ``(n)(1) This section shall apply to the Federal National       Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage       Corporation during any period either such enterprise is under       conservatorship or receivership pursuant to section 1367 of       the Federal Housing  [[Page H2922]]       Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (12       U.S.C. 4617).        ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, the exemption       described in subsection (b)(4), relating to trade secrets and       commercial or financial information, shall apply without       regard to whether such information was obtained from a person       outside the Federal National Mortgage Association or the       Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, as the case may       be.''.         Page 1, line 18, after ``on the date'' insert the       following: ``that is six months after the date''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 280, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Ross) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, the manager's amendment that I am offering on  behalf of Chairman Chaffetz makes technical and conforming changes to  the bill.   Applying FOIA to Fannie and Freddie while the entities remain in  conservatorship will better ensure that the American people know what  their government does with their taxpayer dollars. But, if and when  Fannie and Freddie come out of conservatorship, the entities need to be  able to operate as commercially competitive businesses.   This amendment clarifies that Fannie and Freddie may use exemption 4,  which protects sensitive commercial information from disclosure,  regardless of whether information was obtained from a person outside of  Fannie or Freddie, to protect their financially sensitive materials  from public disclosure.   Mr. Chairman, recognizing the administrative labors involved in  setting up FOIA shops, the amendment also addresses the implementation  date. Fannie and Freddie will likely need to hire staff, update their  websites, and identify records to be made publicly available as a  matter of course.   The manager's amendment, therefore, provides Fannie and Freddie 6  months after the bill's enactment to establish their respective staffs  and protocols to administer FOIA.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Ross).   The amendment was agreed to.              Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in  part B of House Report 115-96.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, though I am  not opposed to the amendment.   The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Florida is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, FOIA does not require that all records be  released to requesters. The FOIA statute allows agencies to withhold  information under nine exemptions, which were designed to protect truly  sensitive information that would be harmful to important interests if  released.   Just last year, Congress clarified that the expectation--and now the  legal requirement--is that agencies only withhold information when it  is necessary to prevent harm to the interest that the exemption was  intended to protect. The Johnson amendment clarifies that Fannie and  Freddie would be allowed to withhold requested information under those  nine exemptions, just as any other agency would be permitted to  withhold information, if the enterprises reasonably foresee that  disclosure would harm a protected interest.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).   The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, though I am  not opposed to the amendment.   The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Florida is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, it is imperative that Fannie's and Freddie's  conservator--the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA--scrutinize  new purchasing strategies to ensure that the enterprises' dealings are  in line with their charters to stimulate homeownership. If FHFA fails  to guarantee the soundness of their business dealings, FOIA could  empower the taxpayer to step in and hold accountable Fannie or Freddie.   For instance, thanks to taxpayers' explicit backing of Fannie earlier  this year, Invitation Homes, the single-family rental business owned by  the lucrative private equity firm Blackstone, secured a $1.8 billion  initial public offering, or IPO, the largest since October of 2015.   In its IPO filing, Invitation Homes disclosed that Fannie, which  received over $116 billion from the taxpayers in the aftershock of the  financial crisis, is guaranteeing up to $1 billion in debt from  Invitation. While Blackstone gets the money, the taxpayers take on the  risk; and Fannie pivots unimpeded into the rental markets, leaving  those hopeful of homeownership with less support.   Applying FOIA to Fannie and Freddie under this bill strengthens the  guarantee that government-sponsored entities are fulfilling their  mandate to stimulate homeownership rather than being in the business of  supporting profitable, private equity investors on the backs of  taxpayers.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment further clarifies the legislation's  assurance of applicable disclosures as a mechanism to keep Fannie and  Freddie consistent with their Federal charters to stimulate  homeownership.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. Clay).   The amendment was agreed to.
