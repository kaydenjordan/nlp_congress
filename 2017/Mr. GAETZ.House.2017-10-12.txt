 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support our friend and  ally, Israel, and to stand for the obvious proposition that the people  of Israel and the Jewish people have an ancient connection to the city  of Jerusalem.   This connection has been forged through millennia of shared faith and  shared history, yet the U.N. is actually trying to rewrite history:   They condemn Israel and call it an occupying power in Jerusalem;   They prevent Israeli scientists from excavating, even though past  findings have been significant to Christians, Muslims, and Jews alike;   They have been silent when Israel's culture has been attacked,  including the desecration and burning of holy sites.   Each year brings new horrors from the U.N. Their cruelty and attempts  to erase history and their anti-Semitism cannot be tolerated any  longer.   Today I am introducing a resolution reaffirming the connection of the  Jewish people to the city of Jerusalem and condemning UNESCO's attempts  to punish and delegitimize Israel.   I encourage my colleagues to show solidarity with Israel, to support  the President's removal of the United States from UNESCO, and to  support this resolution I have proposed.                            ____________________
