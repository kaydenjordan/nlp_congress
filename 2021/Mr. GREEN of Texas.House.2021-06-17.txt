 Mr. Speaker, we, who are honored to be Members of  Congress, are here to pass judgment on the great issues of our time.  There is no greater issue of our time than the issue of war and peace.  It is about life and death.   We should not be allowed to escape our duty, responsibility, and  obligation to vote on issues of war and peace.   We must repeal this authorization so that Congress can take up its  responsibility and vote on the great issues of our time.
