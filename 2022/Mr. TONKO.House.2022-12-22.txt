 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1529, I call  up the bill (S. 1942) to standardize the designation of National  Heritage Areas, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on S. 1942.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I realize we are quickly reaching the end of the 117th Congress, and  there is necessary business to finish before the end of the year. I do  want to express my immense gratitude to Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader  Hoyer, Chairman Grijalva, and Ranking Member Westerman for recognizing  the importance of S. 1942, the National Heritage Area Act, and finding  the time to allow it to be considered today.   National Heritage Areas are far too often overlooked, but they are so  important to so many Members and the communities that they serve. There  are 55 National Heritage Areas across our country, sites of cultural,  historical, or natural significance that help tell our unique and very  diverse American story.   In New York's 20th Congressional District, these legendary sites  include the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor and the Maurice D.  Hinchey Hudson River Valley National Heritage Corridor named after our  late colleague.   For decades, these sites have opened wide the doors of economic  opportunity  [[Page H10007]]  and community engagement for constituents in my district and well  beyond. I am so grateful to Bob Radcliff and Meg Downey for their  leadership and commitment that drives the success of the sites in my  district.   Across our country, heritage areas touch 34 States and nearly 600  counties. They create local jobs, boost local economies, and certainly  bind communities together in every corner of America.   In total, heritage areas have a nearly $13 billion annual economic  impact and support almost 150,000 jobs nationwide. They also return an  average of $5.50 for every Federal dollar appropriated by effectively  leveraging public and private partnerships in the communities which  they serve.   Despite broad, bipartisan support and continued interest in the areas  from communities, these sites have faced inconsistent treatment before  Congress. There is no standardized programmatic system of  administration for our heritage areas, which has required each area to  pursue individual funding extensions and reauthorizations, often with  last-minute congressional action.   Even in this year's omnibus agreement, several sites required  extensions. This stopgap model puts a burden on local coordinating  entities.   Heritage areas have been made to function over the past few years  through multiple short-term stopgap reauthorizations while Congress has  failed to provide long-term certainty. We cannot let that continue into  next year as some 45 of our 55 areas face expiration dates during the  upcoming 118th Congress.   For years, I have worked alongside my colleagues in the House and  passionate partners from local heritage areas to pass the bipartisan  National Heritage Area Act, beginning with the efforts of our former  colleague, Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania.   That effort has continued to grow as more and more Members have begun  to understand the rich value that heritage areas play in their given  districts.   H.R. 1316, the House companion to the bill we are considering today,  was introduced with Congressmen   David McKinley, Glenn Thompson, and  135 other Members, and it has already passed the House this Congress as  part of the Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act. In  the 116th Congress, it was passed as a suspension.   This bill is not controversial. It has widespread support.  Importantly, it will finally bring stability and, very importantly,  predictability to these sites, allowing them to continue to serve their  communities and strengthen surrounding economies with minimal Federal  support.   The National Heritage Area Act would end the current system of  piecemeal reauthorizations through a 15-year authorization of all  existing areas; it would establish the first-ever standardized criteria  for designating new heritage areas; it would include new study  authorizations and designations, most of which have already passed the  House on suspension; and, finally, it would ensure that private  property rights are never affected by heritage area activities.   National Heritage Areas are an incredibly popular, bipartisan way of  preserving American history and culture while supporting local  economies, creating a deeply rooted sense of destination. Congress now  has the opportunity to ensure these sites can be enjoyed for  generations to come by finally making our National Heritage Area Act  law.   Madam Speaker, I encourage Members to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Horsford.) Representative Horsford, who I thank for his  advocacy, represents the Fourth District of Nevada and includes in his  terrain the Great Basin National Heritage Area and Mormon Pioneer  National Heritage Area.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Nevada an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.     Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself balance of my time.   Again, I want to thank Chair Grijalva and Ranking Member Westerman  for their help with this measure. This bill certainly would not have  been possible without the incredible leadership, and I might add  passion, of Sara Capen of the Alliance of National Heritage Areas, of  Alan Spears of NPCA, and so many other stakeholders and supporters.  These advocates of this concept have been tremendously passionate. That  is an understatement, and they deserve this response.  [[Page H10009]]    I also want to recognize the great work by the staff who have fought  for years to bring this bill to the floor: David Watkins, Brandon  Bragato, Henry Wykowski, and Lora Snyder of the House Natural Resources  majority staff, and indeed, Miranda Miller and Emily Silverberg from my  office.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of S. 1942 to finally provide the  certainty and, yes, the predictability that National Heritage Areas  need to continue to serve local communities and strengthen local  economies all across our great United States.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4439) to take certain Federal land located in Siskiyou County,  California, and Humboldt County, California, into trust for the benefit  of the Karuk Tribe, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4439         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H10010]]    I rise in support of S. 4439, the Katimiin and Ameekyaaraam Sacred  Lands Act sponsored by Senator Alex Padilla and led here in the House  by Representative Jared Huffman.   The Karuk Tribe's ancestral territory encompasses over 1 million  acres in northern California and southern Oregon with about 900 acres  currently held in trust for the Tribe.   The lands known as Katimiin and Ameekyaaraam are ceremonial areas and  village sites located at the Karuk Tribe's center of the world. These  sites host the final series of the Tribe's Pikyavish World Renewal  ceremonies.   The Ameekyaaraam is located downriver from the Katimiin and serves as  the site of the Jump Dance and First Salmon ceremonies and the  historical location of pre-contact inter-Tribal fish harvesting.   These sites remain essential to the Tribe's intergenerational  cultural and environmental teachings.   Unfortunately, the Tribe's access to these sacred sites is not always  guaranteed. In recent years, Tribal members have even been interrupted  by members of the public during private components of their ceremonies.   S. 4439 will resolve this access issue by placing approximately 1,031  acres of Federal land located in Siskiyou and Humboldt Counties in  trust for the Tribe.   The bill contains gaming prohibitions and confirms the U.S. Forest  Service's authority over managing the wild and scenic rivers located on  this parcel.   I thank Senator Padilla and Representative Huffman for championing  this important bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3519) to amend the National Trails System Act to designate the  Butterfield Overland National Historic Trail, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3519         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Butterfield Overland       National Historic Trail Designation Act''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF THE BUTTERFIELD OVERLAND NATIONAL                     HISTORIC TRAIL.         Section 5(a) of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C.       1244(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(31) Butterfield overland national historic trail.--        ``(A) In general.--The Butterfield Overland National       Historic Trail, a trail of approximately 3,292 miles       following the route operated by the Butterfield Overland Mail       Company, known as the `Ox-Bow Route', to transport mail and       passengers between the eastern termini of St. Louis,       Missouri, and Memphis, Tennessee, and extending westward       through the States of Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico,       and Arizona, to the western terminus of San Francisco,       California, as generally depicted on the maps numbered 1       through 15, entitled `Study Route Maps', and contained in the       report prepared by the National Park Service entitled       `Butterfield Overland Trail National Historical Trail Special       Resource Study' and dated May 2018.        ``(B) Maps.--The maps described in subparagraph (A) shall       be on file and available for public inspection in the       appropriate offices of the National Park Service.        ``(C) Administration.--The trail established by       subparagraph (A) shall be administered by the Secretary of       the Interior.        ``(D) Land acquisition.--The United States shall not       acquire for the trail established by subparagraph (A) any       land or interest in land outside of the exterior boundary of       any federally administered area without the consent of the       owner of the land or interest in land.        ``(E) No buffer zone created.--        ``(i) In general.--Nothing in this paragraph, the       acquisition of land or an interest in land authorized by this       paragraph, or any management plan for the Butterfield       Overland National Historic Trail creates a buffer zone       outside of the Butterfield Overland National Historic Trail.        ``(ii) Outside activities.--The fact that an activity or       use on land outside the Butterfield Overland National       Historic Trail can be seen, heard, or detected from land or       an interest in land acquired for the  [[Page H10011]]       Butterfield Overland National Historic Trail shall not       preclude, limit, control, regulate, or determine the conduct       or management of the activity or use.        ``(F) Effect on energy development, production, or       transmission.--Nothing in this paragraph, the acquisition of       land or an interest in land authorized by this paragraph, or       any management plan for the Butterfield Overland National       Historic Trail shall prohibit, hinder, or disrupt the       development, production, or transmission of energy.        ``(G) No eminent domain or condemnation.--In carrying out       this paragraph, the Secretary of the Interior may not use       eminent domain or condemnation.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3519, the Butterfield Overland  National Historic Trail Designation Act, introduced by Senator Boozman  of Arkansas. This bill passed the Senate unanimously earlier this week.   This bill amends the National Trails Systems Act to designate the  Butterfield National Historic Trail stretching from St. Louis,  Missouri, to San Francisco, California.   Known as the Oxbow Trail, the Butterfield Overland Trail was an  important 19th century postal route that the National Park Service  studied and deemed to be nationally significant and feasible, suitable,  and desirable for addition to the national trails system as a national  historic trail.   I congratulate the Arkansas delegation and supporters of this bill,  as this will be a great addition to a growing network of national  historic trails. However, I would like to note the bill includes novel  language regarding energy development that has never been included in  the National Trails Act. Simply, it states that nothing in the bill  shall prohibit or hinder the development, production, or transmission  of energy.   While this is an important concern, historic trails designations like  the one envisioned by this bill have not been an impediment to energy  development. So while this is a worthy trail designation--and I support  the adoption of this particular bill--I think we should be mindful of  the need to include similar language in future designations.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I enjoyed hearing that bit of nostalgia. I  have no further requests for time. I have no other speakers. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
