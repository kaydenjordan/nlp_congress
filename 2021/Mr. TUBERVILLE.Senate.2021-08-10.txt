 Madam President, I call up my amendment, No. 3113,  and ask that it be reported by number.    Madam President, believe it or not, people back home  actually listen sometimes to what we say here.   To some local leaders across the country, the far-left rally cry of  ``defund the police'' is not just DC rhetoric; they are actually acting  on it.   More than 80 percent of law enforcement in America is conducted by  State and local police departments--80 percent. These men and women are  community heroes. We should invest in all of them. But local leaders  across the country have decided the ``woke'' thing to do is cancel  their city's police force.   My amendment is pretty simple. If your city council wants to defund  their police, don't expect the Federal Government to make up the  difference.   The American taxpayers in Alabama shouldn't have to pick up the tab  for local leaders in Oregon and Minnesota who value the ``woke''  ``defund the police'' movement over their own community's safety.   I call on my colleagues to support our law enforcement by voting yes  for this amendment. Opposing my amendment is a vote in support of  defunding the police and against the men and women in blue.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
