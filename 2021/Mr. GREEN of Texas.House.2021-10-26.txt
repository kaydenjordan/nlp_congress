 And still I rise, Madam Speaker. And I thank the  chairman, Chairman Scott, for the opportunity to be heard.   Madam Speaker, I support this legislation because, on any given night  or day, in 2020, around 11,000 requests for domestic violence services  went unmet, and this was due to a lack of resources. We have the  resources; they are just not getting to the people.   This is what we can do to make a difference in the lives of 11,000  people. I will do what I can. I support the legislation.
