 Mr. Speaker, I rise as a cosponsor of the bipartisan H.  Res. 11.   In 2002, during the Second Intifada, after the massacre in Hebron, I  had the great, good fortune of meeting in Jerusalem with Shimon Peres,  of blessed memory. He explained why a two-state solution is the only  path to peace, and I will never abandon his dream of a two-state  solution.   U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334, however, pushes the hope of a  two-state solution farther away for three reasons:   One, it discourages direct negotiations between Israel and the  Palestinians.   Two, it fails to distinguish between ``long accepted'' and ``more  controversial'' settlements. ``Long accepted'' settlements, such as the  long established Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, in the Jewish  Quarter, places like the Western Wall, and the ``consensus''  settlements versus ``more controversial'' hilltop settlements in the  West Bank, such as Amona, settlements that even the Israeli Supreme  Court has declared illegal.   Three, it fails to explicitly condemn the number one impediment to a  two-state solution: anti-Israel terrorism.   Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis).   Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, I condemn U.N. Security Council Resolution  2334.   This is an outrageous attack against the State of Israel, the world's  only Jewish state and the only democracy in the Middle East. I also  condemn the Obama administration's failure to veto such a resolution,  because it betrayed Israel and it harmed our national security  interests. The Obama administration's actions, or lack of actions, were  more than just a sin of omission in that they worked behind the scenes  to move this resolution forward so that it could be voted on in the  United Nations General Assembly. That is a sin of commission.   Now, we have to be honest about how the two sides have acted in this  in putting pressure on Israel and not on the Palestinian Authority.  Remember, when you talk about a two-state solution, the Palestinian  Arabs rejected a state in 1948. They tried to wipe Israel off the map.  They tried to beat them in 1967. It has been a constant state of war,  and they have chosen to get rid of the Jewish state as something that  is more important to them than the creation of their own state, and we  have to be honest about that.   I will support this resolution. I view it as a good statement, but as  just a first step. We need something in the coming days that has teeth  to deal with the United Nations and its outrageous conduct. It has  become a hotbed of anti-Israeli activity where all of these tin-pot  countries get together and rail against the world's only Jewish state.  They did 20 resolutions against Israel at the United Nations in 2016  and four against the rest of the world.   We need to take our power of the purse and defund the U.N. until U.N.  Security Council Resolution 2334 is revoked.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my  colleague from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Chair, had I been present, I would have voted ``nay''  on rollcall No. 12.                   Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Grijalva    The Acting CHAIR.

The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule,  the Committee rises.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Woodall) having assumed the chair, Mr. Simpson, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 26) to  amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to provide that major  rules of the executive branch shall have no force or effect unless a  joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, and, pursuant to  House Resolution 22, he reported the bill back to the House with sundry  amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is  ordered.   Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the  Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.   The amendments were agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit    Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at  the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?   Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. I am opposed.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:        Mrs. Murphy of Florida moves to recommit the bill H.R. 26       to the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report       the same back to the House forthwith with the following       amendment:        Add, at the end of the bill, the following:       SEC. 7. EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES THAT PROHIBIT                     DISCRIMINATION BY INSURANCE ISSUERS AGAINST                     DEPENDENTS UNDER THE AGE OF 26.         Nothing in this Act, or the amendments made by this Act,       shall apply in the case of any rule that pertains to       prohibiting an insurance issuer from eliminating, weakening,       or reducing health coverage benefits for dependents under the       age of 26.    Mr. GOODLATTE (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent to dispense with the reading of the motion.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from  Florida is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion.   Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to  the bill. It will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If  the amendment is adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final  passage, as amended.   Like a number of my new colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I was  not a Member of Congress in 2010 when Congress enacted the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law has now been in place for  nearly 7 years, and it has become part of the fabric of our health care  system, fundamentally changing the way that we provide and pay for  health care in this country.   The Members of this Chamber, our counterparts in the Senate, and the  incoming President will soon have a binary choice to make, and the  stakes for patients, physicians, hospitals, and health insurance  providers could not be higher.   The choice is this: Will we retain the many provisions in the  Affordable Care Act that are functioning well and work together in a  bipartisan manner to reform, refine, and rectify those provisions that  need improvement; or, on the other hand, will we repeal the entire  Affordable Care Act without a clear and comprehensive plan in place to  replace the law with something as good or better, which is almost  certain to cause chaos in our health care system and disrupt the lives  and livelihoods of millions of our constituents?   The Affordable Care Act is not perfect; but I believe the responsible  and moral course of action for this body is to strengthen the law, not  repeal it. A look to historic precedent gives us guidance here. In the  past, when Congress enacted important legislation, like Social Security  or Medicare, designed to address serious national problems, it rarely  gets it perfectly right the first time. Congress almost always needs to  revisit the law down the line to observe how the law has operated in  practice, to see who the law has helped or who it may have  inadvertently harmed, to learn from that experience, and then, based on  the evidence and the counsel of our constituents, to work across party  lines to make any necessary improvements to the law. The perfect must  never become the enemy of the good.   Just as in business, when your business plan runs into challenges,  you don't scrap the whole plan; you make left and right adjustments  along the way and keep moving forward toward your goals. Health care is  too central to the lives of our constituents to be rebooted every few  years in a partisan, haphazard manner.   My specific amendment is consistent with this broader philosophy. One  of the most popular and well-functioning provisions of the Affordable  Care Act is a provision requiring certain health insurance plans to  allow young adults to stay on their parents' health insurance plans  until the age of 26. This provision has been particularly beneficial  for my district in central Florida, which has one of the lowest median  ages of any congressional district in the Sunshine State and which is  home to the University of Central Florida--the Nation's second largest  university, with over 63,000 enrolled students.   Prior to the Affordable Care Act, too many young adults in central  Florida and around the country were uninsured either because they were  not employed or because they were employed at jobs that did not provide  affordable coverage or any coverage at all. If these young men and  women were to become sick or get injured, the resulting medical bills  could bankrupt them or their families. The Affordable Care Act sought  to mitigate this risk, and the evidence indicates that it has done so  successfully; and the American people have said, overwhelmingly, that  they want to keep this popular provision.   Accordingly, my amendment would establish an exception to the REINS  Act. It would ensure that any Federal regulation that executes or  enforces the Affordable Care Act provision enabling young adults up to  age 26 to obtain health insurance coverage through their parents' plans  will not be annulled by Congress. By voting for my amendment, you will  send a signal that you support this provision, which has benefited  millions of our constituents whether they live in red States, blue  States, or purple States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
