 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to  complete my remarks before the start of the vote.    Mr. President, this morning the Bureau of Labor Statistics  released the August inflation numbers, and as every American who has  been to a grocery store lately knows, August was yet another month of  high inflation.   Consumer prices rose 8.3 percent last month from a year earlier,  holding to a near-four-decade-high--40-year-high--inflation. And  Americans are feeling the strain.  [[Page S4550]]    Even 1 unexpectedly expensive month can be challenging for many  families, but at least it is actually and usually possible to recover  from a single tough month. How are American families going to recover  from the months upon months upon months of high inflation that have  marked the Biden economy?   As I said, American families are suffering. Grocery bills are out of  control. Between August 2021 and August 2022, grocery bills rose at  their highest rate since 1979--1979, I was a senior in high school.  Even back-to-school supplies like pencils and glue are more expensive.   The National Retail Federation reported in July that households were  on track to spend an average of $864 on back-to-school shopping--a 24- percent increase from 2019.   Utility bills have soared. Things have gotten so bad that  approximately one out of every six households--one out of every six  households in America--is behind on its utility bills. Unfortunately,  considering the increases in the price of natural gas and electricity  since President Biden took office, it is not surprising. Forty percent  of households--40 percent--reported having difficulty paying for their  normal household expenses.   And Gallup reports that 56 percent of Americans--well over half of  the U.S. population--are experiencing financial hardship as a result of  inflation.   The personal savings rate has plunged to its lowest levels since  2009, and many Americans are dipping into their savings to make ends  meet. Others have taken up a side job or are pulling out the credit  card. Still others have been forced to rely on food banks.   As recently as Friday, President Biden was touting his work to  ``finally deliver an economy that works for working families.'' I have  to say, I don't know what ivory tower the President is living in, but  the Biden economy is the very opposite of an economy that works for  working families.   Working families in the Biden economy are struggling. They are  wondering how they can make ends meet. They are cutting back on  groceries like meat or milk. They are cutting back on family trips or  putting off necessary home repairs. They are, as I said, dipping into  their savings or charging necessities on their credit cards or visiting  food banks.   A recent CBS News article discussing a new Gallup poll noted:         The findings indicate that the hottest inflation in 40       years is eating into the bedrock of the American economy--the       middle-class--and even eroding the financial stability of       more well-heeled households.    To repeat:         The findings indicate that the hottest inflation in 40       years is eating into the bedrock of the American economy--the       middle-class.    This is not an economy that is--to paraphrase the President--being  built from the bottom up and the middle out. This is not an economy  that ``works for working families.'' This is an economy where living  standards for working families are declining.   The President has actually had the audacity to repeatedly bring up  the lines of cars waiting at food banks that occurred during the height  of the COVID pandemic, with the implication that things are different  now in the Biden economy. Perhaps no one at the White House has read  the news recently.   Here is a sampling of headlines from the past few weeks:         Las Vegas food banks experiencing heightened demand amid       inflation spikes.    Here is another one:         Food banks feeling pinch of high inflation as centers       juggle to increased demand for help.    Another headline:         New Hampshire food pantries struggle with rising costs,       growing demand: Organizations say more people than ever need       help.    Another headline:         St. Mary's Food Bank in Phoenix sees record number of       families in need amid inflation.    Yet another headline:         Mountain West food banks are strained by high customer       demand and low supply.    Unfortunately, I can go on. At this point, everyone knows how we got  here. Democrats took office and decided to pass a massive $1.9 trillion  spending bill, the so-called American Rescue Plan Act, that flooded the  economy with unnecessary government money. And the economy overheated  as a result.   When President Biden took office, the inflation rate was 1.4 percent,  well within the Fed's 2-percent target.   Democrats were warned, including by at least one noted economist from  their own party, that the legislation ran the risk of overheating the  economy. But they were committed to taking advantage of their new  majority to push through their Big Government, Big Spending vision. And  so they ignored the warnings, and their bill helped trigger the worst  inflation crisis in 40 years.   But perhaps the worst part is that even after Democrats saw the  damage that resulted from their American Rescue Plan spending spree,  they continued to try to double down on the spending strategy that  helped get us into this mess in the first place.   Democrats spent half of last year attempting to force through--if you  can believe this--yet another partisan spending spree originally  planned to cost up to $5 trillion. Fortunately for Americans, those  particular far-left fantasies were foiled. But that hasn't stopped  Democrats from continuing to accumulate wasteful government spending.   In August, Democrats forged through a partisan tax-and-spending bill  that will raise Americans' energy bills, reduce jobs and opportunities  for American workers, and waste taxpayer dollars on a host of Green New  Deal priorities, like electric vehicle tax credits for wealthy  Americans and road equity and identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage.  They called this tax-and-spending spree the Inflation Reduction Act,  even though--as even the Democrat chairman of the Senate Budget  Committee admitted--the bill will not reduce inflation. Apparently, the  title's only function is to make the bill sound more acceptable to  Americans who are sick and tired of dealing with soaring prices and  economic pain.    Then, a mere 8 days--8 days--after signing the so-called Inflation  Reduction Act, the President once again added to Democrats' record of  economic malfeasance with a massive student loan giveaway that could  cost more than $1 trillion and that the Committee for a Responsible  Federal Budget notes will ``meaningfully boost inflation.'' That from  the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.   I am not sure whether the Democrats are incapable of learning their  lesson or whether they consider soaring prices to be a trivial issue  next to implementing their Green New Deal agenda or whether they think  inflation is an acceptable price to pay for Big Government. But,  whatever it is, Democrats are apparently going to continue to ignore  the economic pain that Americans are experiencing in favor of  implementing their far-left, Big Government, and big-spending agenda.  And it appears that the American people are going to have to continue  to suffer as a result.   I yield the floor.
