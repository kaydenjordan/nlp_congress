 Mr. Speaker, I agree we have a serious problem  with multiemployer pensions which needs to be addressed. However, this  bill, I believe, will actually set us back.   It does nothing to address the underlying structural issues of these  plans. It actually does nothing to protect younger workers, who will be  asked to keep paying into a system which remains troubled. And it  saddles taxpayers with liabilities which are unlikely to be paid back,  at a massive cost to taxpayers.   Let me provide just one alarming example of how flawed this proposal  is, which I also highlighted in our committee markup.   Under this legislation, if a pension plan applies for a loan and the  newly created Pension Rehabilitation Administration cannot make a  determination on that plan's ability to repay in order to approve or  deny the loan within 90 days, the loan would be automatically deemed  approved.   Taxpayers deserve timely responses from Treasury, but no reputable  financial institution would rubberstamp loans like this.   Pensioners and taxpayers both deserve better. Let's work together to  deliver a real solution.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly urge opposition to this bill so that we can,  together, focus on a better solution.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
