 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  joint resolution (H.J. Res. 80) approving the request of the Secretary  of Veterans Affairs for a waiver under section 1703E(f) of title 38,  United States Code.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 80         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       approves the request for a waiver under section 1703E(f) of       title 38, United States Code, as submitted by the Secretary       on December 6, 2019.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.J. Res. 80.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 80 introduced by  Representative Roe of Tennessee, the ranking member of the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs.   This resolution would grant VA limited authority to conduct a dental  health access pilot, which VA has proposed under section 152 of the VA  MISSION Act of 2018.   Under section 152, VA can pilot healthcare payment and service  delivery models through its Center for Innovation for Care and Payment.   On December 6, 2019, VA submitted a section 152 report to Congress  proposing the Care Coordination for Dental Benefits program.   Through this pilot, VA would refer veterans who are ineligible for  dental benefits to private providers or community programs that offer  pro bono or discounted dental services. VA will not pay private  providers for the cost of these services under the pilot. To carry out  this dental referral service, the section 152 report contained a  request that Congress narrowly exempt or ``waive'' VA's authorizing  statute.   When a section 152 report contains a request from VA to ``waive'' its  authorizing statute, Congress must pass a joint resolution to approve a  waiver so VA can proceed with a pilot program. By passing this joint  resolution, we are approving VA's waiver request so it can pilot the  referral of veterans for free or low-cost dental care.   Madam Speaker, currently VA provides dental services for only about 8  percent of veterans who are enrolled in the VA healthcare system.  Generally, to receive dental care at VA's expense, veterans must have a  dental condition that is related to a service-connected disability, be  a former prisoner of war, be rated as 100 percent permanently and  totally disabled, or need dental services in preparation for a hospital  admission.   Under this pilot, VA will be able to coordinate dental care for the  remaining 92 percent of veterans ineligible for dental care.  Specifically, VA will provide administrative support potentially  through a call center and online self-service portal to educate and  assist these veterans in accessing community programs and providers  that offer pro bono or discounted dental services. According to VA,  community dental programs are available through federally qualified  health centers, community health centers, and the American Dental  Association.   Through this pilot, VA staff will be able to assist veterans in  scheduling appointments with dentists that participate in these  programs. VA staff will be authorized to obtain records from the dental  visits and provide them to veterans' VA primary care providers.   I support granting VA this limited waiver because it will not permit  VA to outsource more healthcare to private providers beyond its current  authority, and it will not drain precious resources from VA hospitals  and clinics.   I support this pilot because it has the potential to improve  veterans' access to dental care, and to improve the timeliness of that  care. Neglecting oral health can have serious medical consequences. For  example, clinical researchers have identified links between poor oral  health and other medical conditions such as heart disease, bacterial  pneumonia, and stroke.   VA estimates this pilot will be cost neutral, as there will be cost  savings from reducing emergency department visits associated with  delayed treatment or nontreatment of oral health issues.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.J. Res. 80.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As we welcome the new year and a new decade, I also want to take a  moment to recognize my colleague and ranking member of the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs, Dr. Phil Roe, who has announced he will be retiring  at the end of this Congress.   I salute my friend as a Vietnam veteran, as a doctor, and as a  tireless advocate for veterans across the country. I have served with  Dr. Roe since I was first elected to the House of Representatives in  2013, and I am proud of the bipartisan work we have done since then to  ensure we honor our Nation's commitment to our veterans.   Madam Speaker, this Congress alone, we have passed 40 bills out of  this committee with 36 passed out of the House and five signed into  law. Despite the political rancor, which takes up much of the oxygen in  Washington, D.C., this committee has set the standard for  bipartisanship in this body.   In 2015, though I was still fairly new to this committee, then- Chairman Roe invited several Members to join him on a congressional  delegation to Afghanistan to meet with servicemembers over the  Thanksgiving holiday. He set a great example, and I have worked to  replicate that example during my time as chairman. This past  Thanksgiving, we did just that. I took freshmen Members to spend the  holidays with those away from their families in service to our country.                                time  1645    During Dr. Roe's tenure as chairman of this committee, he was  gracious in approving travel to the border so I could better understand  the issues facing deported veterans. Following that trip, I, along with  fellow members Ranking Member Tim Walz and Representatives Vargas and  Coffman, requested additional information from the Department of  Homeland Security on this veteran population.   As a result, we learned that ICE did not know how many veterans it  had deported and failed to follow policies already in place that could  have shielded veterans from deportation.   Dr. Roe also has built on the hard work of former Ranking Member Walz  and helped lay the groundwork for our success in finally passing the  Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019. He helped me bring this  long-overdue legislation across the finish line, and I trust that he  will continue to work with me to ensure our true intent of the law is  implemented.   Madam Speaker, we have always worked to find common areas of  agreement. Because of his agreement to include key protections for  whistleblowers in the last Congress' VA Accountability and  Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017, I reluctantly supported that  legislation, but it is clear today that these protections are nowhere  near as strong as they should be. I hope Dr. Roe will join me in  pressing this administration to implement these to their true intent  and help ensure whistleblowers can come forward when they need to, free  from retaliation.   Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Roe for supporting this committee's  bipartisan work to preserve the power of veterans' voices and combat  online disinformation campaigns perpetrated by foreign trolls and  internet actors. I look forward to working with him to continue to  speak with a unified voice and help prevent the targeting of veterans  and servicemembers.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Ranking Member Roe on more than 11  years of hard work for the people of Tennessee and decades of service  to our country.   It is my hope that, despite it being an election year, we can  continue to come together and finish our work for our Nation's  veterans.   Madam Speaker, I ask that all of my colleagues join me in honoring  Dr. Roe for his many years of service but also in passing H.J. Res. 80.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
