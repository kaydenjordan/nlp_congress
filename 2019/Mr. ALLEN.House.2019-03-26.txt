 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to  commemorate the life of Dr. Lloyd Darby, III.   Dr. Darby was a Georgia-12 native and lifelong resident of Vidalia,  Georgia, and the lasting impact he leaves behind on behalf of the local  community, his friends, and his family will be remembered for  generations.   With a deep love for our Nation and a strong passion for serving  others, his many years as a U.S. Navy lieutenant, prominent dentist,  and instrumental political figure speaks volumes about his character.   Dr. Darby was a former chairman of the Toombs County Republican  Party, district chairman and member of the state GOP board, and a  delegate to the 1972 and 1976 Republican National Conventions.   Additionally, he served as chairman of the Friends of Mattingly  campaign during Mack Mattingly's tenure as U.S. Senator. He was the  first Republican Senator from Georgia elected since the Reconstruction  era.   Lloyd Darby was a man passionate about his faith. He cherished his  local community, loved his wife of 60 years, and his entire family  beyond measure.   Lloyd's passion was to give back a smile and to help those who  otherwise could not help themselves.   Robin and I send our heartfelt condolences and prayers to all of Dr.  Darby's family, friends, and community on a life well lived.                            ____________________
