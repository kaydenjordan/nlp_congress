 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of taking action to  lower healthcare and prescription drug costs.   In each of my townhalls, I heard from my neighbors that they are  tired of the politics; they can't afford the partisanship; and they  need Congress to be the adults in the room and to act now. I am proud  that my bill, the SAVE Act, has been incorporated into the bill that we  will be voting on today.   The SAVE Act came from a conversation, a single conversation, as I  reached across the aisle to Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick, put aside  our parties, and worked together to help the people we wake up every  day committed to serve.   Congress needs more conversations like that. Congress needs bold  action like the one we will be taking today. I call on our colleagues  in the House to recognize that our neighbors need healthcare relief,  and I call on our colleagues in the Senate to recognize that our  neighbors cannot wait for that relief to come.   This is our moment to act to lower healthcare costs. This is our  moment to get something done for the American people.
