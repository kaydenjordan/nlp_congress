 Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman  from Utah for yielding.   I rise in opposition to this bill and my colleagues' efforts to  impede the rapid growth of American energy exploration. This bill is  flawed in a number of ways, as we have recounted here already during  this debate.   First and foremost, it is clear that banning energy exploration will  increase the prices that families pay at the pump and the prices they  pay to power their homes.   Unfortunately, the tax on our Nation's energy producers aren't new.  We know what happens when government intervenes by imposing burdensome  regulations and senseless moratoriums like we are seeing today.   For years, New England States have pushed restrictive energy  policies, and what we are considering here on the floor is no  exception.   A handful of Governors and State legislatures are narrowly focused on  hindering the exploration and development of critical energy resources.  What those policies have resulted in are increased prices for  consumers, and they have done nothing to reduce demands for fossil  fuels.   In fact, as Congressman Duncan recounted just a few moments ago, last  year, those policies culminated in a Russian tanker delivering natural  gas to the Boston Harbor. Why? Because there weren't enough pipelines  available to bring it from nearby Pennsylvania. You heard it right.   Despite being just a few hundred miles from the Marcellus Shale, one  of the largest natural gas reserves in the country, our New England  States were forced to import natural gas from Vladimir Putin. Nobody on  this floor--the advocates of this bill--seem to have a problem with  that.   Now my colleagues want to implement these policies on a Federal level  with moratoriums on drilling. The event in Boston shows us that the  legislation before us would have no impact on reducing demand for  fossil fuels. We would simply have to import more from our adversaries.  That is not good policy.                                time  1515    As has been explained, to add to the madness, the bill is completely  irreconcilable with the Land and Water Conservation Fund, one of the  biggest priorities of the Natural Resources Committee in this Congress.   The LWCF receives its funding from oil revenues generated off the  coast of States like Louisiana, my home State. On the very same day  that the Natural Resources Committee marked up these bills to ban  offshore oil and gas exploration, the committee marked up another bill  to permanently fund the LWCF. The majority wants to see mandatory  spending of $900 million per year out of the LWCF, but at the same  time, it wants to eliminate completely its funding source. That is just  simply nonsense.   Our country is blessed with an abundance of natural resources. We  have the right to use those God-given resources to create jobs, foster  economic growth, and pave the way to an era of American energy  dominance. Oppressive policies like the ones before us today have been  our own worst enemy, forcing us to rely on hostile, foreign nations to  meet our energy demands. We simply can't do that any longer.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.
