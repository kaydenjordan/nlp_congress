 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, let me be clear: Drug costs in America are too high.  Republicans believe this, and so do Democrats. We all should work  together, though, to lower drug costs for consumers. We all  [[Page H10097]]  should work together to stop anticompetitive actions of pharmaceutical  companies that try to game the system and delay access to lower cost  alternative medicines. And we should all work together--together, Mr.  Chair--to pass legislation that both lowers drug costs, without killing  off medical innovation.   Unfortunately, H.R. 3 fails on this count. And that is not just my  conclusion, Mr. Chair. The great American innovators who are working  day and night to find cures to Alzheimer's, to cancer, to ALS, to  Parkinson's, and the hundreds of other diseases and life-changing  therapies are pleading with us for a ``no'' vote to H.R. 3--the  Democrats' plan.   Mr. Chair, 138 different biotech companies signed a letter to  Congress 5 days ago. After reading the bill, they wrote: ``This extreme  proposal will upend the ecosystem of U.S. biomedical innovation,  destroying our ability to attract private sector investment.''   These are the companies who develop the new innovations in medicine.  They said H.R. 3 will shatter the dreams of patients hoping for  lifesaving cures.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the letter in support from those  companies.                                                  December 5, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House Republican Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader McCarthy: We       represent the community of emerging biotechnology companies       whose researchers and scientists strive daily to develop       innovative life-changing therapies and cures for patients. We       take pride that we are providing hope to patients and their       families and changing the world through medical       breakthroughs. These dreams will be shattered if H.R. 3, the       Lower Drug Costs Now Act, if passed.        We are at an incredible inflection point in science and       technology that is bringing forth transformative treatments       and even cures for cancer, infectious diseases, and a myriad       of other serious and rare diseases. These advancements are       benefiting lives of millions of patients and alleviating       human suffering, while helping to reduce other more expensive       parts of our health care system, such as hospital spending.       Our continued success depends on maintaining an environment       that supports investment in tomorrow's discoveries.        Unfortunately, H.R. 3 is an unprecedented and aggressive       government intervention in the U.S. market of drug       development and delivery that will limit patient access to       these extraordinary advancements in health care. This extreme       proposal will upend the ecosystem of U.S. biomedical       innovation, destroying our ability to attract private       investment dollars that allow us to develop new treatments       and change the course of healthcare delivery for so many       patients.        We strongly urge you to abandon H.R. 3. Further, in order       to keep pace with this biomedical revolution and ensure       America remains the world leader in innovation, we hope that       you will pursue bipartisan, holistic policies that modernize       our health care payment system and lower drug costs for       patients.

Mr. Chair, the Congressional Budget Office, they also  looked at H.R. 3, Speaker Pelosi's bill, and they said it would kill  off more than 38 new medical innovations--38.   The Council of Economic Advisers, they looked at it and said they  thought it would be more like 100 new medicines that would be lost. It  is no wonder that President Trump, the country's strongest advocate for  lowering drug prices, said even he could not support H.R. 3, and would  have to veto it.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration  Policy.                     Statement of Administration Policy   h.r. 3--the elijah e. cummings lower drug costs now act--rep. pallone,                          d-nj, and 106 cosponsors         The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 3, which       contains several provisions that would harm seniors and all       who need lifesaving medicines. Nevertheless, as Congress       follows the President's lead on reducing prescription drug       costs, the Administration welcomes bipartisan efforts to       enact legislation that provides additional prescription drug-      cost relief for American families.        In its current form, H.R. 3 would likely undermine access       to lifesaving medicines. The bill creates a statutory scheme       for ``negotiation'' between the Secretary of Health and Human       Services and pharmaceutical manufacturers regarding the price       of prescription drugs, but the penalty for failing to reach       agreement with the Secretary is so large that the Secretary       could effectively impose price controls on manufacturers.       Moreover, this price-fixing mechanism places price controls       on drugs available under Medicare and commercial plans, and       imposes devastating fines on manufacturers, raising serious       concerns under the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause and       Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause.        This bill would also compromise the health of Americans by       dramatically reducing the incentive to bring innovative       therapeutics to market. The preliminary Congressional Budget       Office (CBO) analysis indicates that the bill would reduce       the number of new medicines coming to market. The Council of       Economic Advisers (CEA) finds that H.R. 3's price controls       would affect as much as one third of drugs under development,       meaning that out of 300 projected new medicines that would       otherwise be approved over 10 years by the Food and Drug       Administration, 100 could be severely delayed or never       developed. As a result, CEA estimates H.R. 3 would erase a       quarter of the expected gains in life expectancy in the       United States over the next decade.        The preliminary CBO analysis of H.R. 3 does not account for       the additional costs that would burden families and the       Federal Government due to the unavailability of lifesaving       and cost-reducing medicine that would otherwise exist. For       example, an Alzheimer's cure, or new treatments for site       specific cancers or diabetes, may be delayed or never       developed under the regime imposed by H.R. 3. Thus, the cost       of caring for a growing and aging population with direct       care, skilled nursing, and home health could be substantially       greater than the drug-cost savings estimated by CBO. More       importantly, the effects of these cost increases on       individuals and their families will be significant, personal,       and long-lasting.        This legislation does include important policies championed       by the Trump Administration to lower prescription drug costs.       These include establishing a cap on out-of-pocket expenses       for all beneficiaries in Medicare Part D and simplifying and       improving that program. H.R. 3 also would limit annual price       increases of certain drugs in Medicare to the rate of       inflation, protecting beneficiaries and taxpayers from       excessive price hikes. These provisions reflect the       Administration's priorities, although modifications should be       made to strike a better balance in protecting beneficiaries,       taxpayers, and innovation.        The Administration strongly prefers the Prescription Drug       Pricing Reduction Act of 2019, which was reported out of the       Senate Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis. This       legislation offers a sound approach to delivering relief to       seniors from high prescription drug costs while safeguarding       the ongoing development of life-saving and sustaining       medicines.        Additionally, H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act,       shares many of the same bipartisan elements of the       Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act and is also a far       better approach to lowering drug prices and discovering life-      saving cures than H.R. 3.        The President believes there is a path forward to enacting       bipartisan legislation that lowers prescription drug costs       for American families. The Administration remains committed       to working with both parties to pass legislation that will       lower drug costs while encouraging innovation in the       development of lifesaving medicines.        If H.R. 3 were presented to the President in its current       form, he would veto the bill.    Mr. Chair, my friends on the other side, the Democrats,  ignore these facts. Some have even said--can you imagine this--that it  is ``worth it'' to forego cures.   Seriously? That it is worth it to never have a cure for Alzheimer's?   Is it worth it to never have a cure for ALS?   What about Huntington's Disease, or Parkinson's, or rheumatoid  arthritis? The answer for me is ``no,'' because one lost cure is one  too many.   The Independent Congressional Research Service also read through H.R.  3. They said it is unconstitutional, most likely because of the huge  and punitive club that it hands the government. You see, if an  innovator, under the bill on the floor today that the Democrats have,  if an innovator does not agree with the price that the government  demands, then the government can take 95 percent of that company's  revenues for the sale of that drug--95 percent.   Oh, by the way, it is actually higher than that because you can't  deduct it and they have to pay tax. Democrats call that a negotiation.  I call that a mugging, Mr. Chair, a mugging.   Their scheme is based on what happens with drugs in six other  countries. And they ignore that in these referenced countries and other  countries around the world, people are actually denied access to  lifesaving medicines that Americans have access to. So this is the  tradeoff here.   If you remember nothing else, it is that we first get access to  medicines, and in the countries the bill would emulate and copy and  bring the process here, you don't get access to some of these  lifesaving drugs that Americans do here. That is your trade.   Let me tell you about the family of Katie Stafford:   She is a child living with cystic fibrosis in the United Kingdom. She  was told by officials she cannot receive the medicine that her doctor  determined would be the best chance at treating her life-threatening  condition, because they don't cover it in the United Kingdom under  their system.   Let me tell you about Andre and Joshua: They are Canadian brothers,  tragically both suffering from cystic fibrosis. Their parents had to  beg the Canadian Government to cover treatment for their sons as they  slowly lose their lung function. Now, their oldest son is enrolled in a  clinical trial that the youngest son is ineligible for. So they must  watch as one child gets help and the other child's health declines.   Fortunately, Mr. Chair, American children have access to this new  medicine. We cannot allow this to happen in the United States. Denial  of care is not an American value.   But I want to be clear: We all agree that Americans do pay too much  for prescription drugs, and we need to come back together as  Republicans and Democrats to help solve this issue. There is a better  way, because we can reduce the cost of drugs. We can improve  healthcare, and we can lower long-term costs, but we don't have to do  it at the expense of great American innovation while restricting  patient's access to lifesaving medicines.   There is a way to do this. In fact, Members will have an opportunity  to support, really, the only bipartisan legislation to come to the  floor, H.R. 19. You will see it as a substitute, the Lower Costs, More  Cures Act, which we will offer as a substitute amendment, is the  bipartisan solution. It can be signed into law this year--this year-- not vetoed, not never gain attention in the Senate like H.R. 3 will  find itself, if it gets there, but this can become law.   This is where we can join together and immediately begin to provide  relief to patients and seniors from high prescription drug costs. This  bill lowers out-of-pocket spending, protects access to new medicines  and cures, strengthens transparency and accountability, and champions  competition and innovation. And most importantly, every single  proposal, Mr. Chair, every single proposal in H.R. 19, the substitute,  is bipartisan work--Democrats and Republicans. We give you this option.                                time  1830    This is a serious proposal. It has been described that way. It could  be signed, would be signed into law by the President by the end of this  year. So let's not force a partisan plan that, frankly, puts politics  over progress, that kills medical innovation and cures.   Instead, can't we come together and pass meaningful bipartisan  legislation,  [[Page H10099]]  get it across the finish line and actually find lower costs and more  cures for Americans?   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Latta).

Zaltrap--colorectal cancer    Mr Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Hudson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), an incredible, important member of our  committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), the top Republican on the Health Subcommittee of  the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the top Republican on the Oversight and  Investigation Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from West  Virginia (Mr. McKinley), an important member of our committee.    Mr. Chairman, I want to say that we cannot lose sight of  how anti-innovation H.R. 3 is. We cannot lose sight of how many cures  will never come around as a result. These aren't my conclusions. They  are, but they are also the conclusions of the Congressional Budget  Office and the Council of Economic Advisers.  [[Page H10103]]    Hundreds of new drugs will never come to market. Medicines will never  be created. We know that 10 percent fewer drugs will enter the market  every year in the 2030s and every year thereafter as a result of H.R.  3.   This bill will leave people behind. It will result in earlier deaths  than otherwise should happen.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Griffith).    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I would point out that the Republican alternative also  caps costs for seniors, again, for the first time. We believe there is  a place where that needs to happen for our seniors.   In the committee, Republicans offered up an amendment that would have  taken all the middleman profits, the rebates, and put them toward  making insulin at no cost for seniors at the pharmacy counter.  Unfortunately, every Democrat on the committee voted against that. Why,  I do not know, but they did.   We want more cures and we want lower costs. We can have both.   There is no dispute among us, Republicans and Democrats, that drugs  are too high. The question is: Can we find a scheme that is  constitutional, and does it eliminate cures for diseases that people  are relying on and shut down innovation in America?   I think we can, by the way. I think that is H.R. 19. We will deal  with that later.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Johnson).    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I just want to point out a couple of things.   First of all, what is really unacceptable is to kill off American  innovation in this space. We know from the biotech people who are doing  this innovation, they have written us saying it will shatter the hopes  and dreams of Americans waiting for cures. It will completely upend the  ecosystem of innovation.   America is where the innovation occurs. We don't think that has to  happen to bring down the costs of drugs, which we also support.   We also don't think you should end up in a system like this where, in  these countries that they want to emulate, like Australia, Canada,  France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom, all new medications  that we have here, they only have between 30 and 60 percent.   In fact, in cancer, there are 27 to 50 percent fewer cancer drugs in  these countries. There is a range here, Madam Chair, that are  available. So, if you get cancer, if you were in America here, you  might get a drug that would prolong your life or cure your cancer. In  these countries, you have a run of 27 to 50 percent chance you won't  get that drug; diabetes, 10 to 50 percent fewer; respiratory, 17 to 50  percent fewer.   They, in part, control their costs because they deny access to care  of the lifesaving new cutting-edge drugs that we innovate.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Walberg), a very important member of our committee.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, we have heard this refrain before that it is worth it,  worth it not to have a cure. A cure for what? We don't know.   We know that there are 100 drugs that will never be developed because  of H.R. 3. That is what the Council of Economic Advisers said. The  Congressional Budget Office says 38 in the next 20 years will never be  developed.   Is that the cure for Alzheimer's? Is that the cure for Parkinson's?  Is that the cure for ALS?   Madam Chair, the gentleman says it is worth it to upend the entire  ecosystem of innovation in America. That is what we just heard. We  heard it in committee too: It is okay. We don't need a cure for this,  that, or the other thing.   138 of these great American innovators wrote us and said it is not  worth it. This bill is going to shatter the hopes and dreams of people  who are hoping that there will be a cure for cystic fibrosis or sickle  cell anemia or SMA.   Oh, by the way, we are developing those cures, but this bill, H.R. 3,  kills innovation in America, and that means people will die because  they didn't get those drugs because they were never invented.   We don't have to do that to bring down the cost of drugs. There are  bipartisan ways to bring down the cost of drugs without destroying  medical innovation in America, and we want to work with you to do this.   H.R. 3 is the purely partisan bill on the floor.   The proposal we have is all bipartisan, Republican and Democrat ideas  put together that will have a positive effect on bringing down drug  prices. It will stop the gaming of the system, and it will result in  more cures.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter), Congress' only pharmacist, an outspoken advocate for our  legislation and doing the right thing for patients, whom he greeted at  the pharmacy counter every day.    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Georgia.                                time  1915     Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I can't help but just respond. Our information is based  on fact, not rhetoric. It comes from the independent Congressional  Budget Office that works for all of us. And when they evaluated H.R. 3,  they are the ones--at CBO, the Congressional Budget Office--that said  that the Democrats' plan, the Pelosi plan, would result in fewer new  drug products being developed and coming to market.   CBO is the one, not Big Pharma. You can throw that around all you  want, but it is the Congressional Budget Office that said 38 new cures  that could be developed in the next 20 years would be lost in  development because of this bill--38. Up to 38.   It was the Council of Economic Advisers that said upwards of 100 new  cures, new medicines, would not come to market because of H.R. 3.   The great American innovators wrote to the Speaker and wrote to the  Republican leader and said the dreams of life-changing therapies and  cures for patients would be ``shattered'' by H.R. 3. They said that,  unfortunately, H.R. 3 is an unprecedented and aggressive government  intervention in the U.S. market of drug development and delivery that  will limit patient access to these extraordinary advancements in care.   These are the people that--when they get a cure for cystic fibrosis;  when they develop a cure for sickle cell; when, hopefully, they develop  a cure for diabetes--we will all rush out to say, ``We helped. We  funded NIH. They did an important role.''   And NIH funding is extremely important, but it is these innovators  that do the actual development of the drugs. In fact, the Congressional  Budget Office said, when it comes to H.R. 3 spending for NIH, that the  effects of the new drug introductions from increased Federal spending  under the bill on biomedical research would be modest--modest. Okay.   We have all supported increases in additional research at NIH. It is  an important element of this. But it is actually the innovators spread  all across the country and these tiny little startups, in some cases,  that are begging us not to blow up the system to get drug prices down.   We can get drug prices down. We are willing to work on both sides of  the aisle to do that. You don't have to destroy innovation in America  and lifesaving cures for patients to get there. H.R. 3, independent  analyses show, would do exactly that.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Stivers).     Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his  remarks. I am hopeful that, after this political exercise of H.R. 3 is  done, we can work on a bipartisan basis on needed part D modernization  like we were doing before the Speaker, unfortunately, shut down these  discussions.   When we do so, I look forward to working with the gentleman from Ohio  to ensure that the vulnerable LIS population is not unintentionally  adversely impacted.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  appreciate the gentleman for bringing up this important issue.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Allen) for 1 minute.    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let's go through this really quickly.   Democrats have said it is worth it not to have future cures. That is  point one. They have said that: worth it not to have future cures.   Congressional Budget Office tells us up to 38 cures will not come  about because of H.R. 3.   They have said we want to model America after foreign countries, and  the facts show that in foreign countries you have less access to  lifesaving drugs for cancer, diabetes, respiratory issues, and  cardiovascular.   The chart on the far side here lists those drugs individually. We are  not making this up. This is fact. We can do this better. We can work  together.    The Congressional Budget Office said, when we created Medicare part  D--which I was here for and supported--that having the government in  charge of pricing would have a negligible effect in terms of the  savings. I think they believe that today.   But if you want to restrict access to drugs, if you want to deny new  cures to patients, if you want to go on a system where you die because  the medicine is not available in your country, then vote for H.R. 3.   If you don't, if you want to have lower drug prices, stop the gaming  by the pharmaceutical companies and have more cures, then support our  alternative.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
