 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2440) to provide for the use of funds in the Harbor  Maintenance Trust Fund for the purposes for which the funds were  collected and to ensure that funds credited to the Harbor Maintenance  Trust Fund are used to support navigation, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2440         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2440, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this has been a long time coming. Ronald Reagan worked  with the Democratic Congress and passed a tax, a tax paid by every  American, Americans in Arkansas and every other State. Every time you  buy an imported good that came through a container into our country,  you pay a minuscule sales tax. Most Americans don't know that, but  Congress is well aware of it. And for decades, Congress has been  stealing that money.   The money was intended to maintain our harbors and our ports,  critical to a maritime nation, critical to our competitiveness in the  world economy. And our ports are in pathetic condition around the  Nation.   As we hear so much about our crumbling infrastructure, the surface  bill that I am working on--our wastewater, our drinking water--we don't  have any money. Well, here we have the money. We actually have the  money. We have taken it from the American people. They have paid that  tax, but Congress is stealing it and not applying it to harbors.   This has been a bipartisan problem over the years. It was Republicans  and Democrats who created this program, and it has been Democratic  administrations and Republican administrations that have been diverting  these needed funds.   On a daily basis, our largest ports have only about 38 percent of  their authorized capacity. That means longer lines of ships out to sea  and more costs in the movement of goods and particularly for our  exports.   I will note that this bill is strongly supported by the Senator from  Alabama, Senator Shelby, and Senator Shelby supports it because of the  need to export from his State. And guess what? A bunch of those exports  come from the State of Arkansas.   Why would someone from that State where half of their soybean crop is  exported, where they have $3.1 billion in agricultural exports, be  opposed to more efficiently moving their goods out of the country and  adding costs to their farmers? I don't understand.   But there are some people inland who think ports don't affect them.  Ports affect every single American every day. Goods that are imported  cost more when our harbors aren't dredged properly. And our trade  deficit grows when we are not competitive in the world economy.   I started working on this 23 years ago with a guy named Bud Shuster.  His son, Bill Shuster, succeeded him as chairman of that committee over  the last 6 years before we took back over the House. Twice we moved  that bill out of the committee unanimously, including provisions to  spend the harbor maintenance tax on harbor maintenance.   Now, that is a radical idea to some people inside the beltway in  Washington, D.C., people who just have their focus right here in  Washington. They are not focused on the Nation, the needs of the  Nation, the needs of their farmers, the needs of others who are  exporting and importing goods, about a great maritime Nation that is  falling behind, that isn't going to be ready to accept the largest new  ships because we don't have the money to dredge the harbors.   Well, we have the money. $10 billion of it is sitting over in the  Treasury, but there are those here who do not want to spend that money  on its lawful purpose. They will say, oh, my God, it breaks the budget  caps. Really? The budget caps?   The deficit this year was $397 billion higher than when President  Obama left office. Now, who has been in charge the last 2 years? Who  wrote those budgets to put us up to nearly $1 trillion? And now we are  going to say we can't afford to dredge our harbors, that we should just  shut them down.   Shut them down. Let them silt in. Let the jetties decay. No, we can't  afford it.   We can afford it. This is one place with bipartisan support where we  can meet our infrastructure needs without raising a new tax on the  American people.   This administration actually had some concern about the underspending  of the tax and the diversion of the money to the Treasury, so the  President's budget proposed to cut the tax instead of dealing with our  harbors and saying let's spend the money. But that was written by Mick  Mulvaney, the President's Chief of Staff, and OMB.                                time  1515    The President himself, when I was in a meeting with him discussing  infrastructure and I said, ``We have $10 billion, Mr. President,  sitting in the bank ready to be spent on infrastructure needs at our  ports,'' he turned to Larry Kudlow and he says, ``Spend that money.''   That is where the President stands. That is where Senator Shelby  stands. He has been trying to get it into any and every bill moving  into the Senate. Every one of these budget deals, he is trying to get  it in.   So here today we are going to hear arguments that we can't afford to  spend the taxes that have been taken from the American people on the  purpose for which it was intended. I do not agree with that argument.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                         Committee on the Budget,                                      Washington, DC, June 26, 2019.      Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio: I write to confirm our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 2440, the Full Utilization of       the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Act. H.R. 2440 contains       provisions that fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on the Budget. However, the committee agrees to       waive formal consideration of the bill.        The Committee on the Budget takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment to any House-Senate conference       convened on this legislation or similar legislation and       requests your support if such a request is made.        In particular, the committee should be involved in any       discussions regarding creation of adjustments to       discretionary spending limits and how they relate to the       appropriate level for overall discretionary spending limits.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding,  [[Page H8481]]       and I ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this       matter be included in the committee report on H.R. 2440 and       in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of       H.R. 2440.        Thank you for your attention to these matters.            Sincerely,                                                      John Yarmuth,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                     Washington, DC, July 12, 2019.      Hon. John Yarmuth,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Yarmuth: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       2440, the Full Utilization of the Harbor Maintenance Trust       Fund Act. I appreciate your decision to waive formal       consideration of the bill.        I agree that the Committee on the Budget has valid       jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this important       legislation, and I further agree that by forgoing formal       consideration of the bill, the Committee on the Budget is not       waiving any jurisdiction over any relevant subject matter.       Additionally, I will support the appointment of conferees       from the Committee on the Budget should a House-Senate       conference be convened on this legislation. Finally, this       exchange of letters will be included in the Congressional       Record should the bill be considered on the floor.        Thank you again and I look forward to continuing to work       collaboratively with the Committee on the Budget on this       important issue.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,                                                             Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, ``So we can't do it now. We would like to do it another  time.'' I have heard that on the floor for the last 6 years when we did  the Water Resources Development Act that came bipartisan and unanimous  out of the Transportation Committee when the Republicans chaired it and  this year when I chaired it, bipartisan out of the committee. ``We will  fix it later, because the technical Budget Act is going to be violated  and the caps are going to be violated.''   Well, I would observe that I believe the gentleman was here and the  gentleman voted for the tax cuts. And in that, when Obama left office,  we had a deficit of $587 billion. This year, it is $984 billion due to,  principally, the tax cuts.   So waive all the rules when it comes to cutting taxes, but when it  comes to taking a tax--and it isn't just collected from the shippers.  Every American pays more for every imported good that comes through a  port, with the intention, in a bill signed by Ronald Reagan, that that  money would be spent to maintain those harbors.   As I pointed out, this has been a bipartisan problem: Clinton, Bush,  Obama, all of them. And even the budgets proposed by Mick Mulvaney in  the name of the President would further cut harbor maintenance. So we  would continue to collect the tax from the American people for harbor  maintenance and continue to divert it over here.   How can you increase the deficit in any rational world when you are  spending taxes that have already been collected, that are deposited in  the Treasury of the United States and can only be spent on harbor  maintenance, and you are not spending them? That is increasing the  deficit? Seriously? Oh, come on.   Now, I would note that, in a rare moment, we have a list here of 70  organizations who support this legislation, including the Association  of General Contractors of America, who are going to key-vote this  issue. They realize how critical this is for the future of the American  economy, a great maritime nation. The Association of General  Contractors will key-vote this issue.   We also have the National Grain and Feed Association and a long list  of others on here who support this.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of supporters of H.R.  2440.       Supporters of H.R. 2440, the ``Full Utilization of the Harbor                        Maintenance Trust Fund Act''                        (Updated: October 28, 2019)         American Association of Port Authorities, American       Association of State Highway, Transportation Officials,       American Great Lakes Ports Association, American Petroleum       Institute, American Society of Civil Engineers, Associated       General Contractors of America, Association of Equipment       Manufacturers, Big River Coalition, Boat U.S., Cedar Bayou       (Texas) Navigation District, Columbia River Bar Pilots,       Columbia River Pilots, Columbia River Steamship Operators       Association, Dredging Contractors of America, Florida Ports       Council, Great Lakes Small Harbors Coalition, Gulf Ports       Association.

So, we can talk a lot about making a major investment in  infrastructure. We have been hung up on how are we going to pay for  service, transportation; 47,000 bridges need repair or replacement; 40  percent of the National Highway System is deteriorated to the point we  have to rebuild it, not just recoat it; and there is a $100 billion  backlog in transit just to bring it up to a state of good repair.   Those are just the needs in surface. Then you go to wastewater. Then  you go to airports. Then you go to drinking water.   But guess what? For every single one of those things, we are going to  have to raise revenues one way or another.   But this one thing, the need to invest in our harbors, we have the  money. It is sitting in the bank, and we are being told, because of the  budget caps, it can't be spent. Seriously?   The President himself said, when I was there, ``Spend that money.''  So if we get the bill through the House, if they don't derail it and it  gets through the Senate, the President will sign it, plain and simple.   This is common sense outside the beltway, but just budget weirdness  inside.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Stewart)  would just stand there for a moment, I will yield him some time for a  colloquy.   Name another program with a dedicated tax where we are diverting the  money over to the Treasury instead of spending it on a well-documented  need. Just name another program where we do that.    Mr. Speaker, I reclaim my time.   Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would research that. He can't name one.   Mr. Speaker, we are taking this money. It is a sales tax. The  American people are paying it. It is like some of you live in sales tax  States. I don't live in a sales tax State, but my people are still  paying this sales tax on imported goods, and they expect the money, as  Ronald Reagan signed that bill, to be spent on maintaining our harbors.  And I can list the needs in my harbors that aren't being met today  because the Corps of Engineers are underfunded. But we are hearing,  ``We can't do this.'' And the other argument here is: This busts the  caps and it breaks the agreement.   No. All of this money which has been taken from the American people  and deposited in the Treasury is subject to appropriation. So it gives  discretion to the appropriators to determine whether or not we will  finally honor our compact with the American people and spend the harbor  maintenance tax on harbor maintenance, not on illusory deficit  reduction.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I always enjoy hearing from the gentleman.  He is right that we are underspending the Land and Water Conservation  Fund, but it is not a tax assessed individually on the American people  as a sales tax. It is fees paid by the oil and gas industry, which you  can say: Oh, they are having to pay a fee to use Federal land,  [[Page H8483]]  to take and extract a resource. Therefore, it is not quite the same  thing.    I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, the Federal gas and  diesel tax hasn't changed since 1993, so the American people are not  paying for that. The price of oil goes up and down according to  speculation and wars and conflicts and all sorts of other things. But  the fact is that is a fee paid by the oil companies that might or might  not come out of their profits and goes into a fund, which is being  underspent.   To be consistent, I fully support and have supported fully expending  the Land and Water Conservation Fund on a permanent program, on its  intended and legislated purpose, and that is the same thing here.   But this is, again, a little different. Anybody, today, who bought a  good that came into a port in the United States of America in a  container is paying a very small sales tax increment on that good on a  bill signed by Ronald Reagan. That money is supposed to be spent to  maintain our harbors.   Our harbors are silting in. Jetties are falling apart. We can't  accommodate, in some harbors that want to accommodate them, the new  largest class of ships in the world.   The most efficient way to move goods is on water. The least carbon- intensive way is to move goods on water. But we are impeding that by  not spending this tax for the purpose for which it was intended and  which is legislated in law. That is all we are asking to do here today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I reserve the  right to close.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman said he wants healthy trust funds. Well,  we got a heck of a healthful trust fund when it comes to harbor  maintenance, but we also have a massive deficit in harbor maintenance.   We are projecting that we are going to need an extra $15.8 billion  between now and just 2020 to meet the demands of larger and heavier  ships that are going to come through the Panama Canal and come here.  How are we going to meet that? Well, we could spend the harbor  maintenance trust fund on harbor maintenance, but, no, it wasn't part  of the budget caps.   Go out and tell that to people who are dependent upon getting their  goods in and out of the Nation's ports and say: Oh, well. Sorry. We  can't do that jetty. We can't dredge that harbor because we can't spend  the money that we took from you and put in the bank, even though the  need is not being met.   I don't think that is a real winning subject outside the beltway. But  inside the beltway, it resonates with certain people.   Again, I am pleased to hear from the National Taxpayers Union. The  Association of General Contractors will key vote this issue.   This is a program created during the Reagan administration, signed by  Ronald Reagan. The money has been diverted by both Democratic  Presidents and Republican Presidents for years. It is time to stop  doing that.   This President expressed personally to me, in a meeting, that he  wants to stop diverting that money. Mick Mulvaney, following the line  of arguing we are having here, keeps trying to cut the spending on  harbor maintenance so they can divert more of the tax paid by the  American people to create illusory deficit reduction by putting the  money in the bank.   How does that reduce the deficit? It doesn't reduce the deficit. It  doesn't.   In the real world, it is the Budget Act and its definitions that we  are talking about here, not the real needs of the American people, not  the real needs of the American ports, not the real needs of our  shippers, and not the real needs of our exporters. That is what we are  talking about here today.   We can hear tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. ``We  will get to it some other time.'' Twenty-three years ago, I started  working on this with Republican Chairman Bud Shuster--23 years, a  quarter of a century.   This is something we can do for the American people. The President  ran on providing trillions of dollars of infrastructure investment. So  far, all the budgets written by Mick Mulvaney and that hench-person he  has over at OMB now actually have proposed reductions in transportation  spending and have proposed reductions in harbor maintenance, even  though we have a dedicated tax that can pay for it.   In any sensible world, we would take the dedicated tax and spend it  on its lawful purpose, and the only lawful purpose is to get into our  ports and rebuild the jetties and dredge for the larger ships that are  coming to America so we can be more competitive as a maritime nation  and maybe reduce the trade deficit.   There was a lot of discussion about the deficit. Again, I would just  recall that the deficit is up almost $400 billion in 2 years--2 years  during which the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the  White House.                                time  1545    I think it had something to do with a tax cut, $3 trillion. Didn't  hear much about budget caps or deficit concerns.   Oh, wait a minute. It is going to pay for itself. It was going to  raise revenues. It didn't raise revenues. Revenues didn't get raised.  And, oh, by the way, it didn't pay for itself.   So I would hope that Members here will realize that the vast number  of Americans--I bet if you went out and polled them, saying, ``You are  paying a little tax here for harbor maintenance, and it is being  deposited in the Treasury to make the deficit look smaller; do you  think that is a good idea?'' I think that would be one thing that  people on both sides of the aisle, all across America would say, no,  spend the money on our ports.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill  [[Page H8485]]  (H.R. 1306) to amend the Disaster Recovery Reform Act to develop a  study regarding streamlining and consolidating information collection  and preliminary damage assessments, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

STUDY TO STREAMLINE AND CONSOLIDATE INFORMATION                     COLLECTION AND PRELIMINARY DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS.         ``(a) Information Collection.--Not later than 2 years after       the date of enactment of this section, the Administrator, in       coordination with the Small Business Administration, the       Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Disaster       Assistance Working Group of the Council of the Inspectors       General on Integrity and Efficiency, and other appropriate       agencies, shall--        ``(1) conduct a study and develop a plan, consistent with       law, under which the collection of information from disaster       assistance applicants and grantees will be modified,       streamlined, expedited, efficient, flexible, consolidated,       and simplified to be less burdensome, duplicative, and time       consuming for applicants and grantees; and        ``(2) develop a plan for the regular collection and       reporting of information on Federal disaster assistance       awarded, including the establishment and maintenance of a       website for presenting the information to the public.        ``(b) Preliminary Damage Assessments.--Not later than 2       years after the date of enactment of this section, the       Administrator, in consultation with the Council of the       Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, shall convene       a working group on a regular basis with the Secretary of       Labor, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget,       the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Administrator       of the Small Business Administration, the Secretary of       Transportation, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for       Economic Development, and other appropriate agencies as the       Administrator considers necessary, to--        ``(1) identify and describe the potential areas of       duplication or fragmentation in preliminary damage       assessments after disaster declarations;        ``(2) determine the applicability of having 1 Federal       agency make the assessments for all agencies; and        ``(3) identify potential emerging technologies, such as       unmanned aircraft systems, consistent with the requirements       established in the FEMA Accountability, Modernization and       Transparency Act of 2017 (42 U.S.C. 5121 note), to expedite       the administration of preliminary damage assessments.        ``(c) Comprehensive Report.--The Administrator shall submit       1 comprehensive report that comprises the plans developed       under subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) and a report of the       findings of the working group convened under subsection (b),       which may include recommendations, to the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate.        ``(d) Public Availability.--The comprehensive report       developed under subsection (c) shall be made available to the       public and posted on the website of the Federal Emergency       Management Agency--        ``(1) in pre-compressed, easily downloadable versions that       are made available in all appropriate formats; and        ``(2) in machine-readable format, if applicable.        ``(e) Sources of Information.--In preparing the       comprehensive report, any publication, database, or web-based       resource, and any information compiled by any government       agency, nongovernmental organization, or other entity that is       made available may be used.        ``(f) Briefing.--Not later than 180 days after submission       of the comprehensive report, the Administrator of the Federal       Emergency Management Agency, or a designee, and a member of       the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and       Efficiency, or a designee, shall brief, upon request, the       appropriate congressional committees on the findings and any       recommendations made in the comprehensive report.''.        (b) Technical Amendment.--The item relating to section 1223       in the table of contents of the FAA Reauthorization Act of       2018 (Public Law 115-254) is amended to read as follows:  ``Sec. 1223. Study to streamline and consolidate information collection                and preliminary damage assessments.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1306, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be standing on the floor here with my  colleague, Mr. Meadows, at this time, perhaps a bit more in agreement.   So this bill, H.R. 1306, the Federal Disaster Assistance Coordination  Act, was introduced by Representatives Meadows and Peters. It amends  the Disaster Recovery Reform Act, DRRA, so-called, to help Federal  agencies streamline and consolidate information, collection, and  preliminary damage assessments following disasters.   When a disaster occurs, Americans don't have time to wait around for  the bureaucracy to get the assistance that they are entitled to. Today,  there are too many barriers that stand between emergency response and  Americans in crisis due to a disaster, whether it is a flood, a  hurricane, a wildfire, or an earthquake. Whatever the disaster might  be, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other Federal agencies  are supposed to be there to help.   Currently, the implementation of those recovery efforts and that  disaster assistance is hampered by inefficient information collection  and assessments conducted by multiple agencies. Some of them even come  in like a year after the fact and say: Wait a minute. We didn't  authorize that. That kind of thing has got to stop.   So this will remove information collection barriers that currently  impede disaster aid. It creates a working group to identify duplicative  assessments--we don't need to waste money on those--and it proposes  getting rid of them by administrative rule or, if necessary, by  legislation.   Further, it would streamline Federal disaster recovery efforts by  concluding that a single agency is sufficient to conduct damage  assessments to account for the needs of disaster victims.   Again, we have multiple agencies with conflicting opinions and  numbers, and sometimes they come back to communities and want money  back. Really? The other agency approved the money. Oh, but you didn't  think--this has got to be done better, more efficiently, in  coordination with a single lead. So I am pleased that this bill is  before us today.   Mr. Speaker, I obviously recommend an ``aye'' vote, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I don't see any additional speakers, so I  am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just in reference to what the gentleman said earlier,  once, when Barney Frank used to serve here, I was friendly with one of  the recording clerks, and she would rate how many words per minute  people could talk. Barney was faster than me. Sometimes I would be  sitting here and people would say: What did he say? And I said: Oh, I  can translate that. So I grew up in that era.   But, returning to this bill, this is important, and this is not the  end of our reforms. As the gentleman from Louisiana pointed out, just  think of it this way: We had a very rare, bizarre snow event last  winter, and I had five trees fall on my house. The insurance adjuster  came out and said okay. We agreed on what it would take to fix the  house.   Now, imagine if that company had sent five different adjusters on  different days and they all came up with different figures. The house  was just finished last weekend. It took 9 months, but I would still be  waiting, probably, for the repairs to start.   That is what happens to people in some of these disasters. They are  still waiting for the approvals they need to go forward and do the  repairs, or they got funding from one agency for emergency housing  assistance and then they are being told they can't get housing  assistance or they can't get their home repaired because they took that  money, even though no one told them when they took that money that that  was going to disqualify them from some other agency.   It has got to get straightened out. The Federal Government needs to  coordinate this response, and this is just, I believe, the beginning of  reforming these disaster assistance programs.   And, oh, by the way, the National Flood Insurance Program is broke,  and we have got to do something about that, too, including some  reforms.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1775) to establish a task force on NOTAM improvements, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1775         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Notice to Airmen Improvement       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FAA TASK FORCE ON NOTAM IMPROVEMENT.         (a) Establishment.--The Administrator of the Federal       Aviation Administration shall establish a special task force       to be known as the FAA Task Force on NOTAM Improvement (in       this section referred to as the ``Task Force'').        (b) Composition.--The Task Force shall consist of members       appointed by the Administrator and shall include the       following:        (1) Air carrier representatives.        (2) Labor union representatives.        (3) General and business aviation representatives.        (4) Aviation safety experts with knowledge of international       and domestic regulatory requirements for notices to airmen       (in this section referred to as ``NOTAMs'').        (5) Human factors experts.        (c) Duties.--The duties of the Task Force shall include--        (1) reviewing existing methods for presenting NOTAMs and       flight operations information to pilots;        (2) reviewing regulations and policies relating to NOTAMs,       including their content and presentation to pilots;        (3) evaluating and determining best practices to organize,       prioritize, and present flight operations information in a       manner that optimizes pilot review and retention of relevant       information; and        (4) providing recommendations in the following areas:        (A) Improving the presentation of NOTAM information in a       manner that prioritizes or highlights the most important       information, and optimizes pilot review and retention of       relevant information.        (B) Ways to ensure that NOTAMs are complete, accurate, and       contain the proper information.        (C) Any other best practices that the FAA should consider       to improve the accuracy and understandability of NOTAMs and       the display of flight operations information.        (D) Ways to work with air carriers, other airspace users,       and aviation service providers to implement solutions that       are aligned with the recommendations under this paragraph.        (d) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the       establishment of the Task Force, the Task Force shall submit       to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce,       Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report       detailing--        (1) the results of the reviews and evaluations of the Task       Force under subsection (c);        (2) the best practices identified and recommendations       provided by the Task Force under subsection (c);        (3) any recommendations of the Task Force for additional       regulatory or policy actions to improve the presentation of       NOTAMs; and        (4) the degree to which implementing the recommendations of       the Task Force will address National Transportation Safety       Board Safety Recommendation A-18-024.        (e) Applicable Law.--The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5       U.S.C. App.) shall not apply to the Task Force.        (f) Sunset.--The Task Force shall terminate on the earlier       of--        (1) the date on which the Task Force submits the report       required under subsection (d); or        (2) the date that is 18 months after the date on which the       Task Force is established under subsection (a).        (g) Authority.--The Administrator shall have the authority       to carry out the recommendations of the Task Force outlined       in the report required under subsection (d).    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1775.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of the bill introduced by the gentleman from  Minnesota, Representative Stauber. H.R. 1775 would create a task force  to review existing methods for presenting notices to airmen and -women,  or NOTAMs--maybe we have to add a W after the M, we will work on that-- to pilots. NOTAMs provide pilots with essential real-time information  regarding abnormalities or issues in the National Airspace System. For  example, NOTAMs alert pilots to potential hazards in the airspace or at  an airport, such as, more mundanely, closed runways or taxiways. They  are also used during space launches and things like that.   While pilots are required to review all NOTAMs before flight, there  has been concern about the lengthiness and completeness of the critical  information contained in NOTAMs and how the information is displayed to  and organized for pilots.   Under H.R. 1775 the task force will determine best practices for  organizing and presenting flight operations information to pilots in  the most optimal manner and make recommendations to improve the  presentation of NOTAM information while ensuring their accuracy and  completeness.   Recommendations from the task force could help prevent future  aviation accidents and near accidents. We saw that in July 2017 an Air  Canada A320 almost landed on top of five jetliners with more than 1,000  people onboard awaiting take-off at San Francisco International Airport  before executing an emergency go-around. The aircraft came as close as  60 feet above one of the planes on the ground. That would have been  catastrophic if that plane had just descended a little bit more.   There were no injuries, but this could have been catastrophic, as I  said. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable  cause of the incident was the pilots' misidentification of the taxiway  for a runway based in part on their ineffective review of NOTAMs.   NOTAMs can and must be better and more clear for pilots. I expect the  task force established under H.R. 1775 will lead to good work and  recommendations that will improve safety, hopefully, in the near future  without any sort of lengthy rulemaking process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the  legislation. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I regret that Representative DeSaulnier couldn't be here today  because he partnered with Representative Stauber on this legislation.  He has been very concerned and has been raising this issue with me  repeatedly because of the incident at San Francisco and general  concerns he had about runway intrusions and other problems. So he is on  an airplane, as we speak, flying here, hopefully, safely. That is  unfortunate since he won't be here to actually get credit on the floor,  but I want to extend that to him.   I want to thank Ranking Member Graves for his support on this and the  other Ranking Member Graves for his support on this and Representative  Larsen who is probably also on an airplane somewhere. It is rare that I  would be here on a Monday, but the harbor maintenance bill attracted me  to be here.   Mr. Speaker, I urge that this be adopted, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.  This is one more little bit of an addition, or a major addition, to our  safety culture in aviation in this country with the largest and most  complex airspace in the world, and this is a necessary step to make it  safer.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2502) to amend title 40, United States Code, to require  certain prospectuses for public buildings to be made publicly  available, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2502         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Transparency in Federal       Buildings Projects Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF BUILDING PROJECT INFORMATION.         (a) In General.--Chapter 33 of title 40, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new       section:       ``SEC. 3318. AVAILABILITY OF FEDERAL BUILDING PROJECT                     INFORMATION.         ``(a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date       of enactment of this section, and, at a minimum, on a       quarterly basis thereafter, the Administrator shall make       publicly available on a subpage of the website of the General       Services Administration all prospectuses submitted pursuant       to sections 3307 and 3316, and associated information subject       to the following requirements:        ``(1) The Administrator shall maintain such information in       an easily accessible and readable, organized, downloadable,       and searchable format.        ``(2) The Administrator shall ensure the information is       current and prospectuses and associated information updated       on a regular basis.        ``(3) The information required under this section shall be       inclusive for a period of not less than 10 years.        ``(4) The information shall include--        ``(A) the last date on which the relevant webpage was       updated;        ``(B) approval dates of respective authorizing resolutions       by each committee of jurisdiction, if applicable;        ``(C) copies of respective committee of jurisdiction       resolutions authorizing such prospectuses, as appropriate;        ``(D) cross-references to any resubmitted or amended       prospectuses and associated resolutions; and        ``(E) such other information as determined by the       Administrator.        ``(b) Definitions.--In this section, the following       definitions apply:        ``(1) Prospectus.--The term `prospectus' means       prospectuses, building surveys, and factsheets submitted to       the committees of jurisdiction pursuant to sections 3307 and       3316.        ``(2) Committees of jurisdiction.--The term `committees of       jurisdiction' means the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate.        ``(3) Associated information.--The term `associated       information' means resolutions approved by the committees of       jurisdiction and other information as required pursuant to       subsection (a).''.        (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of chapters for       chapter 33 of title 40, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following:  ``3318. Availability of Federal building project information.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2502.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 2502, the Transparency in Federal  Buildings Projects Act of 2019, introduced by the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Palmer).   It is simple, but it is important. It is also common sense and  contributes to government transparency.   Mr. Speaker, you know that the Federal Government through the GSA is  [[Page H8489]]  the largest lessor or owner of commercial office space in the United  States of America.   The program can use some improvement, and this will help shine a  light on some of the issues and concerns we have as we look for some  reforms in the way we acquire property in the most cost-effective  manner for the American taxpayer. Sometimes GSA does things that make  little or no sense when they get into lease agreements, like they did  with the Department of Transportation, a beautiful new building. We are  now going to buy the building for the second time, essentially, by  having paid for the lease for a number of years. These things can be  done more effectively and more efficiently, and this legislation will  help set a path to that kind of cost savings.   It requires the General Services Administration to publish on its  website all prospectuses for leasing, design, or construction activity;  update the information quarterly, and maintain the information for no  less than 10 years in a readable, accessible, and--this is key--a  searchable form, not just post it and it is like, oh, sorry, there is  no index. It has to be searchable.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good-government bill designed to provide  taxpayers with information regarding the GSA's leasing, design, and  construction projects for Federal agencies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, again, I congratulate the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Palmer) for proposing this new transparency legislation. I  am certain, in the end, it is ultimately going to save the taxpayers  money and lead to GSA, perhaps, performing in a more efficient manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
