 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1271 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1271         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 133)       to promote economic partnership and cooperation between the       United States and Mexico, with  [[Page H7291]]       the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House,       without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered       by the chair of the Committee on Appropriations or her       designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment with       an amendment consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       116-68. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be       considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion. The       question of adoption of the motion shall be divided for a       separate vote on the matter proposed to be inserted as       divisions B, C, E, and F, and the Chair shall first put the       question on such portion of the divided question. If either       portion of the divided question fails of adoption, then the       motion shall immediately be considered to have failed of       adoption.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution, the House shall       be considered to have taken from the Speaker's table the bill       (H.R. 1520) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide       for the publication of a list of licensed biological       products, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment       thereto, and to have concurred in the Senate amendment with       an amendment consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       116-69.        Sec. 3.  The Clerk shall be authorized to make necessary       technical and conforming changes in the engrossment of the       House amendments specified in the first two sections of this       resolution, to include corrections in spelling, punctuation,       section numbering, and cross-references.        Sec. 4.  If a veto message is laid before the House on H.R.       6395, then after the message is read and the objections of       the President are spread at large upon the Journal, further       consideration of the veto message and the bill shall be       postponed until the legislative day of Monday, December 28,       2020; and on that legislative day, the House shall proceed to       the constitutional question of reconsideration and dispose of       such question without intervening motion.        Sec. 5.  The chair of the Committee on Appropriations and       the chair of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence       may insert in the Congressional Record not later than       December 28, 2020, such material as they may deem explanatory       of the Senate amendment and the motion specified in the first       section of this resolution.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Cole), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, today the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1271, providing for a motion to  concur with the Senate amendment to H.R. 133 with a House amendment.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations. It provides that the question on adoption of the motion  shall be divided for a separate vote on the matter proposed to be  inserted as divisions B, C, E, and F.   The rule provides that upon adoption of this resolution, the House  shall be considered to have concurred in the Senate amendment to H.R.  1520 with a House amendment. The rule also provides that the chairs of  the Committee on Appropriations and the Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence may insert explanatory materials in the Congressional  Record not later than December 28 and authorizes the Clerk to make  technical corrections to the bill.   Finally, the rule allows for consideration of a possible veto message  on the conference report to H.R. 6395 on December 28, 2020.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bill in this rule.  This COVID bill has taken far too long. We started these negotiations  before the first day of summer in June, the longest day of the year,  and here we are now headed into the darkest day of the year, the first  day of winter.   I also want to acknowledge the hard work of our Appropriations chair,  Nita Lowey, and Ranking Member Granger.   But this didn't have to happen. The pain that has been inflicted on  the American people did not come just from the novel virus that has  spread like wildfire across this Nation, but also from the elected  leaders sent to Washington to help people and to help this great  Nation.   Our failure to reach an agreement until today only added fuel to this  wildfire. It meant that not only did people get the coronavirus, but  when they did, their families often went hungry, their bills went  unpaid, and they faced possible eviction or foreclosure.   Madam Speaker, for 8 years, I worked in the Hubert H. Humphrey  Building not very far from here. Inscribed in the lobby of that  building is a quote from Hubert Humphrey: ``The moral test of  government is how the government treats those who are in the dawn of  life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly;  and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the  handicapped.''   Madam Speaker, we have failed that moral test. We have no right to  make children go hungry in this country.   While this bill will certainly bring us closer to passing that moral  test, it is too late for too many people, and it will be too little for  others. Nonetheless, we should pass this bill immediately.   There are a number of things that I am pleased to see included in  this bill: a long-fought and negotiated bipartisan and bicameral  compromise to protect patients by ending surprise billing; multiple- year funding for community health centers, the backbone of our Nation's  primary care system for the most vulnerable; and an added boost in  weekly unemployment benefits and relief checks for people who have been  waiting for months for help.   There will be more than $300 billion for small businesses and money  to help schools, for hospitals, and for vaccine distribution. It will  also provide food assistance to hungry children and their families.   This package will be bigger than the American Recovery and  Reinvestment Act. It is the biggest package we have passed since the  CARES Act in March.                                time  1615    But there is still more to do. I hope when the 117th Congress  convenes in January, that they will not forget the American people who  will still be suffering and will need more. I hope that they will  remember the people in my district, a district heavily dependent on  travel, on tourism, and the service economy.   Madam Speaker, I hope that the families in my community in Miami,  which have been devastated by the last 9 months--and so much more must  be done to help them.   But, today, we must pass this bill. It is time to be done with this,  and we can wait not a moment longer.   Simply put, with this bill, we are attempting to right our moral  compass and fulfill our obligation to those suffering across our  country and to help guide us out of this dark winter.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague for  his very kind words. I will say that I have enjoyed working with him. I  have deep respect for his leadership in this Congress.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Rules.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, first, let me thank Chairman McGovern for his very  kind words. I have enjoyed serving under his leadership.   Let me say to my colleague, Mrs. Lesko, years of bipartisan  investments in NIH have, in fact, led to Operation Warp Speed. Decades  of investments in training the world's best scientists have led to a  very fast-paced development of a vaccine. So, it is not just the  present President; it is Presidents before that who believed that we  should have world-class science in this country.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, thank you for your kind words.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Crow).                                time  1645     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the distinguished chairman of the Committee  on Ways and Means.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Espaillat).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).    Madam Speaker, let me remind my distinguished colleague  from Oklahoma that we sent the Heroes Act in May.   And while I agree that the administration should get some credit for  Operation Warp Speed, as I have pointed out, it has been decades of  investment in the science that led to Operation Warp Speed.   Many of us would have appreciated, and we would have saved lives, if  we had made the same kind of investments in testing so that we had an  instant test, and we would have ended up saving lives.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Gottheimer).    Madam Speaker, I don't disagree with my colleague, but  it was bipartisan, and I think that is the important thing about those  investments over the years.   My point was it was those investments that made it possible for  Operation Warp Speed. I never suggested that it was one party versus  another that made that bipartisan investment. It has been decades of  bipartisan investments that have made a difference.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs.  Beatty).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Aguilar).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank my colleague, Mr. Cole, for his generous remarks. I agree  with him, this is a bipartisan bill that is not perfect. I don't think  anyone in this Chamber believes that it is perfect.   Madam Speaker, the time to pass this bill was yesterday. It was 6  months ago. We pray that most Americans will be able to get a vaccine  to stop this killer. But it is not just Americans. To be safe, people  around the world must get the vaccine.   There will be a lot of darkness before enough Americans and people  around the world have the vaccine to bring our lives back to normal.  Before that time, the government must help.   By the way, it is not our money. It is the people in our communities  who have been paying taxes for years. We are taking the resources back  to them. We have to help the unemployed, the shuttered small  businesses, the strained hospitals, and, most importantly, the hungry  child.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the  previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
