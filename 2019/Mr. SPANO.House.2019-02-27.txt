 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the  Greater Brandon Chamber of Commerce, an institution that has helped  small businesses and business owners in the Tampa Bay area succeed for  over 60 years.   I think specifically of Ron Pierce, a very good friend of mine who  started his own consulting firm 10 years ago. Over the past decade, he  has grown his small business to include four other consultants and now  provides advice to some of the largest interests in Tampa, including  the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Port of Tampa Bay.   On top of managing his own successful business, he is also an  upstanding member of our community. He regularly volunteers to bring  food and clothing to families in need. He has worked on youth drowning  prevention and provided advice to leaders in Tampa Bay on how to  improve our local economy.   In recognition of his service, the Chamber recently bestowed upon him  the Community Leadership Award, the highest honor granted by the  organization.   The Greater Brandon Chamber of Commerce is a model organization in my  district, and it helps small businesses succeed in their work so that  they can then help others.   I am proud to be a member of the Brandon Chamber of Commerce. As a  member of the Small Business Committee, I look forward to working with  them to create a stronger economy for Tampa Bay.                            ____________________
