Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying  legislation. The rule makes in order three bills reported favorably by  the Committee on Financial Services. All three bills were the subject  of multiple hearings before the Committee on Financial Services. All  three bills were reported favorably by a bipartisan majority without  amendment. The rule ensures that each of these provisions are fully  paid for and makes in order an amendment offered by the Democrat  ranking member on the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of working with Chairman Hensarling  to bring many Financial Services Committee bills to the floor for  debate. I will be here again tomorrow doing the same thing. I am always  amazed at how bipartisan these votes are in the Financial Services  Committee.   Once again, we have before us today components of the Financial  CHOICE Act. As I have already noted, each of these bills received  bipartisan support in the committee. I anticipate that these bills will  receive a bipartisan vote on the House floor as well.   Mr. Speaker, it is encouraging to hear that the Senate is working  hard toward their own bill overhauling Dodd-Frank. It is about time.  The House has already done its work under the leadership of Chairman  Hensarling. We passed the Financial CHOICE Act nearly a year ago. But I  certainly understand that the Senate has its own ideas about financial  reform.   I would encourage the Senate to look at the roster of bills that we  have passed unpacking the CHOICE Act, as they demonstrate a clear  bipartisan roadmap to overhauling our financial regulatory reform  effort. We continue to provide that roadmap today.   The first bill made in order by this rule is sponsored by my good  friend, the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Tipton. H.R. 1116, the TAILOR  Act, is commonsense legislation that I am pleased to cosponsor.   One of the biggest complaints I hear as I travel the Fourth  Congressional District of Colorado is how the Federal Government stamps  out cookie-cutter regulations without a thought as to how much  variation occurs in industries from State to State. For example, how do  Washington regulators take into consideration the unique business model  of AMG National Trust headquartered in Colorado? Do they know better  than my good friend Earl Wright, who cofounded the bank in 1972, about  the banking needs of his customers? Are they able to differentiate  between AMG's needs and the needs of a bank in another State or on Wall  Street? Typically, the answer is no.   They do not model banking regulations to the particular differences  from State to State. But even inside a State there is diversity within  industries. The needs of AMG National Trust's customers vary from the  needs of other community banks in my district; such as, the Bank of  Burlington or Community State Bank, both of which are on the Eastern  Plains.   The TAILOR Act solves this problem. It requires regulatory actions to  take into account each particular institution's business model and risk  profile. Mr. Speaker, this change would be an innovative regulatory  reform. It would ensure that overarching goals of accountability to  investors and depositors are maintained while providing flexibility in  the application of the regulations to each institution.   Independent community banks and credit unions have been hit hard by  Dodd-Frank's wrong-headed approach to financial services regulation. In  2016, former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said: `` . . . when it  comes to bank regulation and supervision, one size does not fit all''-- and--``rules and supervisory approaches should be tailored to different  types of institutions such as community banks.''   The TAILOR Act will do just that. It will reorient our regulatory  structure and free up our community lending institutions to increase  their investments in our communities, creating jobs and opportunities  for Americans.   This rule also makes in order H.R. 4263, the Regulation A+  Improvement Act. This regulation was the result of the JOBS Act passed  by Congress in 2012. While Regulation A had been around for many years,  it caused startups to enter into a cumbersome process for raising money  from certain types of investors. The process is so inefficient that  most startups avoided it altogether.    Regulation A+ revamped the regulation and raised the amount of money  that entrepreneurs could raise in their startup fundraising round.  Crucially, it also changed the type of investor who could invest in a  startup. Prior to the JOBS Act, essentially only accredited investors  could participate in the first fundraising round.   The problem is that, according to research done by Forbes magazine,  accredited investors only made up 1 percent of the population, thereby  excluding 99 percent of Americans. The JOBS Act changed the regulation  to allow nonaccredited investors to participate in a startup's initial  fundraising round. Expanding the pool of investors has proven to be a  success, and the Regulation A+ Improvement Act continues reforming this  area of investment regulation by further increasing the threshold  investment amount. This bill will ensure greater access to capital for  entrepreneurs seeking investors in their startup.   Finally, this rule makes in order H.R. 4545, the Financial  Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act. This bill establishes  deadlines by which certain regulatory decisions must be made and  provides for a more transparent appeals process. Under current law,  financial institutions may appeal regulatory determinations to an  intra-agency appellate process. The Financial Services Committee found  during hearings that the appeals process was not as impartial as it was  intended to be.   This bill removes the appeals process from the original examining  agency and creates an independent examination review director who is  able to review regulatory determinations. To ensure timeliness of  regulatory reviews, the bill requires the final reports from agencies  are completed within 60 days.   The combination of a better appeals process and deadline for agency  action gives community financial institutions certainty as a regulator  evaluates their practices.  [[Page H1556]]                                     time  1230    Certainty in the regulatory arena will ensure that lending  institutions do not needlessly restrict capital investments due to the  unpredictability of a regulatory agency's decisionmaking process.   These three bills continue to advance smart financial regulatory  reforms that the Committee on Financial Services has been known for  under Chairman Hensarling. Washington's cookie-cutter approach to  regulation hinders investments in Colorado and across the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, I support these measures, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have two other speakers. Neither of them are  here at this point in time. I would be glad to listen to more of the  things that the House should be doing, if Mr. Polis would like to  engage in that discussion. But at this point, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. MacArthur), the sponsor of H.R. 4263.    Mr. Speaker, I have one remaining speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton), the sponsor of H.R. 1116 and H.R. 4545.  [[Page H1558]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   It really is fairly simple. Washington's regulations tend to strangle  economic growth. What usually starts as a do-good effort quickly  devolves into a ``Washington knows best'' regulatory regime. Instead of  recognizing the unique needs of businesses around this country, the  Federal Government usually stamps out a cookie-cutter regulation that  purports to be the solution to a problem but, in reality, almost always  has unintended consequences that reduce the freedom of Americans and  reduces economic activity in our communities.   The bills before us today take a balanced approach to regulation,  maintaining overarching safeguards while making commonsense reforms  that free our community banks and credit unions to increase investment  in our communities.   I promised Coloradans that I would work to reduce the role of Federal  Government in their lives. These three bills today do just that.   I thank my fellow Coloradan, Mr. Tipton, for introducing two of these  measures. I thank Chairman Hensarling for bringing these bills to the  floor.   I urge passage for the rule and the underlying rule.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 773 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry,  [[Page H1559]]       asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G.       Cannon (R-Illinois) said: ``The previous question having been       refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had       asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is       entitled to the first recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
