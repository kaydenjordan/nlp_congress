Wyatt.   Those are the names of the 20 children and 6 adults who were killed  at Sandy Hook 10 years ago today. I want them to know we will never  forget them, and we will continue to honor their memory with our  action.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 26 beautiful  lives that were lost on December 14, 2012.   Today marks 10 years since 20 innocent children and 6 selfless  educators were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,  Connecticut.   Newtown is a small community with a big heart, a community that  changed forever 10 years ago. Bonded by a shared grief no one can ever  truly comprehend, the lives of my constituents in this community were  reshaped forever.   While this community has mourned the loss of their loved ones, they  have also honored their memories through service. Every single family  who lost a loved one at Sandy Hook has found a way to be of service,  with everything from violence prevention programs like Sandy Hook  Promise, to Embrace Hope, which is an equine therapy program. There is  the Ana Grace Project and Ben's Lighthouse, Charlotte's Litter Therapy  Dog Program, the Emilie Parker Art Connection, and everything from  butterflies to puppies. There is the Vicki Soto Project, which is a  fund to promote a love of teaching.   These are just a few, but every single family affected honored the  memory of their loved ones through service. These families have all  found ways to turn their grief into action.   While I recognize that we have so much work to do as legislators in  this body, my only ask of you today, colleagues, is that we not let the  deaths of these children be in vain and that we recommit ourselves to  making our schools and our communities safe and find ways to turn  solemn moments like this into action.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 5230, the Help Find  the Missing Act, also known as Billy's Law. I thank Senator Murphy for  his leadership on this bill, and I am honored to introduce it in  the House.    This bill is named for Billy Smolinski. Billy went missing from my  hometown of Waterbury, Connecticut, on August 24, 2004, nearly 20 years  ago.   Unlike with missing children, Federal law does not require law  enforcement to report missing adults or unidentified bodies. Without  it, families are left to unravel the mystery of what happened to their  loved ones without any support. The Smolinski family was left to  navigate a complicated and disjointed system.   In the absence of a vigorous and sustained effort to solve the crime,  the family created a personal tip line, placed billboards on highways  that I drove by every day for many years, and worked closely with a  private investigator.   When Bill and Janice Smolinski received tips, they would organize  search parties, which worked with rescue teams and brought in highly  trained cadaver dogs to sniff the woods in search of their son.   Each year, nearly half a million people go missing, and sadly, many  of them will never see their loved ones again. Yet, over 40,000 sets of  unidentified human remains are either held at coroners' offices or  disposed of after going unclaimed.   Due to gaps in missing persons databases, missing persons and  unidentified remains are rarely matched. Billy's Law will fix this  critical gap by directing the Department of Justice to continually  operate NamUs, the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System,  and connect it to the FBI's National Crime Information Center. It will  also provide guidelines for local law enforcement agencies, medical  examiners, and coroners on how to best handle missing person cases.   This bill has the support of the National Fraternal Order of Police  and the Consortium of Forensic Science Organizations, as well as both  the Smolinski family and the family of Gabby Petito.   This bill will also help to bring home the missing, many whose names  never make headlines or who are never talked about in the media, and  offer closure to the families of those who will never make it home.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bipartisan,  commonsense legislation to deliver justice to countless families.
