 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I thank my good friend and chairman of the Committee on  Rules, Chairman McGovern, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, in 2018, southwestern Pennsylvania witnessed the  deadliest act of anti-Semitism in our Nation's history when 11 Jewish  worshippers were killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill.  That was the first time I ever spoke on the House floor; it was to  condemn acts of anti-Semitism and hatred in all forms.   No one should ever be attacked and no one should ever be denied their  human rights or dignity because of their religious faith. Republicans  have opposed hate and discrimination of any kind, including  Islamophobia, but the bill made in order under this rule is rushed. It  is a partisan effort, and it fails to address real concerns highlighted  by both committee Republicans and the Biden State Department.    H.R. 5665 creates a new State Department office and a new special  envoy position to combat ``Islamophobia and Islamophobic incitement.''  Those terms are not defined in Federal statute. They are also not  defined in the bill. Without clear definitions, even First Amendment- protected speech could qualify for an investigation.   Under this measure, it would be up to unelected career bureaucrats at  the State Department to determine what constitutes this phobia and to  single out groups, to single out governments, to single out individuals  who do not share the political views of those unelected, career  bureaucrats.   My Republican colleagues on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs  rightly noted the lack of definitions in this bill, and that lack could  be used to promote anti-Israel sentiment. Unfortunately, efforts to  address those concerns were wholly dismissed by committee Democrats.  Further, committee Republicans highlighted that this bill is absolutely  redundant.   Mr. Speaker, the State Department already operates robust human  rights and religious freedom efforts, and those include, and I will  list: the Bureau of  [[Page H7655]]  Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; the Office of International  Religious Freedom; and the U.S. Commission on International Religious  Freedom. We already have offices for what this bill seeks to do.                                time  1315    Creating a new envoy and office would simply duplicate those efforts;  it would further fragment this important advocacy; it would increase  the potential for conflict and delays; and it would thwart our efforts  to actually help persecuted people.   Their concerns fell on deaf ears.   If House Democrats are serious about addressing anti-Muslim  sentiment, then I encourage them to join the longstanding Republican  efforts to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for their  genocide against the Uyghur people.   Somewhere between 1 and 3 million Uyghurs are currently held against  their will in modern-day concentration camps in Communist China. These  people are subjected to atrocities that include forced labor, torture,  and enforced organ harvesting.   Families are torn apart. The CCP even prohibits parents from teaching  their Islamic faith to their children. Women are suffering forced  sterilization and forced abortion to suppress Uyghur Muslim birth  rates.   Anyone who truly supports religious freedom and stands against anti- Muslim atrocities should want to hold the CCP accountable for their  genocide against the Uyghur people.   Yet, earlier this year Democratic leadership caved to the Biden  administration and delayed a strong U.S. response to the Uyghur Muslim  genocide, rather than sending the bipartisan, Senate-passed Uyghur  Forced Labor Prevention Act to the President's desk. It was the Biden  administration who slow-walked that.   Last week, we were finally given the opportunity to vote on that  bill, only after the press highlighted Speaker Pelosi's inaction.  Further, during the committee's consideration of H.R. 5665, Democrats  voted down an amendment to focus the new office's efforts on the plight  of the Uyghurs.   In closing, it is obvious this bill is not combating anti-Muslim  violence and persecution. If it were, House Democrats would have worked  with Republicans and the Biden State Department on this effort.  Instead, the Democrats are advancing this rushed, partisan legislation  that fails to address the religious persecution happening right now in  China and across the globe.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad it was brought up, the so-called Trump Muslim  ban, because it gives me a chance to set the record straight.   Let's be clear, the seven countries that my colleague was referring  to--the seven countries specifically targeted with travel restrictions  in Executive Order 13769, they were actually countries that were  determined by Congress in the Obama administration to be countries of  particular concern for terrorism activity pursuant to the Visa Waiver  Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015.   In fact, the policies in the administration's travel restrictions  apply to just 8 percent of the world's Muslim population, and according  to Pew Research Center, only cover one of the top 10 countries in the  world with the largest Muslim population, that country being Iran.   The courts even found that Trump's travel ban was ``facially neutral  toward religion.'' The court also ruled that Trump ``set forth a  sufficient national security justification.'' So I thank my colleague  for giving me the chance to put in the Record the truth about the so- called Trump ban.   Mr. Speaker, let's talk about something that the American people are  focused on right now. Thanks to the Biden energy crisis, Americans are  paying 56 percent more for a gallon of gas.   In Pennsylvania, families are facing a 50 percent increase in their  energy bills. Biden's war on fossil fuels continues to devastate the  Nation this holiday season.   That is why, Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will  personally offer an amendment to the rule to immediately consider H.R.  6235, the Strategic Production Response Act.   This legislation would require the Secretary of Energy to develop a  plan to increase oil and gas production on Federal lands if the  President uses the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for non-emergency  reasons.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Upton), one of the authors of the legislation, to  explain the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan  an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, my good friend and colleague from Texas mentioned George  W. Bush in her remarks. That is certainly a blast from the past. I was  actually too young to even vote for President Bush when he was running  in the primary. So I say that respectfully for my good friend from  Texas.   But when we are talking about blasts from the past, the American  people have not paid this much at the pump since the last time Biden  was in the White House. It is true. The national average of gasoline is  currently $3.32. Americans are paying 54 percent more nationally for a  gallon of gas. In some parts of the United States the price for a  gallon of gas has reached $7.59 a gallon.   So with Biden in the White House we are repeating ourselves once  again--a blast from the past--and the American people are,  unfortunately, paying every day at the gas pump.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Mullin), my good friend, who is going to talk about that.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Burgess), who is my good friend and fellow Rules  Committee member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Crenshaw), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I didn't anticipate that we were going to talk about the pandemic,  but since we are on the topic, let's just get one thing clear. There  have been more deaths from this pandemic under President Biden than  under President Trump. Remember, President Trump is the one that put  forth Operation Warp Speed with our pharmaceutical industry to get a  vaccine to market incredibly quick, in fact, in record-breaking time.  So again, there were more deaths under President Biden than President  Trump. So who is really ignoring the pandemic?   Let's talk about the Uyghurs. The Chinese openly and proudly refer to  Uyghur concentration camps as reeducation camps. It is a sin how the  Chinese are trying to cover up the modern-day concentration camps they  have. They claim they are necessary to ``rid them of terrorists and  extremist leanings.''   In these camps you have torture like sleep deprivation; people are  being hung from walls; people are being locked in what is called a  tiger chair, a steel chair with fixed leg irons and handcuffs that  render their body immobile, often in very painful positions. Chinese  officials have created a massive nearly week-long bonfire to burn  documents that regard the oversight of these camps.    It is time that we call out the Chinese Communist Party for the  atrocities they are committing on the Uyghurs.   When we are talking about legislation on this point it is actually  the Speaker that slow-walked legislation by as much as 5 months. Let me  explain the legislative history. The Senate passed the Uyghur Forced  Labor Prevention Act, which bans imports of goods made with forced  Uyghur labor, in July of 2021 unanimously. That was in the Senate. Top  House Democrats pointed to a procedural issue and promised future  action and then finally passed the bill in December. Again, a 5-month  delay for what?   Well, according to reports, the Speaker slow-walked this bill at the  request of the Biden administration, who prioritized climate change and  climate reforms over human rights violations in China. Further, the  Biden administration asked that the bill be watered down, which is  truly disgusting when you look at the human rights violations going on  in China.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs.  Greene).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional  15 seconds to summarize.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  as I have no further speakers at this time, and I am prepared to close.    I applaud Chairman McGovern for his work on this piece of  legislation. I applaud Senator Rubio, of course, and my colleague, Mr.  Smith of New Jersey, for working on the legislation. And just to  clarify, when I was talking about the watered-down version that the  administration is trying to water down, I was talking about the Senate  version of this bill. If I misspoke, I want to clarify the Record now.  That is what I was speaking to.   But, again, I applaud anybody who is working on holding the Chinese  Communist Party accountable for the atrocities they are committing on  the Uyghurs. Let me be clear about something: House Republicans will  continue to stand against all forms of hate and Islamophobia. We will  continue to stand with Uyghurs in China and with all people  experiencing religious persecution.   Unfortunately, H.R. 5665, this piece of legislation, is a rushed  bill. It presents serious First Amendment concerns. It will complicate  existing efforts to protect human rights and religious freedom around  the globe. It is also incredibly duplicative. We already have the  Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. We already have the  Office of International Religious Freedom. We already have the U.S.  Commission on International Religious Freedom. We already have  institutions and bodies that are focused on this.   For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  previous question and ``no'' on the rule. I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I demand the yeas and nays.
