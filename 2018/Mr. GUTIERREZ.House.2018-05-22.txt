 Mr. Speaker, Glenda Perkins;   Cynthia Tisdale;   Kimberly Vaughan;   Shana Fisher;   Angelique Ramirez;   Christian Riley Garcia;   Jared Black;   Sabika Sheikh;   Christopher Jake Stone; and   Aaron Kyle McLeod.   Mr. Speaker, those are the 10 names of the people killed at Santa Fe  High School in Texas last Friday. Two were teachers; eight were  students. All were violently torn away from their loved ones and their  pathways to bright futures way too soon.   As usual, the elected officials have expressed that their thoughts  and prayers are with the victims and their families, but we all know by  now that more is needed than a moment of silence, because the silence  of lawmakers, especially those here in the House of Representatives,  kills:   58 killed in Las Vegas, Nevada;   27 killed in Newtown, Connecticut;   14 killed in San Bernardino, California;   17 killed in Parkland, Florida;   4 at a Waffle House in Tennessee;   26 at a church in Texas;   49 at a nightclub in Florida;   6 at a Cracker Barrel in Michigan; and   9 at Mother Emanuel Church in South Carolina.   The gunmen--and they were almost all men or boys--had different  motives or motivations, including crime, racism, terrorism, revenge,  and seeking notoriety, which they got.   And they all had access to weapons and bullets that could kill scores  of humans in just moments. For the most part, of the only thing the  victims had in common was that they were killed by bullets.   The Washington Post reported that the number of people killed in  schools in 2018, this year, is almost double the number of servicemen  and -women killed in our military in both combat and noncombat  fatalities.   And this coming weekend, just like clockwork, as America honors  fallen servicemembers on Memorial Day, Chicago--my city--will see a  deadly toll. Fifty-two people were shot over the Memorial Day weekend  last year, and that was actually down from the previous year, 2016,  when 71 people were shot in my city.   There will probably be no national special reports or wall-to-wall  news coverage, because when 50 or 75 people of color are shot in an  American city over a weekend, it barely makes the news; unless the NRA  or FOX News use my beloved Chicago and her tough gun laws as a way of  giving political coverage to politicians, while failing to point out  that the loopholes and weak gun laws in Indiana, Virginia, and other  States feed illegal guns into my city.   And we should note that the NRA is now run by someone whose claim to  fame--Oliver North--is that he lied to Congress, perjured himself, and  sold guns to our country's enemies. And they claim to be on the side of  law and order?   So, the result is political paralysis, societal paralysis, and  actual, permanent paralysis as the butcher's bill of dead and wounded  grows and grows.   When I came here in 1993, we had hope and optimism that we could cut  crime and reduce the number of guns on our streets. But despite the  drop in crime, all of our efforts to reduce the number of guns on our  streets, in our houses, in our schools, and in our churches have been  thwarted by the gun manufacturers.   The assault weapons ban, I voted for and worked for, was here until  it was killed by politics.   The crime gun bill I wrote would work by reducing the availability  and manufacture of the cheap, concealable handguns most often used in  gun crimes, but it will never get a vote in this House of  Representatives.   See, we have established a school-to-coroner pipeline in this country  that will persist until the American people arm their politicians to do  something about it. But I fear the profit motive of the gun  manufacturers and the politicians they own, got in their pocket, is  greater than the will of the American people to take on and tame our  runaway love affair with bullets.                                time  1015    Mr. Speaker, it takes good people without guns working with good  people who own guns to keep guns out of the hands of people who will  use them to kill other people.   It is not that we do not know what works, because we do. Waiting  periods, background checks, trigger and gun locks, restrictions on the  sales of guns can all be effective in reducing suicide, murder, and  accidental death by firearms.   We are not lacking the way. We are only lacking the will to overcome  the deeply entrenched, highly profitable industry that thrives on fear,  mistrust, inequality, racism, misogyny, and tribalism.  [[Page H4289]]    We cannot afford another moment of silence, because silence kills.  What we need is a moment of action to save the American people from  killing themselves with American guns and American bullets.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this list of moments of silence  observed in the House since the Newtown shooting. It is compiled by the  Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. There are 43 of them, moments of  silence, and nothing done to save the American people from the gun  lobby and the NRA.
