 Mr. President, today I would like to recognize  an Alaska Native leader who has dedicated much of his life and career  to humanitarian service in Alaska. Dimitri Philemonof is the president  of the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association, which is a Tribal  nonprofit organization that serves the regional tribes in the Aleutian  Pribilof Islands of Alaska. Under Dimitri's leadership, APIA has had a  profound impact on the health and well-being of the Aleut people by  providing them with a broad spectrum of services. These services  include health, education, social, employment  [[Page S2341]]  and vocational training, public safety, and cultural preservation.   Dimitri's tenure with APIA began on April 24, 1978, when he was hired  as a training tech for employment assistance. Less than a year later,  Dimitri was promoted to manpower director and later the community  services director. By 1985, the board of directors at APIA would reach  a consensus and promote Dimitri to be the executive director and  president of APIA, a position that he has held since. This week marks  the 40th anniversary of Dimitri's hiring at APIA, and I would like to  take this time to express my appreciation for Dimitri's service to the  Alaska Native people.   Dimitri accomplished many things during his time as the president of  APIA, but according to Dimitri, the most important accomplishment as  the president of APIA was working to pass the Aleut Restitution Act. It  was meaningful for Dimitri because his parents were forcibly evacuated  from the island of St. George and brought to the Funter Bay Internment  Camp during the Aleut Evacuation of WWII. Conditions at the camps were  horrid. There was no running water, no sewer system, and no laundry or  bathing facilities. Most of the buildings didn't have electricity,  heat, windows, or doors. Eventually, Dimitri's parents were able to  return to their home on St. George Island, but they still carried with  them the experience of being forced into an internment camp. This was  an experience that many Alaska Natives carried with them because they  too were put into internment camps, not just in Funter Bay. There were  internment camps in Killisnoo, Ward Cove, and on Burnett Island.   Fast forward and once Dimitri became the executive director of APIA,  he worked tirelessly to ensure that the Aleut people would receive  restitution for their time in internment camps. He worked with Alaska's  congressional delegation to ensure that Aleut and other Alaska Native  people were able to testify before congressional hearing commissions  and committees to share their stories and their experiences in  internment camps.   In 1988, the Aleut Restitution Act was passed, and in 1993, the  Aleutian Pribilof Restitution Trust was created. Dimitri and many other  Aleut leaders believe that the pursuit for restitution was one of the  first steps in the healing process for the Aleut people.   Dimitri has had a significant impact on the Aleut people who he  represents. He serves as an inspiration to many other Alaska Native  leaders. I am honored to recognize Dimitri for his years of  humanitarian service, and I wish him many more years of service to his  people and to his community by reminding us all that ``Unganan Ataaqan  Akun''--``We Are One.''                            ____________________
