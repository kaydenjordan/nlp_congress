 Madam Speaker, I rise to support the Inflation Reduction  Act.   This bill is a monumental achievement that will move America forward,  making important advances in everything from healthcare costs to energy  prices to tax fairness.   Coming from North Carolina, a State battered with increasing  regularity by catastrophic storms, I am especially proud that this act  represents the most significant investment to combat climate change in  U.S. history.   I am also pleased that this bill includes a measure that I have  championed, which will end the prior moratorium on offshore wind. The  Trump administration basically banned North Carolina from taking  advantage of industrial-scale offshore wind. Our utilities support it,  it is good for our economy, and it is good for our environment. This is  an important, game-changing bill.
