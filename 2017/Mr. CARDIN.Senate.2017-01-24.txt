 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, shortly we will be voting on the U.S.  Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley. She went through her  confirmation hearings at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and I  had a chance during those confirmation hearings to ask her a series of  questions. I have also had an opportunity to meet with her and talk  personally about her vision of the United Nations and the United  States' role in how she would conduct her leadership at the United  Nations.   I must say, originally there was some concern because of her lack of  foreign policy experience, but I must tell you, I was extremely  impressed about her competency as Governor of South Carolina--the work  that she did, dealing with some very difficult issues, including a  tragedy that occurred in her State, as well as dealing with the  Confederate flag and removing it from the State Capitol.   She handled these issues with real professionalism and sensitivity to  all communities, and during her confirmation hearing, she displayed a  willingness to reach out, to understand more about world affairs, and  to become fully knowledgeable in these areas. She  [[Page S429]]  exercised, I thought, a commitment and passion for the commitments that  are important to this country--good governance, human rights, and  democracy.   I was impressed during the confirmation hearing about her commitment  to the importance of the United Nations and the important work that it  does. The United Nations, as we all know, does do work as peacekeepers  to try to avoid conflicts but also does an incredible job on  humanitarian needs with refugee assistance, as well as the sustainable  development goals that provide help to people around the world,  increasing maternal health, reducing infant mortality, dealing with  women's education needs. These original Sustainable Development Goals-- originally the Millennium Development Goals, now the Sustainable  Development Goals--have saved millions of lives.   I must tell you, Governor Haley was very mindful of this and very  committed to the United Nations and the work that it does and the U.S.  participation in the United Nations. She recognized that it is  important that we engage the international community in the work that  is done within the United Nations.   When she was questioned about whether she thought it was a good idea  to slash funds to the United Nations in order to make a point about  votes that we thought were unpopular, she said no. She opposed that  slash-and-burn strategy; we need to engage and find ways to leverage  our participation to get more favorable results.   I might tell you, she was very strong about her sensitivity that the  United Nations has not been fair to one of our key allies, Israel, and  she would be a strong voice to make sure those types of issues are  dealt with and the United States uses all the tools at its disposal to  fight against those types of bias and prejudice within the United  Nations.   We have talked a great deal in our committee about moral clarity from  our nominees, so there is no misunderstanding anywhere in the world  that the United States stands for human rights, that the United States  stands against abuses that take place around the world, and that it  will fight for democracy in all parts of the world and support those  causes through our diplomacy, through our development assistance,  through our tools.   She was very clear about the moral certainty issue. Just to give a  few examples, we talked a great deal about Russia and its conduct and  what it is doing in the United States about the attack on our free  election system. She was very clear about how outraged she was with  that type of conduct--what Russia has done in Ukraine, its occupation  of Crimea. She acknowledged that Crimea is not Russian, that it belongs  to Ukraine, and she spoke very strongly about defending Ukraine's  rights and sovereignty.   We talked specifically about what was happening in Syria and Russia's  support for the Assad regime and the atrocities that have taken place  in that country, most recently in Aleppo. When we asked if she would  characterize that type of conduct as war crimes, without any  equivocation she said: Absolutely--that this was a matter that required  international accountability.   I also brought up with her what was happening in the Philippines, one  of our allies, where the President of the Philippines, Mr. Duterte, has  done extrajudicial killings and how she would characterize that as  gross violations of human rights. She agreed that type of conduct  cannot be tolerated, that we need to speak to whether they are friend  or foe when they commit this type of conduct, that this is wrong and  the United States must stand up for our principles. I was impressed by  the way that she spoke to those types of issues.   One of the more telling questions that we asked was whether she would  support any registry for any subgroup of ethnic or religious Americans,  and she said: Absolutely not.   We had, I thought, moral clarity in her response to some of the most  important questions. I think all of us feel that she has the passion to  represent the United States and our views well at the United Nations.   What was particularly important to us is how she would speak out to  power within the United Nations; that she had no problem in dealing  with Mr. Putin and calling his conduct exactly what it was and would  not be intimidated by Mr. Putin saying ``Well, you need me for some  other issue''; that we have to be clear that we will not tolerate that  type of conduct that violates basic human rights.   She gave us confidence that, on behalf of the American people, she  would speak up in the Cabinet room with Mr. Trump and the Cabinet as to  these values. For all those reasons, it was a comfortable vote for me  to support her nomination and confirmation.   I do want to relay the fact that she does represent the American  story. She is a daughter of immigrants who came to this country at  great risk in order to seek a better life for their children. She  experienced some of the discrimination against immigrant communities as  she grew up in this country and tried to participate in the business  and political sphere. She overcame all of those types of challenges and  is extremely sensitive, I think, to all the needs of Americans.   For all those reasons, I am proud to recommend her to our colleagues  on both sides of the aisle. I hope we will support her confirmation. I  think she is the right person now to represent us at the United  Nations. For all those reasons, I will support her nomination.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute  to a dear friend, the Honorable Aaron A. Baer, who died yesterday, just  2 days shy of what would have been his 103rd birthday. He was the  oldest living judge in Maryland.   Judge Baer was known to his family as the ``centennial cowboy'' who  had ``a great ride,'' as his family put it. He was a Baltimore native,  the son of a Russian immigrant who worked in a clothing factory and  became a tailor. Judge Baer graduated from the University of Baltimore  Law School in 1937. He supported himself and paid for law school by  repairing and replacing tar roofs.   Judge Baer practiced real estate law for several years before  becoming an assistant Baltimore City solicitor, an assistant attorney  general, and a State senator for the 5th District in 1959. He was  appointed to the Municipal Court of Baltimore City in 1961 by then- Governor J. Millard Tawes. In 1971, he was appointed to the newly  created District Court of Maryland by then, Governor Marvin Mandel. He  retired as a district court judge in 1981 at the age of 67.   Judge Baer was married to Judy Weinberg for 66 years before her  passing in 2007. He and his wife had two daughters. The older daughter  is Susan Reichmister, who is married to Dr. Jerome Reichmister. They  have two children: Beth, who is married to Bart Casper, and Jodi, who  is married to Craig Kessler. The younger daughter is the Honorable  Barbara Baer Waxman, who is administrative judge of the District Court  of Maryland for Baltimore City. She is married to Dr. Carl Waxman.  Judge Baer had four great-grandchildren: Nicole, Sloane, Mitchell, and  Blair, and numerous nieces and nephews.   The Cardin family is friends with many members of the Baer family.  Judge Baer and my parents were close friends. It has been a great  privilege to know Judge Baer, to receive his counsel, and to count him  not just as a close friend of my father's, but as my close friend, too.   Judge Baer lived an exemplary life devoted to public service, the  community, and to his family. He started riding Indian motorcycles as a  youth and then became an avid horseback rider until he turned 100,  which is how he earned the nickname ``centennial cowboy.'' He did have  ``a great ride,'' and I am grateful for having been along for some of  it. My wife, Myrna, and I send our deepest condolences and prayers to  his family.                            ____________________
