 Madam President, it is hard to think of much good that  has come out of the 3-month experience with COVID-19, but here is one  thing: the number of patients who have seen their doctors remotely  through the internet, FaceTime, and all of the other remote  technologies we have, including the telephone. We call that telehealth.   Our Health Committee this morning had a fascinating hearing on  telehealth. There was a lot of bipartisan interest from the Senators-- Democrat and Republican Senators. The Senator from Minnesota was the  ranking member of the committee today at the request of Senator Murray.  My sense at the end of the hearing was that there were a number of  things we agreed on.   I ask unanimous consent that my opening statement at the hearing  today be included in the Record following my remarks.   My colleague, the Senator from Tennessee who is presiding today, and  I both know Tim Adams, who is the CEO of the Saint Thomas hospital  system in Middle Tennessee.   He told me on the phone last week that Saint Thomas employs about 800  physicians in its several hospitals. During the month of February,  there were 60,000 visits between physicians and patients in the Saint  Thomas system. Only 50 of those 60,000 were by telehealth, were remote.  But during the 2 months of March and April, Ascension Saint Thomas  conducted more than 30,000 telehealth visits. That is 50 to 30,000-- more than 45 percent of all of the visits between patients and doctors  during that time.   Tim Adams expects that to level off, but there will still be probably  15 to 20 percent of all of Saint Thomas 60,000 visits a month by  telehealth.   I talked to the CEO of the largest hospital in San Francisco a few  weeks ago, and he said that during February, about 5 percent of their  visits between doctors and patients were telehealth. He said that was a  very high percentage for a hospital. But in March, it was more than  half, more than 50 percent.   Think about that for just a moment. There were 884 million visits in  2016 between doctors and patients, according to the Centers for Disease  Control. If 15 to 20 to 25 percent of those were suddenly by telehealth  instead of in-office visits, that would mean hundreds of millions of  visits a year would be by telehealth. It is hard for me to imagine that  there has been a bigger change in the delivery of healthcare services  in recent history or maybe in our country's history than the sudden  shift to telehealth in visits between patients and doctors.   Telehealth has been around for a long time. Our witnesses testified  to that. We had some excellent witnesses. Dr. Rheuban from the  University of Virginia; Dr. Kvedar from Harvard, who is  [[Page S3051]]  the new president of the American Telemedicine Association; Dr. Arora,  who is the founder of Project ECHO, which is well known across the  country; and Dr. Andrea Willis, who is the chief medical officer of  Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee, which apparently is the first  major insurance company to say that it will insure telehealth visits in  the same way that it insures other visits.   What I recommended following the hearing was that two of the policy  changes--which I judge to be the two most important changes in policy  that the Federal Government made--be made permanent.   The first is that physicians can be reimbursed for a telehealth  appointment wherever the patient is, including the patient's home. That  would change the originating site rule, as it is called.   The second is that Medicare, during COVID-19, has begun to reimburse  providers for nearly twice as many types of telehealth services. That  rule, those changes, I believe, also should be made permanent.   What has happened is that we have had an incredible pilot program on  telehealth. We have crammed 10 years of experience into 3 months, and  we have a rare opportunity to look at the 3 months of experience and  make a decision about what works, what doesn't work, and right the  rules of the road for the future.   It is not just the Federal Government changing, I think, a total of  31 different policies, all of which we should examine, but States have  made some changes too. Those changes involve allowing individuals to  cross State lines more easily to get appointments with doctors with  whom they need to talk.   Then the private sector is beginning to change too. I don't know of  other insurance companies that have done what Tennessee Blue Cross Blue  Shield did, but I know there will be some who decide on their own to  begin to move to cover those services.   Senator Braun and Senator Cassidy on our committee brought up the  point that we want to watch carefully to see that we are not just  adding to the cost of healthcare by telehealth; in fact, we ought to  have an opportunity to reduce it. Our goal is always, when delivering  healthcare services, to have as an objective a better outcome, a lower  cost, and a better patient experience. It may very well be possible  that telehealth not only improves the patient experience--we have had  very few complaints about the experience of that--and improves the  outcomes, but it may also lower costs, which is a major objective of  our committee.   Last week, 10 days ago, I issued a white paper about the changes I  thought we needed to make--Congress needs to make--so that we could be  well prepared for the next pandemic after COVID-19, the one we know  will surely come. We don't know when, we don't know what the name of  the virus will be, but we know it will come, and we need to take a  number of steps to be as well prepared for that virus as we can.   Whether its accelerating treatments and testing and finding a vaccine  or collecting data in a different way or better coordination of Federal  officials, all of those things are part of what we need to examine, and  we need to do that this year--this year--because our attention spans  are short in this country. We move on quickly to the next crisis. While  COVID-19 is fresh on our minds, we should do whatever we need to do to  get ready for the next crisis. We should do those things this year.   Among those things we need to do this year is to make permanent the  changes in Federal policy on telehealth that allowed this explosion of  doctor and patient meetings by remote visits. People have been trying  to think of ways to do this for a long time. Unfortunately, it took a  pandemic to cause it to happen. Now, while we can see the result, make  sure we don't have unintended consequences that are unfortunate. While  we are doing that, we need to make those changes.   So I recommend to my colleagues, the testimony from our excellent  witnesses this morning. There were 884 million doctor-patient visits in  2016 in the United States, and very few of them were by telehealth. In  the future, the estimates are there could be as many as 20, 25, 30  percent of all of them, hundreds of millions of doctor-patient visits,  by telehealth. That most likely is the largest change in the delivery  of medical services that our country has ever seen   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             Opening Statement        Telehealth: Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic--June 17, 2020         I spoke recently with Tim Adams, the CEO of Ascension Saint       Thomas Health, which has 9 hospitals in Middle Tennessee and       employs over 800 physicians, who told me that in February       before COVID-19, there were about 60,000 visits between       patients and physicians each month.        Almost all of those visits were done in person. Only about       50 were done remotely through telehealth using the internet.        But during the last two months, Ascension Saint Thomas       conducted more than 30,000 telehealth visits--or around 45       percent of all its visits--because of changes in government       policy and the inability of many patients to see doctors in       person during the COVID-19 pandemic.        Tim Adams expects that to level off at 15-20 percent of all       its visits going forward.        The largest hospital in San Francisco told me that 5       percent of its visits in February were conducted through       telehealth--and the hospital considered that to be a very       high number. Then in March, telehealth visits made up more       than half of all its visits.        Because of COVID-19, our health care sector and government       have been forced to cram 10 years' worth of telehealth       experience into just the past three months.        As dark as this pandemic event has been, it creates an       opportunity to learn from and act upon these three months of       intensive telehealth experiences, specifically what permanent       changes need to be made in federal and state policies.        In 2016, there were almost 884 million visits nationwide       between patients and physicians, according to the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention. If, as Tim Adams expects, 15-      20 percent of those were to become remote due to telehealth       expansion during COVID-19--that would produce a massive       change in our health care system.        Our job should be to ensure that change is done with the       goals of better outcomes and better experiences at a lower       cost.        Part of this explosion in remote meetings between patients       and physicians has been made possible by temporary changes in       federal and state policies. The private sector, too, has made       important changes. One purpose of this hearing is to find out       which of these temporary changes in federal policy should be       maintained, modified, or reversed--and also to find out if       there are any additional federal policies that would help       patients and health care providers take advantage of       delivering medical services using telehealth.        Of the 31 federal policy changes, the three most important       are:        1. Physicians can be reimbursed for a telehealth       appointment wherever the patient is, including in the       patient's home. That change was to the so-called       ``originating site'' rule, which previously required that the       patient live in a rural area and use telehealth at a doctor's       office or clinic.        2. Medicare began to reimburse providers for nearly twice       as many types of telehealth services, including: emergency       department visits, initial nursing facility visits and       discharges, and therapy services.        3. Doctors are allowed to conduct appointments using common       video apps on your phone, like Apple FaceTime, or phone       texting apps, or even on a landline call, which required       relaxing federal privacy and security rules from the Health       Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.        Many states made changes as well, most importantly making       it easier for doctors to continue to see their patients who       may have traveled out of state during the pandemic.        For example, a college student from Memphis, who attends       college in North Carolina and has a doctor she sees in Chapel       Hill, was able to go home to Tennessee during the pandemic       and continue seeing her Chapel Hill doctor by FaceTime. Or, a       patient in Iowa has been able to start seeing a new       psychiatrist in Nashville.        The private sector adapted to these changes, too. One of       our witnesses today is from Blue Cross Blue Shield of       Tennessee, which has already begun to make permanent       adjustments to its telehealth coverage policies based on some       of the temporary federal changes in Medicare.        Looking forward, of the three major federal changes, my       instinct is that the originating site rule change and the       expansion of covered telehealth services should be made       permanent.        One purpose of this hearing is to hear from the experts and       discuss whether there may be unintended consequences,       positive or negative, if Congress were to do that.        It's also important to examine the other 28 temporary       changes in federal policy.        The question of whether to extend the HIPAA privacy waivers       should be considered carefully. There are privacy and       security concerns about the use of personal medical       information by technology platform companies, as well as       concerns about criminals hacking into these platforms. When       HIPAA notification requirements are waived, a person might       not even know that their personal information has been       accessed by hackers.  [[Page S3052]]       Additionally, several of these technology platforms have said       they want to adjust their platforms to conform with the HIPAA       rules.        Another lesson from these three months is that telehealth       or teleworking or tele-learning is not always the answer,       especially for people in rural areas or low-income urban       areas who do not have access to broadband.        And still another lesson is that personal relationships       involved in health care, education, and the workplace cannot       always be replaced by remote technology. Children have       learned about all they want to learn over the internet,       patients like to see their doctors, and workplaces benefit       from employees actually talking and working with one another       in person. There are some limits on remote learning, health       care, and working.        There are obvious benefits to allowing health care       providers to serve patients across state lines during a       public health crisis. As a former governor, I am reluctant to       override state decisions, but it may be possible to encourage       further participation in interstate compacts or reciprocity       agreements.        Last week I released a white paper on steps that Congress       should take before the end of the year in order to get ready       for the next pandemic. One of those recommendations was to       make sure that patients do not lose the benefits that they       have gained from using telehealth during the COVID-19       pandemic.        Even with an event as significant as COVID-19, memories       fade and attention moves quickly to the next crisis, so it is       important for Congress to act on legislation this year.        Because of this 10 years of telehealth experience crammed       into 3 months--patients, doctors, nurses, therapists, and       caregivers can write some new rules of the road, and should       do so while the experiences still are fresh on everyone's       minds.     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
