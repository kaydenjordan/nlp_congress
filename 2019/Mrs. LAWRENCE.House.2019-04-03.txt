 Mr. Chairman, today, I rise in support of H.R. 1585,  the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019.   I would like to first thank Representative Karen Bass, the sponsor of  this legislation, for her support of this issue.   As important as the successes of this bill have been, they are at  times insufficient. Every day, an average of three women are killed by  a current or former intimate partner. Every year, 7.9 million women are  victims of stalking, rape, or physical violence by an intimate partner.   The bill before us today provides important updates to the Violence  Against Women Act that improves services for victims of domestic  violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.   Mr. Chairman, as co-chair of the Bipartisan Women's Caucus and as co- chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus, I strongly urge my colleagues,  on both sides of the aisle, to support this passage of legislation.
