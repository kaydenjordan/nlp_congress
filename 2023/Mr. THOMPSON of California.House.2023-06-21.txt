 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   I rise in strong support of this legislation. I thank my colleague  from Nebraska and my friend, Mr. Smith, for working with me on this  important bill.   This legislation before us today simplifies the ACA reporting process  for employers and businesses across our country. The bill allows  employers to submit required information electronically and improves  privacy protections by eliminating the unnecessary requirement that  employers collect dependents' Social Security numbers.   In addition, the bill ensures that employers have a reasonable  opportunity to respond to the IRS before being assessed penalties,  while simultaneously ensuring the IRS has the time and tools it needs  to assess penalties to bad actors.   I share my colleagues' disappointment that prospective reporting  provisions of the bill were removed. I understand the challenges facing  the Treasury Department, and I look forward to working with my  colleagues toward a resolution on that front.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   I reiterate my thanks to my partner on this bill, Mr. Smith from  Nebraska. This is a bill that I have worked on for the last four  Congresses. It will make life easier for businesses, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
