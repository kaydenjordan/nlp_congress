 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate Dr. John E. Quatroche's 100th birthday on May 2 of this year.   Mr. Quatroche is a longtime resident of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.  He is an accomplished veterinarian and a World War II veteran.   At 22 years old, John enlisted in the Army Air Corps, which is now  the United States Air Force. He was a transport pilot and flew C-47s.  Throughout his service, he had many jobs, but one of the most important  was towing gliders during the last airdrops of the Second World War.   After service, John returned to Punxsutawney, earning his veterinary  degree, and he served as a local veterinarian for nearly 60 years.   I had the privilege of being with John and his wife, Irene, on  Sunday. We celebrated his birthday a little early as a part of Loyalty  Day in Punxsutawney.   John, congratulations on this magnificent milestone. I pray that God  will continue to richly bless you; your wife, Irene; and your family.  Happy birthday.                            ____________________
