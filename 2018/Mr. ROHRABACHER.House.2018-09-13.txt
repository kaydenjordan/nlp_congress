 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6227, the  National Quantum Initiative Act. This act will move us toward a new  millennium of computing.   Computers used to be big, really large, and the ways to make them  more powerful was thought to be by making them bigger and bigger.  Enormous mainframes filled entire office floors.   Well, after some very significant discoveries and development in the  technological arena, we advanced this technology, making computers  smaller, lighter, and more capable so we could send, for example,  astronauts to the Moon. That led to more and more improvements, and now  computers are in cars, are in our coffee machines and everything else  that we do. They have gotten so small that most of us can carry them  around and, perhaps, right now, are carrying them around in our pocket.   At this point now, we stand on the cusp of another giant leap forward  for mankind, the quantum leap. By harnessing the natural properties of  atomic and subatomic particles, we can develop the capabilities in the  next decade that are far more capable than the systems that we marvel  about today.   This act will coordinate our Federal activity, reduce waste and  redundancy, and ensure that our efforts are strategic. This will keep  us in advance, and way in advance, of our adversaries around the globe  and ensure our security and our prosperity.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this act and supporting  a better future for America and the world.
