 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 2852) to amend the National Housing Act to authorize  State-licensed appraisers to conduct appraisals in connection with  mortgages insured by the FHA and to require compliance with the  existing appraiser education requirement, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2852         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Homebuyer Assistance Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. APPRAISAL STANDARDS FOR SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSING                     MORTGAGES.         (a) Certification or Licensing.--Paragraph (5) of section       202(g) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1708(g)) is       amended--        (1) by striking subparagraph (A) and inserting the       following new subparagraph:        ``(A)(i) in the case of an appraiser for a mortgage for       single-family housing, be certified or licensed by the State       in which the property to be appraised is located; and        ``(ii) in the case of an appraiser for a mortgage for       multifamily housing, be certified by the State in which the       property to be appraised is located; and''; and        (2) in subparagraph (B), by inserting before the period at       the end the following: ``, which, in the case of appraisers       for any mortgage for single-family housing, shall include       completion of a course or seminar that consists of not less       than 7 hours of training regarding such appraisal       requirements that is approved by the Course Approval Program       of the Appraiser Qualifications Board of the Appraisal       Foundation or a State appraiser certifying and licensing       agency''.        (b) Compliance With Verifiable Education Requirements;       Grandfathering.--Effective beginning on the date of the       effectiveness of the mortgagee letter or other guidance       issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section,       notwithstanding any choice or approval of any appraiser made       before such date of enactment, no appraiser may conduct an       appraisal for any mortgage for single-family housing insured       under title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1707 et       seq.) unless such appraiser is, as of such date of       effectiveness, in compliance with--        (1) all of the requirements under section 202(g)(5) of such       Act (12 U.S.C. 1708(g)(5)), as amended by subsection (a) of       this section, including the requirement under subparagraph       (B) of such section 202(g)(5) (relating to demonstrated       verifiable education in appraisal requirements); or        (2) all of the requirements under section 202(g)(5) of such       Act as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment       of this Act.        (c) Implementation.--Not later than the expiration of the       240-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this       Act, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall       issue a mortgagee letter or other guidance that shall--        (1) implement the amendments made by subsection (a) of this       section;        (2) clearly set forth all of the specific requirements       under section 202(g)(5) of the National Housing Act (as       amended by subsection (a) of this section) for approval to       conduct appraisals under title II of such Act for mortgages       for single-family housing, which shall include--        (A) providing that the completion, prior to the effective       date of such mortgagee letter or guidance, of training       meeting the requirements under subparagraph (B) of such       section 202(g)(5) (as amended by subsection (a) of this       section) shall be considered to fulfill the requirement under       such subparagraph; and        (B) providing a method for appraisers to demonstrate such       prior completion; and        (3) take effect not later than the expiration of the 180-      day period beginning upon issuance of such mortgagee letter       or guidance.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 2852, the Homebuyer Assistance Act of 2019, would make a  commonsense update to FHA's requirements governing appraisals, to allow  licensed appraisers to conduct appraisals for FHA-backed mortgages.   The current requirement for all FHA loans to utilize a certified  appraiser is simply outdated as it was put into place at a time when  there were no minimum Federal standards for State licensure of  appraisers, leaving concerns about consistency and competency across  States. Now that we do have minimum standards for licensure, FHA's  certification requirement is not only out of date and out of alignment  with Fannie and Freddie, it is also creating market pressures for  lenders to require certified appraisers for all loans, even if they are  not FHA loans, just in case the mortgage switches to an FHA loan midway  through the process. This, in turn, makes it harder for licensed  appraisers to obtain work at a time when certain areas are experiencing  appraiser shortages and when we are already struggling to recruit new  appraisers effectively.   There is simply no sound policy rationale to explain why licensed  appraisers that are perfectly qualified to conduct appraisals for GSE  loans are not qualified to conduct appraisals for FHA loans.   This bill is supported by a broad coalition of not just appraisal  industry groups but also lenders and housing advocacy groups that  recognize that this is an unnecessary barrier.   I thank Mr. Sherman for introducing this legislation and the  Republican cosponsor, Mr. Duffy, for his support for this important  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman).    Mr. Speaker, I too thank the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman) for bringing this legislation forward and for  the support of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy).   This bill removes unnecessary barriers to the home-buying process,  which will help millions of Americans over time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 3620) to provide rental assistance to low-income tenants  in certain multifamily rural housing projects financed by the Rural  Housing Service of the Department of Agriculture, and to develop and  implement a plan for preserving the affordability of rural rental  housing, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3620         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Paragraph (3) of section 41411(a) of the Violence Against       Women Act of 1994 (34 U.S.C. 12491(a)(3)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (I), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) by redesignating subparagraph (J) as subparagraph (K);       and        (3) by inserting after subparagraph (I) the following new       subparagraph:        ``(J) rural development housing voucher assistance provided       by the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to section 542 of       the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1490r), without regard to       subsection (b) of such section, and applicable appropriation       Acts; and''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3620, the Strategy and  Investment in Rural Housing Preservation Act of 2019, which will  provide a comprehensive solution to address the imminent crisis of  aging USDA multifamily rental housing that currently serves nearly  400,000 low-income families in rural America.   Like HUD properties, these properties have suffered from years of  inadequate funding, and according to the GAO, USDA does not have a  coherent strategy to preserve these homes and prevent the displacement  of low-income families. For these families, the homes we are trying to  preserve often represent the only affordable housing in their  communities.   Without Congress providing the resources and tools the USDA needs to  preserve properties in its affordable housing portfolio, many of these  families will be displaced, not only from their homes, but from their  communities. And even worse, some might fall into homelessness.   To address this problem, H.R. 3620 would permanently authorize the  Multifamily Housing Preservation and Revitalization Demonstration  program that allows USDA to restructure loans for existing USDA  multifamily properties, to provide incentive for private owners to  continue to participate in the agency's affordable housing programs and  provide those properties with further investment.   To carry out the program, H.R. 3620 would authorize $1 billion in  funding over 5 years. It would also require USDA to develop a plan for  implementing the new funding and authorities available to them under  this bill to ensure that a comprehensive strategy is in place to  preserve these rural housing properties and avoid resident  displacement.   The bill would also establish an advisory committee made up of  diverse stakeholders, including low-income tenants to include USDA on  the implementation of its plan.   Lastly, this bill includes the text of Congressman Vicente Gonzalez's  bill that will add the Rural Housing Voucher Program to the list of  covered housing programs under the Violence Against Women Act.   Groups that represent both tenants and owners support H.R. 3620,  including the National Rural Housing Coalition, the Council for  Affordable and Rural Housing, the National Housing Law Project, the  Housing Assistance Council, the National Housing Trust, and the Local  Initiatives Support Corporation.   I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) for introducing this  important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Clay), the sponsor of this legislation and the chair of  the Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development and Insurance.    Mr. Speaker, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound  of cure.   I, again, commend the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) for bringing  this bill before the House.  [[Page H7576]]    We are committed to helping prevent and address homelessness wherever  they may find themselves, and this bill will go a long way in  addressing the need to prevent homelessness in rural communities.   H.R. 3620 passed the committee by a vote of 57-0, and I urge all of  my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 281) to amend the Federal Reserve Act to require Federal  Reserve banks to interview at least one individual reflective of gender  diversity and one individual reflective of racial or ethnic diversity  when appointing Federal Reserve bank presidents, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 281         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The Congress finds that--        (1) while significant progress has occurred due to the       antidiscrimination amendments to the Federal Reserve Act,       barriers continue to pose significant obstacles for       candidates reflective of gender diversity and racial or       ethnic diversity for Federal Reserve bank president positions       in the Federal Reserve System;        (2) the continuing barriers described in paragraph (1)       merit the following amendment;        (3) Congress has received and reviewed testimony and       documentation of the historical lack of gender, racial, and       ethnic diversity from numerous sources, including       congressional hearings, scientific reports, reports issued by       public and private agencies, news stories, and reports of       related barriers by organizations and individuals, which show       that       race-, ethnicity-, and gender-neutral efforts alone are       insufficient to address the problem;        (4) the testimony and documentation described in paragraph       (3) demonstrate that barriers across the United States prove       problematic for full and fair participation in developing       monetary policy by individuals reflective of gender diversity       and racial or ethnic diversity; and        (5) the testimony and documentation described in paragraph       (3) provide a strong basis that there is a compelling need       for the below amendment to address the historical lack of       gender, racial, and ethnic diversity in the Federal Reserve       regional bank presidents selection process in the Federal       Reserve System.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), the  chair of the Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion, for this  incredibly important piece of legislation, and the Members on the other  side of the aisle who also support this bill.   For far too long, the Federal Reserve system has been very homogenous  since its inception in 1913. This only partially changed when, in 2017,  Raphael Bostic was appointed as the first African American and openly  gay male to serve as Federal Reserve Bank President. Additionally, only  six women have served in a similar capacity, despite America becoming  more demographically diverse.   To address this lack of gender and ethnic representation, H.R. 281  would require the Federal Reserve Bank to interview at least one  individual reflective of gender diversity and one reflective of racial  or ethnic diversity when filling Federal Reserve Bank president  vacancies.   To ensure accountability of this diversity effort, the bill would  further require the Federal Reserve report annually on the applicant  pool demographics. We must ensure the leadership of the Federal Reserve  System reflects the growing diversity of our Nation and that gender and  racially and ethnically diverse candidates are receiving serious  consideration for president vacancies at the 12 Federal Reserve banks.   Increasing diverse leadership representation will ensure that more  perspectives are considered when making decisions about America's  economic future.   Again, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for pushing  this important bill and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 281.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), the sponsor of this legislation and the chair  of the Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to  close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Once again, I thank Representative Beatty for bringing forward this  legislation. I am excited to read about the Beatty rule in future  financial news, and I am excited to see strong bipartisan support for  something that is just common sense.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 241) to amend the Bank Service Company Act to provide  improvements with respect to State banking agencies, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 241         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Bank Service Company       Examination Coordination Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. BANK SERVICE COMPANY ACT IMPROVEMENTS.         The Bank Service Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1861 et seq.) is       amended--        (1) in section 1(b)--        (A) by redesignating paragraphs (2) through (9) as       paragraphs (3) through (10), respectively; and        (B) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:        ``(2) the term `State banking agency' shall have the same       meaning given the term `State Bank Supervisor' under section       3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act;'';        (2) in section 5(a), by inserting ``, in consultation with       the State banking agency,'' after ``banking agency''; and        (3) in section 7--        (A) in subsection (a)--        (i) in the first sentence, by inserting ``or State banking       agency'' after ``appropriate Federal banking agency''; and        (ii) in the second sentence, by striking ``Federal banking       agency that supervises any other shareholder or member'' and       inserting ``Federal or State banking agency that supervises       any other shareholder or member'';        (B) in subsection (c)--        (i) by inserting ``or a State banking agency'' after       ``appropriate Federal banking agency'';        (ii) by striking ``such agency'' each place such term       appears and inserting ``such Federal or State agency'';        (C) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (f);        (D) by inserting after subsection (c) the following:        ``(d) Availability of Information.--Information obtained       pursuant to the regulation and examination of service       providers under this section or applicable State law may be       furnished by and accessible to Federal and State agencies to       the same extent that supervisory information concerning       depository institutions is authorized to be furnished to and       required to be accessible by Federal and State agencies under       section 7(a)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12       U.S.C. 1817(a)(2)) or State law, as applicable.        ``(e) Coordination With State Banking Agencies.--Where a       State bank is principal shareholder or principal member of a       bank service company or where a State bank is any other       shareholder or member of the bank service company, the       appropriate Federal banking agency, in carrying out       examinations authorized by this section, shall--        ``(1) provide reasonable and timely notice to the State       banking agency; and        ``(2) to the fullest extent possible, coordinate and avoid       duplication of examination activities, reporting       requirements, and requests for information.'';        (E) in subsection (f), as so redesignated, by inserting ``,       in consultation with State banking agencies,'' after       ``appropriate Federal banking agencies''; and        (F) by adding at the end the following:        ``(g) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall       be construed as granting authority for a State banking agency       to examine a bank service company where no such authority       exists in State law.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 241, the Bank Service  Company Examination Coordination Act of 2019.   I thank the gentleman from Texas, Representative Williams, for his  work on this bill that would promote better coordination between  Federal and State banking regulators as they oversee third-party  vendors and companies that provide a wide range of services for banks.   In recent years, technology has disrupted every industry, including  banking, and has given the significant cybersecurity risks that come  with that technology.   In light of the recent Capital One data breach, which involved  consumer data the bank stored on a cloud server provided by Amazon Web  Services, a third-party service provider, or TSP, used by the bank and  many other companies, it is important that Congress ensure there is  strong oversight over these third-party companies that work with banks.   Currently, the Bank Service Company Act authorizes Federal regulators  to examine TSPs to assess the risks they may pose to the banks with  which they work. Similarly, many State banking regulators are  authorized to examine bank TSPs under various State laws. These State  regulators are responsible for ensuring that these third-party  relationships do not pose undue risks to the State-chartered banking  system, which accounts for nearly 80 percent of all banks in the United  States.   However, the Bank Service Company Act is silent regarding State bank  regulators, which could hamper information sharing among State and  Federal regulators.   While H.R. 241 would not give States any new authority to conduct TSP  exams, it would recognize at the Federal level the supervisory  authority that many State regulators already have under current State  law and encourage Federal regulators to coordinate with them.   Given the increase in fintech companies that partner with banks,  especially State-chartered banks, it is important that we consider ways  to encourage innovation, coordination, and consistency among Federal  and State regulators in the oversight of TSPs.   Furthermore, in its 2017 annual report, the Financial Stability  Oversight Council recommended that Congress pass legislation to  strengthen oversight of third-party companies that  [[Page H7580]]  work with banks to improve cybersecurity. To that end, last Congress,  Democrats and Republicans of the Committee on Financial Services voted  unanimously, 56-0, in support of this legislation.   H.R. 241 will promote consistency and strengthen oversight of our  banks and the technology companies with which they work. Therefore, I  encourage Members to support H.R. 241, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Meeks), the chair of the Consumer Protection and  Financial Institutions Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Better coordination between Federal and State banking regulators will  make oversight of third-party vendors and companies that provide a wide  range of services for banks more effective. H.R. 241 helps accomplish  that.   I want to again thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) for  introducing this bill, as well as the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Meeks) for his advocacy.  [[Page H7581]]    I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 241.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1690) to require carbon monoxide alarms or detectors in  certain federally assisted housing, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1690         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Carbon Monoxide Alarms       Leading Every Resident To Safety Act of 2019'' or the ``CO       ALERTS Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) carbon monoxide alarms are not required by federally       assisted housing programs, when not required by State or       local codes;        (2) numerous federally assisted housing residents have lost       their lives due to carbon monoxide poisoning;        (3) the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning occur       immediately and can result in death in a matter of minutes;        (4) carbon monoxide exposure can cause permanent brain       damage, life-threatening cardiac complications, fetal death       or miscarriage, and death, among other harmful health       conditions;        (5) carbon monoxide poisoning is especially dangerous for       unborn babies, children, elderly individuals, and individuals       with cardiovascular disease, among others with chronic health       conditions;        (6) the majority of the 4,600,000 families receiving       Federal housing assistance are families with young children,       elderly individuals, or individuals with disabilities, making       them especially vulnerable to carbon monoxide poisoning;        (7) more than 400 people die and 50,000 additional people       visit the emergency room annually as a result of carbon       monoxide poisoning;        (8) carbon monoxide poisoning is entirely preventable and       early detection is possible with the use of carbon monoxide       alarms;        (9) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns       that carbon monoxide poisoning is entirely preventable and       recommends the installation of carbon monoxide alarms;        (10) the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes of       the Department of Housing and Urban Development recommends       the installation of carbon monoxide alarms as a best practice       to keep families and individuals safe and to protect health;       and        (11) in order to safeguard the health and well-being of       tenants in federally assisted housing, the Federal Government       should consider best practices for primary prevention of       carbon monoxide-related incidents.

[[Page H7582]]         (i) No Preemption.--Nothing in the amendments made by this       section shall be construed to preempt or limit the       applicability of any State or local law relating to the       installation and maintenance of carbon monoxide alarms or       detectors in housing that requires standards that are more       stringent than the standards described in the amendments made       by this section.       SEC. 4. STUDY ON INCLUSION OF CARBON MONOXIDE ALARMS OR                     DETECTORS IN OTHER UNITS.         The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in       consultation with the Consumer Product Safety Commission,       shall conduct a study and issue a publicly available report       on requiring carbon monoxide alarms or detectors in federally       assisted housing that is not covered in the amendments made       by section 3.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1690, the CO ALERTS Act  of 2019, which would prevent needless carbon monoxide deaths from  happening in federally assisted housing.   Known as the silent killer, carbon monoxide is an odorless,  colorless, tasteless, and nonirritant gas that is produced by common  fuel-burning products and appliances, such as gas ranges, cars, heating  systems, boilers, and portable engine-driven generators.   High levels of carbon monoxide can cause serious illness and, in  worst cases, death. Carbon monoxide poisoning is as risky to health and  safety as a fire.   But while smoke detectors are required in all housing units,  including public and assisted housing units, carbon monoxide detectors  are not. Only some States and localities currently require carbon  monoxide detectors. They are not otherwise required in federally  assisted housing, such as public housing or private market units  inhabited by Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher households. Therefore,  public and assisted housing residents are at risk of this silent  killer.   According to media reports, there have been 13 carbon monoxide  poisoning deaths cited in public housing since 2003. Four have occurred  in 2019 alone.   In April of this year, HUD's Office of Public and Indian Housing sent  a notice to public housing authorities and private owners of HUD- subsidized housing to encourage them to install and maintain carbon  monoxide detectors.   Unfortunately, in the absence of funding and clear statutory  requirements, public housing authorities and property owners will  struggle to afford the cost of these critical safety devices.   H.R. 1690 will provide just over $300 million over a 3-year period to  support the installation and maintenance of carbon monoxide detectors  and alarms in public and assisted housing, including units in rural  areas.   No family should have to learn their loved ones died because Congress  did not invest in a simple and cost-effective solution that would have  prevented this tragedy from happening in the first place.   I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Garcia) for  introducing this lifesaving legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Garcia), the sponsor of the legislation and an active  member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I just want to extend a sincere thanks to Representative Garcia for  this life-saving legislation. To be able to introduce something that is  actually going to save lives, not just immediately but over the  generations that we are going to continue to provide for is something  very profound. It is an honor to be able to serve with Representative  Garcia. It is an honor to see so much bipartisan support for this  legislation, as well as both Houses of our Congress.   I humbly ask my colleagues to please join all of us in supporting  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
