 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be in  a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein  for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, it is with a very heavy heart that I stand  today in  [[Page S2687]]  the Senate to talk about the death of two Americans last week. One  tragedy is tearing our communities apart. The other may well show us a  path back toward unity.   We all know about the brutal, senseless killing of George Floyd in  Minneapolis last Monday. There is no excuse for what the police did to  Mr. Floyd. His killers are being brought to justice.   His death, we hope, will not be remembered for the senseless violence  launched falsely in his name but, rather, hopefully, in the long-term  reform of policing policies across our country.   In my home State of Utah, the city of Ogden is mourning another  death, that of Police Officer Nate Lyday.   On Thursday, May 28, a woman called 9-1-1 saying that her husband was  threatening her life. Lyday and a group of officers arrived promptly at  the house. The man began shooting at them from inside the home. Lyday  was mortally wounded.   He was just 24 years old. He was about to celebrate his fifth wedding  anniversary with his wife Ashley.   He had been on the job as a police officer for just 15 months. By all  accounts, he did that job honorably and completely up to the last  moment. Nate Lyday was an officer who sought to uphold justice and  protect the innocent, even making the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of a  threatened and fearful family.   Nate Lyday was a ``son of Ogden,'' as Police Chief Randy Watt said.  Ogden was where he was born and raised, where he went to high school,  and where he worked on a regular basis at the Fresh Market on 20th  Street and where he got his degree in criminal justice from Weber State  University.   And it was where he was proud to serve and protect his community as a  sworn police officer. According to Lieutenant Brian Eynon, Lyday was an  officer who ``worked over and above the call of duty.'' Eynon said that  whenever he passed Lyday in the hallways, the young officer would  always smile at him, even before he had a chance to smile first.   As his colleagues, his friends, and his classmates remember him, Nate  Lyday made everyone around him feel like a friend, no matter how well  they knew him because they were indeed his friends.   This Saturday, while far too many other communities throughout our  Nation were tearing themselves apart, Ogden came together. Hundreds of  Ogden residents gathered near the front steps of the Ogden Municipal  Building to honor the memory of George Floyd and to call for nationwide  police reform.   But this was not a divisive event designed to make everyone choose  sides between police and protesters. As Malik Dayo, an Ogden activist  and organizer, said that day:         This is a peaceful protest. . . . This is not an anti-cop       rally. This is a solidarity rally.    The protesters at the event honored George's memory, they condemned  racism, and they called for policing reforms. They also thanked the  officers who were there, the same officers there protecting them and  protecting their First Amendment rights to speak freely and gather  peacefully. And they honored the memory of Officer Lyday, who lost his  life answering the call of duty just a few days before.   ``I gave them my condolences for their fallen officer--our fallen  officer--because we're all part of the same community,'' Dayo said of  the police after the protest.   And Dayo is right. Nate Lyday's loss is our loss. George Floyd's loss  is our loss. And we ought to honor and remember them both.   We must all work to uphold justice for all. Both of these tragic,  horrific deaths last week show us just how far we still have to go to  achieve this goal. It is work that must be undertaken by each and every  one of us, each and every day. We cannot do that work by pitting  ourselves against one another--race versus race, police versus  protester.   We will never move forward if we continue to reduce human beings to  the color of their skin or the color of their uniform. We are all one  Nation, and it will only be in standing and in working together, in  peaceful solidarity, that we can finally heal the wounds in our Nation.   What the people of Ogden did this weekend is an example for us all.  And it is a reason for hope.   I yield the floor.
