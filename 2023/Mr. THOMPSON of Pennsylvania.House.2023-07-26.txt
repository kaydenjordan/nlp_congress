 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  commemorate the 50th anniversary of the historic Clinton County Fair.   For half a century, Clinton County has brought local artisans,  talented agricultural professionals, and an eager community together,  and I want to acknowledge and celebrate the fair's success.   With humble beginnings as a horse-and-pony roundup run on donated  time in a horse ring near Pine Creek, Pennsylvania, the organizers of  the small event had big aspirations. Turning the simple livestock show  into a full-fledged agriculture extravaganza would be no small feat,  accomplished through the hard work and gracious efforts of volunteers.   In the years to come, the determined fair committee and their  community fought through the red tape and battled funding ordeals.  After many years of hard work, they emerged with a fully-fledged  fairground and all the resources to put on an impressive display of  local agriculture.   Today's annual Clinton County Fair is a testament to the hard work,  determination, and strong values that are essential to both rural  communities and our Nation. By funneling resources into local  agricultural economies, farmers and families alike reap the benefits of  collective effort.                            ____________________
