 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. George Debnam who,  sadly, passed away last month.   Dr. Debman was a towering figure in our community, best known for  delivering 10,000 babies; the most by any single physician in the  history of North Carolina.   Dr. Debnam dedicated his life to providing quality healthcare,  championing accessible education, and advancing social justice. It is  only fitting that we honor Dr. Debman during Black History Month. He  played a critical role in integrating healthcare in Raleigh while he  worked at St. Agnes Hospital.   Born in Youngsville, and a longtime resident of Raleigh, Dr. Debman  attended Shaw University and worked throughout his life to ensure that  Shaw got the resources it needed to grow and thrive.   Today, his enduring legacy lives on through his twin daughters; both  are physicians at the Debman Clinic in Southeast Raleigh.   Our community is forever indebted to Dr. Debman and his family.                            ____________________
