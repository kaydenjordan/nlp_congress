 Madam Speaker, the United States is  experiencing an affordable housing crisis, and western New York is not  immune.   Older communities like Buffalo and Niagara Falls have aging houses  with good bones, but the high cost to rehab these properties, compared  to their value, causes them to fall into disrepair. As a result,  neighborhoods are plagued by blighted homes and vacant lots.   That is why we introduced the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act,  which  [[Page H2750]]  closes the value gap these neighborhoods face with a tax credit to  encourage investing in single-family homes to revitalize these  communities.   Over the next 10 years, this bill could help build or rehabilitate  500,000 homes and create more than 700,000 construction jobs. For the  families whose dreams of homeownership feel unattainable, this can be a  game changer.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join Representative   Mike  Kelly and me in supporting this legislation for communities across the  Nation and the families who want to see them thrive long into the  future.                            ____________________
