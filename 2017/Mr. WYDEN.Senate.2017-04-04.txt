 Mr. President, today I, along with my colleague Senator  Paul from Kentucky, am introducing the Protecting Data at the Border  Act, a bill that protects Americans and U.S. Permanent Residents from  warrantless searches of their electronic devices at the border.   1n 2014, the Supreme Court established in California v. Riley that  law enforcement agencies must obtain a probable cause search warrant  before they can search someone's phone or laptop during a ``search  incident to arrest.'' Prior to that decision, law enforcement agencies  around the country routinely engaged in warrantless searches of phones  and other electronic devices. The Supreme Court rightly recognized that  we need new, stronger rules to protect digital information.   Although the warrant protections from Riley have been the law of the  land for the last three years, a significant loophole has remained: the  border. The Riley decision left unresolved the question of whether or  not U.S. Customs can search the smartphones and laptops of U.S. persons  as they leave the country and return home. This is not a theoretical  concern. According to recent statistics provided by Customs and Border  Protection, searches of cellphones by border agents has exploded,  growing fivefold in just one  [[Page S2217]]  year, from fewer than 5,000 in 2015 to nearly 25,000 in 2016. Five- thousand devices were searched this last February alone, more than in  all of 2015.   My colleague, Senator Paul and I intend to close this loophole,  ensuring that U.S. persons crossing the border do not have lesser  digital privacy rights than individuals who are arrested inside the  United States.   This bill has four main components.   First, it requires that law enforcement agencies obtain a probable  cause warrant before they can search the laptop, smartphone or other  electronic device belonging to a U.S. person at the border. The bill  includes an emergency exception to this warrant requirement, modeled  after USA Freedom Act section 102, which became law in 2015.   Second, it requires informed, written consent before the government  may request and obtain voluntary assistance from a U.S. person  accessing data on a locked device or account, such as by disclosing  their password or otherwise providing access. The bill also prohibits  the government from delaying or denying entry to a U.S. person if he or  she refuses to provide such assistance.   Third, it requires that the government obtain a warrant before it can  copy and retain a U.S. person's data, even if the data has been  collected without a warrant, during an emergency.   Fourth, it requires that the government create and publish statistics  on the electronic border searches they conduct.   Passage of this bill would ensure that the important privacy rights  recognized by the Supreme Court in Riley also apply at the border,  while still enabling law enforcement agencies continue to do the  important work of keeping our country safe.   I thank my colleague Senator Paul for his efforts on this bill, and I  hope the Senate will consider our proposal quickly.                                  ______                                         By Mr. BARRASSO (for himself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Booker,          Mr. Boozman, and Mr. Whitehouse):   S. 826. A bill to reauthorize the Partners for Fish and Wildlife  Program and certain wildlife conservation funds, to establish prize  competitions relating to the prevention of wildlife poaching and  trafficking, wildlife conservation, the manaement of invasive species,  and the protection of endangered species, and for other purposes; to  the Committee on Environment and Public Works.

What we don't  hear people talk about as much is the fuel that feeds the engines:  capital. Without capital, entrepreneurs cannot see their ideas to  fruition, successful business owners cannot expand to meet the needs of  the market, and eager job seekers must take their skills elsewhere.  Without capital, Main Street falters, and Wall Street keeps the  advantage.   Today, more than 9 years after the start of the great recession and  many policy reforms later, access to capital remains a challenge. This  capital drought hampers small business growth, economic development,  and job creation in Oregon and across the country. Despite this,  government regulation continues to tie the hands of many willing small  businesses lenders--namely, credit unions. According to some estimates,  credit unions could lend an additional $11 billion to small businesses  if Congress loosened restraints on credit union business lending.   With this in mind, I am pleased to introduce today the Credit Union  Residential Loan Parity Act with Senator Murkowski. This bill would  increase access to capital by exempting certain loans from the member  business lending cap imposed on credit unions. Currently, loans made  for one- to four- person, non-owner-occupied housing are treated as  business loans when they are made by credit unions. As such, these  types of loans count against a credit union's business lending cap,  effectively limiting a credit union's ability to provide loans to small  businesses. Our legislation would address this issue by allowing credit  unions to treat these types of loans as residential loans--the same  treatment these kinds of loans receive when made by other financial  institutions. In effect, the bill would exempt residential loans from  the business lending cap. This exemption would increase access to  capital for small businesses, which in turn would create jobs and grow  our local economies. In addition to generally increasing credit union  lending, our legislation would directly free up capital for small  businesses that make much needed investments in rental housing.   I am hopeful that this legislation will be received by colleagues for  what it is--a simple step to help ensure America's small businesses  have access to the fuel they need to power our economy.   It is my hope that the Senate will pass this legislation swiftly.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 836         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act or the       amendment made by this Act shall preclude the National Credit       Union Administration from treating an extension of credit       that is fully secured by a lien on a 1- to 4-family dwelling       that is not the primary residence of a member as a member       business loan for purposes other than the member business       loan limitation requirements under section 107A of the       Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1757a).                                  ______                                         By Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Baldwin, Mrs. Ernst,          Mr. Brown, and Mr. Portman):   S. 842.

We are wishing him health and Godspeed. We  look forward to his full and complete recovery. We are so glad to have  him here.   I am also pleased that Senator Coons is on the floor, because I think  it would be fair to say that Members on both sides of the aisle who  have watched how Senator Coons has conducted himself throughout this  extraordinarily contentious debate would say that Senator Coons makes  all of us very, very proud.   It is no secret that he has tried repeatedly to bring both sides  together, and he and I have talked often about this. I think there are  going to be opportunities for finding common ground on important  legislation, breaking out of this gridlock that we all understand is  not what the Senate is all about and forging toward more mainstream  topics. When we get there, to a great extent, it will be because of the  thoughtful comments of my friend from Delaware.   Mr. President, the Senate is going to act on one of its most sacred  and important constitutional duties, the advice and consent on the  nomination of the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.   The long tails of these Supreme Court debates stretch through  generations and shape our government deep into the future. The choice  the Senate makes in this extraordinary debate will have a profound  impact, from the broadest governing statutes down to the most specific  particulars of the law that affect our daily lives.   There are several issues that are particularly relevant to this  nominee that have gotten short shrift. I am talking about secret law,  and warrantless wiretapping, death with dignity. I intend to discuss  these issues shortly.   I would like to begin, however, by stating that whether one supports  or opposes Judge Gorsuch, our job would have been easier had the judge  been more forthcoming in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee.  He chose, however, not to do so. So what the Senate has to go by  instead is the judge's lengthy record of adhering to a rigid and far- right philosophy that is packaged in the branding of so-called  originalism.   The originalist says that our rights as a people are contained within  and linked to our founding documents. But that viewpoint is plainly  incorrect. In practice, originalism becomes a cover for protecting the  fortunate over the poor, corporations over individuals, and the  powerful over virtually every other American. It is a political agenda  that masquerades as philosophy, an agenda whose sole intent is  reserving power for those in power and limiting the recognition of the  rights reserved to the people.   Far from endorsing such a creed, our Constitution is actually a  document of constraints, constraints that bind the government, not the  people. The full scope of our fundamental rights as a people, as  Justice M. Harlan once wrote, ``cannot be found in or limited by the  precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the  Constitution.'' The exact concept is written into the Bill of Rights  itself. The Ninth Amendment says: ``The enumeration in the  Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or  disparage others retained by the people.''   James Madison, the founder so significant that Americans are said to  live in a ``Madisonian Democracy,'' was outspoken about the dangers of  future readers or interpreters thinking that the fundamental rights  contemplated by the Framers were limited to the Constitution or Bill of  Rights.   So our founding document and its Framers made clear that rights were  not enumerated by the Constitution; they were retained by the people.  Individual liberties, from personal privacy to a woman's right to vote,  the choice of contraception and abortion, interracial marriage, same- sex marriage, equal protection of the law--these liberties and, let me  emphasize, many, many, many more have always existed. In fact,  the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were silent on much of what  Americans consider fundamental to a free people. That silence left the  door open for the courts, as we shed the prejudices of a darker age, to  recognize the true meaning of the words ``all men are created equal''  and ``inalienable rights.''    The process has been painfully slow. The Constitution, like any  document composed by politicians, is fraught with original sin. For  example, the three-fifths compromise was a shameful device of political  accommodation. Through long stretches of our history, political agendas  have left many individual rights unrecognized or unprotected by the  courts. They ruled in favor of the powerful and against the  disadvantaged and the disenfranchised, often with the justification  that their rulings adhered to the text of the Constitution.   Nowhere did the Constitution expressly deny women the right to vote,  but the Supreme Court ruled against Virginia Minor in 1875. The Federal  Government was not expressly granted a right to intern residents of  Japanese descent, but the Supreme Court allowed it in Korematsu. There  was no constitutional basis on which to deny people of different  ethnicities the right to marry. On those issues and more, our judges  were wrong. Supreme Court Justices were wrong. In the service of the  economic, political, and religious powers that be, the Court has  defended slaveholders, denied the franchise, permitted racial, sexual,  and other discrimination, and routinely--routinely--elevated the power  of the State over individual liberties. Any defense of those rulings as  adhering to the text of the Constitution is just plain wrong.   Let's look more closely at women's voting rights. In Minor v.  Happersett, the Supreme Court found that women did not have the right  to vote because that right was not expressly stated anywhere in the  Constitution. In a unanimous decision, the Court took the absurd  position that a document predicated on voting, organized by voting, and  dependent on voting for any amendment, still did not protect the right  to vote for all citizens. Such is the intellectual bankruptcy of a long  legal tradition sustained by its defense of the status quo.   The 19th Amendment was a response to the abridgement of a fundamental  right by political parties and their dependent courts, but it did not  create a new right. It was a long overdue fix made necessary by an  originalist court.   If there is a national evolution that extends protection of rights  and liberties to disenfranchised and oppressed people, it is because  with time, our wonderful country tends to correct its wrongs. It did so  with a Civil War and the amendments that followed. It did so with  women's suffrage and the Brown decision. It did so more recently with  the Obergefell v. Hodges decision. Historically, our country has  gradually recognized fundamental rights and liberties.   ``Recognition''--I use that word intentionally. It is recognition  because there are no new rights, per se. They are inalienable, and  those rights are not limited to those spelled out in the Constitution.  A jurist governed by that principle would respect individual rights,  but that simply isn't the viewpoint taken by many so-called  originalists on the far right today.   The rightwing originalism looks, in my view, a lot more like the  judicial philosophy that trampled on the rights of Americans in days  past--a philosophy that throughout our history has left many Americans  marginalized, disenfranchised, and oppressed by the State.   Unfortunately, after listening very carefully to Judge Gorsuch  present his views and after reviewing his writings, including some I  will mention that specifically talk about my home State, I have no  faith that Judge Gorsuch would be any different from this philosophy  that I mentioned that has left so many Americans marginalized in our  country.   Judge Gorsuch not only has a long record of conservative activism in  the courtroom, but he has demonstrated an out-and-out hostility toward  the right of individuals to make decisions about their own lives and  their own families without interference from the State. In one  troubling instance, he went so far as to author a book attacking death  with dignity. This of course has been a matter that historically has  been left to the States, and the people of my State twice approved  death-with-dignity ballot measures and our death-with-dignity laws have  been in place for nearly 20 years. The Supreme Court upheld it more  than a decade ago in a case known as Gonzalez v. Oregon. But  [[Page S2396]]  Judge Gorsuch's record and his own words put the will of millions of  Oregonians in question.   Nothing in the Constitution gives the Federal Government the power to  deny suffering Oregonians the right to make basic choices about the end  of their lives. There is nothing in the Constitution that gives the  Federal Government a power to deny people in my State the right to make  those emotional, difficult, wrenching decisions about end of life. It  is a private matter between individuals and doctors, and when  politicians attempt to force regulations through the back door by going  after doctors and their ability to prescribe, in my view that is an  obvious over-the-line Federal infringement. But my guess is there are  probably going to be some folks on the far right that are going to try  that route again.   Nothing Judge Gorsuch said in his confirmation hearing gave me any  indication that he respects the death-with-dignity issue as settled law  or that he would rule against Federal abuse of power to intrude on a  private choice. The bottom line is that Judge Gorsuch is locked into an  extreme rightwing viewpoint on this issue.   And there is more. As I have listened to this debate and,  particularly, the number of comments that some of those who have  espoused the views that concern me so much come back to, part of this  is that they are always talking about States' rights. States' rights-- that will be the altar that we really build our views and philosophies  around. I will state, however, that when we listen to some of what they  are having to say about States' rights, what they are really saying is  that they are for the State if they think the State is right. That is  not, in my view, what fundamental rights--particularly, ones that have  been afforded to States--ought to be all about.   As I indicated, I think his views with respect to death with dignity  really do involve a Federal abuse of power in its intruding on private  choices, but there are other issues that concern me as well.   He has made it clear, in many instances, that he favors corporations  at the expense of the working people. He has sided with insurance  companies to deny disability benefits to people with disabilities, with  large companies to deny employees basic job protections, and has even  written that class action lawsuits are just tools for plaintiffs to get  ``free rides to fast riches.''   No example better illustrates this tendency--and my colleagues have  talked about it--than the case of the truckdriver in TransAm Trucking  v. Department of Labor. In this case that leaves one practically  speechless, Judge Gorsuch sided against a truckdriver who was fired for  leaving his freezing cold truck when his life was in danger.   I have another significant concern about Judge Gorsuch that came up  in the context of his confirmation hearings. It is something that, I  think, a lot of Americans and even those in government are trying to  get their arms around. I have been on the Intelligence Committee since  the days before 9/11, and one of the things we have come to feel  strongly about is the danger of what I call ``secret law.'' I want to  make sure people know exactly what I am talking about when I describe  ``secret law.''   In the intelligence world and in the national security sphere,  operations and methods--the tactics used by our courageous men and  women who are protecting us and who go into harm's way to protect our  people--always have to be secret. They are classified. They have to be  because, if they were to get out, we could have Americans die--the  people who do all of that wonderful work and, possibly, millions more.  Sources and methods have to be secret, but the law and our public  policies ought to always be transparent.   The American people need to know about them because that is how we  make informed decisions in our wonderful system of government. Voters  are given enough information to make the choices. Sources and methods  and operations have to be secret, but the law and political  philosophies have to be public.   Judge Gorsuch, as a senior attorney in the Department of Justice, was  a practitioner of secret law. As I indicated, the public is not going  to know about secret operations; we protect them. But trust in  government and in our legal system cannot survive when Americans  understand that the law says one thing and then the government or a  secret court says that it means another. Secret law prevents the people  from knowing whether their fundamental rights are being infringed by an  unaccountable, unconstrained government that is aided by compliant  courts.   Secret law also keeps the Congress in the dark. Congress's job is to  represent the people and oversee the government. Congress, barring  rebellion, is the only recourse of a free people against an executive- judicial alliance of secrecy that infringes their liberties. It is my  view that secret law makes a mockery of the oath that Members of  Congress, Justices, and each Senator here has taken to serve, protect,  and defend our Constitution. Secret law is fundamentally corrosive to  the rule of law in America.   As we learned during his confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch was a  supporter of secret law. In 2005, the CIA was conducting a secret  torture program. In May of that year, the Department of Justice's  Office of Legal Counsel determined, secretly, that torture techniques,  such as waterboarding, were legal. Somehow, it deemed them consistent  with statutory prohibitions on torture and the Constitution. This was  extraordinary, willful, faulty legal analysis. It was entirely  inconsistent with how the Congress and the public would read the law or  the Constitution.   Then our distinguished colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, who  knows a little bit about these issues in his having been subjected to  them in the defense of our country, passed the Detainee Treatment Act.  Senator McCain understood, in having fought for our country--given  fully of himself--that our government had to find a way out of this  problem. The McCain law prohibits the cruel and inhumane or degrading  treatment that has been at issue here.   By any measure, both the law--the language of the law, the clear  intent of the Congress--and the context in which it was passed would  leave every American to understand that a decision had been made by  their elected officials to limit the power of government. Yet Judge  Gorsuch, then an employee of the Bush administration's, had a solution.   In December of 2005, he wrote to the author of the Justice  Department's opinion, Mr. Bradbury, about a Presidential signing  statement that would magically transform the McCain law into an  endorsement of torture. What Judge Gorsuch wrote was that the McCain  amendment that prohibited cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment was  best read as, essentially, codifying existing interrogation policies.  In other words, according to Judge Gorsuch, John McCain's law--the one  that passed 90 to 9 in the U.S. Senate--endorsed torture when it did  just the opposite.   The issue came up in his nomination hearing. Judge Gorsuch's  explanation was that he was making the recommendation as a lawyer who  was helping his client, which was the administration. I have to say, if  there is one thing we have learned, this ``just following orders''  defense has gone on for far too long in this city. It is a small and  feeble excuse and is unbecoming of a judge who has been nominated to  the highest Court in the land. A judge who justifies government  violations in the law and the Constitution just so his boss can say ``I  was following the advice of counsel'' is making a choice to do wrong.   The McCain amendment--what we passed here in the Congress--did not  green-light torture. It did not codify torture, period. Anybody who has  ever heard John McCain talk about this issue and describe his personal,  horrifying experiences with torture knows that it, certainly, could not  have been his intent when writing the bill.   Any lawyer, especially one secretly advising the government, first  has an obligation to the law and the Constitution. Judge Gorsuch's  failure to recognize that principle and his choice to do wrong, in my  view, disqualifies him from having a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.   Torture is not the only illegal program on which Judge Gorsuch has  left his fingerprints. After news broke of the illegal, warrantless  wiretapping program, Judge Gorsuch helped prepare  [[Page S2397]]  testimony for the Attorney General, which asserted that these  authorities are vested in the President and are inherent in the office.   It added: ``They cannot be diminished or legislated away by other co- equal branches of the government.''   If that were the case, then no action taken in this area by the  elected representatives of the people would have any weight. The  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which has existed since the  1970s, would just be some kind of advisory statement. Section 702 of  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which we are going to debate  this year, would be little more than wasted paper. Then the USA FREEDOM  Act, which ended the bulk collection of law-abiding Americans' phone  records, might as well have never been signed into law.   Voting for those bills and voting to confirm Judge Gorsuch call into  question any Member's commitment to those laws that we passed.   In response to a question during his nomination hearing, Judge  Gorsuch said that he did not believe the Attorney General's testimony  and that, again, he was only acting as a scribe, as a speechwriter. As  such, he absolved himself of responsibility for his actions. Again, I  think that it is just wrong to use this as an excuse. Like the  endorsement of torture, assertions of Presidential authority to  override congressional limits on warrantless surveillance rip at the  fabric of the rule of law. Judge Gorsuch, a man who chose to get up and  go to work every day for individuals who were violating the law, had  the power to say no, but he would not make that choice.   Colleagues, the Senate is voting to confirm an individual to a  lifetime position on the Supreme Court. What Judge Gorsuch has stood  for and against over the course of his legal career is all we have to  go on in this debate, and we will have to reflect on it. A history of  support, in my view, for secret, illegal, and unconstitutional programs  is an unacceptable record for someone who is seeking a place on the  Supreme Court.   I have reminded this Senate of how, time and again, the Supreme Court  has rubber-stamped the excesses of our executive and legislature over  the years rather than defended individual liberty. That is the record-- the Supreme Court rubbing-stamping the excesses of the executive and  legislature rather than protecting the individual liberties of the  American people.   It is my view that it is our job as Senators to ensure that the  Supreme Court does not repeat the errors of yesterday--enshrining  disenfranchisement and discrimination and denying equal protection of  the law based on prejudice and political agendas. I believe that the  only way to prevent this abuse is to appoint judges who recognize that  the judiciary is a bulwark against any attempt to infringe on our  unalienable rights.   The bottom line for me, colleagues, is whether Judge Gorsuch  recognizes that rights are reserved for the people.   There is no respect for individual rights and liberty to be found in  a viewpoint that allows for secret law to justify torture, that favors  the powerful over the powerless, or that tramples on the rights of  Americans to determine the courses of their own lives. Unfortunately,  we have learned over the last few weeks that this is Judge Gorsuch's  record.   I oppose his nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.   I yield the floor.
