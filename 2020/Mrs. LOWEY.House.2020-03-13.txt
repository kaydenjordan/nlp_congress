Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6201, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act builds on  the $8.3 billion supplemental enacted last week to meet the needs of  the American people, by:   Guaranteeing free coronavirus testing;   Providing paid leave; and   Strengthening food security initiatives through additional  investments in WIC, food banks, and senior nutrition.   The bill also makes sure that children who depend on free and  reduced-price meals have access to food during school and childcare  closures.   Mr. Speaker, we must help ensure the physical safety and financial  security of our Nation's working families during this time of crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the chair of the Committee on  Ways and Means.    Mr. Speaker, the hour is late, vote ``yes,'' and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the  engrossment of the bill, H.R. 6201, the Clerk be authorized to make  technical corrections and conforming changes to the bill.
