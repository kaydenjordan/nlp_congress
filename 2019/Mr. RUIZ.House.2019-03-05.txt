 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano and his staff for all  their work on this. They have done a great job. I thank them for  fighting for this bill and for their tireless work in support of our  veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank the ranking member, Dr. Phil Roe, for his  support of veterans who have been exposed to burn pits, and a special  shout-out to my good friend Congressman Dr. Brad Wenstrup, who is the  colead on this bill. We have worked together on this and numerous  bills, and we are also leading the efforts in the bipartisan Burn Pits  Caucus to really give answers to our veterans who have been exposed.   My bill, the Burn Pit Registry Enhancement Act, will help our  government better understand the health effects of toxic burn pits on  our men and women in uniform.   As a nation, we have a responsibility to provide our veterans with  the benefits that they have earned and deserve and to keep them safe to  the best of our ability when they are in the field.   We bear that responsibility even more heavily when the actions of our  own government--in this case, its use of toxic burn pits--are causing  veterans to develop severe pulmonary illnesses, cancers, autoimmune  diseases, and chronic conditions that are making young, otherwise very  healthy veterans, extremely ill, permanently oxygen-dependent, and  totally disabled--and, in some cases, leading to their death.   This is what happened to Jennifer Kepner, a constituent of mine, a  mother of two young children, and a veteran of the United States Air  Force. Despite being only 39 years of age, living an active lifestyle,  very healthy, not having any other risk factors, Jennifer developed a  very aggressive pancreatic cancer that ultimately took her life.                                time  1645    Jennifer's oncologist conducted an extensive genetic and  environmental risk assessment and found that the only probable and most  probable cause of her cancer was her exposure to burn pits. These are  acres, sometimes 10 acres big, of open burn pits where they burn  everything and anything, like that garbage open burn pit with jet fuel,  that exposes our servicemembers to hundreds of toxic chemicals and  carcinogens, with huge clouds of black smoke that traverse long  distances.   So while Jennifer was fighting bravely against her cancer, she also  had to fight tooth and nail to get the healthcare and benefits that she  had earned. Even then, the VA did not recognize her cancer's connection  to burn pit exposures.   I was there in her final days, and she wanted us to do something. She  called it our generation's Agent Orange. She wanted us to do something  to prevent this and to help other veterans.   There is a principle I use as a doctor and a public health expert,  and that is, when there is a high enough suspicion of an agent that can  cause a severe enough health consequence, then we have to act on that  suspicion. In this case, we do have enough suspicion, given the  information that is out there, that burn pits are essentially toxic and  causing health problems and even death, so it is definitely severe  enough.   We need to do something. There are four prongs that we need to  pursue, four pillars of a framework.   One is stop the use of burn pits.   Two is outreach to veterans and providers to educate them about their  risks.   Three is to make sure that we take care of our veterans by providing  healthcare and some of the benefits that they have earned.   Also, do more research so that we can fully understand the full  health effects of being exposed to these burn pits.   This bill and the burn pit registry will help with two of those  prongs. One is that it is a vehicle for the VA, DOD, and our government  to communicate with veterans who have been exposed to burn pits, and  their family members, about any recent health topics, research, or  policy change that they may be interested in.   It also helps them grab samples of veterans for future research so  that we can better understand with more robust scientific research the  full effects of burn pits in their lives, which could lead to a better  understanding, better healthcare, better outreach, and more benefits  for our permanently disabled veterans.   It is very important that veterans who have been exposed to burn pits  register in the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry and build  this communication vehicle with the VA, our government, and those of us  who are strong advocates for our veterans.   My bill will allow an entry with the cause of death in the Airborne  Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry after a veteran passes away. For  example, right now, if a veteran passes away, there is no way to update  this burn pit registry with their cause of death. This allows a spouse  or a designee to enter that cause of death.    Mr. Speaker, those causes of death could be brain cancer,  esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, autoimmune diseases, lymphomas,  leukemias, constricted bronchiolitis, COPD, and others.   Mr. Speaker, I urge each Member of this Chamber to support this  bipartisan bill, which will help our Nation uphold its commitment to  serving our veterans. Together, we are taking a crucial first step  toward honoring Jennifer Kepner and improving and saving  [[Page H2334]]  the lives of countless veterans. I thank the chairman for his support.
