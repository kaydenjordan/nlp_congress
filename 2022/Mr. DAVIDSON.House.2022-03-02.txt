 Madam Speaker, I have requested this time to address  part of the State of the Union that was not addressed last night. In  fact, we saw that the President was so bold as to say that the border  is secure and tout the fact that they have caught 2 million people at  the border, as if that is success. That is what was said.   What wasn't said is what has been going on at the border for a long  time and has been made worse by the policies that Joe Biden and his  administration have put in place. Frankly, by the United States laws  that he and his administration have ignored, and that Secretary  Mayorkas enables every day that he leads the Department of Homeland  Security down the wrong path for our country.   So, we are here to talk about, stop the cartels. We are introducing a  bill called the Stop the Cartels Act. We spend so much time on the  sympathetic cause of immigration and we conflate border security with  immigration.   We can have an incredibly secure border regardless of our immigration  policy, and border security is, in fact, national security. The cartels  pose a serious threat to the United States of America. The products  that they push in our communities have killed over 100,000 people.                                time  1915    This past year, the leading cause of death for 18 to 45 year olds is  fatal overdoses. The drugs are bad, but now they are poisoned with  fentanyl, and we are not taking the threat seriously. So the first  portion of the Stop the Cartels Act will focus on gathering  intelligence.   As we look at the country of Mexico, our southern neighbor, it  controls the whole land portion of our southern border. That border is  controlled by the cartels. I had Brandon Judd, the president of the  Customs and Border Patrol Union, at a hearing that we had to have  offsite because Speaker Pelosi won't have the hearing on the topic in  any of our hearing rooms. She won't let the committees of jurisdiction  deal with it, so Republicans are forced to go offsite to talk about  this important topic.   When I asked him: Who controls the border? You or the cartels? Do the  cartels control the border more than you?   He said: You are not putting words in my mouth. That is the exact  point. The cartels control the border. We don't control the border.   I said: Why don't you control the border?   He said: Because of policies.   Do you need more resources?   That is a different topic. What we need is good policy. We had  policies  [[Page H1271]]  that were working to control the border, and now we have policies that  are not working.   The Border Patrol controls it. We are not even on defense, we are not  even on the field, and we are not even in the stadium because the  policies of this administration changed so that it gave complete  control of our southern border to the cartels.   Now, we could talk about all the corruption and the problems that the  cartels are causing for Mexico. That is a problem that Mexico has to  deal with, and we should be able to help them once we prioritize  intelligence collection on the cartels on par with the other threats to  our country, on par with China, with Russia, with Iran, with North  Korea, with al-Qaida, with ISIS, and with the known credible threats to  our country.   The cartels should have the same level of intelligence priority as  those other hostile or potentially hostile countries. And the cartels  are clearly hostile. They do a lot of business here--billions and  billions of dollars.   So we have highlighted this map. These are the areas that we already  know which cartels control. You have the states of Mexico listed, but  you also have color coded which cartels control that. We would like to  have the granular detail of what is the org chart, who leads the  cartels. I am not saying we don't have that, but we do not have it at  the right priority. And then when we do have the intelligence--just as  we have seen, the intelligence community got Ukraine incredibly right.  The problem wasn't that we didn't have good intelligence with respect  to Russia, the problem was the administration didn't do the right thing  with the intelligence. But let's first get the right intelligence on  the cartels.   So the next thing is we have cities, States, and counties that are  completely ignoring the United States law. It is a Federal policy to  decide who is a citizen and who is not a citizen. And when we go to  enforce our laws as to who is here legally versus who is here  illegally, that is clearly Federal jurisdiction.   We have cities, States, counties, and other communities that are  ignoring these laws--sanctuary cities. And those sanctuary cities are  saying: Not only would this be a great place to base your illicit  activity, cartels, we will protect you by being a sanctuary. Please  come locate your illicit activity here. Bring your drugs, bring your  guns, bring your labor trafficking, your sex trafficking, your human  trafficking, and bring your money laundering business and every form of  corruption into our communities. That is what these first two maps  show.   But let me show you next what the impact on our communities is, Madam  Speaker.   This young lady to my right is Lizzie Murphy. She died at 21 years  old. Drugs are bad, but now they are poisoned with fentanyl. Seeing  that it is not a good idea to take it without a prescription or a  specific use--a lot of people refer to it as a safe party drug--it is a  bad decision. But it is not supposed to kill you. But when it is laced  with fentanyl, that is what is happening to our young people. That is  how fentanyl killed over 60,000 Americans last year. Not all of it is  in the heroin. Not all of it is in the really hard stuff. Some of it is  in the stuff that people never suspect is going to kill them. They take  one pill, and they are dead.   That is what happened to my friends, Mark and Kristi Murphy when  their little girl took one Xanax. Their daughter--she is sitting here  hugging her sister, close friends, best friends--doesn't have her  sister anymore.   This is wrecking our communities, and we have got communities  inviting this in by being sanctuary cities.   We have got a President of the United States who is not just doing  nothing, he is doing worse than nothing. He is making it worse by  empowering the cartels. They exploit people, and they cause harm to our  communities.   To highlight the ways this is happening and the ways to solve it, I  have asked some of my colleagues to join me in this Special Order.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Madam Speaker, look, if we look over on the far right,  how does a young lady lose her sister? How does a young lady, 21 years  old, in Ohio wind up dead from fentanyl poisoning, poison in the drugs?   They know drugs are bad, but they are not supposed to kill them. They  are in Ohio. Ohio is not--I mean, we do have a border. It is on Lake  Erie with Canada. That is not the border that is causing our young  people to die. That is not the one that is causing the leading cause of  death for 18- to 45-year-olds to be fatal overdoses.   It is all the way down here on the southern border. And it is not  officially the Mexican Government. It is the cartels. And we refuse to  collect the intelligence at the right level.   At our southern border, we have a joint task force. We don't have a  joint interagency task force. We have that out in the Pacific Ocean. We  have that in the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean. But we don't have a  joint interagency task force.   The place probably that it makes the absolute most sense to have an  interagency task force is at the southern border. We have Customs and  Border Protection. We have people that are focused on smuggling of  people, smuggling of drugs, of guns. We have people that are focused on  counterfeit property.   We are focused on levying taxes at the border, inspecting fruit at  the border, and everything else. But we don't have an interagency task  force that uses the power of our military to conduct surveillance, that  uses the power of our Director of National Intelligence and all the  resources that we have to know everything about the cartels, not some  benign name like Sinaloa, but, specifically, who leads that.   We know who leads Russia. We know it is Vladimir Putin. They are a  nation-state.   But we have these transnational criminal organizations that go  unnamed. Again, they are involved in the activities not because they  care so much about the activity itself. They want the money.   We don't have an organized way to collect all the intelligence on the  money. What yachts are they buying? What properties do they own? How do  they move this heavily cash business into other goods and services?   They move everything that can store value possible all over the world  to try to clean up this money. We don't have the kind of pressure that  was just brought to bear on Vladimir Putin going against the cartels.   Vladimir Putin we finally recognized as evil as he invaded Ukraine.  But when he was doing the menacing, threatening activity, when we had  at least gone so far as to collect the intelligence, we didn't take the  actions that could have stopped him.   Here, we can't even go so far as to collect the right level of  intelligence. Intelligence is the first thing.   The next slide I have deals with the sanctuary cities. We are going  to defund the sanctuary cities. They can't keep getting funded. They  have to conform to U.S. law.   We just had a Supreme Court ruling that said if you want to get paid  for providing Medicare and Medicaid services, you have to make your  employees conform. We can do that to American citizens, and we can't do  that to deal with the cartels.   Now, it is a different topic, I will grant you, but it is the same  thing, the strings attached to the money. We  [[Page H1273]]  have to put the strings attached to the money to say, if you want the  money that is collected here in the city, you have to reflect the laws  of the United States of America, and you can't offer sanctuary to these  cartels that are killing our young people.   There is more to the bill, but let me highlight in another way the  consequences of not stopping the cartels.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Budd).    Madam Speaker, this is a gravely serious matter. I  highlighted a young lady, Lizzie Murphy; her sister, Catherine; her mom  and dad, Mark and Kristi Murphy, who lost their daughter, their best  friend, their sister.   Communities like this are losing young people all over our country. I  kind of wish I could say that it was only happening where the sanctuary  cities are pictured. I kind of wish I could say it was only right next  to the border that we have the problem.   But our whole country is experiencing the problem because we won't  secure the border. This administration won't secure the border. They  won't listen to the men and women whose duty it is to secure the  border.   I went down there a week after Joe Biden was inaugurated and they  said: We told him. We will see what happens. They said they are going  to do these things, and we told them this is what is going to happen.   Now, when we go to the border, when they come and talk to us up here,  the exact same things they knew were going to happen are happening.   We stopped sanctuary cities. We put strings attached to the grants.  But the other thing is we have this Flores settlement. Congress has not  provided clarity on the Flores settlement, so we provide funding so  that we can hold people as long as they need to be held till their  cases are adjudicated on the Mexican side of the border.   We put pressure on the Government of Mexico to cooperate with us in  this, and we put pressure on the Government of Mexico to resume their  cooperation on intelligence-gathering.   Just yesterday, ahead of the State of the Union, I have my county  sheriffs--Butler County Sheriff Jones was here in Washington, D.C. Why?  Not because he is a border sheriff in the strict geographical sense,  but because he is a border sheriff there in Ohio.   Let me close, Madam Speaker, by just highlighting that what happened  to this family could happen to anybody. I appreciate the time to speak  tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
