 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 18 years ago today, on a cloudless  Tuesday morning, my city, our country, our world changed forever. In  the span of a few hours, the Twin Towers fell, the Pentagon was hit,  and smoke rose from an empty field in Pennsylvania. More than 3,000  souls were taken from us that day.   I knew some of them: a guy I played basketball with in high school, a  businessman who helped me on my way up, a firefighter I did blood  drives with. It was one of the bloodiest days on American soil since  the Civil War.   Each year, we pause to remember that awful day. We mourn those we  lost, but we also recognize, in the aftermath of September 11, the  resiliency of the American people. The resiliency of New Yorkers shone  through one of the darkest hours in our country.   Looking back remains difficult even after 18 years. I ride my bike  through the city of New York and every fifth or sixth street is named  after a firefighter or a police officer who died, as are parts of  Brooklyn, Bay Ridge, and places like that. I will never forget. I think  of it all the time.   The day after, when President Bush sent Senator Clinton and me to go  up to New York in planes, we were the only planes in the sky. We were  in an airliner that had us surrounded by F-18s and F-16s. When we  landed, we went down to the site. The smell of death and burnt flesh  was in the air. This I will never forget, a thousand people lined up-- no one knew who had lived and who had died--with little signs: Have you  seen my mother, Mary? Have you seen my son, Bill?   That stays with me.   I remember the generosity of New Yorkers. A man who owned a shoe  store just north of the Towers gave out free shoes to everybody who was  fleeing. Many of them had lost their shoes in the long trek down the  stairs.   I remember the valor of the first responders who rushed to the  Towers. I remember a firefighter from Staten Island, based in Brooklyn,  who went to his firehouse, put his full gear on, and ran through the  tunnel with about 60, 70 pounds of gear on. It was his day off, but he  knew he was called. He went up the stairs of the World Trade Center and  was crushed when the Twin Towers collapsed. So there is a lot.   Another way I think of this every day, as I am sure you have noticed,  is that I always wear this flag on my lapel. I called on Americans to  wear the flag the day after my having witnessed the site, and I have  worn this flag every day since. Every time I look at it, I think of  those who were lost, and I think of the valor of New Yorkers and of the  American people.   For the first responders, this 9/11 carries additional significance.  A few months ago, some of the heroes that day were here in Washington  to celebrate the permanent reauthorization of the Victim Compensation  Fund. I thank the first responders who came to Washington and helped to  secure this funding, especially those who are no longer with us--James  Zadroga, Luis Alvarez, my friend Ray Pfeifer. Wherever they are, I hope  they are looking down with the knowledge that their brothers and  sisters are being taken care of.   God bless those good heroes. May God continue to bless this resilient  Nation.   Later this morning, I will return to the floor with the Republican  leader and my colleagues as we will respect a moment of silence in  memory of September 11.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a different subject, I return this  morning to the topic of appropriations.   We have until the end of this work period to figure out a way to  continue government funding, and there is good talk of a short-term  continuing resolution so the government doesn't run out of money on  September 30. Yet the larger question is how this Chamber is going to  proceed or not proceed with the 12 appropriations bills that fund our  government.   Despite many disagreements between the majority and minority in this  Chamber, the Senate has been able to produce several bipartisan budget  deals even in the Trump era. The reason we have been able to do this is  that both parties have been committed to working together throughout  each stage of the appropriations process. Bipartisanship-- appropriations can only work with it and will not work without it.   Earlier this summer, the Democrats and the Republicans negotiated the  broad outlines of a budget deal in good faith. We allocated the 302(a)s  and came up with a side agreement. After that, the very first step in  the appropriations process is to agree, in a bipartisan way, with the  allocations for the 12 subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee.  That is what we did in 2018, and I believe it passed the committee  unanimously--or maybe with one dissenting vote. It was passed  unanimously on a bipartisan basis. The Appropriations Committee passed  those 302(b) allocations 31 to 0. That is how we thought it was going  to work now, but already we are running into trouble with those  allocations this time around.   The Republican majority on the Appropriations Committee has  unilaterally proposed putting in an additional $12 billion for the  President's border wall, taking away $5 billion of funding for Health  and Human Services--desperately needed programs like healthcare and  fighting opioid addiction and cancer research--and putting it into the  wall. This is without our OK, without our acknowledgment, and without  our acceptance. The Republican majority also reprogrammed funding from  other sources and backfilled money the President proposes to pilfer for  military construction, which has affected, I believe, 30 States.   My Republican colleagues and my friend the Republican leader know  very well this will not fly with Senate Democrats. We are not going to  vote for a budget that is partisan and is attempting to be jammed down  our throats. It puts an additional $12 billion into the wall? Forget  that. So here  [[Page S5416]]  we are already--at step No. 1 in the appropriations process--and the  spirit of bipartisanship that is necessary for this work might be  melting away.   I just warn my Republican colleagues that this is not a way to  produce a budget. This is the same path they tried to go down last  year. They shut down the government and then had to walk it back. We  all know what a partisan process looks like. President Trump caused the  longest government shutdown in American history by demanding funding  for a border wall and then by shutting down the government when  Congress didn't give it to him. Let's not go down that exact path again  9 months later.   There is still time to get the process back on track. The Republican  majority should sit down with the Democrats on the committee and, in  good faith, come up with the 302(b) allocations and come up with the  order by which we bring bills to the floor. Then we can get this done.  We don't have to go back to a CR. Certainly, our side wants to avoid a  Republican shutdown, and we hope our Republican colleagues will have  the good sense not to let President Trump lead them into that cul-de- sac once again. So let's sit down and make this work. That is what we  want to do, not unilaterally declare something and say, ``Take it or  leave it,'' but work together so both sides have to give.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on gun safety, in response to the  scenes of senseless violence in America throughout the month of August,  Leader McConnell promised that the issue of gun safety would be ``front  and center'' when Congress returned. The Democrats are eager to debate  this issue, and we believe we have a great place to start--with the  bipartisan, House-passed bill on universal background checks.   Leader McConnell has also suggested that President Trump will  determine if and what the Senate will vote on, so we need to know what  the President might support. Throughout the month of August, frankly,  the President was all over the map, saying he wanted strong background  check legislation one day and then saying, the next day, we don't need  it at all. It makes no sense. The President doesn't seem to know what  he wants.   My Republican colleagues met with the President yesterday and  ostensibly discussed the issue of gun safety. I asked them: Where is  the President on this issue? Will he support universal background  checks?   We are eager to move forward with this debate. We want to vote on the  H.R. 8 bill--a simple bill of universal background checks. It does not  impede on the rights of any legitimate gun owner. It only gets in the  way of felons and spousal abusers and those adjudicated mentally ill  from getting guns, and no one thinks they should get them.   The President needs to make his position clear and soon. If he  continues to refuse to state his position or if he keeps flipping  around, the Senate should proceed to debate this on its own. In any  case, you can be sure the Democrats will not let the issue of gun  safety fall by the wayside.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I join the leader. Eighteen years ago, on  a cloudless Tuesday morning, my city, our country, and our world  changed forever. In the span of a few hours, the Twin Towers fell, the  Pentagon was hit, and smoke rose from an empty field in Pennsylvania.   More than 3,000 souls were taken from us that day. I knew some of  them: a guy I played basketball with in high school, a businessman who  helped me on the way up, and a firefighter whom I went around the city  doing blood drives with. It was one of the bloodiest days on American  soil since the Civil War.   Each year we correctly and appropriately pause to remember that awful  day. We mourn those whom we lost and think of them. The day after 9/11,  I called for every American to wear the flag. I wear this flag every  day. I have worn it every day since then in memory of them.   We also remember our resiliency and the resiliency of New Yorkers,  the brave firefighters, police officers, and  [[Page S5419]]  ordinary citizens who rushed to the Towers.   The generosity--I will never forget a man who had a shoe store about  two blocks north of the Towers who just gave shoes to all the people.  Some men and women who had to run 90 flight of stairs left their shoes  behind.   I remember the next day, when President Bush sent us back up to New  York, and the empty skies, a bunch of F-16s around our plane going down  there, smelling the smell of burnt flesh and death in the air, and  seeing over 1,000 people lined up with little signs, because we didn't  know who was gone and who might be found: Have you seen my sister Mary?  Have you seen my son Bob?   It was an awful day and a day we live with, but we know our  resilience. Many predicted that Lower Manhattan would be a ghost town  forevermore. It has more people, more jobs, and more business than  before 9/11. Many thought that America would succumb to the evil  brutality of the terrorists. We have fought back very successfully.   We think, finally, of those who are dying now as a result of their  rushing to the Towers into the hours and days after, and we are also  grateful that this body has now fully funded both the health fund and  the fund to see that the families are taken care of.   It is an amazing moment. I live with it all the time. I ride my bike  around the city, and every seventh or eighth block has the name of a  street commemorating someone who died--firefighter this and police  officer that.   But America, New York, and all of us have not been beaten by the  terrorists and have not been beaten by adversity. On this issue, we  have come together, and we will prevail.   I ask unanimous consent that there be a minute of silence in memory  of those who were lost both that day and who are still being lost  because of their heroism a few days after.    Moment of Silence in Remembrance of the Lives Lost in the Attacks of                             September 11, 2001     Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
