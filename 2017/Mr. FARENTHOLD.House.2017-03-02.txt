 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague from Texas  seeking to make this better, but I am going to have to oppose this  amendment. It is confusing, unnecessary, and  [[Page H1476]]  overly restrictive on agencies. This amendment would create a single  definition of three different words: propaganda, publicity, and  advocacy. Those are different words. Under this amendment, publicity,  advocacy, and propaganda would mean making a statement not widely  accepted by the scientific community. Are we going to create a test of  two out of three dentists agree? It is going to be difficult to do. I  mean, it could be anything. Is it propaganda for me to say I love my  wife? I only know a couple of scientists, there is not going to be a  broad, general consensus in the scientific community about that, but it  is certainly not propaganda. It is a statement of my feeling.   Publicity and propaganda and advocacy are different words. They don't  mean the same thing, and they certainly don't have the definition my  friend from Texas is suggesting. Check out the dictionary. You can do  it on your smartphone. These definitions that are proposed in this  amendment are unworkable. I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I come back to the purpose of this  bill: we want our regulatory agencies to be neutral. They propose a  rule, they have done the research, and they have done the science. They  wouldn't be proposing it if they didn't believe that it needed to be  done. Where they crossed the line is using taxpayer money to go out and  promote and advocate for it. The idea behind public comments, the whole  thought behind public input is to get a diversity of ideas, but, if the  solicitations seeking that comment are biased, or if the agency is  advocating it, it potentially suppresses the other side. We want to get  both sides of the matter.   Let's look at the actual definition of propaganda. I googled it while  Ms. Jackson Lee was just speaking. Propaganda is information,  especially of a biased or misleading nature used to promote a  particular cause or point of view. Advocacy is another one that has a  definition. It is public statements for or a recommendation of a  particular cause or policy. So those definitions basically say you are  pushing a point of view. We don't want to limit those.   The definition and the purpose behind this legislation is to make our  agencies fair about seeking comment and fair about listening to those  comments. We don't want the agencies going into this with preconceived  notions and advocating it. We want the public comment to work the way  the public comment is supposed to work. The scientific community,  whether they are for it or against it, can weigh in in those public  comments, and the public and the agency will know what their consensus  is based on the fair comments fairly solicited. So again, I urge  opposition to this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, the purpose of the  underlying legislation here is to make sure we have a fair process and  the Federal Government isn't pushing a point of view, it is listening  to all sides. This amendment takes that away. For that reason, I urge  opposition.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer), I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this is a simple transparency measure  that adds a disclosure requirement under the underlying bill.  Understanding which regulations are duplicative or overlapping allows  the public to be better informed as they participate in the rulemaking  process. We want to know what is going on as members of the public. Too  many times agencies develop regulations without consideration or  coordination with other Federal agencies, State and local governments,  or, in some cases, even the public. They issue proposed rules that are  unnecessary, duplicative, or overcomplicated.   This simple amendment helps draw the public's attention to potential  areas of concern while the rule is still in the proposed phase of  rulemaking. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I think my colleague across the aisle  actually makes the case for me. The executive branch already requires  that this work be done by the agencies.   Leaving behind the constitutional authority of this body to direct  that happen in the nature of executive orders that can be changed by  the next executive, this actually codifies a good part of the executive  order that is already in place, so the agencies wouldn't have to do any  work.   What this does add, however, to that executive order and why it is so  important is it adds a transparency requirement. An agency is required  to look to see what regulations are out there that may be duplicative  under the executive order. This requires them to tell us about it. Why  would they want to hide from the American people that they are creating  a duplicative regulation?   This is a simple transparency amendment that improves the quality of  the underlying bill, improves the amount of information accessible to  the public, and holds executive branch agencies accountable to make  sure they are not putting unnecessary and duplicative burdens on the  American people.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we are simply codifying an executive  order here, as the gentleman pointed out, but we are adding one more  thing. We are adding transparency to it so the American people know  what these alphabet soups of government agencies are up to and give us,  as watchdogs in Congress, or private organizations or a member of the  public with internet access the ability to see how the CFR is expanding  and expanding with more and more duplicative Federal rules.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is unnecessary and  confusing. As I am sure my colleague from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee)  knows, the Constitution is the supreme law of the land.   The First Amendment applies to everybody in this country. We couldn't  write a law that infringes upon the First Amendment and have it  withstand scrutiny by the Supreme Court or under the Constitution, and  I certainly wouldn't support a law that did this.   The underlying legislation is designed to stop public agencies from  using your taxpayer dollars and my taxpayer dollars for promoting one  side of an issue. It is not designed to chill any Federal employees of  First Amendment rights.   In fact, the Supreme Court, in 1994, in Waters v. Churchill, held  that public employees do have a right to free speech. We are not going  to be leaning over people's necks seeing what they are putting on their  personal Twitter accounts, but we are going to say that, if you are a  government agency spending taxpayer dollars to promote a point of view  on something before your agency, that is a no-no. That is what this  underlying legislation does.   Ms. Jackson Lee's amendment is simply unnecessary because we can't  suppress the First Amendment rights even if we want to. And we do not-- I say do not--ever want to violate the Constitution and interfere with  people's First Amendment rights. And, listen, I agree with the  underlying intent of my colleague's amendment. Simply, we can't do it.   Unfortunately, this amendment is not only unnecessary, it could be  harmful. If we say First Amendment protections apply in this law, are  we going to have to go out and in every law we pass, put in something  that says the First Amendment applies? Come on. We already know the  First Amendment applies because the Constitution is the supreme law of  the land.   So it creates unnecessary confusion that could ultimately harm  people's  [[Page H1479]]  First Amendment rights. Can you see the lawsuits? Well, Congress didn't  say in there it protected my First Amendment right. So we would have to  go and rewrite every law on the books.   The Constitution is there and it works. It is an unnecessary  amendment. So I hope my clarification that the First Amendment applies  assuages the concerns of the gentlewoman from Texas and she withdraws  the amendment. If she doesn't, however, I am going to have to oppose it  as unnecessary and potentially confusing to the entire body of law of  this country.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    I would just like to point out that Commissioner  Pai's release of that information would not be prohibited under this  bill. It is not advocacy. It is releasing facts. So it would not be  prohibited.   Again, the First Amendment already applies to every law that we make  in this body and every law we have made. The Constitution trumps what  we do here.   So, with that, I continue to argue that this amendment is unnecessary  and potentially confusing, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think the utmost clarity is in the First  Amendment. I am going to read it here.   ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of  speech, or of the press, or the right of the people to peaceably  assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.''                                time  1015    That applies to everything we do, every law we make. This amendment  is unnecessary, and I urge opposition.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, at the risk of sounding repetitious, the  First Amendment applies to all we do in this body. This amendment is  unnecessary.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order against the  motion.    Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my point of order.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.     Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my point of order.  Mr.  Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.  Mr. Speaker, as a great supporter of transparency,  this bill is designed to promote transparency in executive branch  agencies.   Unfortunately, I think the motion to recommit would actually be  violative of the Constitution. The President and the executive branch  agencies we are seeking to regulate under this law are creations of  Congress administered by the executive branch.   The Presidency is created by the Constitution, and it is my belief  that it would be unconstitutional to pass this motion to recommit. For  that reason alone, I urge my colleagues to oppose it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
