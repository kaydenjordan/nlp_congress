 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Black for her work  on this subject.   I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 43, a joint resolution to  stop an Obama administration rule that will force States to send  taxpayer dollars to abortion providers, including abortion giant  Planned Parenthood.   In addition to last year's shocking videos where we heard high- ranking Planned Parenthood officials use jarring language such as doing  a less crunchy type of procedure to preserve body parts, we have  recently learned in Pennsylvania that Planned Parenthood was using  false advertising on its websites.   The Pennsylvania Family Institute recently found that each Planned  Parenthood affiliate in Pennsylvania does not provide prenatal  services, even though all 27 Planned Parenthood locations in  Pennsylvania had listed ``prenatal'' as a service on their website.   After these clinics were called and asked, Do you provide prenatal  services, not one had any such services to offer, but they did offer  terminations. Planned Parenthood has since removed  [[Page H1274]]  the word ``prenatal'' from their booking appointments website.   They should not be receiving one dime of Federal dollars when they  are actively attempting to deceive women to get them in the door.  Abortion is not health care. Subsidizing the destruction of human life  with Federal dollars in the name of family planning is simply  unconscionable.   I urge my colleagues to join me in defending the lives of the unborn  and support this important joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the progress  hardworking western Pennsylvanians have made in restoring our hillsides  and streams in historic mining communities polluted by waste coal.   Through the use of innovative technology, workers in the coal refuse- to-  [[Page H1283]]  energy industry have brought about an incredible transformation of  formerly polluted areas, restoring landscapes to their original natural  beauty.   It is a success story all around, both environmentally and  economically. Unfortunately, one-size-fits-all Washington regulations  threaten to stop this success story in its tracks and to destroy the  family-sustaining jobs the coal refuse-to-energy industry supports.   That is why, for the third time, I am reintroducing the Satisfying  Energy Needs and Saving the Environment, or SENSE Act, in the 115th  Congress as H.R. 1119.   My legislation ensures that regulations are tailored to allow a very  specific and small subset of power plants to continue their remediation  efforts and restore western Pennsylvania's natural beauty, as well as  landscapes in historic mining communities across the country.   This legislation passed the House with bipartisan support last year,  and I urge my colleagues to support it once again so that the vital and  successful work of providing electricity while cleaning up the  environment can continue.                            ____________________
