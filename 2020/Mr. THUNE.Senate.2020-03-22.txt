 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I begin, we just learned that our  colleague Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for the coronavirus.  Our thoughts and prayers are with him for a speedy recovery. We will  consult with the attending physician at the Capitol about appropriate  measures for those of us who have been in contact with the Senator.   This is the kind of situation that Americans across the country are  dealing with right now, and it underscores the importance of acting  immediately to deliver more relief for the American people.   The Senate has been working around the clock over the past few days  to put together a third round of coronavirus legislation. We are very  close to moving forward with a major bill that will deliver much needed  relief to American families, workers, and businesses and put more  resources into the hands of medical professionals.   This is a big bill, but this situation requires a big and bold  response. Across our country, American workers and American businesses  are struggling. Families are scared. Businesses have been forced to  drastically curtail  [[Page S1895]]  or close their operations, and social distancing has become a public  health priority.   Workers are wondering how long they will be getting a paycheck. Small  businesses are worrying about whether they will be able to reopen their  doors when all of this is over. Key industries have taken a massive  economic hit. A major response is required.   The package we put together addresses a number of priorities: putting  emergency cash into the hands of American families and American workers  quickly, in a way that ensures those most in need get the maximum level  of support; delivering relief to small businesses to help them keep  their workers employed; injecting stability into the economy to help  bridge this crisis and to limit layoffs; providing new resources for  State unemployment programs to help workers displaced by this  emergency; and most importantly--most importantly--continuing to  deliver resources to the healthcare workers fighting to stop this  pandemic.   This package is the product of bipartisan input, and I hope it will  receive overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate. Republicans and  Democrats have already come together to deliver two coronavirus relief  bills. It is time for us to come together again to deliver this  legislation.   As the leader said yesterday, the American people need help, and they  need it now. This bill will provide them with relief.   These are challenging times. There is a lot of stress and  uncertainty, and Americans are understandably worried. We are going to  get through this. There may be difficult days ahead, but we are going  to come out the other side.   All around this country, Americans are standing up to meet this  challenge. We have our heroic healthcare workers who are putting their  lives on the line to care for the seriously ill, our first responders  who got their name because they are always the first on the scene in  any crisis, and new heroes: grocery store employees, truck drivers,  delivery people, pharmacy employees--people we may have taken for  granted before but won't again.   Everywhere I look in my State, I see South Dakotans helping other  South Dakotans. It is the same all across this country: people looking  out for their neighbors, providing meals for those in need, offering  childcare help to those who can't telework, running errands for  elderly, or those with compromised immune systems who can't leave their  house.   I was touched to read a story from the Rapid City Journal yesterday  about a group of young people from Eagle Butte, SD, who showed up  outside the Medicine Wheel Village Nursing Home to hold up signs to  encourage the residents who can't receive visitors right now because of  the risk of virus transmission.   We are going to get through this together. My colleagues and I in the  Senate are going to keep working to deliver the resources that  Americans need to confront and defeat this disease.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Colorado (Mr. Gardner), the Senator from Utah (Mr. Lee), the  Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul), the Senator from Utah (Mr. Romney),  and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Scott).    Mr. President, we don't have the luxury of time here, and  I think we all know that. Certainly, the American people know it. They  can see it sort of just unfolding right in front of them.   We have small businesses that are shutting down, which, of course,  affects the people who work there. We have healthcare systems that have  tremendous needs, and obviously they are on the frontlines of fighting  the coronavirus.   We continue to try to make progress on a piece of legislation that  really should have been proceeded to today. The vote we had earlier  today was a procedural vote. It was, basically, are we going to get on  the bill. And what you saw was the Democrats object to even getting on  the bill.   Now, obviously, as the leader pointed out, once you are on the bill,  you have 30 hours, if you choose to use it, in which to continue to  discuss and debate. And if there are things that they are continuing to  work on, certainly, they can have the opportunity to do that.   But the vote today, which you saw the Democrats oppose, was simply  whether or not we were going to get on the bill--a bill that is  desperately needed by our country right now, and I would argue that the  American people are looking to us for action. And, frankly, as I said,  we just don't have the luxury of time.   The Democratic leader got up earlier and said that this is a partisan  bill. That is just false. That is just flatly untrue.   This has been negotiated for the past few days now between Democrats  and Republicans. Leader McConnell appointed several task forces, and  the Democratic leader appointed representatives from his side to serve  on those task forces. They have been negotiating elements of this bill  now for the past few days. Frankly, what you see, the legislation in  front of us, reflects that work.   There is a tremendous amount of bipartisan content in this bill. The  Democrats had ample opportunity to make their case and to try to get  things included that they said they wanted.   Just to sort of highlight, again, what the Democrats said their  priorities were in this legislation--phase 3, if you will--it was about  workers. It was about small businesses. It was about unemployment  insurance. They call it unemployment insurance on steroids. It was  about hospitals. I have to say that I see in this piece of legislation  all of that. What they just voted to even debate includes all of those  elements.   In fact, if you look at what this bill includes, if you are talking  about providing help to families and people who really need it in this  country immediately--$1,200 checks to individual taxpayers, $2,400 to a  couple who file jointly, and that runs through income levels all the  way up. If you are a single taxpayer, $75,000. It phases out at about  $99,000 for couples filing jointly and $150,000--it phases out after  that. And then $500 for each child in this country.   That was something that was a priority for both sides. Democrats  wanted to have that in this legislation, and there were many  Republicans who did as well. The President said it was something that  he supported. So that was a bipartisan priority that ended up in this  legislation and will bring immediate relief and get dollars back in the  hands of American families to enable them to deal with their daily  needs and, as best they can, with the crisis that we have unfolding in  front of us.   Then you had, of course, a priority--a huge priority--for the  Democrats, which was the so-called UI on steroids, the unemployment  insurance program. I have to say that my colleague from Ohio, Senator  Portman, did a terrific job of laying out all the elements of this  legislation, but, as he mentioned, unemployment insurance was a big  priority for the Democrats.   Well, there is a big commitment to plussing up, topping off, the  unemployment accounts that the States maintain--$600 per week for 3  months into  [[Page S1908]]  those unemployment accounts. So if you are unemployed in this country  and you go down to the unemployment office in your State, what you  would normally receive in terms of a benefit would be increased by $600  per week, per person, for 3 months.   That was a huge priority for the Democrats and one that Republicans,  as well, believed was important. So we have not only the checks going  out immediately that will benefit families, but we also have now an  unemployment insurance program delivered through the States that will  provide assistance to those who have lost jobs.   Then, of course, we had another priority that the Democrats  mentioned, which was that they wanted to provide assistance--much  needed assistance--to small businesses. If you look at what is in this  bill for small businesses, there is basically a loan program operated  under the Small Business Administration in which participating lenders,  which could include commercial banks, community banks, and credit  unions, as mentioned earlier, where small businesses could go to get  loans--100 percent guaranteed--which, if used to pay payroll, if used  to keep their employees employed over this period, would be forgiven at  the end, to the total tune of about $350 billion total as part of this  package. That is what it adds up to.   That, again, is a benefit that would go out for the next 8 weeks to  small businesses and, if used to keep their employees employed--in  other words, to keep them connected to their jobs, in hopes that, when  this thing passes, those jobs will still be there. So that is $350  billion there--$300 billion for checks that would go out to families,  as I said earlier, and $250 billion to plus up the unemployment  insurance accounts that the States maintain. Those are all benefits  that will go out to workers in this country--to employees--to keep  people afloat, if you will, until we get to a better time, hopefully,  not too far ahead of us.   So those were all priorities that both sides had, and that is just  what Democrats voted against when we had the vote earlier about whether  even to get on the bill, whether to debate the bill. They voted no.  They voted no en bloc.   You saw, shortly after that, a significant drop in the futures  market. I think the markets, in addition to the American people, are  looking to us to provide confidence, to provide a shot in the arm, to  suggest that we get what is at stake and how important it is that we  respond not only swiftly but in a bold and big way.   So those are just a few of the things that were included in there  that are Democrat priorities and represent the work of a bipartisan  task force.   Now, the Democrats have argued that perhaps there is too much in here  in the form of bailouts. Well, there is a provision in here, through  the Federal Reserve, that would allow loans to be made to companies  that need cash flow, that need liquidity, and, obviously, those are  loans that would be paid back. So I don't know how you can argue  something is a bailout when people are getting loans--businesses are  getting loans--that ultimately have to be paid back. But that is a  provision in the bill.   But if you don't have that in there, a lot of those businesses that,  through no fault of their own, have been shuttered or asked to shut  down--and I can use some good examples, notable examples. The airlines,  basically, are not operating--10 percent, maybe 20 percent, but more  likely, from what I am hearing, 10 percent of their normal loads. They  are going to have huge hits to their balance sheets. And there are  other companies like those across this country right now that are  feeling a tremendous amount of economic harm.   The reason that is important is because those people, those  companies, those businesses employ thousands--millions--of workers  across this country, and if we want to keep people employed in this  country, we have to keep those businesses functioning and operating in  a way that will enable them to continue to make payroll. So, yes, there  is a provision in there that helps businesses sort of get liquidity--a  loan, if you will; capital, if you will--that will bridge to,  hopefully, a better time. But those loans, eventually, obviously would  be paid back.   The Democrats were very insistent that there not be any corporate  bailouts, not any bailouts for big businesses, and I don't know how you  could argue that what this includes is a bailout for big businesses.  There is simply a mechanism--a credit facility, as it is referred to-- that would enable businesses to have access to loans that they could  use to keep their businesses up and operating.   So those are just a few of the features in the legislation that was  just voted down--or even whether or not to debate it or not was voted  down--by the Democrats.   I want to mention one last thing here that the Democrats also voted  against, even debated when they came out here and all voted against  this. There is a significant amount of money going to those entities  that we know are on the frontlines of fighting this virus. We have all  said that the best way to get the economy back on track, the best way  to see things restored to normal in this country, is to defeat the  virus. Well, there are significant resources in this legislation that  are designed just to do that:   Seventy-five billion dollars going to hospitals and another $20 or  $25 billion that will go to hospitals through other programs, a  mandatory part of the spending. This comes through the appropriations  bill. So these are discretionary funds. So there is about $100 billion  in there for hospitals.   Twenty billion dollars for veterans healthcare. Of course, veterans  hospitals and healthcare facilities are really critical to caring for a  critical group of people in this country, those who have defended and  fought for our freedoms.   Eleven billion dollars for vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and  other preparedness needs--in other words, all those things that we hear  talked about, in addition to gloves and masks and ventilators, and  those sorts of things, but also the money going into vaccines.  Ultimately, the way we are going to beat this is we have got to have a  vaccine. So there is $11 billion in there for that.   There is $4.5 billion for the Centers for Disease Control, which was  also plussed up significantly in the last two bills that we passed. The  one most recently, earlier this week, had significant additional  resources in there for the CDC.   There is $1.7 billion for the Strategic National Stockpile.   Twelve billion dollars for America's military, which I think we all  agree is a priority for everyone here. National security is always an  issue that we pay a lot of attention to, particularly in the time of  crisis.   Ten billion dollars for block grants to States, just directly block  grants to States.   Twelve billion dollars for K-12 education and another $6 billion for  higher education   Five billion dollars for the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund.   Ten billion dollars for airports--and, obviously, airports are very  much impacted by this complete drop-off when it comes to air traffic in  this country.   Twenty billion dollars for public transportation emergency relief.   That adds up to $242 billion, on top of all the things that I just  mentioned, going to things that we think are really strategic when it  comes to defeating this virus and combating it and making sure that  those resources are available to those who are on the frontlines and  doing that.   So, all told, of that $242 billion, 75 percent--or $186 billion--goes  through the States. The Democrats have said: We need more money for the  States; we need more money for the States. Well, this is a pretty  significant amount, I would think: $186 billion out of the $242 billion  that I just described runs through the States.   So there is a tremendous amount of support for those who are on the  frontlines trying to fight and defeat this coronavirus.   So I just point all that out to say, again, that it is a complete  misnomer to say, as the Democratic leader did earlier, that this was a  partisan bill. This is a bipartisan bill. I participated in one of  those working groups, and I sat across from my Democrat counterpart-- or, at times, more than one--and with staffs, and we came to the table  with a set of priorities, and they came to the table with a set of  priorities.   What this represents is not everything they wanted, and it is  probably  [[Page S1909]]  not everything we wanted but the things that we could find that we  could agree upon. So this was a very bipartisan process which  incorporated the ideas of both Republicans and Democrats.   It is truly unfortunate--frankly, sad, a sad day, I would argue, here  in the U.S. Senate--for our country that the Democrats opted just a  moment ago to vote not even to get on this bill, not even to proceed to  it, to give us the opportunity to continue that discussion and that  debate.   They indicated that there are still discussions going on. I hope that  is the case because--I have said this before--we don't have the luxury  of time. We need action. We need action now--not later, now.   The American people need to see relief. They need to see confidence  in their elected leaders and a willingness to work in a bipartisan way  on a solution, perhaps many solutions--hopefully, included in this  legislation--to the challenges that they are facing in their everyday  lives.   So I will say it is unfortunate we are not going to be on this bill  right now. I hope and pray--for the sake of our country and for the  people who are not only suffering from the coronavirus but those who  have loved ones and those who are exposed to it, those who are caring  for them, but also for every worker, every small business in this  country--that the Democrats would reconsider and allow us to get on  this legislation and move forward in a bipartisan way on a bipartisan  bill, which they helped fashion, which they helped craft, and that is  critical to the challenges that we are facing in the days and weeks  ahead so small businesses will have an opportunity to receive a cash  infusion.   I yield the floor.
