 Reserving the right to object, I appreciate the  earnestness on this issue from my friend and colleague the Senator from  New Jersey. He mentions that something could happen in the world, that  something will happen in the world. Something, I submit to you, has  happened in the world, and today we have been learning about it. I am  talking about the crisis in Afghanistan, the debacle in Afghanistan.   All day, the Senate has been hearing testimony in the Armed Services  Committee from Secretary Austin, from General Milley, and from General  McKenzie about how it came to be that 13 American servicemembers are  dead, 169 civilians killed, and hundreds of Americans left behind enemy  lines there as we still speak--the greatest foreign policy crisis that  this country has seen since Vietnam. And those aren't my words; those  are the words--the comparison of the Democratic members of the  committee who repeatedly referenced today Vietnam, the fall of Saigon.  That is the level of crisis that we are dealing with.   What accountability has there been for this crisis, for this debacle?  Because ``crisis'' isn't even quite the right word. That sounds like a  natural disaster, as if it accidentally happened. That is not the case.  This is a debacle, a failure of leadership in the first order, and what  accountability has there been for it? Who has resigned? Who has been  fired? Who has been relieved of command? Nobody. What actions have the  administration taken? None.   What does Secretary Austin say today? He says: Well, we will take a  hard look at ourselves, and we will ask some tough questions.   Mr. President, that is not nearly good enough. Americans are dead.  Americans are stranded behind enemy lines. Our foreign policies are in  a state of collapse. Our national security is in a state of collapse.  Enemies around the world are watching what is happening in Afghanistan,  are seeing an opportunity as the United States shows weakness and  disarray and chaos. There must be accountability.   Let me say something more about what we learned today because we did  learn quite a lot, and all of it is frightening. We learned that the  President of the United States lied. He lied when he said to the  American people in an interview on television just a few weeks ago that  he was never told by any of his military advisers--never told that a  drawdown on this timetable, his timetable, would result in catastrophe.   He was asked by George Stephanopoulos:         Your top military advisers warned against withdrawing on       this [timetable]. They wanted you to keep about 2,500 troops.    President Biden:         No, they didn't.    Stephanopoulos:         They didn't tell you that they wanted troops to stay?    President Biden:         No.    Stephanopoulos:         So no one told--your military advisers did not tell you,       ``No, we should just keep 2,500 troops.''    President Biden:         No. No one said that to me that I can recall.    Today, we heard from General Milley, General McKenzie, and Secretary  Austin, who--each of them said that they advised the President--it was  their considered military judgment that the President's plans were  mistaken. They advised against it. They advised him against it. Yet he  said: No, no one ever told me. I am not responsible. No one ever told  me.   We also learned this: We learned that the President lied when he said  that he had no idea that the Taliban would take over the country in  such a short time period.   From the same interview, George Stephanopoulos said to President  Biden:         Back in July, you said a Taliban takeover was highly       unlikely. Was the intelligence wrong, or did you downplay it?    Biden said: No. I think that there was no consensus. If you go back  and look, they said it is not going to happen.   Stephanopoulos:         [But] you didn't put a timeline on it when you said it was       highly unlikely. You just flat out [said], ``It's highly       unlikely the Taliban would take over.''    President Biden said:         Yeah.    We learned today, in fact, that his commander on the ground, General  Miller, warned as early as March, March of this year, that the military  situation in Afghanistan was deteriorating rapidly; that the Taliban  was on the offensive; that the drawdown of American troops would likely  result in the collapse of the Afghan Government and the Afghan security  forces sooner rather than later. It was going to come fast is what  General Miller said. Yet  [[Page S6730]]  the President says no one ever told him that. He never knew about it.  In fact, his own commanders on the ground warned him about it.   What was the consequence of this? Well, the President is either  forgetting or ignoring or just outright lying about what he was advised  by his own commanders.   His administration was failing to plan for the collapse of the Afghan  security forces. We learned that today too. Secretary Austin said: We  just didn't plan for a scenario of an Afghan security forces collapse.  We didn't plan for it.   Why didn't they plan for it? Why isn't somebody being held  accountable for it?   The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan has been warning for  years that the Afghan security forces were not ready, that they were  not well equipped, that they were not well trained, and that they would  not likely stand on their own. We know that the commander on the ground  shared the same assessment. Yet the administration did not plan for--by  their own admission did not plan for the collapse of the Afghan  security forces or the collapse of the Afghan Government, which also  meant that they did not order the evacuation of American civilians in  time. They dilly-dallied. They waited. They dithered. They did not  order the evacuation in time. They waited until the middle of August to  undertake an evacuation of civilians in earnest, after American troops  had withdrawn from the country. No wonder there was chaos in Kabul. No  wonder there was a total disaster. That is the administration's fault.  They waited because they hadn't planned. They waited because apparently  they were fighting among themselves--the State Department, Defense  Department, the White House--all fighting because President Biden  wasn't leading. It was a total debacle, total chaos.   My friend the Senator from New Jersey quite reasonably wants to know,  what is the connection? Why I am objecting to these nominees? Why do I  want a vote?   Here is the connection: It is about accountability. No one has been  held accountable. I note the Senator wants to hear from Secretary  Austin in his committee. He should hear from the Secretary in his  committee because what we learned today contradicts quite a lot of the  testimony that the Secretary of State gave to the Senator from New  Jersey and his committee earlier--quite a lot of contradictions. He is  quite right to want to hear from Secretary Austin.   We need to do more than hear from him; we need to have accountability  for what has happened. Until we get that accountability, until someone  is held responsible, until there is some turn, some change, some shift  in policy--and I have called for the resignations of General Milley,  Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, and the national security  advisers, all of whom planned and executed this operation. Until there  is accountability, I think the least the Senate can do is actually  vote, take at least a vote on this floor for nominees to leadership  position at the State Department and the Department of Defense.   Mr. President, I object.    I object.    Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, I object.
