 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Morelle for yielding me the customary 30  minutes. I would parenthetically note that it took about 30 minutes to  read the actual rule itself, so this is one of the longer rules that we  have had under consideration.   There are six measures included in this rule. First is a bill that  seeks to protect older Americans from discrimination in the workplace,  protection  [[Page H3020]]  which already exists. There are two bills that failed to pass on  suspension last week, and three Congressional Review Act resolutions.   The legislation considered in this rule will revoke commonsense  regulations, expand the Federal Government, and create duplicative and  unnecessary red tape for America's small businesses, employees, and  consumers.                                time  1230    In 1967, Congress enacted the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to  protect applicants and employees over 40 years old from discrimination  on the basis of age in employment matters. This act is enforced by the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.   In 2009, the Supreme Court held in the case of Gross v. FBL Financial  Services that the standard of proof for a claim under the Age  Discrimination in Employment Act requires that age stand alone as the  cause of the adverse action rather than in conjunction with other  evidentiary factors.   In 2013, the Supreme Court also ruled, in the University of Texas  Southwestern Medical Center v. Naiel Nassar, that the plaintiff must  prove that a retaliatory motive was the decisive cause of an adverse  employment action.   H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act,  would reverse the Supreme Court decisions by allowing mixed-motive  claims in Age Discrimination Employment Act cases where age would only  need to be a motivating factor for discrimination, even though other  factors also motivated discrimination. In other words, the bill shifts  the burden of proof to allow plaintiffs in age discrimination cases to  demonstrate that any practice by an employer for which age was a  motivating factor is covered. Eliminating the decisive factor approach  disregards two Supreme Court cases and existing law.   Other provisions of H.R. 2062 prohibit a court from awarding damages  or requiring any employment activity other than injunctive relief,  making the only true beneficiaries of this legislation members of the  plaintiffs' bar.   The Supreme Court stated in the Nassar case that ``lessening the  causation standard could also contribute to the filing of frivolous  claims, which would siphon resources from efforts by employers,  administrative agencies, and courts to combat workplace harassment.''   Republicans are committed to eliminating discrimination in the  workplace; that includes for older Americans. Discrimination of any  kind is already against the law through the Age Discrimination in  Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation  Act, and the Civil Rights Act.   Today's rule also contains two bills that were brought up on  suspension last week but were unable to pass with the required two- thirds vote: The Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act, and  the LGBTQ Business Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment Act.   The final three measures included in the rule utilize the  Congressional Review Act to overturn three Trump-era rules that  attempted to provide commonsense regulations, reduce red tape, and to  promote transparency. But in the zeal to repeal all things Trump,  commonsense reduction of red tape, and promoting transparency may just  be regarded as collateral damage, as everything associated with the  former President must be undone in the eyes of House Democrats.   First, S.J. Res. 15 nullifies a rule submitted by the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency relating to National Banks and Federal  Savings Associations as Lenders. This agency rule provides clarity by  determining exactly when a national bank or a Federal savings  association is, in fact, the ``true lender'' when partnering with a  third party to provide loans.   In today's markets, it is common for financial technology companies  to partner with banks to meet the needs of their consumers.  Unfortunately, Court rulings have created uncertainty when partnerships  occur in determining who is the ``true lender'' in these circumstances.   This Office of Comptroller of the Currency rule provides much-needed  clarity for market participants and ensures consumers are, in fact,  adequately protected. Federal law requires ``true lenders'' to comply  with certain consumer protection laws, and clearly delineating the  ``true lender'' will eliminate this uncertainty.   While the majority claims that this rule gives a green light to  predatory relationships by allowing a ``rent-a-charter'' partnership,  this could not be further from the truth. This rule provides greater  transparency into such practices, allowing better protections for  consumers. With more transparency comes more accountability; after all,  sunlight is the best disinfectant.   The next resolution, S.J. Res. 13, uses the Congressional Review Act  to nullify the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's rule titled  ``Update of Commission's Conciliation Procedures.'' Conciliation is a  process by which two parties may resolve disputes informally and  confidentially without ever having to go to court.   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission rule is designed to bring  its conciliation procedures in line with the Supreme Court's decision  in Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC, and would update these procedures for the  first time since 1977.   By encouraging the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claims to  be resolved outside of court, this rule ensures that disputes can be  resolved at less expense in a more timely basis and ensure  accountability.   Passing S.J. Res. 13 would not promote a better workplace for  employees; it would only encourage more litigation. And by utilizing  the Congressional Review Act, this resolution would prevent the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission from ever updating its conciliation  procedures without additional Congressional action. Simply put, this  resolution would only make it more difficult to settle workplace  disputes.   The final resolution in this rule is S.J. Res. 14, which would use  the Congressional Review Act to nullify the Environmental Protection  Agency's rule titled ``Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission standards  for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources Review.'' Should this be  signed into law, it would have significant ramifications for America's  energy industry but, in fact, it would have little impact on America's  public health or America's environment.   In 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency issued new regulations  that right-sized New Source Performance Standards for the oil and gas  industry. Despite the hyperbolic language in the media and from  interest groups, the Environmental Protection Agency found that these  methane rules had no real impact on emissions.   Let's say that again, because it is so important: Despite the  language in the media and from interest groups, the EPA found that  these methane rules had no real impact on emissions. Simultaneously,  barriers to entry were lifted and companies of all sizes were able to  compete. This allowed America to regain its position as a global energy  leader.   Throughout the Trump administration, Americans benefited from  historically clean air and cleaner water. Greenhouse gas emissions fell  throughout the Trump Presidency. The lesson is quite simple: Promoting  innovation and investment in the energy sector is a better way to  promote economic and environmental success.   I am very concerned about this resolution's impact, especially in my  home State of Texas. In recent months, Americans have seen sharp  increases, sharp increases in the price of gasoline, sharp increases in  the price of electricity. Energy costs are rising, and this resolution  only threatens to send them higher. History shows us that the most  substantive changes that can be made occur faster through innovation  and not greater regulation.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to immediately consider H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer  Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of  2021.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, this bill, introduced by Representative  Chris Smith, prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortions or for  health coverage that includes abortions.   The Hyde Amendment first passed Congress in 1976 to ban Federal  funding for most abortions. President Biden's fiscal year 2022 budget  request omits this ban for the first time in over 40 years, breaking  longstanding precedent.   H.R. 18 would make the ban on Federal funding for abortions  permanent, with exceptions for rape, incest, or if the mother's life is  in danger.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), my good friend, and a true leader on this issue, to  further explain the amendment.                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Louisiana (Ms. Letlow), one of our newest Members, to speak again on  defeating the previous question and considering the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the ranking member of our Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Cammack) on the motion against the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach), a valuable member of the Rules Committee,  to speak against the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared  to close if that is in accordance with the wishes of the majority, so I  yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the bills in this lengthy rule will not achieve the  benefits for the American people that are being claimed.   The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act lowers the  threshold for age discrimination cases in the workplace. It is already  illegal to discriminate against an employee because of age. Lowering  the burden of proof to allow for mixed-motive claims will, in fact,  only benefit the trial lawyers who actually bring the suits.   I do want to direct attention to a letter that most Members received  from the United States Chamber of Commerce. It is a very good letter  opposing S.J. Res. 15. This is the Congressional Review Act repeal of  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's rule on national banks  and Federal savings associations and lenders.   The reason I bring this up is because I know many of my friends on  the other side of the aisle do claim that their support from the United  States Chamber of Commerce is what makes them bipartisan and, hence,  they should be reelected. But here we have the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  sending each of us a letter talking about how damaging excluding that  rule from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would be.   If I may just read a portion of this letter: ``Partnerships between  banks and third parties have become a critical avenue for making credit  available to both consumers and small businesses. . . . Fintech  partnerships provided funding for many of America's smallest businesses  which, according to McKinsey & Company, are disproportionately  minority-owned.''   Mr. Speaker, by undoing this Trump-era rule, you are, in fact, going  to be hurting some of the smallest businesses in the country, and I  don't think that is what you would have intended.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letter from the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce.                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                      Washington, DC, June 18, 2021.        To the Members of the House of Representatives: The U.S.       Chamber of Commerce strongly supports the Office of the       Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) rule on ``National Banks       and Federal Savings Associations as Lenders,'' also known as       the ``True Lender'' Rule, and strongly opposes S.J.Res. 15,       which would effectively overturn it.        The True Lender Rule provides important legal certainty for       national banks and federal savings associations regarding       loans they may issue in conjunction with third-parties.       Various judicial rulings have created legal uncertainty as to       who is the ``True Lender'' of a loan when a bank works with a       third party, thus calling into question the laws that apply       to these loans. This legal uncertainty discourages financial       institutions from partnering to provide credit to consumers       and small businesses.        Partnerships between banks and third parties have become a       critical avenue for making credit available to both consumers       and small businesses. In fact, FinTech partnerships       represented 15% of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to       small businesses last year. More importantly, the median       value of FinTech partnership-enabled PPP loans was $15,000.       That median value amount was the smallest of all lending       providers including Minority Development Institutions and       Nonprofits. That means FinTech partnerships provided funding       for many of America's smallest businesses which, according to       McKinsey & Company, are disproportionately minority-owned.        The OCC's rule establishes a clear test for determining the       ``True Lender'' when a bank makes a loan, which clarifies       what legal frameworks are applicable to a loan. The rule       provides that a bank is the ``True Lender'' when it, as of       the date of origination, (1) is named as the lender in the       loan agreement or (2) funds the loan. This clarification is       critical for banks to partner with third parties and does not       undermine the myriad consumer protection laws enforced by       state and federal regulators.        The Chamber opposes S.J.Res. 15.            Sincerely.                                                   Neil L. Bradley.     The Congressional Review Act is a legitimate tool to  review executive actions, but it should not be used as a political tool  to overturn a previous administration's actions simply because, Mr.  Speaker, you don't like the previous occupant of the White House.   The CRAs in this rule are not based on sound policymaking. They are  instead being used as an attempt to score political points by undoing  Trump-era policies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow Members to reconsider these measures by  simply focusing on the policy and not the policymaker.   Mr. Speaker, I have no other conclusion than to urge a ``no'' vote on  the previous question, a ``no'' vote on the rule, and a ``no'' vote on  the underlying measures.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H3024]]         Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
