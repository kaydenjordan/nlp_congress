 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  good work that was done there and the VA MISSION Act, which improves  access to care for our veterans, funds the Choice Program, and expands  the caregivers program for pre-9/11 veterans.   I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member for their work  on this important legislation. I would particularly like to applaud the  inclusion of the VA Medical Scribes Pilot Act. This was legislation  that I helped write with Chairman Roe to set up a pilot program for  including scribes in primary care teams at the VA.   Research in the private sector has shown that allowing scribes to  handle electronic health records allows the healthcare providers, the  doctors, to do more of what they do best, which is to treat the  patients. So we have doctors treating patients rather than spending  their valuable time doing paperwork.   Chairman Roe joined me in my district last fall on a tour of the VA  clinic in White City, Oregon, where we heard firsthand about the  administrative challenges the VA doctors face and how that affects  their ability to care for veterans. The underlying bill that we will  bring to the floor will help. The entire bill will help. This will help  our docs have more time to spend with their patients.   We will continue to work with the VA on their implementation of this  program, but I am pleased that it was included in the underlying  legislation, Mr. Speaker.   Once again, I applaud the entire Veterans Affairs Committee on their  work to give veterans the access to healthcare they have earned and  deserve. I urge support and passage of the underlying VA MISSION Act  and approval of the rule.
