 Mr. President, in support of National Forest Products  Week and in my role as a cochair of the Senate Paper and Packaging  Caucus, I would like to recognize the almost 20,000 hard-working men  and women employed by the forest products industry in the great State  of Arkansas.   Arkansas is home to over 90 wood products, paper, and packaging  manufacturing facilities that make over $8 billion in products annually  and contribute over $1.2 billion to the State and local economies  through wages and compensation.  [[Page S6398]]    The forest products industry plays a valuable role in the life of  every American, every day. From paper and packaging to wood products,  tissue, and other personal care items, paper and wood products are at  the heart of modern life and a modern economy. In total, the industry  employs about 900,000 Americans nationwide and manufactures over $280  billion in products every year. That is nearly 4 percent of the current  U.S. manufacturing GDP.   In addition to cochairing the Paper and Packaging Caucus, I am also a  cochair of the Senate Recycling Caucus. In this dual capacity, I have  seen the success the forest products industry has had in pairing  economic growth with respect for the environment. Be it through the use  of carbon-neutral biomass energy or the successful implementation of  voluntary recycling programs that now reach 96 percent of Americans,  the forest products industry is leading by example.   Last year, I had the opportunity to see firsthand how the forest  industry contributes to the economy of my State. Congressman Bruce  Westerman and I visited timber-rich south Arkansas on our ``Seed to  Sawmill'' tour. We learned about proper forest management and the  positive environmental impacts achieved through conservation efforts.  We also visited a seedling nursery, working private forests, state-of- the art processing facilities, and the U.S. Forest Service's  Experimental Forest in Crossett.   It is clear that the forest products industry contributes a great  deal to Arkansas and to the U.S. economy overall. That is why it is  important for us to highlight how forest products improve our lives,  help grow our economy, and promote healthy environmental practices.   I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating National Forest  Products Week and reflect on the many ways this recyclable and  renewable resource impacts our daily lives for the better. Thank you  for the opportunity to recognize the hard-working professionals of the  forest products industry in the great State of Arkansas.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an  organization that is committed to redirecting the lives of youth and  their families in western Arkansas. Comprehensive Juvenile Services,  Inc., of Fort Smith, AR, helps youth who experience difficulty within  their families, have problems in school, or face other challenges that  result in them being at risk of or referred to the juvenile justice  system. Comprehensive Juvenile Services is celebrating 40 years of  incredible, invaluable service to the community, and I want to  congratulate them on this milestone.   Incorporated in 1976, Comprehensive Juvenile Services is a private,  nonprofit community-based youth services agency. It serves 1,000 youth  each year in Sebastian, Crawford, Franklin, Logan, Scott, Polk, and  Montgomery Counties. CJS is supported by and receives guidance from  community leaders as it seeks to help children and youth who are  susceptible to delinquency or have encountered legal problems and need  positive influences to help get back on track toward a happy and  successful adolescence.   CJS provides support to these children and their families in a  variety of ways. It employs caseworkers to assess a youth's individual  problems and develop case plans, provides aftercare to those in custody  of the Department of Youth Services, offers one-on-one mentoring  opportunities, operates an emergency shelter for at-risk youth, and  features other programs including treatment for major behavioral  problems, mental health assessments, and therapy and parenting classes.   The commitment that CJS has demonstrated for youth in western  Arkansas is inspiring. The men and women of the agency put their hearts  and souls into helping children and teens improve their situations and  strive for better outcomes at home, at school, and in life generally.  In one of many success stories, a former client named Sherry went  through a difficult adoption where she experienced major conflict with  her adopted family. Through the help of Community Juvenile Services,  Sherry completed a program at the Girls Shelter of Fort Smith and is  now a Department of Child and Family Services caseworker herself,  advocating for children and helping to make a difference in their lives  the same way that CJS did in hers.   I am so proud of the work that Comprehensive Juvenile Services has  done over the past 40 years. They truly are changing lives, one child  at a time. I want to congratulate everyone involved with CJS on a job  well done, and I look forward to hearing many more success stories in  the years to come.                            ____________________
