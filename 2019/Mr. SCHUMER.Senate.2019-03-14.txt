 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I thank my colleague and friend from  Tennessee for deferring.   First, on Donald Stewart, I know Leader McConnell talked about him.  Everyone is going to miss him here in the Senate. He was truly somebody  whom everyone liked. He always had a great sense of humor and a big  smile. He served his boss, Mitch McConnell, extremely well, but he  never let that get in the way of being friendly and working with the  other side. He is somebody we will all miss. I enjoyed my interactions  with him a great deal. I think that is probably true of just about  every Member here.   We wish Stew the best and thank him for serving this body so long and  so well.                                 H.J. Res. 46    Today, Madam President, the Senate will vote on the resolution to  terminate the President's declaration of a national emergency. This is  not a normal vote. What we are doing here today--this is not a normal  day. It is not your typical vote on an appropriations or authorization  bill. It doesn't concern a nomination or an appointment. This will be a  vote about the very nature of our Constitution, the separation of  powers, and how this government functions henceforth.   The Framers gave Congress the power of the purse in article I of the  Constitution. It is probably our greatest power. Now the President is  claiming that power for himself under a guise of an emergency  declaration to get around a Congress that repeatedly would not  authorize his demand for a border wall.   The President has not justified the emergency declaration. You would  think in a moment like this, when there is not a war, when there is not  an immediate disease, or when there is not a disaster--that is when we  had other declarations. They don't need an elaboration, but this one  would. But the President hasn't done that. He simply said he ``didn't  need to do this.'' That is amazing, folks, my colleagues. The President  said he didn't need to do this, and yet he is declaring an emergency.  It is a direct contradiction of his own words.   Everyone here knows the truth. Democrats and Republicans know the sad  truth. The President did not declare an emergency because there is one;  he declared an emergency because he lost in Congress and wants to get  around it. He is obsessed with showing strength. He couldn't just  abandon his pursuit of the border wall, so he had to trample on the  Constitution to continue his fight. That is not how this democracy is  supposed to function. That is not how this democracy has functioned. I  have never seen it, where, out of anger and out of a desire to win the  fight regardless of the consequences, a President would do this.   The President has not laid out where he plans to divert funds from,  though we know it is going to be from our military--from the men and  women serving us and from the things they need.   Senators who vote against this resolution this afternoon may be  voting to gut funding for a military installation in their State or for  a cut to military pay and military pensions. How could they do that?   Most importantly, President Trump has shown zero understanding of  what his emergency portends for the separation of powers in our  democracy. The President seems to regard the government, not just the  Justice Department, as his own personal tool to do whatever he wants,  whether it is in the private sector or the public sector. We have never  had a President like this.   We have had lots of Presidents with lots of foibles, but none of them  seem to equate their own ego with the entire functioning of the  government of the United States, except this one.  [[Page S1858]]    We can't succumb to that. It is our job here, in Congress, to limit  executive overreach, to defend our core powers, to prevent a  President--any President--from ignoring the will of Congress every time  it fails to align with the will of the President. That is what the  balance of powers is. That is what checks and balances is. That is what  every one of us learned in second grade civics class.   All that teaching in the second grade civics class seems to be lost  on so many of my Republican colleagues in blind obeisance to this  President, no matter what the consequences.   This is not an issue of the wall. It goes way beyond that. We have  had our fights and disputes on the wall for several years here. However  you feel about our policy on the southern border and however you feel  about the President, Senators should vote yes on the resolution to  terminate the emergency declaration.   This resolution is about more than this President. It is about the  Presidency now and on into the future.   It should not be difficult for any of my Republican colleagues to  take this vote. Conservative principles would demand it, and some of  the true conservatives, like Mr. Lee, yesterday, understood that logic.  Conservatives have always feared an agglomeration of power in any  branch of government, but particularly in the executive branch. The  conservative movement has been designed to reduce the powers of the  Federal Government. That is why they are for lowering taxes so much.   All of a sudden, again, because President Trump simply wants it, they  say: Let's abandon those principles and vote to change, fundamentally,  the way the balance of power works--shame.   If conservatism today is to mean anything, self-branded conservatives  should vote to terminate the resolution. Deep-seated principles like  that shouldn't take a back seat to the politics of the moment. They  should not be abandoned just because the President shares the same  party.   Now, let me speak from the heart to my Republican colleagues. I know  that President Trump is extremely popular among Republicans for many  reasons. I know he commands the vast majority of the Republican Party,  and I know that the President never shies away from threatening,  bullying, or publicly castigating members of his own party if they  refuse to do what he wants.   So, I realize this. It is a much more difficult vote for my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take than for those of us  who are Democrats. I would say to them, and I would say to every  Republican: There are times when loyalty to America, to our  Constitution, to our principles, and to what has made this country  great should lead Members to rise above and rise to the occasion.   I hope and I pray that this moment is one of those times when Members  choose country over party and when Members rise above politics for the  sake of fidelity to our constitutional principles and to this great  United States of America.   In conclusion, on this issue, this is not an everyday moment. This is  not just about going along with this President or that one. This is a  red-letter day in the history of how the U.S. Government functions. The  judgment of our Founding Fathers and the judgment of history weighs  upon this vote.                                   Tariffs    Madam President, the trade negotiations with China are moving  forward, and I continue to have concerns that President Trump will  accept a weak deal for the sake of a headline. Apparently, I am not  alone. President Trump's former top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, told a  podcast that the President is ``desperate'' to reach a trade deal. He  also expressed deep skepticism that the administration would be able to  stop the Chinese from stealing intellectual property and hold the  Chinese accountable.   I hope Gary Cohn is wrong. The President, to his credit, was not  desperate for a deal in North Korea and stood up to Kim Jong Un and  looked strong for that. I hope he realizes that, as he negotiates with  someone with even more consequences at stake for the long run of  America--President Xi--and with a country that can do far more harm to  our country, ultimately, in the long run.   Ambassador Lighthizer has said that there are still major issues left  to be resolved. If that is the case, President Trump should not be  pressing for a quick solution. The Chinese are more desperate for a  solution than we are, although, obviously, some harm has been created  to bring the Chinese to the table with tariffs.   The Chinese are desperate, and it is like they are ahead in the  seventh inning, and then you say: I quit the ball game; I lose.   Don't do that, Mr. President. The tariffs you have imposed, at some  political cost, have brought China to the table and given us the first  opportunity in decades--in decades--to make the Chinese reform so they  don't take total advantage of American workers and know-how. Soybean  purchases and promises to import more American goods are not sufficient  if we don't win concrete concessions on major issues.   If President Trump caves to China for the sake of soybean purchases,  he would be trading America's future, literally, for a hill of beans.  We want to help the soybean farmers. We want to help everybody else,  but not at the expense of the future viability of jobs and wealth in  America.   My message to President Trump is the same one I mentioned to him and  I gave to him before he met with Kim Jong Un: Don't back down.   The President should be proud that he stood up to North Korea and  walked away. He will be proud if he does the same with China, unless  President Xi makes enduring, verifiable reforms of China's economic and  trade policies, because the odds are high that if the President walks  away from a weak deal, he will be able to get a much better deal down  the road.   I yield the floor.    We have 1 minute remaining, I think. I ask unanimous  consent to speak in leader time.    Thank you, Mr. President.   Today, the Senate will vote on the resolution to terminate the  President's declaration of a national emergency.   Let me begin with a quotation.         Revelations of how power has been abused by high government       officials must give rise to concern about the potential       exercise, unchecked by the Congress or the American people,       of this extraordinary power. The National Emergencies Act       would end this threat and ensure that the powers now in the       hands of the Executive will be utilized only in a time of       genuine emergency and then only under safeguards providing       for congressional review.    Let me repeat that. ``[T]he powers now in the hands of the Executive  will be utilized only in a time of genuine emergency.'' That is from  the special committee report on the National Emergencies Act, which was  passed decades ago.   The bottom line is very simple. We all know the other arguments--that  this is not an emergency. The President himself said so. He said he  didn't have to do this if he didn't want to. In previous emergencies,  it was either apparent, like 9/11, or it was a disease or some other  immediate disaster, and there was a long explanation as to why. We have  gotten no explanation as to why this is an emergency.   The second reason, of course, is the money that might be taken away  from the military--our brave men and women in uniform not getting the  dollars they need--for this wall.   The third, of course, is that the President couldn't get his way  through Congress even when we had 2 years of Republican leadership in  the House, Senate, and White House, couldn't get his way this time, and  is now simply going around Congress to declare an emergency.   But those reasons pale for the most important reason. This is a  momentous day. The balance of power that the Founding Fathers put in  place, so exquisitely designed, has served this Nation extremely well  for over two centuries. That balance of power was in large part  motivated by the fear of an overreaching Executive. The patriots had  just fought King George. They knew what it was like to have an  Executive who would go too far, and they put in precautions to make  sure that didn't happen.   Today, we are being asked, in a way that we haven't been asked in  decades, maybe even longer, to change that balance of power. And make  no mistake about it--it will set an awful precedent for the future, no  matter who is President. It will change it. If a President can invoke  an emergency because he didn't get his way or she didn't get her way,  without real cause, without a real emergency, woe is our Republic in  many ways--the ways the Founding Fathers feared.   I know this is a very difficult vote for my friends on the other side  of the  [[Page S1882]]  aisle--much more difficult than ours. We all know that the President is  extremely popular in the Republican Party for maybe a few good  reasons--I would say mostly bad, but he is. We know that he has been  vindictive, contemptuous, calling out people who oppose him. So it is  not an easy vote. I take my hat off to those Members on the other side  of the aisle who have let principle rise above party, who understand  what the Constitution requires this afternoon and have agreed to vote  against this emergency.   I would plead with those others who haven't made up their minds to  look at this moment in history. This is not an immediate moment. You  can be for the wall or against the wall, you can think that what we are  doing at the southern border is inadequate, but that issue pales before  the issue before us; that is, how far an Executive can reach when  Congress does not want to do what that Executive wants.   This is a crucial moment. This is a moment historians will look back  on. This could be a moment that changes the fundamental balance of  power in our government. So I would ask my colleagues--I would really  plead with my colleagues. I understand the politics are difficult--much  harder for you than for me--but our Nation, our Constitution, the  beauty of this government demands that we rise to the occasion this  afternoon. Please join us in rejecting this emergency and keeping our  government with the same balance of power that has served us so well  for two centuries.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning, something rather amazing  and wonderful happened in the House of Representatives. The House of  Representatives this morning passed a resolution expressing the sense  of Congress that the full report by Special  [[Page S1884]]  Counsel Robert Mueller should be made available to the public and to  Congress. The vote was 420 to 0. Not a single Member of the House,  Democratic or Republican, voted no.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the record of the vote,  including all 190 Republicans who voted yes, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    Final Vote Results for Roll Call 125    (Democrats in roman; Republicans in italic; Independents underlined)         H. Con. Res. 24: Yea-and-Nay, 14-Mar-2019, 10:30 AM.        Question: On Agreeing to the Resolution.

That is  because there is no good reason that the special counsel's report  should not be made public. The American people are overwhelmingly for  making the report public. They have a right to see it. No one should  stand in the way of that. In fact, in the House, no one did. The only  reason to not make this report public would be to cover up what is in  it. What a shame that would be.   The Senate should pass this resolution with the same unanimity that  the House did. The special counsel has been investigating one of the  greatest affronts to our democracy--the deliberate interference by a  foreign power in our elections. The American people have an undeniable  right to see the results of that investigation for themselves, and so  this resolution should pass.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 24, expressing the sense of  Congress that the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller be made  available to the public and to Congress, which is at the desk; further,  that the concurrent resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to,  and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I am  deeply disappointed in my good friend from South Carolina. This  amendment appears to be a pretext for blocking this very simple,  noncontroversial resolution. Four hundred-twenty Members of the House  voted for it. Congressman   Jim Jordan, a friend of the President's,  voted for it. Congressman Devin Nunes, a friend of the President's,  voted for it.   This resolution should pass the Senate in the blink of an eye. I have  absolutely no idea why a Member of this body would object to this basic  level of transparency, whatever their concern on other issues.   My friend from South Carolina says the report ought to be made  public. Let's not stand in the way for other issues. He is chairman of  the Judiciary Committee. He can deal with that separately but not block  this resolution.   So let the American people know that the Republican majority in the  Senate--at least for now--is blocking a resolution that the Mueller  report should be made public. I hope my friend from South Carolina and  all of my Republican colleagues take time over the recess to thinks  about this. We are going to be back here asking for consent again when  the Senate is back in session, and my Republican colleagues ought to  think long and hard before they block this resolution again.   I object.
