 Mr. Speaker, 6 years ago today, DACA provided a shining  light for hundreds of thousands of young Dreamers from all across this  country to come out from the shadows and live freely without fear in a  nation that for many has been the only home they have ever known.   These are people who were brought here as young children through no  choice of their own, but no longer. Now, since DACA was rescinded,  their status and future hang in limbo with great uncertainty. Their  futures and dreams are put on hold as those fears of being ripped from  their families and deported to strange, foreign countries has reentered  their lives.   We cannot afford to wait another day. The vast majority of Americans  support Congress passing a final solution, a permanent solution, for  these Dreamers. The majority of Congress supports finding a permanent  solution for these Dreamers.   Let's stand together, work for the good of the people in this  country, and pass a solution for these young people all across the  country.                            ____________________
