 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted the chairman mentioned President Reagan.  But he made it sound as though President Reagan did tax reform on his  own. Tax reform in 1986 was done in a bipartisan manner. I guess we  just leave out Speaker O'Neill and we just leave out Chairman  Rostenkowski and we just leave out Senator Bradley or Congressman  Gephardt. The reason that they are left out is because even though it  was accomplished in 1986, it started in 1982 when Mr. Gephardt and Mr.  Bradley introduced the first tax reform act.                                time  1700    What happened in those intervening years?   The Ways and Means Committee took testimony from 50 witnesses. They  held 30 markups and an untold number of hearings.   Contrast that with what we did in the Ways and Means Committee: not  one witness, not one hearing, not one opportunity to hear from renowned  economists, labor leaders, or individuals who would have great  knowledge not just of what happened in 1986, but what could happen in  this Chamber. Instead, we are going forward with this ill-considered  effort.   This is a missed opportunity. This is a bad deal for millions of  Americans in the middle class. The legislation puts the wealthy, the  well-connected, and the strong, once again, at the top. Thirty-six  million Americans are going to receive a tax increase.   When they talk about tax simplification, take a look at the phase-ins  and phase-outs of this measure. That is hardly simplification. It is  greater complexity.   Oh, by the way, the corporate rate is made permanent. The individual  issues phase out after 5 years.   Consider this: 13 million people will lose their health insurance  based on what Republicans are doing in the United States Senate. They  are going to lose their healthcare to pay for a tax cut for people at  the very top.   Let me just walk you through some of these provisions because I think  that they deserve our attention and the magnifying glass of critical  analysis.   We are being asked tonight to borrow $2.3 trillion to pay for this  tax cut. This is from people who regularly lecture the American  electorate on the need for fiscal austerity and balanced budgets.   When Barack Obama was President, the budget should be balanced. When  Bill Clinton was President, the budget should be balanced. But in the  intervening period of time, apparently, we don't have to balance the  budget.   Also, $2.3 trillion is being added to the debt and deficits. We are  witnessing what they are attempting to do because they are going to  scale back the tax benefit for buying a new home by lowering the cap on  mortgage interest deduction to $500,000. That is going to lower home  values.   H.R. 1 repeals the new markets tax credit. The historic tax credit  that has transformed American cities is being eliminated. They beat up  on the municipal bond market.   As a former mayor, I have some knowledge of the municipal bond  market.   They are getting rid of the private activity bonds. Years ago, I  raised the cap so that we might do more intervention and innovation in  terms of rebuilding our airports across the country. Private activity  bonds are a key for financing affordable housing. It is going to go by  the wayside if they have their way. It is going to have a profound  impact on the housing market.   They eliminate several deductions and exclusions that help pay for  college education, including a deduction for interest on student loans.   Pay attention to this number. Student debt in America is at $1.3  trillion, and they are taking away the ability of students to deduct  that interest on those loans.   They also impose a new tax on universities and colleges.   They repeal the above-the-line deduction for teachers' out-of-pocket  expenses. You know, those teachers who, in September, might be short  some school supplies and they are good enough to pack the car up and  bring it to school? We give them a $250 deduction. They are going to  take it away.   They create a health tax, an Alzheimer's tax, by repealing the  medical expense deduction. This change basically scraps a family's  ability to receive financial relief when dealing with serious medical  conditions.   Think of it this way: We celebrate annually the increases in life  expectancy in America--80 for a male, 81 for a female. But if we are  going to celebrate that, we also have to acknowledge something else:  more dementia and more Alzheimer's as people grow older in America. So  their decision is: Let's take away the ability of individuals to deduct  those expenses.   They also want to write off a very important consideration for the  middle class in their ability to deduct real property tax costs up to  $10,000.   Contrast this with what these tax cuts do for the wealthy.   H.R. 1 repeals the estate tax, which is paid by a small number of  families in America. They are going to repeal it. I guess the slogan  becomes: We are rich, and we are not going to take it anymore. That is  not a tax on Conrad Hilton; it is a tax on Paris Hilton. That is what  we should be considering with the greater efforts on their side to  further concentrate wealth.   By the way, there is an issue I have worked on for decades here,  successfully, because 27 million middle class families no longer pay  the alternative minimum tax. But guess what they are going to do? They  are going to eliminate it for 4.5 million of the richest families in  America. They are going to take away that payment.   This is a missed opportunity, Mr. Speaker. This could have been done  the way Chairman Brady indicated in 1986: hearings, markups, a genuine  effort to find common ground on this.   On our side, I have waited all these years to do this. Tonight and  tomorrow, what you are witnessing is that they need a victory. That is  what this is about. It is a victory in search of a policy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am for maintaining the status quo by  allowing students to deduct their student interest loans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, this bill phases out the deductions that  benefit middle-income families.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, more than 100,000 Nebraska households making  under $137,000 a year will see a tax increase under this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Capuano), my good friend from Somerville, Massachusetts.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Speaker, 40 percent of Mr. Paulsen's constituents claim  the SALT deduction, a benefit of over $15,000. They are lucky to break  even after this tax bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Kind), a valued member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, over 350,000 Tennessee households making under  $132,000 will see a tax increase with this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Courtney), a leader on the Higher Education Subcommittee and well known  nationally as a spokesperson on education issues.    Mr. Speaker, all of those projects in Philadelphia are  about to come to an end with the abolition of the historic tax credit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Sherman), who, incidentally, is a CPA and a tax attorney    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, 38,000 South Dakota households making less  than $113,000 a year will see a tax increase under this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the highly regarded gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the son of Massachusetts and my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a well-regarded champion of middle-income people.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), a valued member of our delegation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, correction. Not one hearing was held on this  tax bill. Thirty-eight thousand people in Mr. Reed's district will lose  the student loan interest deduction.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Kaptur), a real champion of the working class in America.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch), who is a son of Springfield, Massachusetts, and a  very distinguished gentleman.    Madam Speaker, the University of Notre Dame is about to get  slugged with a new tax, and the clock is running out.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  David Scott), who has been a champion of the working class.     I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's sincerity as we  proceed to watch them borrow $2.3 trillion on the deficit.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Kildee), from a well-known family.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle), a conscience of the House and a  champion of all things Pittsburgh.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Ryan), who is well known and well regarded as he addresses  national economic issues.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney), well-known as a champion of America's middle  class.    Madam Speaker, 28,000 people will use the student loan  interest deduction in Missouri's Eighth District, claiming nearly $33  million in deductions.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Ruiz), a medical man and Congressman.    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I just happen to have the nephew of former  President Kennedy here who is going to set the record straight on that  quote that was attributed to President Kennedy just a few moments ago.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Kennedy), a very good member of the Massachusetts congressional  delegation and my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Massachusetts an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin). Congressman Raskin is a well-known champion of  civil liberties and a scholar of the law.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Maryland an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters), who is the ranking member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell). Congresswoman Sewell is an attorney and a  Marshall Scholar.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, 33 percent of Mr. Knight's constituents derive a  $16,000 annual benefit from the State and local tax deduction.   In the case of the gentlewoman from California, 37 percent of her  constituents enjoy an $18,200 State and local tax deduction benefit.   Madam Speaker, in closing, more than anything else, this is, as I  opened with, a missed opportunity.   We all know what is wrong with this Tax Code. We could have found  areas of compromise emphasizing the middle class and middle-income  earners. We understand that the Tax Code that American corporations use  is not competitive now internationally, but we wanted some relief for  middle-income people.   So here is where the investment could have taken place. We could have  begun an investment in human capital. You have heard it tonight. We  should all be alarmed by labor participation rates in America. We all  should be alarmed by what has happened in the post-war period where, at  one time, it was 63 percent, and now it is 63.8 percent.   It is about technology; it is about globalization, for sure; but it  is also about skill set. Eighteen thousand precision manufacturing jobs  in New England go unanswered, the smallest geographic region of the  country. The Department of Labor reported this week that 6 million jobs  in America go unanswered. It is part of a skill set issue.   You know what else we need to be concerned about?   Two million people in America are addicted to opioids. That is what  we should be concerned about as well as getting them back into the  workplace through the trampoline effect, where they hit it and bounce  back up into the mainstream. But that is not what we did.   Without any hearings, without any chance for the minority to  participate, in terms of substance, we moved forward.   I want to say to the last two speakers, they are sincere enough. We  have heard now four different people come to the well of this House on  the other side and say to the chairperson of our committee and a  friend: Are you going to fix this after the bill leaves here?   Four different people asked for a fix. I want to tell you, based on  long experience in this House, the path gets more narrow as it leaves  this House. It doesn't grow more expansive. It will be harder to fix  these things because of the budget score that was embraced.   In 2001, we were promised widespread economic growth when President  Bush took the Clinton surplus and offered $1.3 trillion worth of tax  cuts. When you look at the distribution tables, they were right about  one thing: everybody did get a tax cut. But then you look at those  tables and you say: Let me examine who got what.   In 2003, we came back and the President proposed $1 trillion worth of  tax cuts based on the premise of economic growth, which didn't happen.  [[Page H9360]]    By the way, in 2004, there was repatriation, which may be the  granddaddy of them all. Well, we are going to repatriate those holdings  offshore at 5\1/4\ percent o the premise of job growth. And there was  none.    We had this opportunity to do this together, as I described with  worker participation rates, understanding that most families now are  not having large numbers of children any longer. This should have been  about immigration reform attached to it as well. We all know skilled  workers from overseas are going to be an important part of the American  economy, and we should be embracing that, along with sensible tax  policies based upon some relief for the middle class.   Instead, we are taking away the ability of American students to  deduct interest on their loans to pay for a tax cut for people at the  top?   We are taking away a medical expense deduction for people who have  Alzheimer's disease to pay for the tax cut for people at the top?   We are assessing universities and colleges a new, special tax to pay  for tax cuts for people at the top?   We could have had this conversation. We acknowledge what President  Reagan and Speaker O'Neill did because it was based upon good will and  commonality and not needing just a political victory. Day after day  they plowed through with 450 witnesses in front of the Ways and Means  Committee.   How many witnesses did we have in front of the Ways and Means  Committee?   Zero.   How many hearings did we have on this tax bill?   Zero.   We saw the manager's amendment and were given 20 minutes to review  it. I don't mean 25 minutes. I mean 20 minutes. Back to regular order.  We should scrap this bill.   To those who are vulnerable on the other side, I would not be  trusting of the idea that these issues are going to be fixed after you  cast this vote tomorrow morning. There will be an opportunity to go  back and redo this if the other side would say: Let's find a meaningful  path to cooperation between the two parties.   That is all we are asking for on this side: include us in this  discussion so we might invest in community colleges, vocational  education, internship programs, skill set training, and answer the call  of globalization.   We still have innovation and creativity that far surpasses the rest  of the world. There is nothing we can't answer in America without those  healthy investments that we need.   Instead, when you look at these distribution tables that are proposed  as to who is going to get what; taking away the alternative minimum tax  for the 4.5 million families that pay it; asking students to give up  their student interest deduction; the estate tax, which we are  repealing; and we are asking that loved ones who have Alzheimer's and  being cared for at home to give up that medical deduction to pay for  all of that, it makes no sense whatsoever. But there is an opportunity,  Madam Speaker, to reverse course.   In my years here, I can tell you this: Anybody who thinks that the  United States Senate is going to accommodate their wishes, when they  see the goalpost and the goal line of a handful of Members of this  House, they are making a miscalculation.   We have heard tonight they are going to do something about state and  local tax deduction, they are going to do something about the historic  tax credit, and they are going to revisit these issues.   Do you know how difficult that is going to be, Madam Speaker?   That is going to be nearly impossible.   On top of that, they are going to go back and try to appeal the  Affordable Care Act again and take 13 million people away from their  insurance so that we can have a tax cut that further concentrates  wealth for a handful of people in America?   This is the House of Representatives, Madam Speaker, not the House of  Lords. We don't serve here by peerage. We are not entitled to anything  here. Most of us come from pretty modest backgrounds. That is the  principle we should be honoring in this tax debate as we discuss who is  about to pay what and what the rewards ought to be for the hardworking  men and women.   This is last note I am going to express before I yield back my time.  What about those 1 million veterans who have served us honorably in  Iraq and Afghanistan?   New veterans, what about them?   Are we going to eventually cut their benefits with Social Security  and Medicare and Medicaid and put it all on the chopping block as we  attempt to further concentrate wealth in America, particularly for  unearned income, by the way?   That is where we are heading.   We should honor the skills of those men and women who get up every  day and strive and work hard in this country with a sense of purpose  and great patriotism. That is what we should be acknowledging in this  debate.   I am looking forward to tomorrow morning, when we conclude this  debate and spend the 2 hours discussing more of what we have witnessed  here tonight. There will be more than enough enthusiasm on our side.  They will be lined up to RFK Stadium to participate tomorrow morning in  this debate. That is how important this is to the future of the  American people.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we are going to be asked to cast  perhaps one of the most important votes that will take place in a  career here in the House based on the tax plan that the Republicans  have put forward.   I say history is important, because this vote is likely to have  consequences for years and years and years to come.   As I noted earlier tonight, as we look at a million new veterans from  the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq who deserve our care, for those of us  who represent soldiers' homes and hospitals for the VA, we know just  how important this is.   We know what happens to Alzheimer's patients who are going to lose  the deduction on healthcare. We know what is going to happen to those  students who currently write off parts of their student loans through  interest deductions. We know the assessed tax that is going to go on  places like the University of Notre Dame and others. We also understand  that the homeowner deduction, the mortgage interest deduction, which is  a huge middle class benefit, is about to be taken away arbitrarily.   State and local taxes, in some cases sales taxes, are about to be  abolished all based upon the premise of maybe there will be enough  economic growth.   There is no evidence, based on the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 or the  repatriation that took place in 2004, that any of this is accurate, but  they continue to proceed.   The next part of the challenge is they have now substituted the old  supply side economics theory--remember tax cuts pay for themselves--and  they have come up with a new term, and the new term that they have come  up with is ``dynamic scoring.''   So we have the challenge of technology, we have the challenge of  globalization, and, yes, we have the challenge of skill set across  America to move people into a direction of employment where they and  their skills might be aligned with the jobs that are open, because the  Department of Labor this week said there are 6 million jobs in America  that go unanswered, 18,000 precision manufacturing jobs in New England  that go unanswered, and 1 million tech jobs.                                time  2000    So we should be using this opportunity to invest in vocational  education; we should be using it to invest in internship programs; and,  yes, we should be using it to invest in community colleges. So part of  this discussion should be based on, again, the historic vote of long- term investment.   Now, we also know that is unlikely to happen because, when people  have a chance to look at these distribution tables on these tax cuts as  to who gets what, they are going to be furious.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Napa, California (Mr.  Thompson), and then the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) will be  acknowledged right after that.    I yield to the gentleman.    The summary of this tax bill was published last Thursday.  We did a walk-through on Monday. We only had a chance to respond to the  bill, or the chairman's mark on Friday. And then on Monday, we did a  walk-through. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday morning, we did the  markup. Not one hearing.   And recall that, in the last moments of the markup, we were handed a  manager's amendment. We had 20 minutes to react to the manager's  amendment, so no hearings.   And compare that with 1986, which everybody heralds now, as the great  moment of Reagan and O'Neill and Rostenkowski and Gephardt and Bradley,  450 witnesses, 30 public hearings. The Secretary of the Treasury sat  through the markup.    I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).                                time  2015     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Kind).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    I yield to Mr. Davis to talk about historic tax credits. I  know Mr. Lipinski is here from Chicago as well to talk about new  markets, and then we can talk, as Mr. Kind did, about the retirement  crisis that is coming, and we can just yield back and forth to make  sure that people understand the totality of what is being asked in this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind).    Mr. Speaker, forgive me for being from New England. I will  leave that alone.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson).    I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to yield to the gentleman from  Connecticut.    Mr. Speaker, I want to ask Mr. Welch, who made it to  Vermont via Springfield, who has a longstanding interest in higher  education--maybe he could talk about parts of Vermont that are very  rural and also link it to that whole notion of higher education in the  State of Vermont.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Vermont. It was a  very nice description of our hometown, Springfield, Massachusetts.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Chicago, Illinois (Mr.  Lipinski), who is a good friend to all of us here.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, let me thank Mr. Lipinski and the group that  is assembled here tonight. I want to encourage the American people to  pay attention beginning again tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock when we are  going to finish the debate on this legislation.   I hope that as they pay attention to it they will consider what a  missed opportunity this was, a reminder that one of the most complex  pieces of legislation offered in the years I have been here had no  public hearings. Not one witness was summonsed to give advice on a tax  bill of this consequence.   It has been advertised as a middle class tax cut. I can assure you  that 36 million Americans are going to pay more when this is done.   Also, another reminder to pay close attention to is that our friends  down the hallway in the Senate are going to include an end to the  mandate, which is the glue that holds together the Affordable Care Act,  in a further effort to take away health insurance from 13 million  people to pay for a tax cut.   This could have been done together, Democrats and Republicans. We  wanted to do it. We were shut out of this process from day one.  Remember, this legislation was offered last Thursday. A manager's mark  was published Friday. We went to markup on Monday, and we were done on  Thursday. There was no opportunity for us to participate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
