 Mr. Speaker, today I rise with a heavy heart to  acknowledge the life and legacy of Coach Marvin Keelen. Coach Keelen  coached at Goretti Playground in New Orleans, Louisiana.   I met Coach Marvin probably when I was about 13 years old; and he  started me out as a bookkeeper at the playground keeping score. Then I  went on to be an umpire; then I went on to be a coach.   Coach Marvin passed away this weekend, but over his 34 years of  coaching at Goretti Playground, he has touched the lives of so many  young men. We have a Capitol Police officer here that Coach Marvin  coached. We have myself and countless others that his direction, his  mentorship provided a real pathway for a lot of our young men.   The other thing I would say about Coach Marvin is his family followed  in his footsteps. Just two weekends ago, his younger son, Nick, won his  first city championship. His other son, Marvin, won a couple of city  championships, and Coach Marvin won about seven.   But it wasn't just about competing. It was taking our young kids and  making sure that they understood their potential to be whatever they  wanted to be, that they could be champions if they wanted to be, that  they could actually be U.S. Congressmen.   So I just want to extend my condolences to his wife Jennifer Keelen;  his daughter Nikki; his son, Nick; and his other son, Marvin, to let  them know that their father has heard those words: ``Well done, my good  and faithful servant.''      Celebrating the Life and Legacy of Judge Angelique ``Angie'' Reed     Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life and legacy of  Judge Angelique ``Angie'' Reed, who passed in the city of New Orleans.   Judge Reed was the quintessential judge. She was fair, but she was  firm. She expected the best out of lawyers in front of her, and she  demanded nothing less.   She was a proud member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated,  and, in honor of her, I am wearing my pink tie today. She was also a  faithful member of Jack and Jill, that provides mentorship to children  and communities all across the country, and she was a faithful member  of the New Orleans Chapter of The Links.   Let me just say that her membership in all of these organizations  really highlighted her love for New Orleans.   On the national level, she was a member of the Judicial Council of  the National Bar Association, even co-chairing the event in New  Orleans.   I first met Judge Angie Reed when she was just a young lawyer in the  City Attorney's Office and I was a law clerk trying to find my way  around. She took me under her wing and taught me life lessons that I  would never forget about the practice of law: that it was not about  trying to make money; it was not about you, but it was about your  client; it was about making a difference; it was about righting a  wrong.   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in his speech, ``Give Us the Ballot,''  proclaimed that, if you give us the ballot in the South, we will elect  judges and put judges on the bench that will love mercy and do justice.  Judge Angelique Reed did just that, and she did it better than anyone  else.   She leaves behind her daughter, Giana Warren.  [[Page H9064]]    And I would just say that the New Orleans community is better off  because Angie Reed passed our way, and she will be sorely missed.   She also will hear those words: ``Judge Reed, well done, my good and  faithful servant.''                            ____________________
