 Mr. Speaker, in September, I was named to the National  Defense Authorization Act conference committee, which is tasked with  reconciling differences between the House and Senate-passed defense  authorization bills.   In this role, I believe I would have the chance to advocate for  provisions for PFAS contamination and its devastating effects, which  include thyroid disease, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. The  contaminant has wreaked havoc in my district, from Hoosick Falls to  Petersburgh.   Unfortunately, leaders in both parties ultimately opted to hijack  negotiations at the eleventh hour behind closed doors and in a  disturbingly undemocratic fashion. In the end, nearly every PFAS  provision was stripped from the agreement.   While I am pleased that my bipartisan legislation requiring PFAS  chemicals to be listed on the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory was  ultimately included, I am, nonetheless, deeply frustrated by an  incredibly flawed process completely void of transparency.   For this reason, I decided not to sign the final conference report. I  expected more from this process, and I am quite certain the American  people expect more from this body.                            ____________________
