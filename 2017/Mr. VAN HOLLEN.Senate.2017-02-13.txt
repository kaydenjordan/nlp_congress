 Mr. President, today we consider the nomination of  Steve Mnuchin, a multimillionaire former Goldman Sachs executive, hedge  fund manager, and investor, to be Secretary of the Treasury. In our  Nation's history, the Treasury Secretary was the first Cabinet official  to be confirmed by the Senate, when Alexander Hamilton took his post in  1789.   The first Congress valued the Treasury Department highly, giving it  more resources than all other government agencies combined. Today the  mission of the Treasury Department is to:         ``Maintain a strong economy and create economic and job       opportunities by promoting the conditions that enable       economic growth and stability at home and abroad, strengthen       national security by combating threats and protecting the       integrity of the financial system, and manage the U.S.       Government's finances and resources effectively.''    While the Department always serves a critical function, it has been  particularly vital in times of financial crisis. In 2008, in the wake  of lax regulation and excessive speculation, a financial crash shook  our Nation's economy. The Treasury Department was a key player to pull  us back from the brink and keep the toxic contagion on Wall Street from  spilling over to Main Street. We had to fight to ensure that the  colossal failures of irresponsible corporate executives would not wipe  out small businesses and citizens' savings.   At that time, my congressional office helped hundreds of homeowners  facing foreclosure, working them through the loan modification process,  helping track down missing documents, and following up again and again  with banks to make sure that paperwork was processed. We held a  foreclosure prevention forum to connect people to  [[Page S1110]]  housing counselors. For too many, this process was extremely difficult,  tremendously confusing, and, in some cases, deliberately misleading.  While my office was always ready to help, there was no reason why  congressional intervention should have been necessary to help families  modify their payments to stay in their homes.   Where was Steve Mnuchin at this time, when families across the Nation  were struggling? He was profiting from it. In 2009, he joined a group  of billionaire-investors to buy IndyMac, a failed bank that the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation had taken over. The investors turned it  into OneWest Bank, and they turned it into what the California  Reinvestment Coalition called ``a foreclosure machine.''   Though the majority did not permit the California Reinvestment  Coalition to testify at an official hearing on Mr. Mnuchin's  nomination, the coalition's Paulina Gonzalez spoke with a number of  Senators at a forum on Mr. Mnuchin's bank. Ms. Gonzalez told us that  OneWest was among the worst. OneWest denied more applications than most  for the Home Affordable Modification Program, the government program to  help homeowners avoid foreclosure by adjusting their payment schedule.  Ms. Gonzalez told us, ``We have labeled OneWest a `foreclosure machine'  not only because it foreclosed on more than 60,000 American families  and because of its aggressive foreclosure practices, but because it  seemed to do little else.''   Consider some of the heartbreaking foreclosure stories that OneWest  left in its wake.   A 90-year-old Florida woman lost her home after making a 27-cent  payment error.   Christina Clifford attempted to modify her loan twice. Each time that  she sent in her check with the paperwork, OneWest told her that her  paperwork was not received--even though the bank cashed the check that  was in the same envelope.   A Minneapolis woman was in the process of negotiating a loan  modification when she came home in a blizzard and found that her locks  had been changed.   OneWest and its subsidiary Financial Freedom were also notorious for  what came to be called ``widow foreclosures.'' They lured seniors into  reverse mortgages signed by one spouse of a married couple. When the  spouse who signed the paperwork died, OneWest and Financial Freedom  would immediately begin the foreclosure process, sending out notices in  as little as 10 days to widows and widowers.   Another egregious bank practice during the foreclosure crisis was  ``robo-signing.'' Mortgage officials would speed through foreclosure  documents and sign off without reviewing their accuracy. This practice  all too frequently led to the bank powering through as many  foreclosures as possible.   Mr. Mnuchin told the Finance Committee that ``OneWest Bank did not  `robo-sign' documents.'' But in a deposition, a OneWest executive  admitted to personally robo-signing hundreds of documents, even  shortening her signature to her initials to speed the process even  further.   Thanks to these draconian practices, Mr. Mnuchin made a tidy $1.5  billion in profit when he and his fellow investors sold OneWest after 6  years.   In the aftermath of the devastating 2008 financial crisis, Congress  worked to reform the system with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act. Congress intended the law to reduce the kind  of risk and recklessness that led to the crisis and strengthen Federal  oversight of Wall Street and Big Banks. Congress created the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau to be a watchdog for everyday Americans and  prevent predatory lending and unscrupulous behavior by financial  institutions. It began regulation of exotic financial derivatives that  contributed to the crisis by masking risk and established the Volcker  rule to place limits on ways that banks can invest to minimize  conflicts of interest and high-risk transactions.   While Congress can certainly do more to improve consumer and investor  protections and ensure that no bank is ever ``too big to fail,'' Dodd- Frank is a critical reform. And since the day it passed, Republicans in  Congress have attacked it, seeking to roll back its protections, weaken  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and reduce the oversight of  the speculative transactions that increase risk in our financial  markets.   President Trump has called Dodd-Frank a ``disaster'' and vowed to  ``do a big number on it.'' And last week, President Trump signed an  Executive order directing a review of Dodd-Frank regulations.   By his side at that moment was Gary Cohn, who was co-president of  Goldman Sachs during the financial crisis. As detailed in a report by  the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Goldman survived  the crash in part by betting against its own customers and sticking  them with bad mortgages. In 2006, they saw trouble coming in the  subprime mortgage market and realized that they were overinvested. So  they packaged the bad deals into new mortgage-backed products and  dumped them. In 2009, one analyst called Goldman ``a single underwriter  solely interested in pushing its dirty inventory onto unsuspecting and  gullible investors.''   President Trump's adviser Gary Cohn was a leader of Goldman Sachs at  that time. Now, after walking away from Goldman Sachs with a $285  million payout, he has become chair of the National Economic Council.  Mr. Cohn is at President Trump's side to work to unravel the reforms  that Congress put in place to stop bad behavior of banks like Goldman  Sachs.   Mr. Mnuchin also worked at Goldman Sachs and continued to work in the  hedge fund industry. Will he serve as a check on the impulse to reopen  banking to greater risk? In an interview with CNN's Squawk Box after  his nomination, he said, ``We want to strip back parts of Dodd-Frank  and that will be the number one priority on the regulatory side,''--the  number one priority.   It is unclear how Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Cohn, and President Trump plan to  reshape financial regulation, how much risk they plan to reintroduce to  the markets, and whether they would ensure adequate safeguards for  consumers and investors. We do know, however, that Mr. Mnuchin and Mr.  Cohn are cozy with Wall Street and Big Banks, and it appears now that  Mr. Trump's talk about reining in Wall Street was just talk.   In addition to the need to continue sensible oversight of the  financial system, the next Treasury Secretary will have to confront one  of the greatest challenges of our time--growing income inequality,  wealth inequality, and wage stagnation.   According to an Economic Policy Institute Analysis of data from the  Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis, from 1948  until 1973, worker productivity and compensation rose at roughly  similar rates--productivity increased by 96.7 percent and hourly  compensation increased by 91.3 percent. Starting in 1973, however,  growth in worker productivity and wages began to diverge dramatically.  Between 1973 and 2013, productivity increased by 74.4 percent, but  hourly compensation increased by just 9.2 percent.   Not everyone, however, saw stagnation. The wages of the top 1 percent  of earners grew 138 percent between 1979 and 2013, once again,  according to analysis by the Economic Policy Institute. In that same  time period, the wages of workers in the bottom 10 percent actually  dropped by 5 percent.   In 1965, an average company CEO made 20 times the salary of an  average, nonmanagement worker. In 2014, the average CEO made 303 times  the salary of an average worker.   Many Americans feel that they are working harder than ever, but they  aren't getting ahead. Too often, they are right. They are taking on  more and not getting compensated for the extra effort. We need policies  to help average workers, like increasing the minimum wage, fair pay,  and improvements to the Tax Code to encourage hard work rather than  simply rewarding those who make money off of money.   Is Mr. Mnuchin the right person to address this problem? His  experience is certainly different from that of the average worker. The  son of a Goldman Sachs banker, he has accumulated enough wealth that he  forgot to disclose a hundred million dollars in assets to the Finance  Committee. He has said little about his ideas for tax reform, except  creating what my colleague Senator Wyden has dubbed the  [[Page S1111]]  ``Mnuchin Rule.'' In an interview, Mr. Mnuchin said of tax reform:  ``Any reductions we have in upper-income taxes will be offset by less  deductions, so there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class.''  I would certainly welcome that outcome. Unfortunately, it is totally  inconsistent with the Trump tax plan.   According to Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on  Taxation and Economic Policy, President Trump's tax plan is heavily  weighted to benefit the wealthy, leading to ``a new era of dynastic  wealth.'' A report from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center concluded  that President Trump's plan would ``significantly raise taxes'' for  about 8.5 million families, particularly working single parents. In  contrast, the wealthiest one percent would receive 47 percent--almost  half--of the tax cuts, saving on average $214,000. The 117,000  households in the top 0.1 percent would receive, on average, a whopping  $1.3 million each.   In addition to exacerbating the problem of income inequality, the  Trump tax plan would add $7 trillion to the national debt over the next  decade. It would blow a hole in our Federal budget to give big checks  to the superwealthy, provide limited benefit to the middle class, and  hurt low-income families.   This is entirely backwards. We have learned over and over again that  massive tax cuts for the wealthy do not lead to economic growth for  everyone. Trickle down has never worked. We need to build an economy  that works for everyone, not just the very wealthy. And we certainly  should not be rewarding the wealthy at the expense of everyone else.   Given what little we know of Mr. Mnuchin's policy priorities, we have  to look to his career to determine his experience to carry out the  mission of the Treasury to create economic and job opportunities and  sustain economic growth. Unfortunately, Mr. Mnuchin appears to have had  a canny ability to take advantage of the dire circumstances of others  to benefit himself, particularly in pushing aggressively for  foreclosures at OneWest. It is far from clear that he is willing to now  work on behalf of all Americans and especially those who have been  working harder and receiving no return. I hope to be proven wrong, but  I cannot support his nomination.    Mr. President, I support the nomination of David  Shulkin to be Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.   President Obama nominated Dr. Shulkin, a medical doctor, to be Under  Secretary for Health for the Department of Veterans Affairs and Chief  Executive of the Veterans Health Administration. The Senate confirmed  Dr. Shulkin in June 2015 by a voice vote. Since then, he has led the  VA's health care system, with more than 1,700 care sites and 9 million  veterans using the system each year.   Before joining the VA, Dr. Shulkin served as president and CEO of  Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City and president at Morristown  Medical Center, Goryeb Children's Hospital, and Atlantic Rehabilitation  Institute, and the Atlantic Health System Accountable Care  Organization. Dr. Shulkin also previously served as the chief medical  officer of the University of Pennsylvania Health System, the Hospital  of the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University Hospital, and the  Medical College of Pennsylvania Hospital. He had been chairman of  medicine and vice dean at Drexel University School of Medicine. And Dr.  Shulkin founded and was the chairman and CEO of DoctorQuality, a  consumer-oriented source of information for quality and safety in  health care.   Veterans groups are cautiously optimistic that Dr. Shulkin will  continue to improve the timeliness and quality of medical care our  veterans receive. They are also hopeful that he will begin much-needed  reforms in the administration of veterans' benefits, including the  reform of the appellate review process.   The Department of Veterans Affairs provides important services, care,  and peace of mind for our Nation's 21 million veterans. The VA has more  to do to make sure that the care that it provides is worthy of those  who served our Nation. I believe that Dr. Shulkin's experience and  training has prepared him well to continue that effort, and I support  his nomination.
