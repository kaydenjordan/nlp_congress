 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to compliment Steve Hartman of  CBS News on his recent broadcast centered on the kindness of everyday  Americans.   Practicing kindness in our daily lives is a central part of what  makes America strong. Kindness plays an integral role in building  family and community life and is a bedrock of civil society.   Hartman's CBS News series ``Kindness 101'' shares stories of  compassion, friendship, and everyday acts of kindness.   One story is about a woman in Minneapolis offering free haircuts to  the homeless. Another is about my fellow Ohioans contributing to a  young girl's visual bucket list before she loses her eyesight. These  stories teach us lessons about the unending compassion of the American  people.   Both inspirational and honorable, these stories also serve as a  reminder to Americans. Each of us hold the power to make positive  impacts on the lives of others in our workplaces and community.   Congratulations to Steve for reminding us just how impactful everyday  acts of kindness are on strengthening the United States of America.                            ____________________
