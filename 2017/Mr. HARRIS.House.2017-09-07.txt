 Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Calvert for allowing me time to  discuss an issue that is important to my constituents in Ocean City,  Maryland.   I am proud that Ocean City is home to beautiful beaches and views  and, as a result, a booming tourism industry.   I sought the inclusion of section 438 to respond to concerns of Ocean  City residents regarding the visibility of the proposed wind turbines  offshore. By siting turbines within 24 nautical miles from the  shoreline, I am concerned that our beach economy and tourist experience  will be compromised. I believe every effort must be made to minimize  the impact of this project on the Ocean City view shed.   This large scale project requires full consideration of the needs and  opinions of the local community. I look forward to working with my  colleagues to develop a practical solution to this challenge.
