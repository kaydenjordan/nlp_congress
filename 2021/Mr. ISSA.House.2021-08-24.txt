 Madam Speaker, our colleague Rahm Emanuel famously said:  ``You never let a serious crisis go to waste.'' Today, my Democratic  colleagues are not letting a serious crisis go to waste.   While America is focused on the tragedy halfway around the world in  Afghanistan, a plan to fail that now has successfully failed, the  reality is, here, instead of holding real hearings, looking at the  causes, and maybe, in fact, being more helpful in preventing further  suffering of the 37 million people  [[Page H4399]]  in Afghanistan, what are we doing? We are codifying a permanent  majority of the Democratic Party everywhere they can. We are making  changes to election law that pull into Washington and into the Attorney  General's office control of elections that the Constitution clearly  gave to legislatures.   What we are doing, by the statements of my own colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, is we are clearly saying we don't like the  Supreme Court's decisions, so we are going to find a way to do what we  want to do even though, in fact, the time and the success of the Civil  Rights Act has, in fact, mostly passed.   Why can't you take success? Because it no longer benefits the goals  of a permanent Democratic majority. I am sorry for my Democratic  colleagues that, in fact, the people of America do not at times approve  of things like the tragedy in Afghanistan or, in fact, are not willing  to accept a permanent smear of we can never have elections without  Federal intervention.
