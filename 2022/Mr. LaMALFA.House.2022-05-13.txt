 Madam Speaker, the Biden energy crisis doesn't just  extend to gas and diesel in this country. It also extends to our power  grid, shutting down our hydroelectric plants, et cetera.   We also have in California a nuclear power plant known as Diablo  Canyon, which produces just under 10 percent of all of our power in  California, slated to be shut down in 2024.   The California Independent System Operator warns of a critical  inflection point to the stability of the grid and would require a shift  to--get this--more fossil fuel, which would then require more  CO2 to be produced, even though we know CO2 is  only 0.04 percent of the atmosphere.   Summer blackouts were predicted by the California Energy Commission  and the ISO just last October in information they released, so this  would make a greater reliance on imported electricity from other  States.   The Biden administration needs to do all it can to help have the NRC,  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission renew the licenses for Diablo Canyon for at least 20 years.                            ____________________
