 Madam Speaker, I rise today to mark National  Emergency Nurses Week and to honor the contributions of Anita Dorr.   Anita was an emergency room nurse at the Erie County Medical Center  in Buffalo, New York. She observed that emergency rooms could do better  in the many types of crises coming through emergency room doors.   She developed the crash cart, which has drawers that contain  defibrillators, life-supporting drugs, and other essential items for  crisis care. The crash cart is now universally used in medical settings  around the world and has saved countless lives.   Anita also cofounded the Emergency Nurses Association to advocate for  nurses and support their training across America.   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring emergency nurses as well  as Anita Dorr's lasting contributions to the medical field and to my  community.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, the Republican Party is, in  fact, the party of debt and deficit. Ronald Reagan, a Republican, grew  the deficit to $152 billion. Bush 1, a Republican, grew that deficit to  $290 billion. President Clinton, a Democrat, wiped out the entirety of  the deficit and gave $128 billion surplus to Bush 2, a Republican, who  turned that $128 billion surplus into a $1.4 trillion deficit. Obama, a  Democrat, cut the Bush deficit of $1.4 trillion to $600 billion, from  which Trump, a Republican, grew that deficit to $1 trillion.   Over the past 60 years, Democrats have created 21 million more jobs  than Republicans. Annual economic growth is almost double. The  Democratic Party continues the clean up the mess that the Republicans  have made. And the Republicans are running away from the mess that they  are responsible for.
