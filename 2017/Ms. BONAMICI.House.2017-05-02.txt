 Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, too many workers in Oregon  and across the country are still facing a great deal of economic  uncertainty. They worry about rent payments, healthcare costs, saving  for retirement, balancing family responsibilities and work, and making  ends meet.   Congress should be considering policy changes that support workers,  not a bill that threatens their economic security. This bill takes away  overtime pay and, instead, a workers gets a vague IOU for compensatory  time sometime in the future, and only if the comp time does not unduly  disrupt the operations of the employer--whatever that means.   I would like to share the story of Anjeanette. She said:         I work as a waitress in a restaurant in Gresham, Oregon,       that is part of a large chain. I have three children. I have       never had a single paid sick day. A few years ago, when I was       working in construction, I sprained my ankle badly and       couldn't go to work for a week. I didn't have any paid sick       days, so I lost a whole week's pay, which meant I wasn't able       to pay all of my bills and I wasn't able to pay for gas.    Anjeanette is a single mother of three sons who also struggles to  care for them when they get sick. In fact, when her youngest got the  flu, her older son had to stay home from school to care for him.   In May and June, we celebrate Mother's Day and Father's Day. This is  a perfect time for Congress to focus on legislation that allows parents  like Anjeanette to be more present in their kid's lives and still pay  their bills.   Instead, this legislation would result in taking their overtime pay  from their pockets. The so-called Working Families Flexibility Act is  not a solution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation.
