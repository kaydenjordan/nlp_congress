 Mr. President, if the Senator from Utah has concluded  his remarks, I would like to say a word or two.   We have just passed in the Senate a bill that is named the Orrin G.  Hatch Music Modernization Act. It was an amendment I had offered to the  bill, not Senator Hatch's amendment. He is the principal sponsor of the  bill, along with Senator Whitehouse and 82 Members of this body, but I  ask that it be named in his honor. It is fitting because it is the most  important piece of legislation in a generation to help make sure  songwriters in our country are paid and are paid a fair market value  for their work. It is fitting because Senator Hatch is a songwriter  himself and has long been an advocate for musicians. So I can think of  no better way to memorialize his four decades of service in the U.S.  Senate than by renaming this legislation the Orrin G. Hatch Music  Modernization Act.   Under his leadership, as I just mentioned, the bill gained nearly  unanimous support in the Senate. It passed in the House earlier. After  its having been thoroughly vetted and compromised and changed, it  passed unanimously. It went to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where it  was considered and passed by voice vote. Then, tonight, it passed by  voice vote.   I join with Senator Hatch in especially thanking the other Senators  who have worked so hard on this, both Democrats as well as  Republicans--Senator Whitehouse; Senator Durbin, the Assistant  Democratic Leader, who enjoys going to Nashville on a regular basis and  has lots of good stories about it; and Senator Coons of Delaware.   The bill, which passed the House unanimously and has now passed the  Senate, will go back to the House because we have made some changes in  the bill. That is the way the process works. We have stayed in close  touch with the House of Representatives as we have done this.  Representative Doug Collins and a number of others in the House have  been really extraordinary leaders in pushing this, so I  [[Page S6260]]  know Representative Collins and others will work hard. My hope is, the  House will be able to pass the Senate's bill next week and that the  bill will then go to the President and become law.   Earlier this evening, Senator Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, was on the  floor, but he had to leave. I join Senator Hatch in thanking Senator  Grassley, who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for having  expedited the consideration of this bill and for having been here to  speak about it.   Senator Grassley asked me to read these words on his behalf:         The Music Modernization Act will really help songwriters,       artists, publishers, producers, distributors, and other music       industry stakeholders. This bill is the product of long and       hard negotiations and compromise. Senators Hatch and       Alexander especially--but many other Senators--contributed to       this bill. I am pleased to support this bill.    One reason this bill has been successful--and one of the senior  members of the staff of the Judiciary Committee was talking to me  tonight and said it was a really remarkable piece of legislation--is  that it touches so many of the aspects of the creation of music in our  country. I think that is true. It is a very complex piece of  legislation.   I asked some of those who were working on it the other day: Will this  really help the songwriters? The answer was: Yes, it will.   We have been able to get so far because the songwriters and the  publishers and the digital music companies and the broadcasters and the  record labels and others decided to work together over the last 2 or 3  years on what they agree on instead of on what they disagree. It has  taken several years to do this, but I believe it has been worth the  effort.   What has happened is that the internet has changed the music business  in the way it has changed politics, other businesses, and the world.  More than half the revenues in the music business now come from music  that is played over the internet. The legislation is necessary because  the copyright laws of our country haven't kept up with the arrival of  the internet. In addition to that, they were way out of date before the  internet ever got here. Those copyright laws haven't been modernized  since the days of the player piano a century ago. As a result of that,  today's songwriters are often not paid royalties for their songs when  their songs are played online, and when they are paid, they aren't paid  a fair market value. It has become almost impossible for songwriters to  make a decent living. Songwriters in Nashville--and we have them all  over Tennessee, but Nashville has thousands of them--are typically taxi  drivers, teachers, waitresses who are all working to write their first  hits.   Last Saturday, I was at the Bluebird Cafe, in Nashville, where  Senator Hatch has been before. Bob DiPiero was there and was playing  some of his songs. He told a story of how, in the 1980s, he was  teaching guitar lessons at the Rivergate Mall. That is how he was  earning a living. He had moved to Nashville from Ohio and had fallen in  love with country music. He said he would take a bus out to the  Rivergate Mall--that took about an hour and an hour back--to teach  these kids in the afternoons, after school, from 3 to 9 o'clock. During  the day, he would write songs. Nothing happened until he wrote a song  called ``American Made,'' which almost everybody knows the words to,  and that song has done pretty well.   To give you an idea of what this bill could mean to most songwriters,  let me tell you a story. I mentioned that songwriters can be taxi  drivers or teachers or waitresses. They can also be U.S. Senators, like  Senator Hatch, who actually has a gold record--maybe two--to his  credit, and he has often cowritten with national songwriters. I had an  experience too.   A few years ago, I was in my hometown of Maryville, TN. I went into  the drugstore, and as I was coming out, there was this older couple who  was sitting in a pickup truck.   I asked: How are y'all doing?   The woman in the pickup truck said: We are just falling apart  together.   It just so happened that over that weekend, my son, who is in the  music business, had a group of songwriters at our home, and they were  writing songs. So I told that story about the lady saying ``falling  apart together'' to one of them whose name was Lee Brice, who is a  well-known songwriter and performer.   Lee Brice said: Hey, we can do something with that.   So he and Billy Montana and John Stone wrote the song ``Falling Apart  Together.''   ``Falling Apart Together'' went on Lee Brice's album, and it was  played a lot. According to Nashville's custom, I get a one-fourth  royalty for the song whenever the song is played. Now, Lee is a pretty  well-known singer, and you would think those royalties would add up to  give me a nice income in addition to my salary as a U.S. Senator. I  checked. In 2016, I reported on my ethics form, which I file each year,  that my royalties only added up to $101.75. That was for one-fourth of  a record that was played on an album of a pretty well-known singer and  writer.   If you are a songwriter in Nashville or anywhere else, you can't make  a living on that, but the Orrin G. Hatch Music Modernization Act will  help to fix that. It will help to make sure songwriters are paid a fair  market value when their songs are played and that they are actually  paid when their songs are played.   First, the legislation will make sure songwriters are paid by  creating a new entity. This is really an elegant solution to a  complicated problem. This new licensing entity will make it easier for  digital music companies like Spotify or Amazon or Pandora to obtain  licenses. Let's say they want to play ``Falling Apart Together.'' All  they will have to do is go down to the entity and get a license from  that entity to make sure the four of us who helped to write that song  will be paid whenever the song is played. This can be a big problem for  one of the internet companies because they deal in hundreds of  thousands--millions--of songs, and songwriters end up everywhere in the  world. So finding them is sometimes impossible. That is not good for  the songwriter who doesn't get paid. It is not good for the streaming  company because it might get sued.   As I said earlier, half of the revenues in the music industry come  from internet songs. This new entity will collect the royalties each  time a song is played. It will look for the songwriter and hold onto  the royalties for 3 years until the songwriter can be found. As I  mentioned, it will help the digital music companies because it will  reduce the number of lawsuits and make it a lot simpler to get a  license for a song.   Second, the legislation will make sure that songwriters will be paid  a fair market value for their songs by doing three things.   First, it will revise outdated songwriter royalty standards. As I  mentioned earlier, go back a century to the days of the player piano.  It will replace those with a standard of willing seller and willing  buyer. What would the song be worth in the free market, not as to the  statutory rate that is set today?   The second thing the legislation will do is to allow ASCAP and BMI-- the two largest performing rights organizations--to present new  evidence about the fair market value of a songwriter's work--like what  the performer of the song might earn for performing the song--to a  Federal rate court judge when there is a dispute about what the  royalties are.   Finally, the third thing it will do to make sure songwriters are paid  a fairer rate is to allow ASCAP and BMI to have Federal judges in the  Southern District of New York, which is where these cases are heard, to  be randomly assigned to the cases rather than to have all of the  proceedings before the same judge. We believe that will produce a  fairer outcome for songwriters.   This is a big day for songwriters in Nashville and in Memphis and in  Knoxville, TN, as well as all over the country. It is the most  important piece of legislation in a generation that will help make sure  songwriters will be, A, paid when their songs are played and, B, that  songwriters will be paid a fair market value.   I thank Senator Hatch for his leadership on this. Because he led this  effort and because of his prestige in the Senate, we have 82 cosponsors  of the legislation. We were able to pass it by voice vote tonight after  it went through the Judiciary Committee.   I would not want anyone to think that because it passed by such a  wide  [[Page S6261]]  margin that this was a simple exercise. It was a very complicated  exercise, and it was in doubt until about an hour and a half ago in  terms of whether we would be able to do this tonight. Yet we wouldn't  have been able to have done it without Senator Hatch, so I thank him.   I think it is fitting, as he retires this year after spending four  decades in the Senate, that we name the most important piece of  legislation to help songwriters in a generation after the Senate's  songwriter, that being the Orrin G. Hatch Music Modernization Act.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his  remarks. I think we both would feel remiss if we didn't properly  acknowledge all of the Senators and especially all of the staff members  who have put in such long hours and used such professionalism to help  with this. We will come back to the floor next week and do that  properly.   Lindsay Garcia is here with me, as well as Paul McKernan and David  Cleary. I see Senator Hatch's staff is on the floor, some from the  Finance Committee. I want to make sure that we do a complete job of  acknowledging their highly professional work in this complex and  important piece of legislation. As I said, it is the most important  piece of legislation in a generation to help make sure that American  songwriters are paid fairly for their work.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn to then convene for pro  forma session only, with no business being conducted, on Thursday,  September 20, at 3 p.m. I further ask that when the Senate adjourns on  Thursday, September 20, it next convene at 3 p.m., Monday, September  24, and that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, and the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day;  further, that the Senate be in a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, until  5:30 p.m., and that then, at 5:30 p.m., the Senate proceed to the  consideration of the Wolcott nomination under the previous order;  finally, that notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture motions filed  during today's session ripen following disposition of the Wolcott  nomination.
