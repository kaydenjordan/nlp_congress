 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk to refer the  resolution to the Committee on Ethics.    Mr. Speaker, I was one of the first Members of this  body to call on the subject of this resolution to resign. I am  personally in favor of this individual's expulsion from this House.   Regrettably, however, I am of the understanding that we currently do  not have the two-thirds support from Members of this House to expel  that individual.   I believe that this individual is a stain on this institution, a  stain on the State of New York, a stain on Long Island, and a stain on  the beloved Nassau County.   With that said, I believe this resolution should be referred to the  Committee on Ethics to ensure a thorough and expedient investigation  into this matter. I firmly believe this is the quickest way of ridding  the House of Representatives of this scourge on government.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the motion to refer.   The previous question was ordered.    Madam Speaker, as we are in the midst of National  Police Week, on Thursday, riding bicycles with the Capitol Police and  Speaker McCarthy, from the steps of the Capitol Building to the  National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, I couldn't help but think  back to the day when I took the oath to become a member of the New York  City Police Department.   Upon my many visits to the National Law Enforcement Officers  Memorial, I think back to the inscription underneath the lion that  says: ``It is not how these officers died that made them heroes, it is  how they lived.''   Madam Speaker, I recognize the heroes that were added to the wall  from my district, representing the Nassau County Police Department:  Hector Nunez, Matt Perlungher, Charles Vroom, IV, and Robert Negri.  Their families were here on Capitol Hill this week to watch as their  loved ones were added to the wall.   Madam Speaker, we are reminded each day that it wasn't how they died  that made them heroes, it was how they lived.                            ____________________
