 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and neighbor for yielding.   I rise today in fierce opposition to H.R. 3755, the Women's Health  Protection Act of 2021. The goal of this bill is not to protect the  health of women, but rather, to remove all barriers standing in the way  of murdering millions of innocent babies.   This deceptively-named legislation would be more accurately entitled  the abortion on demand until birth act.   Once again, the Democrat Party has pathetically caved to the demands  of the far left.   This bill will not only legalize abortion on demand for any reason,  it will make it available at any time during the pregnancy.   By nullifying State regulations, this radical bill will eliminate any  prohibitions on sex-selection abortions, late-term abortions, and  abortions based on Down syndrome or another genetic diagnosis.   The Democrats know that their pro-abortion agenda does not align with  the views of most Americans.   They know that when given a choice, more than 75 percent of Americans  support some limitations on abortion.   Knowing this, it is too risky for them to leave the choice to the  people and to the State legislatures that represent them. Instead,  Democrats vote to impose their will at all costs.   We cannot, and I will not, remain silent while Democrats play  abhorrent political games with the lives of our most vulnerable  citizens. I will never stop fighting to protect the unborn and stand  firm in my opposition to this heinous legislation.
