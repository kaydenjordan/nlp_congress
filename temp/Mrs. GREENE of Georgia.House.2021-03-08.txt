 Mr. Speaker, on International Women's Day, I  would like to discuss the Equality Act.   The Equality Act has completely destroyed women's rights. It has  taken away women's rights in sports. It has completely canceled women,  and I think it is a terrible thing that has happened to the women in  America who have come so far.   Our grandmothers and mothers worked so hard to achieve our rights,  and now with the passage of the Equality Act, they have put men in our  little girls' bathrooms, sports locker rooms, playing fields, and seem  to care less about women's rights whatsoever.   They have also completely destroyed religious freedoms and violated  our freedoms and rights in every single way.   The Equality Act is atrocious and evil. It completely erases gender.  God created us male and female in His image. He created us.   Women deserve their rights. We deserve our sports. We deserve our  privacy and should not have the invasion of biological men in any of  these areas.                            ____________________
