 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for  his remarks. He reminds me of something former Majority Leader Tom  Daschle told us one morning at the Prayer Breakfast. He said that after  World War II, Archibald MacLeish, who was the poet laureate of the  United States, said of the veterans who came back from the war--when  talking to Members of the Senate, he said: They gave us our country.  Now it is up to us to see that we can do something with it.   I think we need to always remember that challenge and opportunity  that we have.                             The Jackson Magnolia    Mr. President, some disappointing news arrived last month. The White  House announced that the Andrew Jackson magnolia is sick and dying and  that part of it had to be removed. On December 27, the east leader,  which is a top section of a tree, was removed. The other leader of the  Jackson magnolia is still intact, but it is supported by a cabling  system. The part that was removed will eventually be replaced with a  seedling from the original tree.   When President Trump visited the Hermitage outside Nashville in March  of last year and laid a wreath at Andrew Jackson's tomb, he likely  walked past trees that were also seedlings from the Jackson magnolia.   The news of the Jackson magnolia has special significance for  Tennesseans and for several Tennessee families, including our own.   Shortly after his arrival at the White House in 1829, Jackson, who  was our seventh President, planted a magnolia seedling in honor of his  wife Rachel, who had died only weeks earlier. During the Presidential  campaign, Rachel had been so maligned about the legitimacy of her  marriage to Jackson that she had said: ``I would rather be a doorkeeper  in the House of God than live in that palace at Washington.''   The seedling that Jackson planted came from a magnolia at the  Hermitage, the couple's home outside Nashville. Over the years, it grew  into a magnificent, sprawling specimen, reaching the roof of the White  House at the South Portico.   Take a look at the back of the twenty-dollar bill--the one in your  billfold or wallet or purse, the one with President Jackson on the  front, and you will see the Jackson magnolia, along with another  magnolia planted later to supplement it.   The Washington Post detailed some of the tree's history when the news  was announced. Here is what the Post said:         Long after Jackson left office, his magnolia remained.       Other trees were planted to supplement it, and the tree       became a fixture in White House events. Herbert Hoover       reportedly took breakfast and held Cabinet meetings at a       table beneath its sprawling branches. Franklin Delano       Roosevelt spoke with Winston Churchill in its shade. Richard       Nixon strode past it as he left the White House for the last       time after his resignation. In 1994, a Maryland man piloting       a stolen plane clipped the tree before suffering a deadly       crash against the White House wall.    Some said it might have saved President Bill Clinton's life.         No tree on the White House grounds can reveal so many       secrets of romance and history, longtime White House butler       Alonzo Fields once told the Associated Press.    The Jackson magnolia itself may be dying, but its children and  grandchildren and even its great-grandchildren will live on.   In 1988, President Ronald Reagan presented a cutting of the Jackson  magnolia to Howard H. Baker, Jr.--a former majority leader of this  Senate--when Baker retired as Reagan's chief of staff. Baker planted  that cutting at his home in Huntsville, TN.   Six years later, in 1994, Baker was lunching at his home with John  Rice Irwin, founder of the Museum of Appalachia in Norris, TN. Irwin  noticed the tree, which by then had grown to a height of 18 feet. Baker  told Norris the story of the Jackson magnolia and, with the help of the  University of Tennessee College of Agriculture, arranged for two  cuttings from Baker's magnolia to be rooted and sent to John Rice  Irwin.   In 1995, Senator Baker presided at a formal ceremony at the Museum of  Appalachia when those two cuttings--the grandchildren of the White  House Jackson magnolia--were presented to the Museum of Appalachia.  They are planted in front of the museum's Hall of Fame.   In 1996, John Rice Irwin gave a cutting from the Museum of Appalachia  magnolia to my wife Honey and me. We planted this great-grandchild of  the White House magnolia in front of our home outside Maryville, TN.  Today, it is 80 feet tall.   In 1998, a tornado destroyed the original magnolia at the Hermitage,  from which the White House Jackson magnolia had been taken. At the  request of Hermitage officials, the Museum of Appalachia provided a  cutting from the museum magnolia to replace the original tree. It was  presented at a ceremony presided over by Lewis Donelson, III, the  descendent of John Donelson, Rachel Jackson's father. Senator Baker and  John Rice Irwin attended.   According to the Museum of Appalachia, five cuttings have been  successfully propagated from the museum magnolia. In 2009, John Rice  Irwin gave my wife and me a second cutting from  [[Page S230]]  the museum magnolia, which is planted at our home in Blount County. We,  in turn, have given cuttings to Graham and Cindy Hunter in Knoxville  and to Denise and Steve Smith of Franklin. Their trees are growing tall  in the Tennessee soil from which the Jackson magnolia came 180 years  ago.   While we commemorate the long and prominent life of the Jackson  magnolia, we can also look forward to long lives from its grandchildren  and great-grandchildren now planted at the Museum of Appalachia in  Norris, at a city park in Sevier County, and at the Hermitage and other  homes in Tennessee.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the article from the Washington Post dated December 26, describing the  history of the Jackson magnolia.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, Dec. 26, 2017]      White House To Cut Back Magnolia Tree Planted by Andrew Jackson                             (By Sarah Kaplan)         The White House cut down part of the aging historic       magnolia tree planted by former president Andrew Jackson on       Dec. 27. Here's a bit of the tree's history.        The enormous magnolia tree stood watch by the South Portico       of the White House for nearly two centuries. Its dark green,       glossy leaves shaded politicians and heads of state. Its       ivory flowers bloomed through times of peace and war. It is       the oldest tree on the White House grounds, a witness to       Easter egg rolls and state ceremonies, a resignation, a plane       crash, all the tumult and triumph of 39 presidencies.        But the iconic magnolia is now too old and badly damaged to       remain in place, the White House announced Tuesday. At the       recommendation of specialists from the National Arboretum,       first lady Melania Trump called for a large portion of the       tree to be removed this week.        The decision, first reported by CNN, comes after decades of       attempts to hold the aged tree up with a steel pole and       cables. Arboretum experts said that rigging is now       compromised and that the wood of the magnolia's trunk is too       delicate for further interventions. Any other tree in that       condition would have been cut down years ago.        But this is not any other tree. According to White House       lore, the stately evergreen was brought to Washington as a       seedling by Andrew Jackson. The magnolia was a favorite tree       of his wife, Rachel, who had died just days after he was       elected. Jackson blamed the vicious campaign--during which       his political opponents questioned the legitimacy of his       marriage for his wife's untimely death.        The new planting, which came from the couple's Tennessee       farm, the Hermitage, would serve as a living monument to her       in the place she despised; before her death, Rachel had       reportedly said, ``I would rather be a doorkeeper in the       house of God than live in that palace at Washington.''        Long after Jackson left office, his magnolia remained.       Other trees were planted to supplement it, and the tree       became a fixture in White House events. Herbert Hoover       reportedly took breakfast and held Cabinet meetings at a       table beneath its sprawling branches. Franklin Delano       Roosevelt spoke with Winston Churchill in its shade.        Richard Nixon strode past it as he left the White House for       the last time after his resignation. In 1994, a Maryland man       piloting a stolen plane clipped the tree before suffering a       deadly crash against the White House wall. And for decades,       the magnolia was featured on the back of the $20 bill.        ``No tree on the White House grounds can reveal so many       secrets of romance and history,'' longtime White House butler       Alonzo Fields once told the Associated Press.        In 2006, when the National Park Service initiated a       ``Witness Tree Protection Program'' to study historically and       biologically important trees in the Washington area, the       Jackson magnolia was at the top of the program's list. By       then, the tree was tall enough to reach the White House's       second-story windows and had already eclipsed the minimum       life expectancy for its species--about 150 years.        According to a report from the NPS program, workers       attempted to repair a gash in the tree in the 1940s. But       within a few decades, much of the interior portion of the       tree had decayed, leaving behind a ``rind'' of brittle wood.       Those surviving portions were held in place by a 30-foot pole       and guy-wires. ``It is doubtful that without this external       support the specimen would long survive,'' the report said.        Ultimately, those measures could not allay safety concerns       about the tree, said White House spokeswoman Stephanie       Grisham. Visitors and members of the press are frequently       standing right in front of the magnolia when the president       departs on Marine One; the high winds from the helicopter       could make a limb collapse more likely.        Keith Pitchford, a D.C.-based certified arborist, is       familiar with the Jackson magnolia but has not professionally       assessed it. He wondered whether the removal may be       premature: ``If you can lower the tree and make it a bit more       squat, it really prolongs the life of these trees we thought       were hazardous,'' he said.        According to Grisham, the first lady requested that wood       from the magnolia be preserved and seedlings be made       available for a possible replanting in the same area.        Already, progeny of the historic tree are thriving in other       spots nationwide. It's said that Lyndon B. Johnson had a       seedling from the magnolia planted outside a friend's home in       Texas so that when Lady Bird stayed there she could look out       the window and imagine the president at work in the White       House. Ronald Reagan gifted a cutting to chief of staff       Howard Baker Jr. for his retirement in 1988. Then first lady       Michelle Obama donated a seedling to the U.S. Department of       Agriculture's ``people's garden'' in 2009.        Jackson's original magnolia at the Hermitage was destroyed       along with hundreds of other trees during a devastating       tornado in the late 1990s. It was ultimately replaced by new       trees donated from the Museum of Appalachia in Norris, Tenn.       According to Michael Grantham, gardens manager for the       Hermitage, staff always said that those trees were clones of       the White House magnolia--but without an identifying label,       no one knew for sure. So Grantham sent tissue samples to a       plant genetics lab at Cornell University.        ``It was not an exact match,'' he said. ``What we got was       probably seedlings from underneath the tree.''        Someday, Grantham would like to bring a cutting, or an       exact clone, of the White House magnolia back to the       Hermitage. ``I know there are some out there,'' he said. In       those trees, Jackson's two-century-old tribute lives on.     Mr. President, I yield the floor.
