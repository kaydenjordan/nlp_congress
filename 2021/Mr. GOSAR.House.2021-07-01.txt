 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the chairman of the U.S.  Slovenia Friendship Caucus to commemorate today, July 1, as the first  day of the Slovenia's presidency of the Council of the European Union.   Slovenia takes the helm of one of the EU's main decisionmaking bodies  at a challenging time not just for the EU, but for the world at large.  Slovenia will manage a Europe working to control the COVID pandemic,  seeking to repair the economic and social damage from this virus; all  the while dealing with the ongoing and critical issues with the EU and  the U.S., such as countering Chinese and Russian influence, bolstering  cybersecurity, and charting an economic path for the future.   As Slovenia begins its 6-month presidency, it is doing so under the  slogan, ``Together. Resilient. Europe,'' which outlines an agenda where  Slovenia seeks to facilitate the European recovery while also  reflecting on Europe's future, strengthening the rule of law and  European values, and increasing security and stability in the European  neighborhood.   Slovenia officials have also made their intentions known to Balkanize  the EU through engaging Western Balkan states which have yet been able  to join.   Slovenia's presidential platform makes it clear they are up to the  unique challenge. The challenge is not just recovering from a once-in- a-generation pandemic, but thinking strategically to promote a more  resilient Europe in the future.   I wish our strong friend and ally, Slovenia, all the best.                            ____________________
