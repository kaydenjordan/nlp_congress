 Madam President, I rise today to introduce two bills  aimed at continuing the important progress we are making to prevent and  effectively treat Alzheimer's disease. I know how devastating this  disease is to our families. My father, grandfather, and two uncles all  died from Alzheimer's. I am committed to this effort both as a person  whose beloved family members have suffered from this terrible disease,  as well as a Senator concerned about the impact on our families and our  healthcare system.   When I founded the Congressional Alzheimer's Task Force in the Senate  in 1999, there was virtually no focus on Alzheimer's in Washington.  Twelve years ago, I coauthored the bipartisan National Alzheimer's  Project Act with my colleague Senator Evan Bayh. Before we passed that  legislation, there was no coordinated, strategic, national plan to  focus our efforts to defeat Alzheimer's. NAPA fixed this by convening a  panel of experts to create a coordinated strategic national plan to  prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025. The expert  council updates the plan annually.   While the 2025 goal has been elusive, we have made some progress in  our efforts to find a treatment and a means of prevention.  Nevertheless, Alzheimer's remains the fifth leading cause of death in  the United States for people over 65. In addition to the human costs,  caring for people living with Alzheimer's and other dementias is one of  the costliest conditions to society, costing our Nation an astonishing  $321 billion per year, including $206 billion in Medicare and Medicaid  spending. If we continue along this trajectory, Alzheimer's is  projected to claim the minds of 12.7 million seniors and nearly surpass  $1 trillion in annual costs by 2050.   It takes a tremendous toll on families too. In 2021, family  caregivers provided 16 billion hours of unpaid care for loved ones with  dementia, a contribution to society valued at more than $271 billion.  That job is often 24/7 and often harms the health of the caregiver.   The first bill I am introducing today with my colleagues Senators  Warner, Capito, Markey, Moran, Menendez, Murkowski, and Stabenow is the  NAPA Reauthorization Act. This bill would reauthorize the National  Alzheimer's Project Act through 2035 and modernize the legislation to  reflect strides we have made in understanding the disease, such as  including a new focus on promoting healthy aging and reducing risk  factors. The National Alzheimer's Project Act is set to expire in 2025.  We need to reauthorize this critical legislation this Congress in order  to ensure that our research investments remain coordinated and there  are no disruptions as we maximize the impact of our investments.   The second bill I am introducing with my colleagues Senators Markey,  Capito, Warner, Moran, Menendez, Murkowski, and Stabenow is the  Alzheimer's Accountability and Investment Act. This bill would continue  through 2035 a requirement that the Director of the National Institutes  of Health submit an annual budget to Congress estimating the funding  necessary for NIH to fully implement NAPA's research goals. Only two  other areas of biomedical research--cancer and HIV/AIDs--have been the  subject of special budget development aimed at speeding discovery, and  this ``bypass budget,'' as it is known, helps us to understand what  additional funding is needed to find better treatments, a means of  prevention, and ultimately a cure for Alzheimer's disease.   Nearly half of baby boomers reaching age 85 will either be afflicted  with Alzheimer's or caring for someone who has it. In many ways,  Alzheimer's is the defining disease of this generation. We have made  tremendous progress in recent years to boost funding for Alzheimer's  research, most recently providing $3.74 billion--a $226 million  increase--for NIH Alzheimer's research in the fiscal year 2023  government funding bill. This investment holds  [[Page S151]]  great promise to ending this disease that has had such a devastating  effect on millions of Americans and their families, but we must keep up  this momentum. The two bills I introduce today will make sure that we  do not take our foot off the pedal just as our investments in basic  research are beginning to translate into potential new treatments. We  must not let Alzheimer's define our children's generation as it has  ours.   I urge my colleagues to support the NAPA Reauthorization Act and  Alzheimer's Accountability and Investment Act, and I thank the  Alzheimer's Association and UsAgainstAlzheimer's for their support of  this bipartisan legislation to help improve the lives of those affected  by Alzheimer's throughout the country.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to introduce two bills  aimed at continuing the important progress we are making to prevent and  effectively treat Alzheimer's disease.
