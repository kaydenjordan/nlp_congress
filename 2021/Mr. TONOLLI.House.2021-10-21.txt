Mr. Stephen K. Bannon      c/o Mr. Robert J.

The Select Committee is investigating the facts,       circumstances, and causes of the January 6th attack and       issues relating to the peaceful transfer of power, in order       to identify and evaluate lessons learned and to recommend to       the House and its relevant committees corrective laws,       policies, procedures, rules, or regulations. This inquiry       includes examination of how various individuals and entities       coordinated their activities leading up to the events of       January 6, 2021,        The Select Committee has reason to believe that you have       information relevant to understanding important activities       that led to and informed the events at the Capitol on January       6, 2021. For example, you have been identified as present at       the Willard Hotel on January 5, 2021, during an effort to       persuade Members of Congress to block the certification of       the election the next day, and in relation to other       activities on January 6.\1\ You are also described as       communicating with then-President Trump on December 30, 2020,       and potentially other occasions, urging him to plan for and       focus his efforts on January 6.\2\ Moreover, you are quoted       as stating, on January 5, 2021, that ``[a]ll hell is going to       break loose tomorrow.'' \3\ Accordingly, the Select Committee       seeks both documents and your deposition testimony regarding       these and multiple other matters that are within the scope of       the Select Committee's inquiry.        A copy of the rules governing Select Committee depositions,       and a copy of document production definitions and       instructions are attached. Please contact staff for the       Select Committee at 202-225-7800 to arrange for the       production of documents.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                                                          Chairman.      ------       \1\ E.g., Bob Woodward & Robert Costa, Peril at 233 (2021).      \2\ Id. at 207.

[From the Congressional Record--House, Page H41, Jan. 4, 2021]       * * * health, safety, and well-being of others present in the       Chamber and surrounding areas. Members and staff will not be       permitted to enter the Hall of the House without wearing a       mask. Masks will be available at the entry points for any       Member who forgets to bring one. The Chair views the failure       to wear a mask as a serious breach of decorum. The Sergeant-      at-Arms is directed to enforce this policy. Based upon the       health and safety guidance from the attending physician and       the Sergeant-at-Arms, the Chair would further advise that all       Members should leave the Chamber promptly after casting their       votes. Furthermore, Members should avoid congregating in the       rooms leading to the Chamber, including the Speaker's lobby.       The Chair will continue the practice of providing small       groups of Members with a minimum of 5 minutes within which to       cast their votes. Members are encouraged to vote with their       previously assigned group. After voting, Members must clear       the Chamber to allow the next group a safe and sufficient       opportunity to vote. It is essential for the health and       safety of Members, staff, and the U.S. Capitol Police to       consistently practice social distancing and to ensure that a       safe capacity be maintained in the Chamber at all times. To       that end, the Chair appreciates the cooperation of Members       and staff in preserving order and decorum in the Chamber and       in displaying respect and safety for one another by wearing a       mask and practicing social distancing. All announced       policies, including those addressing decorum in debate and       the conduct of votes by electronic device, shall be carried       out in harmony with this policy during the pendency of a       covered period.                                  ______                                           117TH CONGRESS REGULATIONS FOR USE OF DEPOSITION AUTHORITY                                                 Committee on Rules,                                        House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, January 4, 2021.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Madam Speaker: Pursuant to section 3(b) of House Resolution       8, 117th Congress, I hereby submit the following regulations       regarding the conduct of depositions by committee and select       committee counsel for printing in the Congressional Record.            Sincerely,                                                 James P. McGovern,                                      Chairman, Committee on Rules.              Regulations for the Use of Deposition Authority         1. Notices for the taking of depositions shall specify the       date, time, and place of examination. Depositions shall be       taken under oath administered by a member or a person       otherwise authorized to administer oaths. Depositions may       continue from day to day.        2. Consultation with the ranking minority member shall       include three days' notice before any deposition is taken.       All members of the committee shall also receive three days       written notice that a deposition will be taken, except in       exigent circumstances. For purposes of these procedures, a       day shall not include Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays       except when the House is in session on such a day.        3. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by       personal, nongovernmental counsel to advise them of their       rights. Only members, committee staff designated by the chair       or ranking minority member, an official reporter, the       witness, and the witness's counsel are permitted to attend.       Observers or counsel for other persons, including counsel for       government agencies, may not attend.        4. The chair of the committee noticing the deposition may       designate that deposition as part of a joint investigation       between committees, and in that case, provide notice to the       members of the committees. If such a designation is made, the       chair and ranking minority member of the additional       committee(s) may designate committee staff to attend pursuant       to regulation 3. Members and designated staff of the       committees may attend and ask questions as set forth below.        5. A deposition shall be conducted by any member or       committee counsel designated by the chair or ranking minority       member of the Committee that noticed the deposition. When       depositions are conducted by committee counsel, there shall       be no more than two committee counsel permitted to question a       witness per round. One of the committee counsel shall be       designated by the chair and the other by the ranking minority       member per round.        6. Deposition questions shall be propounded in rounds. The       length of each round shall not exceed 60 minutes per side,       and shall provide equal time to the majority and the       minority. In each round, the member(s) or committee counsel       designated by the chair shall ask questions first, and the       member(s) or committee counsel designated by the ranking       minority member shall ask questions second.        7. Objections must be stated concisely and in a non-      argumentative and non-suggestive manner. A witness's counsel       may not instruct a witness to refuse to answer a question,       except to preserve a privilege. In the event of professional,       ethical, or other misconduct by the witness's counsel during       the deposition, the Committee may take any appropriate       disciplinary action. The witness may refuse to answer a       question only to preserve a privilege. When the witness has       refused to answer a question to preserve a privilege, members       or staff may (i) proceed with the deposition, or (ii) either       at that time or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling from the       Chair either by telephone or otherwise. If the Chair       overrules any such objection and thereby orders a witness to       answer any question to which an objection was lodged, the       witness shall be ordered to answer. If a member of the       committee chooses to appeal the ruling of the chair, such       appeal must be made within three days, in writing, and shall       be preserved for committee consideration. The Committee's       ruling on appeal shall be filed with the clerk of the       Committee and shall be provided to the members and witness no       less than three days before the reconvened deposition. A       deponent who refuses to answer a question after being       directed to answer by the chair may be subject to sanction,       except that no sanctions may be imposed if the ruling of the       chair is reversed by the committee on appeal.        8. The Committee chair shall ensure that the testimony is       either transcribed or electronically recorded or both. If a       witness's testimony is transcribed, the witness or the       witness's counsel shall be afforded an opportunity to review       a copy. No later than five days after the witness has been       notified of the opportunity to review the transcript, the       witness may submit suggested changes to the chair. Committee       staff may make any typographical and technical changes.       Substantive changes, modifications, clarifications, or       amendments to the deposition transcript submitted by the       witness must be accompanied by a letter signed by the witness       requesting the changes and a statement of the witness's       reasons for each proposed change. Any substantive changes,       modifications, clarifications, or amendments shall be       included as an appendix to the transcript conditioned upon       the witness signing the transcript.        9. The individual administering the oath, if other than a       member, shall certify on the transcript that the witness was       duly sworn. The transcriber shall certify that the transcript       is a true record of the testimony, and the transcript shall       be filed, together with any electronic recording, with the       clerk of the committee in Washington, DC. Depositions shall       be considered to have been taken in Washington, DC, as well       as the location actually taken once filed there with the       clerk of the committee for the committee's use. The chair and       the ranking minority member shall be provided with a copy of       the transcripts of the deposition at the same time.        10. The chair and ranking minority member shall consult       regarding the release of deposition testimony, transcripts,       or recordings, and portions thereof. If either objects in       writing to a proposed release of a deposition testimony,       transcript, or recording, or a portion thereof, the matter       shall be promptly referred to the committee for resolution.        11. A witness shall not be required to testify unless the       witness has been provided with a copy of section 3(b) of H.       Res. 8, 117th Congress, and these regulations.

Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Madam Speaker: Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution       8, 117th Congress, I hereby submit the following regulations       regarding remote committee proceedings for printing in the       Congressional Record.

Members participating remotely in a committee proceeding       must be visible on the software platform's video function to       be considered in attendance and to participate unless       connectivity issues or other technical problems render the       member unable to fully participate on camera (except as       provided in regulations A.2 and A.3).        2. The exception in regulation A.1 for connectivity issues       or other technical problems does not apply if a point of       order has been made that a quorum is not present. Members       participating remotely must be visible on the software       platform's video function in order to be counted for the       purpose of establishing a quorum.        3. The exception in regulation A.1 for connectivity issues       or other technical problems does not apply during a vote.       Members participating remotely must be visible on the       software platform's video function in order to vote.        4. Members participating remotely off-camera due to       connectivity issues or other technical problems pursuant to       regulation A.1 must inform committee majority and minority       staff either directly or through staff.        5. The chair shall make a good faith effort to provide       every member experiencing connectivity issues an opportunity       to participate fully in the proceedings, subject to       regulations A.2 and A.3.

Bannon dated September 23,           2021.         Dear * * *        I write today on behalf of Stephen K. Bannon with respect       to the above referenced subpoena, which I accepted on behalf       of Mr. Bannon. On the afternoon of October 6, 2021, I       received a letter from Justin Clark, as counsel for then       President of the United States Donald J. Trump. That letter       references the subpoena that your Committee served upon Mr.       Bannon, and notes that the subpoena:         ``seeks records and testimony purportedly related to the       events of January 6th, 2021, including but not limited to       information which is potentially protected from disclosure by       executive and other privileges, including among others the       presidential communications, deliberative process, and       attorney-client privileges. President Trump is prepared to       defend these fundamental privileges in court.        Therefore, to the fullest extent permitted by law,       President Trump instructs Mr. Bannon to: (a) where       appropriate, invoke any immunities and privileges he may have       from compelled testimony in response to the Subpoena; (b) not       produce any documents concerning privileged material in       response to the Subpoena; and (c) not provide any testimony       concerning privileged material in response to the Subpoena.''         It is therefore clear to us that since the executive       privileges belong to President Trump, and he has, through his       counsel, announced his intention to assert those executive       privileges enumerated above, we must accept his direction and       honor his invocation of executive privilege. As such, until       these issues are resolved, we are unable to respond to your       request for documents and testimony.        We will comply with the directions of the courts, when and       if they rule on these claims of both executive and attorney       client privileges. Since these privileges belong to President       Trump and not to Mr. Bannon, until these issues are resolved,       Mr Bannon is legally unable to comply with your subpoena       requests for documents and testimony.            Very truly yours,      Robert J. Costello.                                   ____          In sum and substance, the letter states that       Mr. Bannon is, ``legally unable to comply with your subpoena       requests for documents and testimony,'' because President       Trump's attorney informed Mr. Costello by letter, dated       October 6, 2021, that President Trump is invoking executive       privilege, ``to the fullest extent permitted by law,'' and       instructing Mr. Bannon not to provide documents or testimony,       ``concerning privileged material,'' in response to the Select       Committee's subpoena.        I will mark as exhibit 4 and enter into the record a letter       that Chairman Thompson sent to Mr. Costello in response on       October 8, 2021.           Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on             the United Staes Capitol,                                                   October 8, 2021.      Mr. Robert J. Costello,      Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP      * * *        Dear Mr. Costello, I write in response to your October 7,       2021 letter which states that your client, Stephen Bannon, is       ``legally unable to comply'' with the September 23, 2021       subpoena (the ``Subpoena'') issued by the Select Committee to       Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States       Capitol (the ``Select Committee''). Your letter relies on an       apparent instruction from former President Donald Trump that       appears limited to requesting that Mr. Bannon not disclose       privileged information. Despite this limited instruction,       your letter takes the inappropriate position that Mr. Bannon       will not comply with any request for information or testimony       sought by the Select Committee. Moreover, Mr. Trump's stated       ``intention to assert those executive privileges'' that may       or may not belong to him, does not provide a legal basis for       Mr. Bannon's refusal to comply with the Subpoena.        You accepted service of the Subpoena for documents and       testimony on Mr. Bannon's behalf on September 24, 2021. The       Subpoena required that, by October 7, 2021 at 10:00 a.m., Mr.       Bannon produce certain documents and  [[Page H5757]]       other records referring or relating to the matters described       in the Subpoena's schedule. All the requested documents       relate directly to the inquiry being conducted by the Select       Committee, serve a legitimate legislative purpose, and are       within the scope of the authority expressly delegated to the       Select Committee pursuant to House Resolution 503. In the       letter accompanying the Subpoena, the Select Committee set       forth the basis for its determination that the documents and       records sought by the Subpoena and Mr. Bannon's deposition       testimony are of critical importance to the issues being       investigated by the Select Committee.        Your letter indicates that the sole basis for defiance of       the Subpoena is Mr. Trump's ``direction'' to your client and       his decision to ``honor [Mr. Trump's] invocation of executive       privilege.'' That position has no basis in law, and your       letter does not cite any statute, case law, or other legal       precedent for support.        First, virtually all the documents and testimony sought by       the Subpoena concern Mr. Bannon's actions as a private       citizen and involve a broad range of subjects that are not       covered by executive privilege. You have provided no basis       for Mr. Bannon's refusal to comply with those portions of the       Subpoena not covered by any privilege. Furthermore, blanket       assertions of the deliberative process and attorney-client       privileges, such as those apparently requested by Mr. Trump,       have been rejected by courts as ``unsustainable'' even when--      unlike the situation with Mr. Bannon--the subpoena recipient       is an Executive Branch agency. See Comm. on Oversight and       Gov't Reform v. Holder, 2014 WL 2662665, at *2 (D.D.C. 2014)       (rejecting DOJ's assertion of deliberative process privilege       on all documents after a particular date and noting that the       ``Attorney General has not cited any authority that would       justify this sort of blanket approach'').         Second, the Select Committee has not received any       assertion, formal or otherwise, of any privilege from the Mr.       Trump. Even assuming that, as a former President, Mr. Trump       is permitted to formally invoke executive privilege, he has       not done so. At most, Mr. Trump has ``announced his intention       to assert those executive privileges.'' The Select Committee       is not aware of any legal authority, and your letter cites       none, holding that the mere intention to assert a privilege       absolves a subpoena recipient of his duty to comply.         Third, your letter indicates that Mr. Trump has requested       that your client ``to the fullest extent permitted by law . .       . not provide any testimony concerning privileged material in       response to the Subpoena.'' Even if your client had been a       senior aide to the President during the time period covered       by the contemplated testimony, which he was most assuredly       not, he is not permitted by law to the type of immunity you       suggest that Mr. Trump has requested he assert. To the       contrary, every court that has considered the absolute       immunity Mr. Trump alludes to has rejected it. See, e.g.,       Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982); Comm. on the       Judiciary v. Miers, 558 F. Supp. 2d 53, 106 (D.D.C. 2008)       (rejecting former White House counsel's assertion of absolute       immunity from compelled congressional process). Miers made       clear that even the most senior Presidential advisors may not       resist a congressional subpoena ``based solely on their       proximity to the President. `` Id. at 101 (citing Harlow, 457       U.S. at 810).' If there is no absolute immunity for senior       Presidential advisors, then there certainly can be no such       immunity for private citizens, such as Mr. Bannon, who       occasionally communicate with the President on nonofficial,       non-governmental, or campaign-related matters.        Regardless of any purported privilege assertion by Mr.       Trump, Mr. Bannon has an ongoing obligation to produce       documents to the Select Committee. Accordingly, please       produce all responsive documents and records identified in       the Subpoena. Should Mr. Bannon seek to withhold specific       responsive documents, consistent with the Subpoena       instructions, he must provide the Select Committee with a       privilege log that ``identifies and describes the material in       a manner `sufficient to enable resolution of any privilege       claims.''' See Comm. on Oversight, 2014 WL 12662665 at *2       (quoting Miers, 558 F. Supp. 2d at 107). Such a privilege log       should, at a minimum, provide the author(s) and recipient(s),       indicate the general subject matter of each document being       withheld, and the specific basis for withholding it.        Finally, the Select Committee expects Mr. Bannon's       appearance at the time and place designated in the Subpoena       for a deposition and respond fully to questions by the Select       Committee. If there are specific questions at that deposition       that you believe raise privilege issues, Mr. Bannon should       state them at that time for the deposition record for the       Select Committee's consideration and possible judicial       review.        Please be advised that the Select Committee will view Mr.       Bannon's failure to respond to the Subpoena as willful non-      compliance with the Subpoena. His willful non-compliance with       the Subpoena would force the Select Committee to consider       invoking the contempt of Congress procedures in 2 U.S.C.       Sec. Sec. 192, 194--which could result in a referral from the       House to the Department of Justice for criminal charges--as       well as the possibility of having a civil action to enforce       the Subpoena brought against Mr. Bannon in his personal       capacity.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                                                          Chairman.      ------      \1\ It is also worth noting that the court in Miers rejected       the former White House Counsel's claim of absolute immunity       from congressional testimony even though the sitting       President had formally invoked executive privilege. Id. at       62.                                   ____          And I'll take a brief pause to recognize that       Mr. Schiff has joined us.        Turning back to the letter that Chairman Thompson sent on       October 8th, in sum and substance, the response states that       Mr. Costello's, ``letter relies on an apparent instruction       from former President Donald Trump that appears limited to       requesting that Mr. Bannon not disclose privileged       information. Despite this limited instruction, your letter       takes the inappropriate position that Mr. Bannon will not       comply with any request for information or testimony sought       by the Select Committee. Moreover, Mr. Trump's stated       `intention to assert those executive privileges' that may or       may not belong to him does not provide a legal basis for Mr.       Bannon's refusal to comply with the subpoena.''        The letter states the Select Committee's expectation that       Mr. Bannon would appear today for the deposition and respond       fully to the Select Committee's questions and to state for       the record any objections to particular questions for the       Select Committee's consideration and possible judicial       review.        The letter concludes by advising that the Select Committee       will view Mr. Bannon's failure to respond to the subpoena as,       ``willful noncompliance,'' that would force the Select       Committee to consider invoking the contempt of Congress       procedures entitled to United States Code, sections 192 and       194, which could result in a referral from the House to the       Department of Justice for criminal charges as well as the       possibility of a civil action against Mr. Bannon personally       to enforce the subpoena.        I will mark as a final exhibit, exhibit 5, and enter into       the record a reply letter that Mr. Costello sent to Chairman       Thompson, the evening of October 13, 2021.                                      Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP,                                          Attorneys at Law, * * *                                   Washington, DC, October 13, 2021.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, House Select Committee to Investigate the January           6th Attack      * * *      Re: The Subpoena for Stephen K. Bannon dated September 23,           2021         Dear Congressman Thompson: I write on behalf of Stephen K.       Bannon to respond to some of the inaccurate statements made       in your letter to me dated October 8, 2021, which purports to       address the positions taken by Mr. Bannon with respect to the       above-referenced subpoena.        As an initial matter, your use of the word ``defiance'' is       inappropriate. Mr. Bannon's position is not in defiance of       your Committee's subpoena; rather, Mr. Bannon noted that       President Trump's counsel stated that they were invoking       executive and other privileges and therefore directed us not       to produce documents or give testimony that might reveal       information President Trump's counsel seeks to legally       protect. Mr. Bannon has testified on three prior occasions,       before the Mueller Investigation, the House Intelligence       Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee. In each of       those instances, when President Trump waived his invocation       of the executive privileges, Mr. Bannon testified.        As recently as today, counsel for President Trump, Justin       Clark Esq., informed us that President Trump is exercising       his executive privilege; therefore, he has directed Mr.       Bannon not to produce documents or testify until the issue of       executive privilege is resolved. Your Committee will have the       right to challenge that exercise or its scope. That is an       issue between the Committee and President Trump's counsel and       Mr. Bannon is not required to respond at this time. See Comm.       on the Judiciary v. McGahn, 415 F. Supp. 3d 148, FN 34       (D.D.C. 2019) (``The President can certainly identify       sensitive information that he deems subject to executive       privilege, and his doing so gives rise to a legal duty on the       part of the aide to invoke the privilege on the President's       behalf when, in the course of his testimony, he is asked a       question that would require disclosure of that       information.'')        Until such time as you reach an agreement with President       Trump or receive a court ruling as to the extent, scope and       application of the executive privilege, in order to preserve       the claim of executive and other privileges, Mr. Bannon will       not be producing documents or testifying. As noted       previously, Mr. Bannon will revisit his position if President       Trump's position changes or if a court rules on this matter.        Mr. Bannon's communications with President Trump on the       matters at issue in the Subpoena are well within the scope of       both the presidential communications and deliberative process       executive privileges. See In re Sealed Case (Espy), 121 F.3d       729 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (holding that the presidential       communications privilege covers communications made or       received by presidential advisors in the course of preparing       advice for the President even if those communications are not       made directly to the President); Coastal States Gas Corp. V.       U.S. Dep't of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 868 (D.C. Cir. 1980)       (finding that deliberative process privilege applies to       ``recommendations, draft documents, proposals, suggestions,       and other subjective documents  [[Page H5758]]       which reflect the personal opinions of the writer rather than       the policy of the agency.'')            Very truly yours,      Robert J. Costello.                                   ____          In sum and substance, the letter reiterates       that Mr. Bannon is abiding by President Trump's invocation of       executive privilege and direction to Mr. Bannon not to       produce documents or testify.        In support of Mr. Bannon's position, the letter cites       several judicial opinions on executive privilege, including a       2019 decision of the United States District Court in       Washington in the case of Committee on the Judiciary v.       McGahn.        In particular, the letter cites the following sentence from       the court's opinion: ``The President can certainly identify       sensitive information that he deems subject to executive       privilege, and his doing so gives rise to a legal duty on the       part of the aide to invoke the privilege on the President's       behalf when, in the course of his testimony, he is asked a       question that would require disclosure of that information.''        However, Mr. Bannon is not here today to assert executive       privilege on a question-by-question basis. He chose instead       not to appear at all, just as he chose not to produce any       documents at all or even a log of responsive documents that       he is withholding based on the claim of executive privilege.        With that, I will note for the record that it is 10:06       a.m., and Mr. Bannon still has not appeared or communicated       to the Select Committee that he will appear today as required       by the subpoena.        Accordingly, the record is now closed as of 10:06 a.m.        [Whereupon, at 10:06 a.m., the deposition was concluded.]
