 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of  Gainesville's native son, Mr. Tom Petty.   Thomas Earl Petty was born on October 20, 1950, and, over a career  that spanned five decades, collected 28 top 10 hits, the most of all  time.   But his contribution cannot be measured in hits or awards. He wrote  America's soundtrack. Tom Petty's story sounds familiar. He grew up in  a small town, struggled, persisted, and then succeeded--a true American  Dream story.   But it is not what he did; it is how he did it that strikes us. It is  the honesty, wit, and sentimentality that made his music special. Every  hit Tom Petty crafted became an anthem, each song a score to the  memorable moments of our lives. American life would be much diminished  without his work.   Jefferson and Madison wrote our system. Twain wrote our story that  described Early American folklore. Petty wrote our songs. The songbook  of America is bigger and brighter because of him.   Rest in peace as you continue ``Runnin' Down a Dream.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's leadership on  this.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the three promises, 3-month  initiative that you have outlined here, and I think it is so important  that we follow through with this.   I want to start with tax reform. Members can say: Why do we need tax  reform? I think it is self-evident. Our Tax Code, as you heard, is the  most burdensome in the world. It stifles economic growth,  entrepreneurship, and it creates noncompliance. So we need to simplify  it. We have told the American people we were going to do that if we get  in charge.   I think the repeal of ObamaCare--and some people get offended if we  call it ObamaCare, so I will refer to it as the Affordable Care Act. It  has disrupted over 20 percent of our economy, and I think it is not  affordable. We can talk to so many different people. I know our  premiums went up $11,000 since I have come to Congress. In fact, our  policy got canceled when I came to Congress because of ObamaCare.   Then I think the third part of that is we promised the American  people that we would repeal this in its entirety and fix healthcare so  that people have access to healthcare, it is affordable, and that it is  quality care is the part that gets left out.   Then I want to touch on border security. This is something that we  have all run on. Any nation needs a secure border. A sovereign nation  has to have a secure border, and they have to have control over their  border. However, due to the failures of politicians past and present,  the U.S. southern border, in particular, remains porous.  [[Page H7964]]    I applaud President Trump for releasing a set of principles which I  fully endorse and his priorities that are focused on making our borders  more secure. President Trump's consistent message calling for better  enforcement of our immigration laws and improving border security is  one of the main reasons he won the Presidency.   President Trump is sticking to his campaign promises, which is  refreshing to see in Washington, D.C., these days, a town where too  many times there is an aversion to making tough decisions in fear of  how that will be viewed in the next election. So it is refreshing to  see President Trump do what he said he was going to do.   Protecting our borders, ending sanctuary cities, and facilitating  State and local cooperation in immigration enforcement are commonsense  ideas that will protect national security, promote public safety, and  deter future illegal immigration. We are hard at work on solving these  problems of illegal immigration in the House.   Just three real quick facts:   From November 2013 to July 2014, officials apprehended 143  individuals listed on the U.S. terrorist watch list trying to cross the  Mexican border and enter the U.S. illegally. So many times I hear  people say that this is not true and that this does not happen, but we  know better.   As of 2014, illegal immigrants were convicted and sentenced for about  13 percent of the crimes in the United States.   Then, lastly, border security should also focus on maritime domain.  Our Coast Guard, a hardworking branch of our military service, has set  a new record for cocaine seizures at sea for the second consecutive  year, seizing more than 455,000 pounds of cocaine in 2017 that was  destined for the homeland.   So I am proud to join the Republican Study Committee in recognizing  the necessity of border security today.
