 Madam President, December should be the happiest  [[Page S8014]]  month of the year, as we await Christmas and the New Year, but in the  even numbered years, it is bittersweet as we say goodbye to colleagues  who will not be returning in the next Congress. While the body often  seems to be polarized and contentious to the public that knows us only  from media appearances, the fact is that partnership and alliances  across the aisle are part of the fabric of the body, and friendships of  unlikely allies abound. This is not to say that we don't disagree on  issues; we very much do. But we strive for these disagreements never to  erode our collegiality.   I would like to take this opportunity to thank those with whom I have  been proud to serve, Mr. Hatch, our President Pro Tempore, Mr. Corker,  Mr. Flake, and Mr. Heller on my side of the aisle for their  distinguished service. To my friend, Mr. Kyl, it has been a pleasure to  serve with you again. On the Democrat side of the aisle, Mr. Donnelly,  Ms. McCaskill, Mr. Nelson, and especially my dear friend, Ms. Heitkamp,  the Senator from North Dakota. Each of these individuals cares deeply  for the Nation, for the States they have represented so ably, and for  the Senate.                            ____________________     Madam President, I pay tribute to my friend, the  Senator from Utah, President pro tempore of the Senate, who is retiring  after 41 years of service. Senator Hatch is known as a Senator's  Senator. He has had more legislation signed into law than any other  living Member of this body, and he has chaired the Finance, Judiciary,  and Labor and Human Resources Committees with great distinction. Today  we call that Labor and Human Resources Committee the HELP Committee.   We all recall the friendship Mr. Hatch had with the late Senator from  Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. This relationship was responsible for some  of the most impactful legislation of our time. The State Children's  Health Insurance Program, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the  Ryan White Act, to name a few, and when Senator Kennedy suffered from  life's difficulties, Senator Hatch was there to support him as a  friend.   On June 28, 2017, Senator Hatch published a very important column in  TIME Magazine, entitled, ``I am recommitting myself to civility.''  Written in the wake of the attempted massacre of colleagues who were  practicing for the annual congressional softball game, a racially  motivated stabbing in Portland, and dueling political rallies in  Berkeley that turned violent, Senator Hatch observed, ``Civility is the  indispensable political norm.''   I would like to quote a few sentences from Mr. Hatch's column because  they bear repeating, now more than ever.       ``Civility--it is the public virtue that has greased the       wheels of our democracy since its inception. Without it,       little separates us from the cruelty and chaos of rule by       force. For decades, civility has acted as the levee       protecting our society from its own worst impulses. But that       levee now shows signs of strain as political passions spill       over into open violence.''  If our Nation paid greater heed to Mr. Hatch's wisdom, horrors like the  Pittsburgh synagogue shooting might well have been avoided.   Orrin, you have been a steady hand in troubled times. While you may  have chosen to retire from this body, your work is hardly done, and I  hope that your retirement does not mark a retreat from your commitment  to keep our Nation and your colleagues on a steady course.   You are indeed a Senator's Senator and a true patriot.                            ____________________     Madam President, people often forget that each of us  comes to the Senate having done other significant things in life. Mr.  Corker, the Senator from Tennessee, came here with a series of  experiences that greatly informed his work in the Senate, as well as  the work of his colleagues.   Mr. Corker was a success in business long before he entered politics,  and he brought the lessons of that success into public service. He was  the deeply respected mayor of Chattanooga, TN. Mayors are perhaps the  most accountable elected officials in the Nation. They are a pragmatic  results-oriented stock. They live in the communities that they govern,  so there is no place to hide, and they are forced to defend their  records because the electorate knows what they have done and haven't.  No room for spin when you are a mayor.   Bob then brought the lessons of both of these careers to the U.S.  Senate where he is known as a no-nonsense Senator who cuts through the  bluster and focuses on the facts. On difficult problems, whether it was  the Iran nuclear agreement or working to save the American automobile  industry from near collapse, he brought discipline to our  deliberations.   I would like to say a few words about Bob's work as chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Senate Foreign Relations  Committee has historically held a preeminent role in the formulation  and execution of U.S. foreign policy. Chairman Corker approached the  position with all of the grace and diplomacy appropriate to the office.   As the Senate's representative to the executive in foreign policy, he  ably represented our interests. He asked the questions that were on so  many of our minds and then he returned to the Senate to explain the  administration's thinking. He calmed many of our anxieties about the  turbulent world in which we live. I like to think that is because Mr.  Corker is a thoughtful, methodical, and calm thinker. His calm, steady  leadership as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee these past  several years will be greatly missed.                            ____________________     Madam President, Heidi Heitkamp and I share much in  common. Although we sit on different sides of the aisle, we represent  resource States, we represent significant populations of Native  Americans, and we are each fiercely independent women who have tended  to vote our conscience over party on the toughest issues of our time.  We are also the best of friends off the court. So it will come as no  surprise to those who know us that I am heartbroken that my friend will  not be returning to serve alongside me in the next Congress.   Our collaborations over the past 6 years have been very productive.  We partnered on creating the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff  Commission on Native Children, a body named for respected Elders from  each of our States. The commission has been stood up and is now  operating. I am hopeful that the commission will conclude its work with  recommendations that we can adopt into law. The adoption of those  recommendations will be a fitting legacy for my friend, the Senator  from North Dakota.   Senator Heitkamp and I have also collaborated on Savanna's Act, which  is the first piece of legislation to specifically address the epidemic  of missing and murdered Native women and girls in America. This cause  is so very important to my friend, as it is to me, but I would like to  share a story about my friend that is so telling about her commitment  and her character.   On the Wednesday, following our return from the election day and  Veterans Day recess, I had a news conference scheduled with the Urban  Indian Health Institute. That news conference was called to discuss the  results of a new report on the epidemic of missing and murdered Native  women and girls in urban American cities. It was important to me that  my friend be present at that news conference because it was about an  issue that she championed during her time in the Senate, and it would  have been excusable if my friend had bowed out, having just fought and  lost a difficult reelection bid.   But my friend didn't bow out. She stepped up, and she pledged to the  advocates present that, even though she will no longer be a Senator  come January, she would be moving over to their side come January. She  pledged to remain an advocate for this cause that is most important to  her. She will continue to do great and good things. Her work is not  done.   To Heidi, you have done good in the U.S. Senate. We thank you.                            ____________________
