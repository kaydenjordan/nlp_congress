 Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am.    Madam Speaker, this motion to recommit will not kill the  bill or send it back to committee, to be clear. If adopted, the bill  will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.   My Democratic colleagues are set to pass this bill despite the fact  that the ACLU opposes it.   Let me repeat that. The ACLU opposes H.R. 1112 because it is so  sweeping and improperly perpetrates unfounded assumptions that people  with mental disabilities should be considered dangerous and are prone  to violence without any meaningful due process.   As most of you know, I am a survivor of domestic violence, and that  is why this motion to recommit is so personally important to me. This  motion to recommit, in contrast, is narrowly tailored. It would simply  allow victims of domestic violence who go through a NICS check to  receive their firearms in 3 days, which is the status quo, if NICS has  not responded with a denial or approval in 3 business days--again, the  status quo.   Do we really want to tell victims of domestic violence they have to  wait up to 20 business days, which is under this bill, before they are  allowed to adequately defend themselves?   Do we really want to tell them: Sorry. I know you are purchasing a  firearm to protect yourself, but you have to wait 20 business days?   Should we tell them: Hopefully you can hide from your abuser for the  next month?   The Judiciary Committee recently heard testimony from a young woman  who was raped on her college campus. She did not have a gun on campus  because the State did not allow her to carry a gun in order to defend  herself. This is a clear example of how law-abiding citizens, not  criminals, follow the law and how this law-abiding young woman was  harmed by gun control laws.   Another specific example related to this bill of a well-intentioned  law gone wrong is Carol Bowne, a New Jersey woman stabbed to death  while waiting to be approved for her firearm application. She already  had an order of protection from the courts, but that wasn't enough for  her. She needed more than just that piece of paper. She needed to  protect herself, so she went and tried to get a gun to defend herself,  but because of the waiting period, she was killed.   Let me repeat that. Carol Bowne had an order of protection. She  attempted to purchase a firearm, and she was tragically murdered by her  abuser while waiting to be approved.   H.R. 1112 will make the realities of Carol's story happen across the  country, putting millions of women and law-abiding citizens in danger.  Women who seek avenues of protection will be forced to wait almost a  month, like Carol.   How many women will potentially suffer like Carol? And what will the  Democrats say: Sorry; we hope you can hide from your abuser for a  month?   Madam Speaker, that would be foolish as well as heartless. It would  be an infringement of Second Amendment rights for someone who needs  them the most.   Given the insidious flaws in this bill, do we really want to burden  law-abiding victims by placing them in a never-ending cycle of  background checks? Of course not.   This motion to recommit is a commonsense measure. It would ensure  that domestic violence victims, many of whom live in fear, can receive  the protection they need and deserve.   Vote for this motion to recommit and you vote to protect domestic  violence victims. Vote against the motion to recommit and you are  telling victims who live in fear: Sorry; we won't help you.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to  recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H2292]]         Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
