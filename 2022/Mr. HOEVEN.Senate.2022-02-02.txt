 Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute  to the late North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem, a dedicated  public servant, a colleague, and a true friend. Attorney General  Stenehjem spent four decades serving the people of North Dakota. He was  a fierce advocate for the rule of law and the rights of North Dakotans.   His was a tremendous and impactful career that clearly demonstrated  his devotion to our State, which he called home for the entirety of his  life. Wayne was born in Mohall, ND. He graduated from the University of  North Dakota and received his law degree from the University of North  Dakota School of Law. He is survived by his wife, Beth Bakke Stenehjem,  and his son, Andrew, along with many other loved ones.   Wayne started his career in public service in the State legislature,  where he served for 24 years, first as a member of the North Dakota  House of Representatives and then as a member of the North Dakota  Senate. He then ran for the position of attorney general in 2000, the  same year I was elected Governor and the first time either of us sought  statewide office. I had the benefit of traveling much of the State with  Wayne that year, where I came to know him as a solid, reliable  individual with a tremendous sense of humor.   Wayne capped off his career in public office as our State's longest  serving attorney general. Throughout my time as Governor and as a U.S.  Senator, I had many opportunities to work with Wayne on keeping our  communities safe, supporting our law enforcement officials, and  protecting the rights of North Dakotans. He worked tirelessly to  advance these important goals, and I will always be proud of our shared  efforts in these matters. Moreover, I am grateful for our time  together, both as colleagues and as friends.   He will be greatly missed and remembered well for the meaningful  legacy he has left behind. Mikey and I send our sincerest condolences  to Beth, Andrew, and the entire Stenehjem family.                            ____________________
