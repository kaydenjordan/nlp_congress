 Madam Chair, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution  172, I offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This package of 17 important amendments was made in order by the  rule. The substance of these amendments ranges from commonsense  information-gathering to protecting our Nation from foreign influence.   For instance, one amendment expands an existing ban to protect  against a greater universe of threats. It provides that the Federal  Election Campaign Act, which already bans foreign nationals from  contributing to American elections, ought also to ban them from  contributing to State or local ballot initiatives or referenda, where  their undue influence might allow outside control of State and local  matters.   Our colleagues have also joined with us in efforts to understand and  appreciate the different experiences of American voters and to ensure  that voters of all kinds are included at the ballot box by supporting  information-sharing between States and the Election Assistance  Commission.   One amendment focuses on greater reporting of demographic  information, shining a light on who is voting so that we can better  grasp who is participating or perhaps feels left out of our diverse  electorate.   In States where information about age, gender, race, and ethnicity is  already available to the State, this amendment will simply require  States to include that demographic information about voters in their  annual report to the Election Assistance Commission on voter  registration statistics.   Our colleagues also support efforts by the Government Accountability  Office to study the extent to which membership diversity requirements  have been met in State redistricting commissions, ensuring that justice  and fairness in representing the people is the priority, not partisan  advantage to either party.   In a similar vein of being welcome to diverse voters, an amendment  requires that the poll worker training manual provided by the Election  Assistance Commission ensures that services are delivered in a  culturally competent manner to voters who need these services,  including voters with disabilities, those with limited English  proficiency, and voters of diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, all  regardless of the gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity of the  prospective voter.   This amendment seeks to give each voter full and equal access to the  poll worker services that are critical to inclusive and efficient  election administration and engagement with our sacred duties in this  election.   This amendment also contains several component parts that focus on  transparency and accessibility of information to everyday citizens so  they can feel confident about the integrity, prudence, and independence  of this government.   One amendment would stop campaign contributions providing an endless  piggybank to candidates long after they have left office, or their  campaign.   Another amendment gives citizens an important and accessible window  into lobbying information. It would require the Attorney General to  establish within the Department of Justice a single lobbying  information disclosure portal through which members of the public could  obtain hard copies and electronic copies of registration statements  filed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 and the Foreign Agents  Registration Act of 1938. The effect of this amendment would be to  combine and make easily accessible information that is currently  available from disparate sources, including the House, the Senate, and  the Department of Justice. Efforts like these increase information  flow, transparency, and confidence in our government.   Madam Chair, I think these amendments are worthy of our support.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, a few of the Members who have offered  amendments would like to speak briefly on them.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Harder).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran), who has several amendments.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider), who has an amendment here.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I must oppose the gentleman's amendment. It  strips the subpoena power from the Director of the Office of Government  Ethics.   Recent years have made it clear that the OGE needs to be  strengthened. The subpoena power is a key enforcement tool, and a  necessary one, for the Office of Government Ethics.   The former head of OGE said, in working with the current  administration it has become clear we need to strengthen the ethics  program. That individual resigned as head of the agency in July of last  year, after almost 5 years as its head.   The OGE was set up in the aftermath of the 1970 Watergate scandal to  clean up government. Some of that cleanup has relied on norms of  behavior that are no longer in effect. We need to make sure that we  have the ability with the OGE head to actually obtain information so  they can do their job.                                time  1245    I do want to touch on a few other points raised by the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Hice).   You know, there has been a lot of discussion over and over that the  small donor program is funded by taxpayers. That is incorrect. You can  just read the bill and see that is incorrect.   The freedom from influence fund is entirely funded by a nominal,  additional assessment on criminal tax fraud cases, at the upper end,  and corporate malfeasance fines and forfeitures. That is the entire  source of funding. If there is not enough funding from those sources to  fully fund the program, then the program is not fully funded.   That is in the bill itself; so I think it is important that we all  understand that.   In terms of the automatic voter registration system, this has worked  very successfully in a number of States, and six more are in the  process of implementing it.   There are quite a few--we think, ample--safeguards to make sure that  only those eligible to vote are, in fact, registered to vote. AVR  agencies have reliable data about citizenship status and age, and there  are separate rules for those agencies that don't collect that  information.   I would note, also, that there has been discussion about how this is  an unfair Federal imposition on States. This is only for Federal  elections. This whole bill, H.R. 1, is about Federal elections. And why  is that? Article I, Section 4 gives the authority to Congress to pass  laws about the conduct of Federal elections.   We have seen over and over, throughout the United States, efforts to  suppress the vote in ways we think are improper by purging eligible  voters from the rolls, by preventing people from registering through  bogus and arcane ID rolls, by making sure that voters can't get to the  polls because they have moved the polls, by eliminating early voting  that is so helpful to people who work so hard that they might not be  able to get to the polls before the poll closes. So this is for Federal  elections.   And why is that important? Each one of us here in the House of  Representatives has one vote. That is as it should be, as the Founders  established it.   The people who send us here should have the equivalent right to vote  for their Representative. There shouldn't be a way that one person in  one State has an adequate right to vote but the vote is suppressed in  some other State. That is not democracy; that is not fair; and that is  what H.R. 1 will fix.   Madam Chair, I urge that we oppose the gentleman from Georgia's  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment,  reluctantly, because it is only the last paragraph in the amendment  that causes concern.   The amendment expresses a sense of Congress that free speech should  be protected. Who can disagree with that? Our Founding Fathers  envisioned a robust and open discourse. They did not fathom speech that  was unaccountable to anonymous corporations that would drown out the  voices of individual Americans.   The concern we have on this amendment is the last paragraph, really,  is an attempt to protect the Citizens United decision and the flow of  unlimited dark money into our politics and elections.   It is important to note that, under the guise of free speech, some  are suggesting that we need to protect anonymous special interests.  Nothing stops people or entities from donating to political campaigns  or politicians, but they must be transparent about it.   Justice Brandeis indicated, and I think he is very wise, that  sunshine is the best disinfectant, and the American people cannot fully  exercise their First Amendment rights if they do not have all of the  information necessary to react in an informed manner.   We all have the right to know who is trying to influence elections,  and it may well change our minds if we know who is saying what.  Ultimately, this amendment is flawed because disclosure does not limit  speech.   In Citizens United, the Court affirmed holdings in other cases, that  disclaimer and disclosure requirements impose no ceiling on campaign- related activities and do not prevent anyone from speaking. Indeed, the  Court held the disclosure is ``a less restrictive alternative to more  comprehensive regulations.''   Lauded conservatives have long espoused this principle, and the  Supreme Court has repeatedly endorsed disclosure because it helps  voters hold elected leaders accountable. In fact, eight of the nine  Supreme Court Justices upheld disclosure in the Citizens United case as  necessary for voters to hold leaders accountable.   Perhaps no one said it better than Justice Antonin Scalia in Doe v.  Reed. Justice Scalia said: ``Requiring people to stand up in public for  their political acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is  doomed.''   Much has been said about the ACLU, and I appreciate what the ACLU  does on many scores, but they have a storied history of litigating  constitutional issues that I support. However, we have differed on our  approach to campaign finance laws. They have upheld and supported the  Citizens United decision and they oppose McCain-Feingold. While I  support so much of the good work they do, I think they are mistaken on  this issue.   I include in the Record a letter from Democracy 21, which is a very  thoughtful rebuttal to the ACLU's position.                                                   Democracy 21,                                                      March 7, 2019.      Re Response to ACLU Letter on H.R. 1.         Dear Representative: Democracy 21 strongly supports H.R. 1,       the ``For the People Act of 2019,'' and urges you to vote for       the legislation, which is the most comprehensive effort to       repair our democracy since the post-Watergate reforms of the       1970's.        In particular, the bill contains a series of important       reforms to address serious problems with our campaign finance       system. The legislation provides a small donor, matching       funds system for House and presidential elections that will       encourage small donations and remove candidate dependence on       wealthy contributors and special interest money. It also       contains important improvements to the disclosure laws to       address the growing problem of undisclosed ``dark money''       that is being spent to influence federal elections. And it       provides effective standards to ensure that supposedly       ``independent'' spending is not done in cooperation or       coordination with candidates or their agents, thus evading       contribution limits.        We want to address constitutional concerns about some of       these measures that have been raised by the ACLU in a letter       dated March 6, 2019. We note that the ACLU has participated       as a plaintiff or amicus to seek invalidation of reform       measures in key Supreme Court cases, including Buckley v.       Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93       (2003) and Citizens United v. FEC, 130 S.Ct. 876 (2010). Many       of the ACLU's challenges to campaign finance reform measures,       including disclosure requirements, were rejected by the Court       in these cases.      ACLU concerns about disclosure provisions        The provisions of the DISCLOSE Act incorporated into H.R. 1       are essential to closing gaping disclosure loopholes through       which, in the last four elections, wealthy donors and special       interests gave $1 billion in secret, unlimited contributions       to nonprofit groups that spent the money to influence federal       elections. Unlimited, secret contributions, also known as       dark money, are the most dangerous contributions in American       politics because there is no way to hold the donor and       officeholder accountable for corrupt practices.        In its March 6 letter, the ACLU particularly criticizes the       DISCLOSE Act incorporated into H.R. 1. Those provisions       require disclosure of the sources of funding used for       ``campaign-related disbursements'' that are intended to       influence federal elections. Dating back to the Buckley case,       and as reaffirmed in Citizens United, the Supreme Court has       consistently upheld disclosure requirements because they       serve the important governmental interests of ``providing the       electorate with information about the sources of election-      related spending'' in order to help citizens ``make informed       choices in the political marketplace.'' Citizens United, 130       S. Ct. at 914.        As Justice Kennedy wrote for an 8-1 majority in Citizens       United, disclosure provisions ``impose no ceiling on       campaign-related activities'' and ``do not prevent anyone       from speaking.'' Id. In Citizens United, the Supreme Court       upheld disclosure provisions applicable to section 501(c)(4)       nonprofit groups.        The ACLU's principal objection is that H.R. 1 requires       disclosure of spending that ``reaches beyond the bounds'' of       express advocacy. ACLU Ltr. at 12. Yet the Court in Citizens       United addressed precisely this issue and upheld a disclosure       requirement for a broadcast ad that referred to a candidate       in the pre-election period, but that did not contain express       advocacy.        The Court explicitly stated that ``we reject Citizens       United's contention that the disclosure requirement must be       limited to speech that is the functional equivalent of       express advocacy.'' Id. at 916.        Thus, the principal constitutional argument raised by the       ACLU with regard to the  [[Page H2523]]       DISCLOSE Act--that disclosure requirements cannot extend       beyond express advocacy--has already been squarely and       overwhelmingly rejected by an 8 to 1 vote in the Supreme       Court. While the ACLU states that it particularly objects to       disclosure requirements for ``electioneering       communications,'' i.e., non-express advocacy ads that refer       to a candidate in the pre-election period, ACLU Ltr. at 13,       this is the very issue that the Court addressed in upholding       such disclosure requirements in Citizens United.        The ACLU also objects to disclosure requirements for money       spent on ads that promote, support, attack or oppose (PASO)       the election of a candidate, complaining about ``applying       vague and subjective standards to regulation of political       speech.'' ACLU Ltr. at 14. Yet again, the Supreme Court       directly addressed this issue, and rejected an identical       criticism of the same test in the McConnell case.        In McConnell, the Court stated that the words used in the       PASO test--promote, attack, support, oppose--are not       unconstitutionally vague because they `` `provide explicit       standards for those who apply them' and `give the person of       ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what       is prohibited.' '' 540 U.S. at 170 n. 64 (internal citations       omitted).        The Court further stated that ``any public communication       that promotes or attacks a clearly identified federal       candidate directly affects the election in which he is       participating. The record on this score could scarcely be       more abundant.'' Id. at 170. These rulings should put to rest       the objections raised by the ACLU about the PASO test.        The ACLU also raises privacy and associational concerns       with the disclosure requirements in the legislation. It       invokes the Court's decision in NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S.       459 (1958), which protected the associational interests of a       civil rights group against disclosure of the group's       membership lists when the group was under attack from       government officials in the 1950s South. We note that the       NAACP today is itself a supporter of H.R. 1, and that the       disclosure provisions in H.R. 1 could not be more different       from the disclosure requirements addressed by the Court in       the 1958 NAACP decision.        The DISCLOSE Act provisions in H.R. 1 require disclosure       only of donors who give $10,000 or more in a two-year       election cycle to a group which engages in campaign-related       spending. That high dollar threshold alone will exclude       disclosure of the vast majority of donors to, and members of,       most membership organizations, and instead will require       disclosure only of very large donors to such groups.        Furthermore, the Supreme Court in both Buckley and       McConnell has already rejected the analogy between campaign       finance disclosure requirements and the disclosure of       membership lists that was struck down in the NAACP case. The       Court said in McConnell, ``In Buckley, unlike NAACP, we found       no evidence that any party had been exposed to economic       reprisals or physical threats as a result of the compelled       disclosure.'' Id. at 198.        Indeed, H.R. 1 has an explicit safe harbor from disclosure       for any donor who may be subject to ``serious threats,       harassment or reprisals.'' Sec. 4111(a) adding Sec.       324(a)(3)(C). This again aligns with the Supreme Court's       requirements on this issue.        The Court has made clear that disclosure requirements are       not invalid because of a generalized or theoretical concern       about ``public harassment,'' but instead are invalid only in       specific cases where a group can show a ``reasonable       probability'' that disclosing the names of its contributors       would ``subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals       from either Government officials or private parties.''       Citizens United, 130 S.Ct. at 916.        Absent such a showing, campaign finance disclosure       requirements are constitutional. And even if there is such a       specific showing of a specific threat, the disclosure       requirements would be held unconstitutional only for the       specific group involved based on the specific showing of harm       to that group. The disclosure laws would otherwise remain       constitutional.        The ACLU states a concern that the bill would ``require       disclosure of an overbroad number of donors,'' ACLU Ltr. at       15, but it fails to acknowledge or to give proper weight to       other protections for privacy interests that are contained in       the bill. A group can set up a separate bank account for its       spending on campaign-related disbursements and then is       required to disclose only those donors of $10,000 or more to       this separate account. All other donors to the organization       would not be disclosed.        In addition, any donor can restrict his or her donation to       the organization from being used for campaign-related       disbursements. If the group agrees to the restriction and       segregates the money, the identity of the donor is not       disclosed. By these measures, groups and donors can ensure       that donors whose funds are not used for campaign-related       expenditures are not subject to any disclosure, thereby       respecting any donor's particularized privacy interests.      ACLU concerns about coordination provisions        A second area of concern with H.R. 1 raised by the ACLU is       the provisions related to strengthening the coordination       rules in the campaign finance laws. These rules play a major       role in protecting the integrity and efficacy of contribution       limits which are, in turn, the major bulwark against       corruption.        While independent spending is not subject to contribution       limits, any spending that is coordinated with a candidate or       his agents is treated as a contribution and therefore is       subject to limits. Because of weak rules and even weaker       enforcement by the Federal Election Commission, the existing       coordination rules do not effectively restrain campaign-      related spending by Super PACs, nonprofit groups and other       outside spenders from being functionally coordinated with the       candidates supported by the spending.        In this fashion, the rise of individual-candidate Super       PACs has played an especially pernicious role. These Super       PACs are typically set up with the involvement of the       candidate or his or her close associates, and the candidate       is often involved in helping to raise unlimited huge       contributions for the Super PAC.        This money is then spent, purportedly independently of the       candidate, to promote the candidate's election. But because       there are not effective rules against coordination, these       individual-candidate Super PACs have operated in de facto       coordination with the candidates they are set up to support.       In practice, they have become dedicated soft money campaign       accounts for candidates, thus eviscerating the contribution       limits which should apply to money raised and spent by       federal candidates.        While the use of individual-candidate Super PACs began       after Citizens United with presidential candidates in 2012,       they rapidly have spread to congressional races. By the 2018       election cycle, 259 individual-candidate Super PACs       supporting federal officeholders and other candidates had       raised $176 million in unlimited contributions.        The coordination provisions in H.R. 1 strengthen existing       coordination rules to conform to Supreme Court decisions       which require independent spending to be ``totally''       independent of a candidate. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 47.        The ACLU tempers its objections to these provisions of the       bill, noting that it ``strongly supports stricter enforcement       of rules restricting coordination between campaigns and       outside groups'' and acknowledging that ``H.R. 1 would make       strides in the right direction by clarifying the definition       of coordinated expenditures treated as contributions to a       campaign.'' ACLU Ltr. at 17. Yet it objects that the       definition of coordination could encompass ``communications       with the candidate about the public policy issues of the day       without a sufficient nexus to the potential corrupting       influence of very large expenditures.'' Id. at 18.        In stating this objection, the ACLU fails to give proper       weight to an explicit provision in the bill which protects       such communications by creating a safe harbor from       application of the coordination rules for any person's       ``discussions with the candidate or committee, or with any       agent of the candidate or committee, regarding that person's       position on a legislative or policy matter (including urging       the candidate or committee to adopt that person's position) .       . .'' Sec. 6102 adding sec. 326(b)(2).        The ACLU acknowledges this safe harbor, Ltr. at 19, but       misinterprets it. As set forth in the text of the bill, the       safe harbor applies to legislative or policy discussion ``so       long as there is no communication between the person and the       candidate or committee . . . regarding the candidate's or       committee's campaign advertising, message, strategy or       policy,'' id. (emphasis added).        The ACLU's concern that ``[d]iscussion of `message' or       `policy' is integral to discussion of legislative and policy       positions,'' id., is already adequately addressed by the safe       harbor provision, which permits all legislative message and       policy discussion so long as it is not about campaign policy,       or the campaign's message.        Raising additional concerns, the ACLU objects to treatment       as a coordinated expenditure of a payment by an outside       spender for republication of a candidate's own campaign       material, although it correctly notes that this same       republication provision has long been part of existing law.       ACLU Ltr. at 18. It notes that there are regulations issued       by the FEC which have interpreted this provision of existing       law, and claims those regulations are necessary to the       constitutionality of the law. Even if true, there is nothing       in H.R. 1 which would prevent the FEC from similarly       construing the bill's re-promulgation of the same       republication language, which is all that the bill does on       this matter.        Finally, the ACLU notes that the coordination provisions of       H.R. 1 create a new category of ``coordinated spenders,''       based on certain specified relationships, activities or       status between candidates and outside spenders. The bill then       provides that certain specified categories of campaign-      related spending by such ``coordinated spenders'' will be       treated as coordinated. The ACLU questions whether such       treatment can be ``based solely upon a speaker's identity.''       ACLU Ltr. at 19.        This is, at best, a half-hearted objection because the ACLU       also then ``agrees that a speaker's identity coupled with the       contents of the communications can be factors in determining       whether a particular communication was coordinated with a       candidate such that it should be considered a campaign       contribution.'' Id. The ACLU nonetheless questions whether       spending can be treated as coordinated ``absent any       additional information indicating the speaker acted pursuant       to a common plan.'' Id.        But the Court has never limited the definition of       coordinated spending only to spending pursuant to an explicit       discussion about,  [[Page H2524]]       or a ``common plan'' for, a particular expenditure. The Court       has instead cast a wide net in demanding that independent       spending be ``totally independent,'' Buckley, 424 U.S. at 29,       and ``not pursuant to any general or particular understanding       with a candidate,'' Colorado Republican Federal Campaign       Committee v. FEC, 518 U.S. 604, 614 (1996), and ``truly       independent'' or ``without any candidate's approval (or wink       or nod).'' FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign       Committee, 533 U.S. 431, 442 (2001).        The standards set forth in H.R. 1 look both to certain       relationships between the outside spender and the candidate,       and certain activities between the outside spender and the       candidate, to determine whether the spending meets the       standard set by the Court of being ``totally'' and ``truly''       independent. If the relationship between the candidate and       spender, or the activities of the candidate on behalf of the       spender (such as helping to fundraise for the spender),       indicate that they do not meet this high standard for true       independence, then the proposed rule would appropriately deem       spending by that person to be coordinated.      Conclusion        The reforms contained in H.R. 1 will make essential       improvements in the transparency of the money spent to       influence federal elections and in shutting down avenues that       are currently being exploited to evade and eviscerate       candidate contribution limits. The bill is carefully drafted       to conform to the Supreme Court's campaign finance rulings,       and to appropriately balance constitutionally protected       privacy and speech interests with the government's compelling       interests in deterring corruption and the appearance of       corruption through disclosure and the restoration of       effective contribution limits.        Democracy 21 urges you to vote for H.R. 1.            Sincerely,      Fred Wertheimer,        President.      Donald J. Simon,        Counsel.     Madam Chair, I would note, also, that we have just  received a letter from The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human  Rights expressing their strong support for H.R. 1. This is an  organization that no one can fault for their firm leadership on human,  civil, and constitutional rights for many decades.   I include in the Record a letter from The Leadership Conference on  Civil and Human Rights.                                           The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                      Washington, DC, March 1, 2019.      Support H.R. 1, the For The People Act.         Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 200       national organizations committed to promoting and protecting       the civil and human rights of all persons in the United       States, and the 50 undersigned organizations, we write in       strong support of H.R. 1, the For the People Act.        H.R. 1 represents a transformative vision for American       democracy. It would create a democracy that welcomes every       eligible voter's chance to participate in civic life, and a       democracy that demands integrity, fairness, and transparency       in our nation's elections. For far too long, voter       suppression has been a shameful reality in our country--      undercutting the power and representation of African       Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders,       Native Americans, and other groups historically excluded from       our political process. The ability to meaningfully       participate in our democracy is a racial justice issue. It is       a civil rights issue. And the need for legislative action is       urgent. We commend the 235 House co-sponsors of this critical       legislation.        Our nation will soon mark the 54th anniversary of the       Bloody Sunday march, where John Lewis and 600 voting rights       activists were viciously beaten and attacked on March 7, 1965       on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. History was       made in August 1965 with the passage of the landmark Voting       Rights Act (``VRA''), which sought to end racial       discrimination at the ballot box. Nearly five decades later,       in 2013, five justices of the Supreme Court gutted the VRA's       most powerful tool--the preclearance system. That system had       enabled the Justice Department and federal courts to block       proposed discriminatory voting restrictions in states with       well-documented histories of discrimination.        In the aftermath of the Shelby County v. Holder decision,       North Carolina, Texas, and other jurisdictions previously       covered in whole or part by the VRA preclearance requirement       began to implement voter suppression laws. In striking down       the North Carolina law in 2016, the Fourth Circuit described       the law as ``the most restrictive voting law North Carolina       has seen since the era of Jim Crow'' with provisions that       ``target African Americans with almost surgical precision.''       There have been findings of intentional discrimination in at       least 10 voting rights decisions since Shelby County.        The Trump administration has only made matters worse by       damaging our democracy and institutions--from elections to       the census to the free press. The administration's assault on       voting rights can be seen in the creation of the sham Pence-      Kobach commission, a political ploy that was ultimately       discredited and disbanded. We also saw it in its defense of       Texas's discriminatory photo ID law and Ohio's voter purge       efforts. The Trump administration has not filed a single VRA       case, despite numerous recent state and local efforts to       block access to the ballot in communities of color. Yet the       Trump administration cited its need to enforce the VRA as its       justification for adding an untested citizenship question to       the 2020 Census--a justification that a federal judge       recently found to be pretextual and unlawful.        People turned out in record numbers during the 2018       election to reject this assault on voting rights and cast       their votes for democracy reform. Not only is this reflected       in the most diverse Congress in our nation's history, but       voters also cast their ballot to end gerrymandering and make       voting more accessible in red and blue states across the       country. However, many states continue to create barriers to       voting, and that is why H.R. 1 is so critical.        H.R. 1 would enhance and ensure democracy in America by:        Committing to restoring the Voting Rights Act: H.R. 1       contains a commitment to restoring the landmark VRA and       updating its preclearance provision, which is crucial to       ensuring that our political process functions fairly and       equitably. VRA restoration is being pursued on a separate       legislative track that will involve investigatory and       evidentiary hearings, thus enabling Congress to update the       preclearance coverage formula and develop a full record on       the continuing problem of racial discrimination in voting. In       2006, the VRA was reauthorized on a unanimous vote in the       Senate and a near-unanimous vote in the House. We need the       same type of broad and bipartisan support for restoring the       VRA today. Safeguarding democracy should not be a partisan       issue.        Restoring voting rights for formerly incarcerated people:       H.R. 1 would restore voting rights for people with felony       convictions, a necessary repudiation of our nation's       discriminatory and racially violent past. This would re-      enfranchise approximately 4.7 million voters nationwide.       Reforming felony disenfranchisement has bipartisan support;       last November, 65 percent of Florida voters cast their       ballots to restore the right to vote for over 1.4 million       people.        Reforming voter registration: In the November 2016       election, nearly 20 percent of people who were eligible but       did not vote cited registration hurdles as the main reason       for not voting. H.R. 1 would modernize America's voter       registration system and improve access to the ballot box by       establishing automatic voter registration (``AVR''), same day       registration (``SDR''), and online voter registration for       voters across the country, and by ensuring that all voter       registration systems are inclusive and accessible for people       with disabilities. AVR alone could add an estimated 50       million people to the voter rolls and SDR increases voter       turnout by roughly 10 percent.        Combating voter purging: H.R. 1 would overturn the Supreme       Court's troubling 2018 decision in Husted v. A. Philip       Randolph Institute that allowed Ohio to conduct massive       purges from its voter rolls based on non-voting in past       elections. Such practices disproportionately target and       remove traditionally marginalized people from registration       rolls. Voting should not be a ``use it or lose it'' right.        Prohibiting deceptive practices and voter intimidation:       H.R. 1 would ban the distribution of false information about       elections to hinder or discourage voting. This provision is       particularly important in an era in which Facebook and other       digital platforms have been readily manipulated to spread       misinformation about the time, place, and manner of voting to       vulnerable communities. The bill would also increase the       criminal penalties for intimidating a voter for the purpose       of interfering with their right to vote, or causing them to       vote for or against a candidate.        Banning voter caging: H.R. 1 would ban voter caging and       prevent challenges to voters' eligibility to vote by       individuals who are not election officials, unless the       challenge is accompanied by an oath under penalty of perjury       that the challenger has a good faith factual basis to believe       the person is ineligible to vote or register to vote.        Creating a federal holiday and ensuring early voting and       polling place notice: H.R. 1 would make Election Day a       federal holiday. It would also require at least 15       consecutive days of early voting, including weekends, in       federal elections and ensure that early voting polling places       are accessible by public transportation. The bill would also       require that voters be given a minimum of seven days' notice       if the state decides to change their polling place location.        Reforming redistricting: H.R. 1 would be a milestone in the       battle against the extreme partisan gerrymandering our       country has witnessed in recent years, by requiring states to       draw congressional districts using independent redistricting       commissions that are bipartisan and reflect the demographic       diversity of the region. The bill would establish fair       redistricting criteria and ensure compliance with the VRA to       safeguard voting rights for communities of color.        Modernizing election administration: H.R. 1 would       reauthorize the Election Assistance Commission--an       independent, bipartisan commission that plays a vital role in       ensuring the reliability and security of voting equipment       used in our nation's elections. It would also promote       election reliability and  [[Page H2525]]       security by requiring voter-verified permanent paper ballots       and enhanced poll worker recruitment and training. And H.R. 1       would prohibit state election administrators from taking an       active part in a political campaign over which they have       supervisory authority.        H.R. 1 would also make significant advances in the areas of       campaign finance and ethics reform. It would correct the       rampant corruption flowing from the corrosive power of money       in our elections. It would replace the current campaign       finance system that empowers the super-rich and big       corporations with one that relies on small donors and public       matching funds. It would end secret election spending and       force disclosure of all election-related spending. And it       would call for a constitutional amendment to overturn the       disturbing Citizens United decision that made it impossible       to restrict outside spending by corporations or billionaires.       In addition, H.R. 1 addresses our government ethics crisis       by, among other things, requiring the development of a code       of conduct for Supreme Court Justices to enhance       accountability on ethics and recusal issues; overhauling the       Office of Government Ethics to strengthen federal ethics       oversight; establishing more robust conflict of interest       requirements for government officials; prohibiting members of       Congress from using taxpayer dollars to settle allegations of       employment discrimination; and requiring presidents to       disclose their tax returns.        H.R. 1--the For the People Act--provides a North Star for       the democracy reform agenda. It is a bold, comprehensive       reform package that offers solutions to a broken democracy.       Repairing and modernizing our voting system goes hand in hand       with reforms that address the rampant corruption flowing from       the corrosive power of money in our elections, and reforms       that address the myriad ethical problems that plague all       three branches of the federal government. The reforms in H.R.       1 are necessary to advance racial justice and ensure that our       government works for all people, not just a powerful few. The       civil and human rights coalition is strongly committed to       expanding the franchise and fixing our democracy, and we urge       Congress to pass this historic legislation.

Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we have no additional speakers at this  point.   I would just note that--and I understand the gentleman's points one  through four. I completely agree. It is number five in your amendment  that causes me concern about whether there is actually an undercutting  of H.R. 1's disclosure requirements, and that is the concern we have  and why I am so sorry that I cannot support the amendment.   I do think that we have a disagreement over disclosure. I don't  understand why, because the Supreme Court, including Justice Scalia,  recommended that to us, and we never followed up with Justice Scalia's  admonition that we should have disclosure as a remedy for concern over  unlimited money.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I understand, but the concern that has been  expressed to me by a number of people who have read this, probably  lawyers who spent more time on constitutional cases than I have, is  that the concern is that this, as a part of the bill, would undercut  the disclosure requirements that are established within it, and that is  the reason we cannot come to an agreement.    This is a splendid amendment. It will do a lot to allow  young people to channel their excitement and to understand they are  important and they are going to be participating as voters when they  turn 18. It works well with the amendment that will be offered by Mr.  Neguse later that allows for preregistration of 16- and 17-year-olds so  that when they turn 18 they will automatically be registered to vote.   I know that there is some concern on both sides of the aisle about  the idea of a 16-year-old preregistering, that change in the voting  eligibility. We don't know how that amendment will turn out, but  certainly these amendments would do much to make sure that young people  are thoroughly connected to our government and understand that the  government belongs to them and their families.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Chair, nothing in H.R. 1 impacts any State law that requires an  individual who has been convicted of an offense against a child staying  away from a school. Luckily, we have vote-by-mail and early voting at  county facilities in the bill, so that is really not a real issue.                                time  1345     Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendment aims to exempt States that have taken measures to  increase voter turnout that are not subject to additional Federal voter  registration mandates, and I think what it really does is undermine the  progress that would be made under H.R. 1.   In November of 2016, the general election, nearly one in five people  who were eligible to vote but who did not vote cited registration  issues as their main reason for not casting a ballot.   H.R. 1 sets a national standard for voter registration and access to  the ballot in Federal elections.   Now, an improvement in participation rates is fine, but it doesn't  mean that proven programs, such as the automatic voter registration  program, aren't necessary.   You know, automatic voter registration is not simply to increase  turnout. It serves a more fundamental purpose: to protect the right to  vote by removing bureaucracy and obstacles from the process of  registering to vote.   Now, nearly every State that has implemented automatic voter  registration has seen dramatically increased registration rates. High  rates of voter registration are inherently healthy for a democracy.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter that I received just  yesterday from Kate Brown, the Governor of Oregon.                                                 State of Oregon,                                                      March 6, 2019.        Dear Members of Congress: I write in strong support of H.R.       1, the For the People Act of 2019, which includes bold and       necessary reforms to strengthen our democracy, protect and       expand voting rights for all Americans, and improve campaign       finance laws. As the Governor of Oregon and former Secretary       of State, this is an issue that I--like many Americans--care       deeply about, and I urge you to vote in support of this       legislation.        Voting is our country's greatest collective responsibility,       and we must work continuously to safeguard the sanctity of       our elections. Across the country, the fundamental right of       voting itself is increasingly at risk. More states are moving       to obstruct voting rights than are increasing access to the       ballot. It's imperative that Congress take action to bolster       our democracy and fight every effort to undermine it by       ensuring that, as a country, we are making it easier, not       harder, for people to have their voices heard.        Several key provisions in H.R. 1 reflect the work that       Oregon has done to lead the way on expanding voter access,       including creating a national automatic voter registration       system, allowing citizens to register to vote online, and       expanding vote-by-mail.        As you know, Oregon was the first state to pass automatic       voter registration (AVR) in 2015. This law, combined with our       vote-by-mail election system, makes Oregon the most modern,       efficient, and secure state to vote in the country. Oregon's       AVR program has added nearly 400,000 voters to the state       rolls, already significantly increased voter turnout, and has       ensured 90 percent of eligible voters in our state are       registered.        Across the country, this success is being recognized and       replicated. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia       have since adopted some form of automatic voter registration.       These reforms have been successful in creating a stronger and       more inclusive democracy. And here in Oregon, it's supported       by both Democrats and Republicans.        Every eligible voter in the U.S. should have equal, easy       access to the ballot box, and I commend Congress for their       focus on this critical issue. This week, I urge you to pass       this important legislation.            Sincerely,                                               Governer Kate Brown.     Madam Chair, Governor Brown notes that Oregon was the  first State to have automatic voter registration. It went into effect  in 2015 and has added nearly 400,000 voters to the State rolls. Nearly  90 percent of eligible voters are, in fact, registered to vote. What  that means is they can participate in our elections, which I think is  very important.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the spirit with which this  amendment is offered, but I disagree.   This is about Federal elections. The Constitution says that the  Congress has the ability to promulgate laws about Federal elections.   The reason why we are looking at it is there have been States who  have gone into AVR, they are grandfathered into the bill, but the  problematic States are those States that are trying to suppress the  vote, trying to keep people from voting, and we need to do something  about that.   Madam Chair, while we are here, I do want to say something about, not  the gentleman's comments, but the prior comments of the ranking member  about the costs of the bill.   We have a score from CBO, and almost all the money that CBO has  scored goes to grants to the States to upgrade their computer systems:  $1.5 billion from 2019 to 2024; 750 for other computer assistance; and  the other big amount is for making polling places accessible to  disabled voters. So it is not about the other provisions in the bill.   I would also like to note, and I put this into the Record yesterday,  the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that the fine and  forfeiture fund that will go into the Freedom From Influence Fund is  estimated to raise $1.948 billion between 2019 and 2029. They also  estimate that it will reduce the deficit by $83 million, which is  interesting, because it will deter people from cheating on their taxes.  So the comments made about the money were simply incorrect.   I know that the Joint Committee on Taxation material is in the Record  under general leave. I will make sure that the CBO report is also  included.   Madam Chair, I would just end with this: I appreciate the tone of the  gentleman's arguments and the intent of his amendment, but I do think  it severely undercuts the advances that H.R. 1 would make.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I think there has been a lot of talk about  transparency today. We have had a transparent process in the  committees, 15 hours of hearings, but this repeals a rider that was  privately put on an appropriations bill by Republicans to prevent the  SEC from doing something that they want to do.   Let's get real. I mean, this actually just undoes a secret rider on  an appropriations bill. This is the way bad law gets made.   We are here in the middle of the day, in public, debating amendments,  not secretly putting little riders on appropriations bills that  hamstrung the SEC for making sure that there is sunlight on what  corporations are doing.   I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Madam Chair, just to note, Congress never intended for  501(c), for social welfare organizations to just be conduits for dark  campaign spending.   In exchange for nonprofit status and tax exempt status, the law  requires them to engage exclusively in the promotion of social welfare.   Now, how is that defined? The IRS was trying to get a bright line on  that, but they were stopped by a secret rider put in an appropriations  bill.   Obviously, the appropriation at large got votes from both sides of  the aisle because you need to keep the government down. But that is not  the way you legislate. That is a sneaky way to change the law.   To repeal this provision of H.R. 1 would be a huge mistake, because  what we are doing is setting things right so that people know what they  can do and what they can't do.   Yes, you can speak, but don't expect to get a tax break because you  are speaking about politics. You get a tax break because you are doing  charitable work.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Madam Chair, I think this amendment improves the bill.  It revises the election infrastructure grant program and includes an  emphasis on increasing voter participation, in addition to the emphasis  on improving election infrastructure that is currently included in H.R.  1.   I am especially pleased that it engages the National Institute of  Standards and Technology, NIST, which is really the premier agency to  help us on technical issues. So I think it is a very good amendment.   And while I have the floor, I would like to note that I will include  in the Record a letter from the AFL-CIO and a letter from the American  Federation of Teachers urging support of H.R. 1.                                                         AFL-CIO,                                      Washington, DC, March 5, 2019.      United States House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I am writing       to express our strong support for H.R. 1, the ``For the       People Act of 2019.'' By expanding access to the ballot box,       reducing the influence of big money in politics and       strengthening ethics rules for public servants, this       legislation includes many of the most important reforms       necessary to restore the promise of our democracy.        For years, right-wing groups backed by wealthy donors have       been working aggressively to suppress the right of every       American citizen to cast a ballot. They have supported laws       to make it harder to register and to vote and they have used       the corrosive power of money to drown out the voices of       working people.        H.R. I would expand the franchise by promoting early       voting, same day and online registration. It would create a       system of public financing powered by small donations and       require super PACS and dark money political organizations to       make their donors public. It would restore voting rights for       formerly incarcerated individuals and commit Congress to       restore the Voting Rights Act to end racial discrimination in       voting.        Record wealth inequality, mass incarceration and low voter       turnout are all symptoms of a broken political system. AFL-      CIO proudly supports H.R. 1 as we continue the fight to fix       our democracy and restore the balance of power to working       people.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,      Director, Government Affairs Department.                                   ____                                  American Federation of Teachers,                                      Washington, DC, March 6, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.7 million members       of the American Federation of Teachers, I urge you to vote       YES on H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2019.        There is no question that we have seen an erosion of voting       rights, a loosening or ignoring of ethics rules and conduct,       and an ever-increasing presence of big money in elections.       All of this undermines America's democracy. That is why       passage of H.R. 1 is so important. It represents a historic       effort to restore both the rights of working people and the       promise of our nation's democracy. It will give power back to       the people by limiting the influence of the corrupt and by       expanding voting rights for all Americans.        The For the People Act will strengthen the government's       ethics laws while imposing much-needed restrictions on       campaign finance regulations. For far too long, the influence       of money in politics--especially unaccountable ``dark money''       funneled into our system by wealthy individuals and large       companies--has been a negative force in elections across our       nation. The bill will put an end to anonymous election       spending and force disclosure of all election-related       spending.        The AFT also strongly supports H.R. 1's call for a       constitutional amendment to overturn the disturbing Citizens       United decision. This case has had a corrosive effect on our       democracy, giving powerful corporations a disproportionate       amount of influence in our elections. Since this case was       decided, big corporations have been using their record       profits to try to silence the voices of hardworking       Americans. No donor should be able to hide its identity as it       floods the system with hundreds of millions of dollars in an       effort to pass an extreme agenda that will gut the salary,       healthcare and pensions of workers.        It's time to restore balance and guarantee that a teacher       in Cleveland has the same voice in our democracy as a CEO on       Wall Street. H.R. 1 moves us in that direction.        The bill's promise to focus on voting is absolutely       essential as a civil rights matter and as a democracy issue.       It commits to restoring the Voting Rights Act; restoring       voting rights for formerly incarcerated people; reforming       voter registration; combating voter purging; prohibiting       deceptive practices and voter intimidation; creating a       federal holiday for Election Day; ensuring early voting and       polling place notice; reforming redistricting; and       modernizing election administration.        Expanding voting rights in 2019 is vital to our democracy.       It's hard to understand how any members of the House of       Representatives would vote against it, yet we have seen all       too frequently an allegiance to partisan politics rather than       to the basic values of civic participation.        Passage of H.R. 1 will help confront the many real threats       facing our democracy today. I hope you will vote YES when it       comes up for a vote this week in the House.            Sincerely,                                                  Randi Weingarten,                                                         President.     Madam Chairwoman, I appreciate the thoughtful comments  made by the ranking member, but I do think this is a special situation,  and it is why the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund is in support  of this amendment.   As the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund has noticed, the  practice of counting prison inmates as part of the district where the  prison is located has a disproportionate impact on African American and  Latino communities. That is because members of those communities, for a  variety of other bad reasons, are incarcerated at higher rates and  housed at prisons farther from their homes than other communities.   The gentleman from Illinois is correct. You may be counted in the  census at your university dorm, but you can also vote from your  university dorm. The inmates can't vote.   Actually, they are properly allocated to the communities where they  are from. Doing otherwise has the impact of disenfranchising  communities of color around the United States, and that is why this  amendment is an important one and why the Brennan Center for Justice  and the NAACP supports it.   I thank the gentleman for offering the amendment.  [[Page H2538]]         Madam Chairwoman, I support this amendment, given the  level of foreign interference in the elections in 2016 and 2018 and  efforts to penetrate our voting systems. I think it makes sense that we  use American-manufactured systems as well as software. But I would note  this: this amendment is not proscriptive. It says that ``States shall  seek to ensure.'' That is not a mandate to do it. Really, this is  saying this is a good thing to do. I think it is a good thing to do.   While I have the microphone, I would like to note that we have just  received  [[Page H2539]]  a letter from 27 religious institutions, including the Alliance of  Baptists, African American Ministers In Action, the National Council of  Churches, the NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice and the  Presbyterian Church in the United States, in favor of H.R. 1, which I  include in the Record.                                                     March 6, 2019.        Dear Representative: As national faith-based advocates and       congregations we urge passage of H.R. 1--the For the People       Act. Our organizations strive for policies and systems that       diminish inequality, support the most vulnerable, nurture       human potential, and protect the health and well-being of all       members of our society and of creation. We look to our       government to reflect those ideals and we support a strong       democracy:        . . . where voting is a fundamental right and a civic       responsibility.        . . . that serves the people rather than the private       interests of public officials and wealthy political donors.        . . . where our influence is based on the force of ideas,       not the size of our wallets.        . . . where people know who is trying to gain influence       over our representatives, who is trying to influence our       votes, and how and why policy is being made.        . . . that works to respond to the needs of all people and       their communities, building trust in governance and equity.        A broken democracy has clear and detrimental impacts on the       issues important to us. We are faithful advocates who work       within the existing political system, yet that system no       longer seems capable of contending with the big problems       facing our country, our communities, and our congregations.       The faith community offers witness to what is obvious to most       Americans: our democracy is out of balance.        The current system allows powerful corporate and wealthy       interests to regularly defy the foundational principles of       fairness, equity, ethics, accountability, and respect for the       rule of law. The unfortunate result is that our government       has become more responsive and accountable to wealthy       political donors than to the public. Today's broken       democratic system subjugates deeply held, age-old values to       the profit motive.        People of faith know that Washington is not representing       their best interests when millions of Americans who are       eligible to vote cannot do so because they are not       registered, voter ID laws are used as a tool to suppress the       vote, millions of Americans are disenfranchised due to a       felony conviction, and a number of states are improperly       purging eligible voters from the registration rolls.        People of faith know that Washington is not representing       their best interests when congressional districts are drawn       to achieve highly partisan results at the expense of fair       representation for citizens.        People of faith know that Washington is not representing       their best interests when ethics rules governing our highest       leaders and decision-makers are deeply flawed and are not       subject to proper oversight and enforcement.        People of faith know that Washington is more accountable to       corporate interests than to the public when they can spend       huge sums of money influencing our elections and our       government.        People of faith know that we can't fix the issues that the       faith community cares about the most--such as poverty,       immigration, climate change, racial justice and health care--      until we fix our democracy.        To that end, the undersigned national faith organizations       support H.R. 1, The For the People Act.        We recognize the historic opportunity our country faces to       repair our political system and, as people of faith, we are       hopeful in the possibility of renewal.        We applaud efforts to reform our election processes and our       governing politics so that the interests of all are served,       not just those with money.        We support attempts to restore ethical norms which inhibit       self-interested corruption on the part of lawmakers.        We support provisions that enhance the influence of low-      income and middle-income people on policy-making through       their vote and their engagement in the civic body.        We support campaign finance reforms that sustain and       encourage elected officials to serve their constituents and       to legislate on behalf of the common good.        We embrace reforms that favor accountability and       transparency in our government and in our lawmakers'       decision-making.        We urge Congress to seize this moment to pass the       comprehensive democracy reform H.R. 1.

Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.   This amendment clarifies that the election administration improvement  grants that are in the bill may be used by localities or the States to  implement and model best practices for ballot design, ballot  instructions, and, I will say, testing of ballots, which is very  important.   Most of the grants are really oriented towards computer systems,  which is also very important, but I have seen some of these ballots  where you could see why you could get confused; and, really, if you  look at our friends in the tech world, you can design something so you  vote yes or no just by the way the design is done.   Now, I think most of the ballot mistakes--there is no evidence it is  by intention; it was just error. But you can create something so that  people make a mistake.   The last thing we want for the most precious right that we have is  for people to make inadvertent errors. We want people to cast their  votes for whom they choose and then to have their vote counted for  whomever it is they choose. It is that simple.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for the amendment. I think it is  a good one.    Madam Chair, I commend Mr. Beyer and Mr. Butterfield for  this amendment providing grants.   Over the period of time that the bill covers, this is actually a  pretty small amount of money, and it is subject to appropriations.   I do think it is difficult to put a price on our democracy. We need  to make sure that young people are involved from the get-go. We have  seen that young people don't necessarily have the tools to become  engaged in our democracy.   It is fine if our ranking member gave his instruction to his twins  around the dinner table. I commend him for that. But not every person  in America has been so fortunate, and we need every American to  participate.   I would like to say that this amendment, coupled with Mr. Al Green's  amendment for the pilot project and Mr. Neguse's amendment, which will  come later in the proceedings, really does put on the agenda outreach  to the young people of America to participate in our democracy.   I know that there are people on both sides of the aisle who have  concerns about changing the voting age in this bill and want to study  that further. For  [[Page H2542]]  those people, these amendments are going to create vigorous outreach to  the young people of America so they can be participants, and I commend  the gentlemen for offering it.    Madam Chair, first, I would like to thank Congressmen  Brown and Crist for an excellent amendment that improves the bill  considerably.   On the point just raised by the ranking member, the report given by  the Joint Committee on Taxation was put into the Record yesterday, and  it is their estimate of how much will be raised, and their estimate  that we will reduce the deficit by $83 million.   We are waiting; the CBO is crunching numbers, which is hard to do  because each amendment has to be crunched as we go along.   But I will say this: During the markup in the House Administration  Committee, we did outline the vessel for the Freedom From Influence  Fund. We didn't have the jurisdiction to do the assessment on criminal  wrongdoing by corporations and tax cheats, but we did create the  Freedom From Influence Fund, and we did create the step-down on the  program if there is insufficient funding. So this is not a new thing.   I think it is sound policy.    Madam Chair, I just want to say how much I appreciate  the amendment offered by Mr. Brown. It improves the bill by making sure  that voters are notified, not just 7 days before the poll is moved, but  before early voting begins, maximizing the opportunity to actually get  to the poll.   Many Americans, right now, have a single day to vote, and if you are  a working person, you may not even have time off, you may not even be  able to get to the polling place. That is what H.R. 1 is all about.    And just getting to the federalism issue. Article I, section 4  explicitly says, ``Congress may at any time by law make or alter such  regulations'' about Federal elections. That is what we are doing here.   We need to do more because there are jurisdictions in our country  that are specifically trying to prevent people from voting based on  race. That is why we have got the Voting Rights Act that  [[Page H2545]]  is going to be coming later. We are compiling the evidentiary record  for the Voting Rights Act right now.   But this bill just relates to Federal elections which we have  jurisdiction to do. We need to make sure that the efforts to keep  people from exercising their right to vote in Federal elections are  defeated. That is what H.R. 1 is about. That is what Mr. Brown's  amendment is about, and I am grateful to him for offering it.    Madam Chair, I would like to commend the gentleman for  this amendment.   When you make a phone call in to complain about harassment or  intimidation, that information may or may not ever become known, so  this is really a pro-transparency measure.   The amendment says: ``together with a description of actions taken in  response to such instances of voter intimidation or suppression.''   The State legislatures may not know, we may not know how many efforts  are being made. We should know that to see whether what we have done  here is sufficient, whether the Voting Rights Act that will be  following along this bill later in the spring needs to address this.   Madam Chair, this is an excellent amendment.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Butterfield) having assumed the chair, Ms. Haaland, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1) to  expand Americans' access to the ballot box, reduce the influence of big  money in politics, and strengthen ethics rules for public servants, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, it is a good amendment because it allows the  FEC to be represented in an effective way.   As to the underlying bill, I can't think of another agency of the  Federal Government, commission, where you have an even number. Most  have an uneven number so you don't have deadlocks.   We are deadlocked at the FEC. They are dead in the water.    Is it because of bipartisanship? Right now there are two Republican  commissioners, one Democratic commissioner, one independent  commissioner, and two vacancies. They can't make a decision.   There are backlogged cases that go on for years. This is really a  disservice to America to not be able to play that cop on the beat,  because it is a completely dysfunctional agency.   We need to change that. And that is what the underlying bill does. It  allows a nonpartisan career staff to make initial fundings. It provides  that there can be no more than two commissioners in the same party, so  we are not going to have a partisan takeover. And then it allows the  commission to overrule the nonpartisan staff, if necessary.   We need reform at the FEC. This amendment is part of it, and I credit  the gentleman for offering it.    Mr. Chairman, I congratulate the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts for simply an excellent amendment. This strengthens the  provisions in the underlying bill to make sure that agents of foreign  principals would have no role in these commissions.   I think it is important that we understand that the citizens who  serve on these commissions have no agenda, not for one party or the  other, and certainly not for some foreign country.   It is really a very good amendment. I am so glad that she offered it.    Mr. Chairman, I want to say what a smart amendment this  is, and I am so grateful that the gentlewoman from Massachusetts has  taken the time to put this together.   We all care about our men and women in the armed services, to make  sure they are treated fairly. But over the years we have been here,  none of us came up with this amendment before this evening.   I really thank the gentlewoman. Great kudos to her. We are lucky that  she is a Member of our House of Representatives.   Like the ranking member, I will be happy to vote ``aye'' on this  amendment. I think it is very important, and I am grateful to the  gentlewoman for offering it.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, I would remind the gentleman of the recycled  ballot amendment that had passed earlier today relative to the issue of  cutting down trees.    Mr. Chairman, this just goes to show how lucky we are  that someone with the background of Congresswoman Spanberger has been  elected to the House. With her background in the CIA, we gain a special  expertise on issues of national security.   You know, States don't have a CIA, they don't have an NSA, and if  foreign actors are attacking us, they are not in a position to find  that out.   I think that the gentlewoman from Virginia understands the workings  of our national security agencies and the importance of giving them  metrics on what to do and with whom so that we are completely safe.   Mr. Chair, I am so delighted that she has offered this very smart  amendment, and I look forward to approving it, and I thank her so much  for the wisdom that she brings to the House.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Chair, I join in the celebration of the new Members  of this House of Representatives. The gentlewoman from Michigan has  experience in preserving our national security. Not everyone who is  here serving has done what she has done, and the gentlewoman who  preceded her.    Our body is richer because of the experience that they have brought  to this Congress, and I think this excellent amendment really is a  product of the expertise that she brings to this institution.   I am grateful for her amendment. I look forward to joining the  ranking member in approving it and in celebrating her service to our  country here in the House of Representatives.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  Hill of California) having assumed the chair, Mr. Cuellar, Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1) to  expand Americans' access to the ballot box, reduce the influence of big  money in politics, and strengthen ethics rules for public servants, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
