 Mr. Speaker, I cannot overstate the solemnness and  sadness that I feel right now.   To see the House so debased by the invocation of our most grave  constitutional duty--impeachment of a President--should disturb every  patriotic American.   Just 49 years ago, Barbara Jordan, the great gentlewoman from Texas,  invoked the solemnity with which any serious Member of Congress must  approach our duties, and particularly the circumstances under which we  should consider impeachment.                                time  1115    That solemnity has guided the majority in this House in recent years  as we have tried to navigate an extraordinarily tumultuous time in  service to our Nation and our constituents--a time in which we have  seen a rogue former President run roughshod over the guardrails of  democracy and decency, compromising our national security and  disparaging the courts, the free press, law enforcement, Congress, and  anyone who would try to hold him accountable.   During that time, we impeached former President Trump twice, but we  did so based upon a careful and close study of law, history, our  Constitution, and rigorous factfinding, as well as consideration of the  impact upon our country. We prayed. We prayed for guidance to discharge  our duties to our country, our constituents, and our Constitution with  fidelity.   Today, as we confront this deeply unserious effort to impeach a  President to serve partisan political posturing and political  profiteering, I have to return to the words of Barbara Jordan.   She cautioned: ``Common sense would be revolted if we engaged upon  this process for petty reasons. Congress has a lot to do:  appropriations, tax reform, health insurance, campaign finance reform,  housing, environmental protection, energy sufficiency, and mass  transportation. Pettiness cannot be allowed to stand in the face of  such overwhelming problems.''   Jordan's words could not ring more true today. Common sense is  revolted by the political grandstanding and petty stunts allowed by the  House majority. Days on end are wasted catering to the whims of an  extremist minority.   We are marking 6 months of one of the least productive Congresses in  history. Under the control of this MAGA majority, we have made no  progress in addressing the most pressing issues facing America, whether  gun violence, hunger, opioid abuse, housing, immigration, health costs,  tax reform, or the environment.   So I must oppose both this rule and the resolution, because in the  words of Congresswoman Jordan: ``My faith in the Constitution is whole;  it is complete; it is total. And I am not going to sit here and be an  idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the destruction, of  the Constitution.''
