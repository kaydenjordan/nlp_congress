 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise to address the Biden administration's reckless  decision to use taxpayer dollars to purchase weapons and ammunition for  the IRS, which is a tax collection agency.   Last year, the American people were shocked to learn that the Biden  administration was providing billions of dollars to the IRS to hire  80,000 new agents, whose job it will be to go after hardworking,  middle-class Americans.   The IRS should be focused on assisting our constituents with tax  compliance and ensuring Americans receive their entitled refund, not  focusing on arming its agents with the aim of further extorting the  American taxpayer.   The majority of Americans don't trust the government to be good  stewards of their tax dollars. Arming the IRS certainly will not  inspire new hope in our system.   Let me make one thing clear. Washington does not have a tax  collection problem. It has a spending problem.   By disarming our tax collectors, this amendment offers us an  opportunity to refocus the image of the IRS and restore faith in our  government. After all, under President Biden, our agencies have been  weaponized enough.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I understand why the IRS criminal  investigation agents carry weapons. I am looking at a 2019 report where  it was reported that by the end of 2017 the IRS already had 4,487 guns  and over 5 million rounds of ammunition. I don't know what they need  that for.   When we have more agents carrying weapons than we do marines carrying  weapons, that is a problem.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the last thing I heard is that we  have a couple people who haven't paid taxes. Hunter Biden is one, and  more than likely so is President Biden. The IRS should not be the  agency that goes after criminals. That is an agency called the FBI.   If they want to enforce the border with guns, then go after the 8  million plus illegals that are coming across the border and also the  known terrorists that we have in this country.   Mr. Chairman, this is my amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support my commonsense amendment which would defund and effectively  eliminate the Biden administration's pro-abortion and pro-transgender  policy council which is housed in the Executive Office of the  President. The Biden administration has declared war on science, basic  biology, and the concept of gender.   The American taxpayer should not be funding an office in the White  House that is dedicated to spreading this administration's woke DEI  agenda. Americans should know what DEI really stands for: division,  exclusion, and indoctrination.   Through various directives such as the Department of Education,  President Biden has made it abundantly clear that his priorities are  not promoting the policies that benefit the majority of Americans but  are promoting an extreme agenda.   They are forcing our daughters to compete against biological males in  sports, forcing young women to share locker rooms and bathrooms with  men, and launching pressure campaigns to encourage minors to take life  altering hormones or undergo experimental surgeries.   One must ask: Why are we promoting these radical policies, and why is  the taxpayer funding it?   The White House Gender Policy Council's executive director wants to  lecture Americans, specifically our children, about her belief that  racism and sexism are somehow built into our health system. The White  House Gender Policy Council exists in a White House that is incapable  of defining what a woman is.   This amendment is as much about curbing wasteful and unnecessary  government spending and being good stewards of taxpayer money as it is  about putting an end to the Biden administration's far left ideology  being forced on Americans and their children.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have a question as to why we even  [[Page H5622]]  have a gender policy council when that authority should fall under the  Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Becerra. I  think it is a redundancy that we do not need.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, nowhere in my remarks did I mention the  Hyde amendment. I am talking about a gender policy council that should  not exist.   For over 40 years we have had the Hyde amendment in place to where  American taxpayer dollars didn't go to fund abortion.   Nowhere did I say that a woman shouldn't have a right to do what she  wanted to do, but with the Roe v. Wade reversal, that decision went  back to the States where it rightly belonged. In my opinion, over the  last 40 to 50 years women have been indoctrinated to think it was a  constitutional right to abortion, and it never was.                                time  1630    I am here to set the record straight. It went back to the States  where it belongs. All I am trying to say is that we need to get rid of  the Gender Policy Council. If they want to put that anywhere, HHS is  the Department that it should fall under.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
