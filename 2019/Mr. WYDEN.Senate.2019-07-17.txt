 Mr. President, on October 22, 2018, the Departments of  Health and Human Services and the Treasury issued a document, entitled  State Relief and Empowerment Waivers, relating to section 1332 of the  Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations.   Although it was not submitted to Congress for review under the  Congressional Review Act, CRA, this so-called guidance document seemed  to me to be a substantive rule that should be subject to review under  the CRA. Accordingly, I wrote a letter, along with Chairman Pallone of  the House Energy and Commerce Committee, asking the U.S. Government  Accountability Office, GAO, to determine whether the CRA applied.   This week, I received a reply, in which the GAO general counsel  concludes that the 2018 guidance ``is a rule under the CRA, which  requires that it be submitted to Congress for review.''   I ask unanimous consent that the letter from GAO, dated July 15,  2019, be printed in the Congressional Record following my remarks. The  letter I am now submitting to be printed in the Congressional Record is  the original document provided by GAO to my office. I will also provide  a copy of the GAO letter to the Parliamentarian's office.   Based on Senate precedent, my understanding is that the publication  of the GAO legal opinion in today's Record will start the ``clock'' for  congressional review under the provisions of the CRA.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                     U.S. Government                                           Accountability Office,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.      Subject: Department of Health and Human Services and           Department of the Treasury--Applicability of the           Congressional Review Act to State Relief and Empowerment           Waivers       Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives.        This responds to your request for our legal opinion as to       whether guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human       Services (HHS) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury)       on October 22, 2018, entitled ``State Relief and Empowerment       Waivers'' (2018 Guidance), is a rule for purposes of the       Congressional Review Act (CRA). Letter from Ranking Member of       the Committee on  [[Page S4902]]       Finance, United States Senate, and Chairman of the Committee       on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, to       Comptroller General (Feb. 6, 2019). The 2018 Guidance at       issue relates to section 1332 of the Patient Protection and       Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and its implementing regulations.       Pub. L. No. 111-148, Sec. 1332, 124 Stat. 119, 203-206 (Mar.       23, 2010) (classified at 42 U.S.C. Sec. 18052); 45 C.F.R. pt.       155. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the       2018 Guidance is a rule under the CRA, which requires that it       be submitted to Congress for review.        Our practice when rendering opinions is to contact the       relevant agencies and obtain their legal views on the subject       of the request.

We contacted HHS and Treasury to obtain the agencies' views.       Letter from Managing Associate General Counsel, GAO, to       General Counsel, HHS (Mar. 4, 2019); Letter from Managing       Associate General Counsel, GAO, to General Counsel, Treasury       (Mar. 4, 2019). We received a response on March 22, 2019.       Letter from General Counsel, HHS, to Managing Associate       General Counsel, GAO (Mar. 22, 2019) (HHS Letter).                                  BACKGROUND         PPACA requires that most United States citizens and legal       residents maintain health coverage that meets minimum       requirements. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 18021. PPACA also requires the       establishment of exchanges in every state so that individuals       and small businesses can purchase such coverage and contains       requirements for exchange functions, such as maintaining web       portals for individuals and small businesses to access the       exchange and call centers to provide customer service. 42       U.S.C. Sec. 18003(a). In addition, PPACA provides for premium       tax credits and cost-sharing reductions for eligible       individuals, among other things. 26 U.S.C. Sec. 36B.        Section 1332 of the statute permits states to seek federal       approval to waive certain key requirements under the law. See       42 U.S.C. Sec. 18052. For example, section 1332 authorizes       HHS and Treasury to approve state proposals to waive PPACA       requirements related to, among other things, the maintenance       of insurance coverage for individuals, exchange functions,       and subsidies for exchange coverage. 42 U.S.C.       Sec. 18052(a)(2). PPACA requires that state 1332 proposals       meet four approval criteria. Specifically, a state proposal       must demonstrate that the waiver will result in coverage that       is at least as comprehensive, at least as affordable, and       available to at least a comparable number of residents as       would have been provided without the waiver, and that the       waiver will not increase the federal deficit. 42 U.S.C.       Sec. 18052(b)(1)(A)-(D).        PPACA required that the Secretaries of HHS and Treasury       promulgate regulations relating to waivers under section 1332       of PPACA. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 18052(a)(4)(B). The regulations were       required to include processes for (1) public notice and       comment at the state level sufficient to ensure a meaningful       level of public input, (2) the submission of an application       that ensures the disclosure of the provisions of law that the       state involved seeks to waive, (3) additional public notice       and comment after the application is received, (4) a process       for the submission of periodic reports concerning       implementation of the program under the waiver, and (5)       periodic evaluation of the program under the waiver. Id. HHS       and Treasury issued such regulations on February 27, 2012.       Application, Review, and Reporting Process for Waivers for       State Innovation, 77 Fed. Reg. 11700 (Feb. 27, 2012)       (codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 155).        On December 16, 2015, HHS and Treasury issued guidance       prescribing what a state needs to demonstrate for a waiver       proposal to meet the statutory criteria under section 1332 of       PPACA and how the proposed waiver will be evaluated. Waivers       for State Innovation, 80 Fed. Reg. 78131 (Dec. 16, 2015)       (2015 Guidance). For example, the 2015 Guidance provided that       assessment of whether the proposal meets the coverage and       affordability criteria must take into account effects across       different groups of state residents, such that even if a       state could demonstrate that the waiver would provide       coverage to a comparable number of residents overall, it       would not be approved if it reduced coverage for vulnerable       groups, like low-income or elderly individuals. Id. at 78132.        In 2018, the Departments issued new guidance superseding       the 2015 Guidance. 83 Fed. Reg. 53575 (Oct. 24, 2018).       According to HHS and Treasury, the Departments reviewed the       2015 Guidance in accordance with Executive Order 13765 issued       in January 2017, which, among other things, called for       executive branch agencies with responsibilities under PPACA       to ``exercise all authority and discretion available to them       to provide greater flexibility to states and cooperate with       them in implementing healthcare programs.'' Id. at 53584       (citing Exec. Order No. 13765, Minimizing the Economic Burden       of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending       Repeal, 82 Fed. Reg. 8351 (Jan. 24, 2017)). As a result of       this review, HHS issued updated guidance revising the       agency's policies implementing the statutory criteria for a       section 1332 waiver. In particular, the 2018 Guidance changed       the analysis of comprehensiveness and affordability       articulated in the 2015 Guidance. For example, as noted       above, the 2015 Guidance prohibited approval of a section       1332 waiver of a state plan that made coverage less       comprehensive or affordable for vulnerable groups of       residents; whereas, the 2018 Guidance provides that while       analysis will continue to consider effects on all categories       of residents, the revision gives states more flexibility to       decide that improvements in comprehensiveness and       affordability for state residents as a whole offset any small       detrimental effects for particular residents. 83 Fed. Reg. at       53578. In addition to providing new interpretations for       certain provisions of the 1332 waiver criteria, like the 2015       Guidance, the 2018 Guidance explains how the Departments will       evaluate each of the statutory requirements for a section       1332 waiver and what a state must include and demonstrate in       its waiver proposal to comply with each criterion.        CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight       of agency rulemaking, requires all federal agencies,       including independent regulatory agencies, to submit a report       on each new rule to both Houses of Congress and to the       Comptroller General before it can take effect. 5 U.S.C.       Sec. 801 (a)(1 ). The report must contain a copy of the rule,       ``a concise general statement relating to the rule,'' and       the rule's proposed effective date. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 801       (a)(1 )(A). In addition, the agency must submit to the       Comptroller General a complete copy of the cost-benefit       analysis of the rule, if any, and information concerning       the agency's actions relevant to specific procedural       rulemaking requirements set forth in various statutes and       executive orders governing the regulatory process. 5       U.S.C. Sec. 801 (a)(1 )(8).        CRA adopts the definition of rule under the Administrative       Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 551(4), which states that       a rule is ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of       general or particular applicability and future effect       designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy       or describing the organization, procedure, or practice       requirements of an agency.'' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 804(3). CRA       excludes three categories of rules from coverage:        (1) rules of particular applicability;        (2) rules relating to agency management or personnel; and        (3) rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice       that do not substantially affect the rights or obligations of       non-agency parties. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 804(3).        Neither HHS nor Treasury sent a CRA report on the 2018       Guidance to Congress or the Comptroller General.                                   ANALYSIS         To determine whether the 2018 Guidance is a rule subject to       review under CRA, we first address whether the Guidance meets       the APA definition of a rule. As explained below, we conclude       that it does. The next step, then, is to determine whether       any of the CRA exceptions apply. We conclude that they do       not.        We can readily conclude that the 2018 Guidance meets the       APA definition of a rule upon which the CRA relies. First,       the 2018 Guidance is an agency statement, as it was issued by       HHS and Treasury announcing supplementary information about       the requirements that must be met for the approval of a State       Innovation Waiver. Second, the Guidance is of future effect,       as the Departments state in the 2018 Guidance that the       document will be in effect on the date of publication and       will be applicable for section 1332 waivers submitted after       the publication date of the 2018 Guidance. Finally, the       Guidance is designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe       law or policy as it provides interpretations of the section       1332 criteria, sets forth what states need to provide to       demonstrate that a waiver proposal meets these statutory       criteria, and how the proposed waiver will be evaluated.        In 2012, we examined a substantially similar issue to the       one presented here and concluded that an Information       Memorandum issued by HHS concerning the Temporary Assistance       for Needy Families (TANF) program was a rule for purposes of       CRA. 8-323772, Sept. 4, 2012. The TANF program was       established by section 402 of the Social Security Act, and       provides federal funding to states for both traditional       welfare case assistance as well as a variety of other       benefits and services to meet the needs of low-income       families and children. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 601. Section 1115 of       the Social Security Act provides HHS with the authority to       waive compliance with the requirements of section 402 in       cases of experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects that       HHS determines are likely to assist in promoting the       objectives of TANF. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1315. The HHS Information       Memorandum at issue in our 2012 opinion sets forth       requirements that must be met for a waiver request to be       considered by HHS. We held that the HHS Information       Memorandum was concerned with authorizing demonstration       projects in the future, rather than evaluation of past or       present demonstration projects, and thus was prospective in       nature. We also found that because the Information Memorandum       stated that HHS will use its statutory authority to consider       waiver requests and set out requirements that waiver requests       must meet, it was designed to implement, interpret, or       prescribe law or policy. Like the HHS Information Memorandum       at issue in our 2012 decision, the 2018 Guidance at issue       here meets the definition of a rule.        We next consider whether the 2018 Guidance falls within one       of the exceptions enumerated in CRA. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 804(3)(A)-      (C). In this case, the 2018 Guidance is clearly a rule of       general and not particular applicability, as it applies to       all states. Additionally, the  [[Page S4903]]       Guidance is not a rule relating to agency management or       personnel. In that regard, our 2012 opinion regarding HHS's       Information Memorandum is instructive. See B-323772, at 4.       There, we found that the Information Memorandum did not       relate to agency management or personnel since it applied to       the states.        With respect to the final exception--for rules of agency       organization, procedure, or practice that do not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties--the Guidance issued by HHS and Treasury provides       requirements that a state must meet for a waiver proposal to       be approved. For that reason, these requirements affect the       obligations of states, which are non-agency parties. Our 2012       opinion is again instructive. There, we determined that       because the Information Memorandum set out the criteria by       which states may apply for waivers from certain obligations       of the states, the Information Memorandum affected the rights       and obligations of third parties and therefore did not fall       under CRA's third exception. We similarly find here that the       2018 Guidance does not fall under CRA's third exception.        We requested the views of the General Counsels of HHS and       Treasury on whether the 2018 Guidance is a rule for purposes       of CRA. Treasury deferred to HHS's response. HHS responded by       letter dated March 22, 2019, stating that the 2018 Guidance       is not a rule under CRA because it is not binding and if it       were rescinded, it would not alter or affect the rights and       obligations of any state or other stakeholder under PPACA.       HHS also noted that it informally notified member offices,       the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and Senate       Finance Committees, and the House Ways and Means and       Education and Labor Committees of the 2018 Guidance. See HHS       Letter at 1.        HHS provided a similar response when we requested its views       on its Information Memorandum concerning the TANF program.       See B-323772, at 5. As we noted in our 2012 opinion, the       definition of rule is expansive and specifically includes       documents that implement or interpret law or policy, whether       or not the agency characterizes the document as non-binding.       Id. (citing B-281575, January 20, 1999). Finally, as we have       stated previously, informal notification does not meet the       reporting requirements of CRA. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 801 (a)(1); B-      323772, at 5.                                  CONCLUSION         The 2018 Guidance sets forth what a state needs to provide       to demonstrate that its proposal meets the four criteria for       a waiver under section 1332 of PPACA and how the proposals       will be evaluated. The 2018 Guidance meets the APA definition       of a rule and does not fall under an exception as provided in       CRA. Accordingly, given our conclusions above, and in       accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 801(a)(1),       the 2018 Guidance is subject to the requirement that it be       submitted to both Houses of Congress and the Comptroller       General before it can take effect.        If you have any questions about this opinion, please       contact Shirley A. Jones, Managing Associate General Counsel,       or Janet Temko-Blinder, Assistant General Counsel.            Sincerely yours,                                               Thomas H. Armstrong,      General Counsel.                            ____________________
