 Mr. President, over the past 13 months, Americans  have endured extraordinary constraints on one of the most precious  rights guaranteed by our Constitution: the right to freely exercise  their religion. There is, perhaps, no freedom more intertwined with our  nation's history. It was religious freedom that drove persecuted  settlers from England to America just over 400 years ago. And they were  not the last. Over the centuries, countless religious minorities from  across the world have come to America, seeking refuge from religious  warfare and bigotry.   To be clear, we haven't always lived up to this ideal. Members of the  church to which I belong were forced to flee across the country due to  religious persecution, to name just one example. Despite these  aberrations, however, no nation in the history of the world has  protected and preserved the rights of religion and conscience like the  United States.And that's not an accident. The First Congress recognized  the profound importance of religious freedom by protecting it in the  very first sentence of the Bill of Rights. That provision--called the  First Amendment--states that ``Congress shall make no law respecting an  establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''  The Supreme Court has applied this prohibition to State and local  governments through the 14th Amendment.   So what does this mean, practically? First, governments cannot  discriminate against religion or single it out for worse treatment than  similar nonreligious activities. But, second, if a government does  treat religion differently than other similar activities, it must  'pass'' the ``strict scrutiny'' test. That means that the government  must show that there was absolutely no other way to achieve an  extremely important goal than restricting the religious activity in  question.   The First Amendment is clear. Religious exercise must be protected.  Nevertheless, over the course of the pandemic, governments throughout  the country have placed heavy-handed restrictions on this fundamental  freedom, restricting Americans' freedom to gather for worship, to meet  in smaller groups for religious purposes, or even to sing.   At first, Americans accepted these restrictions. We understood the  extraordinary difficulties facing our leaders as they struggled to  grapple with a new and deadly virus. And we were assured that these  restrictions would be temporary, lasting no longer than necessary. But  as the weeks and months dragged on and the prohibitions on religious  exercise continued, we began to see a startling trend. As restrictions  on restaurants, casinos, and museums began to thaw, in many states,  synagogues, churches, temples, mosques, and other religious gatherings  were left out in the cold.   In May 2020, the Governor of California allowed some restaurants and  retail businesses to operate indoors with up to 50 Percent capacity.  Meanwhile, all indoor religious services--of  [[Page S2162]]  any size, and even with identical precautions--were outright banned.   California was not alone. In Nevada, the Governor allowed gambling  establishments to reopen in June, 2020. As thousands flooded into  casinos along the Las Vegas strip, religious gatherings in Nevada  remained strictly limited to 50 people. Likewise, in New York, houses  of worship were explicitly singled out for worse treatment. In some  areas, religious gatherings were restricted to only 10 people, while  train stations, acupuncture facilities, and factories in that same area  could allow entry to as many as they wished.   And I could go on. Again, and again, COVID lookdown rules left  religious Americans on the outside looking in.   Despite several opportunities to overturn these clear, discriminatory  restrictions, for most of 2020, the Supreme Court failed to intervene.  In South Bay v. Newsom, five Justices--without explanation-declined to  halt California's ban on all religious services. Likewise, in Calvary  Chapel v. Sisolak, the Supreme Court left Nevada's discriminatory ban  on houses of worship in place. And again, they did so without  explanation.   The pandemic stretched on. Some States eased restrictions, allowing  worshippers to gather. Others did not. During that time, countless  weddings, baptisms, holy days, and, perhaps most heartbreakingly-- funerals--were observed in isolation from family, friends, and  community. Or not at all.   Finally, in November of last year--after over 8 months of lockdowns-- a ray of light broke through. In Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo, the  Court held that ``even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put  away and forgotten. [New York's] restrictions . . . strike at the very  heart of the First Amendment's guarantee of religious liberty.''  Subsequent decisions earlier this year resurrected the First  Amendment's robust protections of religious liberty. Just a few weeks  ago, in Tandon v. Newsom, the Supreme Court resoundingly affirmed  religious freedom, summarily rejecting California's discriminatory  restrictions. Thanks to God, the First Amendment lives.   It's been a long road to get here. But we can't ignore the lessons of  the past 13 months. That's why I offered an amendment to S.937, the  COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which would require the Attorney General to  create a report detailing the restrictions imposed on religious  exercise imposed during the pandemic.   This amendment directs the Department of Justice to look into: first,  whether governments applied the same rules to religious groups that  they applied to similar nonreligious organizations and businesses, and,  second, whether those restrictions complied with the First Amendment.  The goal here is simple-we need to understand and remember how  Americans in 2020 lost their religious freedoms in order to ensure that  it never happens again.                            ____________________
