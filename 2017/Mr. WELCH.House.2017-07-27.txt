 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment that would--it is  shocking that it would have to even do this--prohibit spending money on  these Afghan uniforms that met the sartorial taste of a general that  corresponded to lush tropical forests. Number one, what the general  wants for sartorial splendor of his troops is not our problem. Number  two, his sartorial taste had to do with tropical forests, which is not  what we have in Afghanistan.   I am very happy that General Mattis himself was outraged by this, and  I applaud him. But it is an opportunity for us to express our outrage  as well.   We all want to support our men and women in uniform, and we all want  them to have good uniforms. But it is not up to an Afghan general to  take taxpayer money on a vanity project that ultimately undercuts the  security of our troops.   So, Mr. Chairman, I believe I speak for everyone. Let's not do it.
