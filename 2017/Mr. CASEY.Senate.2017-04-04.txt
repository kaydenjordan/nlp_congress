 Mr. President, I want to add to the remarks of Senator  Brown.   We had a process; the Presiding Officer was a part of this, as well,  in the Finance Committee getting the Miners Protection Act through the  Finance Committee, 18 to 8. It should have been voted on by the end of  the year so these miners could have certainty with regard to healthcare  and pensions, and our government could keep our promise to those  miners.   Our government has not kept its promise to coal miners, and some of  them are here today in Washington. It is about time our government kept  our promise. They kept their promise to their company, to their  country, and every promise that they have been asked to keep. It is  time that we did our job here in the Senate. Get this legislation  passed in the month of April.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.    Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak about the  nomination of Judge Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the U.S.  Supreme Court.   Every Member of the United States Senate has an obligation to review  this nomination thoroughly and to make a determination. I believe the  advice and consent duty of a Senator--certainly in my case, when I make  decisions about any judge for confirmation, but especially for the  Supreme Court--has to be a decision grounded in a review of a number of  considerations. I think they are generally the same no matter who the  nominee is, but sometimes they can vary. I think in this case there are  probably additional considerations that I weighed.   Of course, we want to look at the nominee's character and their  integrity, certainly their judicial temperament. Someone can be very  capable as a judge and very learned in the law, but they may not have  the temperament or the integrity.   I don't think there is any question that there is nothing in the  record that indicates that Judge Gorsuch doesn't have the experience or  the character and integrity to do this job, and to do it with the kind  of temperament we have the right to expect from any judge.   I also believe at the same time, though, that you have to do a review  of the cases decided by the nominee--in this case, a judge on the Tenth  Circuit Court of Appeals, a very similar kind of job to that which the  Supreme Court Justice does. You are reviewing cases on appellate court.  In Judge Gorsuch's case, it is the Tenth Circuit--not the Supreme  Court, but still appellate court decisions.   Part of that inquiry I believe is a review of an assessment, really,  of this individual's judicial philosophy. That is where I will spend  most of my time tonight. I will also talk about the rule change that  might be upon us.   While reading Judge Gorsuch's opinions, I developed very serious  concerns about his rigid judicial philosophy. Judge Gorsuch's opinions  indicated, in my judgment, an extremely conservative judicial  approach. This leads him to come down disproportionately on the side of  powerful interests, against workers in many cases, and consumers in  other cases--a cause for particular concern at a time when the Supreme  Court itself, under Chief Justice Roberts, has become an ever more  reliable ally to big corporations.    A major study published by the Minnesota Law Review in 2013, found  that the four conservative Justices currently sitting on the Court are  among the six most business friendly Supreme Court Justices since 1946.  A review by the Constitutional Accountability Center shows the  consequences of the Court's corporate tilt, finding that the national  Chamber of Commerce has had a success rate of 69 percent in cases  before the Roberts Court, a significant increase over previous courts.  These are cases of serious importance to everyday Americans--cases  involving rules for consumer contracts, challenges to regulations,  ensuring fair play in labor standards, and attempts by consumers to  hold companies accountable for product safety and much more.   Another concern I have about his nomination is that at some point in  the campaign of last year, the Republican nominee was given a list of  names from which he should choose, were he to be elected President. I  would hope that there would be a list of names that any President would  consider beyond what we are told in published reports was just 21  names, developed by organizations on the far right. And that fact alone  causes me great concern--that the President is permitted, according to  this arrangement, this understanding, only to consider a list of 21  names that those organizations developed.   The record of this judge indicates also that he would only exacerbate  the problem that I pointed to with regard to the corporate tilt of the  current Roberts Court. In my judgment, by doing so, it would further  stack the deck against ordinary workers and families. It starts with  his basic judicial philosophy. He employs the narrowest possible  reading of Federal law and shows extreme skepticism--even hostility-- toward executive agencies or what some might call administrative  agencies, agencies that carry out the law in areas like labor or  consumer protections and the like.   Many have expressed concerns about his opinion in the Hobby Lobby  case, where Judge Gorsuch endorsed the idea that owners of for-profit  corporations can assert corporate religious liberty rights, opening the  door potentially to widespread discrimination against LGBT Americans  and other Americans as well. But a variety of other cases are equally  illustrative of Judge Gorsuch's troubling approach to the law.   I will give you just a few examples. One case involved the tragic  death of a trench hand who was electrocuted while working as part of an  excavation crew. The court reviewed a ruling by the Department of  Labor, punishing the mining company for failing to provide proper  safety training to the worker. Judge Gorsuch mocked the Department of  Labor's ruling as nothing more than a ``Delphic declaration'' devoid of  necessary proof, and he concluded that the agency was wrong to penalize  the company following the worker's death. Fortunately, a majority of  the Tenth Circuit disagreed and affirmed the Department of Labor's  ruling.   Another case involved a truckdriver who was stranded on the side of  the road at night in subzero temperatures, with the brakes on his  trailer frozen and the heater in his cab broken. He called dispatch for  help multiple times, but after hours of waiting in the freezing cold,  this truckdriver was having  [[Page S2355]]  trouble breathing, and his torso and his feet were numb. Worried about  his safety, he unhitched his trailer, drove the truck away, and then  later the company fired him for abandoning the trailer.   Three different authorities within the Department of Labor ruled  against the company. Judge Gorsuch disagreed, parsing a Federal statute  to argue that the driver was not protected in his decision to drive  away, despite the risk of freezing to death if he stayed put. Again,  fortunately, the majority of the Tenth Circuit Court disagreed,  describing the judge's labored interpretation of the statute as  ``curious,'' and ruling in favor of the truckdriver.   I have a basic disagreement with Judge Gorsuch's rulings regarding  the legal protections for individuals with disabilities, especially  students with disabilities. In one case, he ruled against parents who  believed their autistic child was not receiving an adequate education  at his public school. A hearing officer, an administrative law judge,  and a U.S. district court all found in favor of the family, ruling that  they were entitled to reimbursement for tuition at a residential  program tailored for children with autism.   Judge Gorsuch reversed the rulings and, instead, articulated an  extremely narrow interpretation of Federal law--this particular Federal  law that protects students with disabilities, the IDEA law, the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.    In 2004, Congress amended the IDEA, in part, based upon findings that  its implications have been ``impeded by low expectations.''  Nevertheless, Judge Gorsuch ruled that because the student in this case  made some progress in public school, even though he could not  generalize his learning to settings outside of school--which is the  goal of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--the family,  the judge believed, was not entitled to tuition reimbursement. That  decision happened a number years ago.   It just so happens that the U.S. Supreme Court, the current Court  with only 8 members, voted 8 to 0 against the basic position that Judge  Gorsuch had in that education case--a different case but the same  question about what is the duty owed by a school district to a child  with a disability. That ruling happened to be announced during the week  that Judge Gorsuch was in front of the Judiciary Committee--in fact, on  one of the very days he was in front of the committee. A unanimous  Court disagreed with his approach to those kinds of cases involving  children with disabilities in a public school.   These cases and others are illustrative of a broader trend in the  judge's jurisprudence, whether it is a case involving an employee  seeking redress for work place discrimination, hospital staff fighting  for back pay after an unlawful reduction in the work hours, or a victim  of improper conduct by a medical device company looking for justice.  Judge Gorsuch's approach produces rulings disconnected from the lived  experience of those they impact.   Therefore, after review of many of his cases, after consideration of  his judicial philosophy, and after a review, as well, of the current  state of this Court--especially the corporate tilt of this current  Roberts Court--I have concluded that I could not support Judge  Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court.   I wanted to add some comments before concluding tonight about what  this vote may mean to the Senate and the rules of the Senate. It is my  belief--others, of course, disagree--but it is my belief that if you  seek to become an Associate Justice on the most powerful Court in the  world, you ought to be able to garner the support of at least 60  members of the U.S. Senate. If your nomination to the Court is the  subject of such consensus, you ought to be able to get 60 votes in the  U.S. Senate. If both your nomination and your judicial philosophy is  seen as such a mainstream nomination, you ought to be able to get 60  votes. Despite that, it is a point in time when we are having a debate  about how we arrived at this question of a potential change in the  rules. I believe that the reason we got here is because of substantial  and unyielding obstruction by Republicans in the U.S. Senate over a  number of years.   Just consider this: From the founding of our Nation, through  President Obama's first term when Senate Republicans were in the  minority, cloture--the motion to cut off debate and proceed to a final  vote--has been filed in a total of just 147 nominations. Just 147 times  in the total history of the U.S. Senate, the minority forced the  majority to file cloture. Of all the Presidents before President Obama  combined, cloture needed to be filed only on 68 of these nominations,  but in President Obama's first term before Republicans took the  majority of the Senate, Republicans refused to consent to votes and  forced the Democratic leader to file cloture on 79 nominations--over 50  percent of all the cloture motions ever filed on nominations in the  history of the U.S. Senate. So half of those cloture petitions were  filed just in the last couple of years. That doesn't even include what  I think was an outrageous obstruction that continued once Republicans  took the majority, culminating, of course, in their refusal to consider  Judge Merrick Garland's nomination. So Judge Garland, of the District  of Columbia Circuit, the chief judge who had great support, I think, on  both sides of the aisle--Judge Garland had maybe a few meetings, no  vote, and not even a hearing before the Judiciary Committee.   According to the Congressional Research Service, President Obama is  the only one of the five most recent Presidents whose first term was  marked by nominations that languished for over half a year on average.  Also in his first term, he was the only President of the previous five  under whom the district court vacancies increased, unaccompanied by the  creation of new judgeships to meet the demand. In fact, President  Obama's district court nominees, during his first term, waited an  average of 60 days longer for confirmation than those of President  George W. Bush.   I think the evidence is overwhelming. Senate Republicans' obstruction  of judicial nominations reached historic levels under President Obama.  So we are here at this point, and we have to make a decision. My vote  will be to insist on 60 votes; therefore, I will be voting no on  cloture and also voting no on the nomination of Judge Gorsuch.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.    Mr. President, the easiest way for workers to save the  additional money they need for retirement is through work-based  retirement plans. When workers have access to work-based plans, the  vast majority of them choose to participate, but many Americans do not  work for an employer that offers such a plan. According to AARP, 55  million private-sector workers ages 18 to 64 had no ability to save for  retirement through an employer-sponsored plan in 2013. Of those  workers, 2.2 million lived in Pennsylvania   In response, numerous States and multiple cities have considered  programs that would give residents better access to retirement savings  accounts, and multiple States have already passed laws putting such  programs in place: Our Republican colleagues are trying to nullify  efforts by these States and cities, rolling back their efforts to give  their citizens better access to retirement savings accounts.   It is both surprising and disappointing to see this opposition  mounted against a measure we should all be able to support--enhancing  access to retirement savings. In undermining these programs,  Republicans will be denying access to safe, low-cost retirement savings  vehicles.   A recent study looking at just the city of Philadelphia found that  roughly half of Philadelphia workers between the ages of 25 and 64 did  not have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan at work.  Further, 20 percent of Philadelphians over the age of 65 are poor,  compared to 9 percent nationwide; 30 percent of Philadelphians over the  age of 65 have incomes between 100 and 200 percent of poverty.   One of the most important elements of economic security for the  middle class is retirement security. Millions of Americans ask, ``Will  I have enough money saved to retire and retire comfortably?'' The  answer to that question for too many Pennsylvanians is no. Looking at  these facts, Philadelphia took action and began exploring ways to  expand access to saving for our workers. Through these resolutions,  Republicans will severely undermine the efforts of cities and States to  expand access to retirement savings vehicles to the citizens by  facilitating IRA retirement savings through private employers.   The programs States and cities are pursuing are simple, low-cost, and  voluntary. Most would simply require that employers that do not  currently offer a plan facilitate voluntary employee contributions to  an Individual Retirement Account. Our State and local governments are  our idea incubators. Many of our States and cities, including  Philadelphia, want to make it easier for workers to save for  retirement. In repealing this guidance, Republicans are hindering that  effort.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Dr. Thomas  E. Starzl, the pioneer in the field of organ transplantation who  impacted the lives of thousands directly and indirectly. Dr. Starzl  died on March 4, 2017, 1 week shy of his 91st birthday.   To say Dr. Stazrl was a remarkable surgeon, researcher, or physician  does not begin to describe this man or the contributions he made. He  was a visionary who created and then transformed an entire field of  medicine. He performed the first liver transplant in 1963, the first  heart-liver transplant in 1984, and led a team conducting a five-organ  transplant in 1987. In 2007, at the age of 80, Dr. Starzl visited with  me to seek research funding for the hand transplant program at the  University of Pittsburgh. He never stopped envisioning what more could  be done or striving to achieve it.   The late Senator Robert F. Kennedy once said, ``only those who dare  to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.'' Dr. Starzl was not afraid  to fail, and through his determination and the innovation and advances  he brought forth, organ transplantation preserved human life, and the  University of Pittsburgh became the busiest transplant center in the  world. Knowing that the actual surgery is only one part of a successful  transplantation, Dr. Starzl worked to develop immunosuppressant  therapies and played a role in creating tacrolimus, which remains the  most widely used immunosuppressant drug in the world. He also believed  that it was his obligation to train the next generation of transplant  surgeons. Today approximately 90 percent of transplant centers are  headed by surgeons Dr. Starzl directly trained or by surgeons who  learned from surgeons Dr. Starzl trained.   Over his decades of service, Dr. Starzl profoundly impacted many  lives and families, including my own. Our family will always be  grateful for the extraordinary care Dr. Starzl provided for my father,  during his second term as Governor of Pennsylvania. In June of 1993,  Dr. Starzl oversaw Governor Casey's exceedingly rare heart and liver  double transplant surgery. My family cherished the 7 additional years  we had with my father.   Among the many accolades Dr. Starzl received was being ranked 213th  in the book ``1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking the Men and Women Who  Shaped the Millennium.'' Published in 1998, this book named the people  who had the greatest impact on the world over the previous 1,000 years.  Dr. Starzl's inclusion speaks to the enormous impact he had on so many  lives.   Dr. Starzl's passing leaves a void, but we know the foundation he  built for organ transplantation will endure through the many lives he  saved, the surgeons he trained, and the high standards he set for  quality of care. In the statement released by his family, it was noted  that he ``was a force of nature that swept all those around him into  his orbit, challenging those that surrounded him to strive to match his  superhuman feats of focus, will and compassion.'' His ``superhuman  feats'' will remain an inspiration for those in the medical profession  and beyond.                            ____________________
