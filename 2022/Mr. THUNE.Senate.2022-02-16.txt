 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are currently in the midst of the worst  border crisis in our Nation's history.   It is no exaggeration to say that the situation at our southern  border is out of control. In December, U.S. Customs and Border  Protection apprehended more than 178,000 individuals attempting to  cross our southern border illegally--178,000 in 1 month--which is more  than double the number of individuals apprehended by the Border Patrol  the previous December.   This is no isolated incident. Almost from the day the President took  office, our Nation has been experiencing an unprecedented border surge.  In fiscal year 2021, the Border Patrol encountered more than 1.7  million individuals attempting to cross our southern border--the  highest number ever recorded.   The situation at our southern border is a security, enforcement, and  humanitarian nightmare. Our Border Patrol officers have done heroic  work this past year, but they are stretched incredibly thin and are  having to spend too much time caring for migrants and not enough time  patrolling the border. This heightens the chance that dangerous  individuals--from terrorists to drug smugglers, to human traffickers-- will slip across the border into the country unnoticed.    Drug trafficking across our southern border is a major problem and a  problem that affects our entire country. There is a massive increase of  fentanyl being smuggled across the border in States around the country,  with total seizures up 134 percent and as high as 1,000 percent in  South Texas. Alarmingly, fentanyl overdoses are now the leading cause  of death for Americans aged 18 to 45.   I have talked with local law enforcement officials in South Dakota  who report that they regularly seize drugs that they can trace back to  cartels trafficking them across our southern border. In other words, it  is not just border States that are affected by security problems at our  borders. Every State in our Union is threatened by lax border security.   Addressing the situation at our southern border should be one of this  administration's top priorities, but the President has been almost  completely AWOL on this issue, as has his supposed border czar, the  Vice President. He seems to be hoping that if he ignores this crisis  long enough, it will go away. But it hasn't gone away. In fact, it  shows no signs of stopping.   It is hard to overemphasize the depth of the President's dereliction  of duty on this issue. After all, it is the President's job to deal  with national security and border enforcement. Yet the President  continues to do essentially nothing to address the situation at our  southern border. He can't even be bothered to visit the border. In  fact, there is reason to believe that the President has never, never  visited the border--not as President, not as Vice President, and not  even as a Senator--beyond driving by it once on the way to a campaign  rally in 2008.   Of course, this situation isn't just a matter of the President being  derelict in his enforcement duties. The President is partly, if not  largely, responsible for the existence of this situation in the first  place.   Immediately upon taking office, the President took steps that  weakened our Nation's border security. On his very first day in office,  the President rescinded the declaration of a national emergency at our  southern border. He halted construction of the border wall, and he  revoked a Trump administration order that called for the government to  faithfully execute our immigration laws. That was all on his first day,  and that wasn't all.   The President's Department of Homeland Security also issued  guidelines that same day pausing deportations except under certain  conditions. The effect of all this was to declare to the world that the  U.S. borders were effectively open, and the administration hasn't made  much of an effort to correct that impression. The President has  significantly limited the ability of Immigration and Customs  Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection to enforce immigration  laws.   Deportations dropped precipitously during fiscal year 2021, as did  arrests in the interior of the country. And, of course, having a  President who seems untroubled by the massive number of migrants  attempting to cross our borders illegally hardly sends a discouraging  message to those contemplating making the crossing themselves.   There is simply nothing good to say about President Biden's record on  the border so far. His policies are not compassionate. There is nothing  compassionate about policies that invite illegal immigration and  encourage individuals to undertake the dangerous journey to our  southern border.   He has betrayed the duty he owes to the American people who should be  able to count on their President to care about security concerns,  including border security.   We just marked the anniversary of the President's first year in the  White House, a year marked by disaster at our southern border. The  President has a chance to change that record, to leave behind something  other than border chaos to mark his time in office. But until we see  real action from this administration, I am not going to get my hopes  up.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
