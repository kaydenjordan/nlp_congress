 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, while missiles and machine guns rain down death on  innocent Ukrainians, President Zelensky is pleading with America and  all free nations to stop buying Russian oil to fund this inhumane war.   This weekend, America should know that both parties in Congress came  together, worked together in agreement to immediately ban purchases of  Russian energy. I was proud to have helped lead that bipartisan effort  of the House Committee on Ways and Means and Senate Committee on  Finance, and pleased that President Biden, who fought the Russian  energy ban tooth and nail, finally relented and accepted the moral  choice to stand with the people of Ukraine.   The bill before us is certainly not as strong an energy ban as what  Congress crafted, nor does it include Congress' crucial economic  sanctions to revoke favorable trade relations with Russia and Belarus,  which would have targeted all the products America buys from Russia.  But President Biden insisted that these economic sanctions be dropped  so that nearly half of all Russian imports to the U.S. will go  untouched. For some reason, he is insisting we treat Russia, the  invader, the same as Ukraine, the invaded.  [[Page H1397]]                                     time  1930    It's puzzling why Russian diamonds and vodka deserve continued  special treatment here in America. Those revenues all help strengthen  Russia's economy to fund the war against Ukraine. President Biden  insisted, regrettably, in this bill they remain protected. Our allies  will certainly get a laugh.   This bill directs our trade representative to urge other nations to  revoke the special trading status for Russia, even though America  refuses to do it at this time. That is not a profile in courage.   I wish our President was as committed to crippling economic sanctions  as neighboring Canada, which banned both Russian oil and revoked the  special trading treatment for Russian products. To be clear, neither  the President's executive ban nor this bill takes any action to replace  Russian oil with Made-in-America energy.   Nothing in this bill includes Republican-led proposals to extend  secondary sanctions on Russian energy purchases in financing around the  world--as we already impose on Iran and North Korea. Nothing in this  bill creates access to more American-made energy on and offshore. Nor  does it approve American pipelines that could easily replace Russian  oil with U.S. and Canadian energy, or accelerate approval for delayed  permits for American export facilities to help the rest of the world  wean themselves from the grip of dirty Russian energy.   Answer this question: Why is our country begging Venezuela and Iran,  terrorist nations and thug regimes, to produce more dirty oil to send  to America when America is fully capable of producing all the cleanest  oil and gas in the world that we need right here at home?   As expected, the President is blaming everyone and everything for  high prices and inflation--including the war. Higher prices, as you  know, have hammered Americans for a solid year, all starting with the  President's $2 trillion unpaid-for COVID stimulus that ignited  inflation, paid people not to work, and fueled the worst inflation in  40 years.   Thanks to the White House, America is in a dangerous wage-price  spiral, and as a result of the President's failed economic leadership  more and more experts are predicting a recession this year. No wonder  most Americans believe our economy is already in a recession or  depression and have lost faith in the President's ability to rebuild  our economy.   To close, I will tell you this. The ban on Russian oil alone is worth  our support. Ukraine is waiting, as Chairman Neal points out. After  this bill, I urge Congress to do more: to revoke Russia's special trade  status and unleash America's own ability to be energy independent, to  replace Russian oil with American sources, and use our energy strength  to wean the world from Russian energy.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith), the Republican leader of the Trade Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Ferguson), the chief deputy whip for the Republican  Conference.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Rice), the Republican leader of the Oversight and Reform  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker), who is a member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Smith), who is a longtime leader on human rights.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Cloud).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Kim).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I will just point out, all of that was  nonsense. The truth of the matter is, it was Democrat President Clinton  who forced Ukraine to turn over 1,800 nuclear weapons to Russia and  President Obama who stood by when Putin took over parts of Ukraine.  Now, under President Biden, we stand by while he looks to invade and  take over a sovereign nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to  recommit this bill to the Committee on Ways and Means.   I will also ask to have my amendment, that suspends permanent normal  trade relations with Russia, included in the Record.   While there is broad agreement to stop imports of Russian energy, to  stand with Ukraine, Congress does need to do more. That is what this  motion does.   As we talked earlier, when we talked about amending the rule to offer  American-made energy production, the idea of doing sanctions without  American energy production is incomplete at best.   But when it comes to trade with Russia, we also need to take stronger  steps, stronger bipartisan steps. We had a good, bipartisan agreement  that stopped oil imports from Russia but also removed preferential  trade on other products from Russia.   The bill we are voting on today allows about 40 percent of the total  products we buy from Russia to receive preferential trade treatment.  That is why we are so disappointed and puzzled about why this provision  was removed from the bill, because I believe that there is sincerely  broad, strong bipartisan support in Congress to remove and suspend  that.   I know that Chairman Neal is committed to working together toward  that goal. By not revoking PNTR, Russia enjoys the same preferential  trade status and lower tariffs as all of our American allies.   Ironically, unless we change the bill, Russia will maintain the same  trade status on nonenergy products, like Russian diamonds and vodka, as  Ukraine, the country they invaded. That is not right by any measure. We  need to be tougher together.   Congress can lead by passing this motion to recommit, which simply  substitutes the bipartisan agreement we reached that both shuts down  Russian oil imports and removes the preferential trade status for all  of the other products we import from Russia.   America needs to lead, Congress needs to lead, to take this important  bipartisan step and vote ``yes'' on the motion to recommit.   I strongly believe the effort in this bill to immediately stop  purchases from Russia has support and should have support from every  American, but we need to do more.   I urge my colleagues and I urge our President to stand with us with  strong economic sanctions and more American-made energy to replace  Russian oil.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
