 Mr. Speaker, listening to the debate this morning reminds  me of something President Ronald Reagan once said. He said: Our friends  on the other side of the aisle, they know so much that just isn't so.   How interesting it is that the title of this package is the exact  opposite of what this legislation is going to do. It will do nothing to  bring down the cost of food and energy. Instead, it is making excuses  for the crises caused by the Biden administration's attacks on American  agriculture and energy.   Now, there are a few good pieces of bipartisan legislation in this  package, but our friends on the other side of the aisle refuse to allow  these bills to receive their individual votes. Instead, they are using  the good provisions here as pawns in their political messaging.                                time  1000    One of the really harmful bills in this package, as has been  discussed, the Meat and Poultry Special Investigator Act, creates a  duplicative office within the USDA that will only add to the regulatory  burden of our food processors across the country, and that is going to  increase costs.   The investigator would be granted independent litigation authority,  allowing for civil suits against packers at the whim of the Secretary  without even consulting with the DOJ. It should be noted, the DOJ  already launched an investigation into the ``Big Four'' for  anticompetitive practices in May of 2020 and has declined to provide  Congress with an update even 2 years into that investigation.   The bottom line is increasing regulation will raise food prices, not  make them more affordable. Our farm families need inputs at a fair  price. They need diesel prices to come down. They need to be able to  produce the food to feed this country and the world without the  government making it harder and harder day in and day out. That is why  this package must be defeated.   Rather than more regulation, we must unleash the full ability of  American production. We must work for our farm families and do what is  right and defeat this bill.
