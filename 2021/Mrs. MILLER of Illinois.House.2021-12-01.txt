 Madam Speaker, Joe Biden's open-border  policies have created a crisis on our border not seen in over 30 years.  And what are the Democrats doing to address this worsening border  crisis? They just passed through a multitrillion-dollar spending bill  with mass amnesty for up to 10 million illegal immigrants, plus $100  billion in taxpayer-funded benefits.   This far-left, socialist reconciliation package provides zero funding  for border wall construction, technology, or additional Border Patrol  agents.   While border arrests are at an all-time high with no signs of  stopping, our border czar, Vice President Harris, who has yet to be  seen, has no solutions that would end the crisis on our border.  Instead, Biden and Harris continue to incentivize illegal immigration  at the expense of all Americans.   Open borders plus amnesty is the end of our great country as we know  it.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I have observed multiple  times when we open our daily session in prayer that we are praying to  Creator God, acknowledging that God is our creator. He is also the  giver of life.   I am proud of my five daughters who cherish this blessing from our  Creator and have blessed us with 17 grandchildren.   The abortion industry talks about pregnancy as if it is a cancer  diagnosis. How sad and tragic that Planned Parenthood and the chemical  abortion industry have targeted and deceived young women for their own  profit.   Today, we have been praying for wisdom and for God's guiding hand  over the Supreme Court as it hears the Dobbs v. Jackson case. This case  could mark the biggest win for human life in America in decades. In  Illinois' 15th Congressional District, we honor and respect the dignity  of all stages of life, born and unborn. Pro-life Americans believe all  life has value, no matter how small.   I also have a little grandson who has Down syndrome. He is just  precious. His name is Nathaniel, and that means a gift from God.   With the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case, the Court  can correct the dreadful ruling of Roe v. Wade and acknowledge that the  decision wasn't constitutional or based in reality.
