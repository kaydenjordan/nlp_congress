 Mr. Speaker, today we are considering the Big Cat Public  Safety Act. I have some concerns.   First, this is not what most Americans are concerned about right now.  People outside of the Beltway are worried about the cost of living.  Food prices are way up. Gas prices are nearly double what they were  last year. Crime is skyrocketing. Drought and wildfire are ravaging my  State of Oregon, and the Biden administration denies responsibility;  and, worse, has no plan.   Americans aren't fooled. They know that the priority number one  should be lowering the cost of living.   Second, I have concerns about the Big Cat bill itself. This is a  State issue, not a Federal issue. Most States already have restrictions  on keeping big cats as pets, if not outright bans. In fact, 38 States  have already addressed the issue.   For example, my home State of Oregon has already banned private  possession of big cats. Other States can legislate on this issue as  they see fit. It is not appropriate for Congress to intervene, and this  would certainly be an improper expansion of the Lacey Act.   We should, instead, focus upon the most important issues facing our  Nation: inflation, the price of fuel, wildfire, and drought.
