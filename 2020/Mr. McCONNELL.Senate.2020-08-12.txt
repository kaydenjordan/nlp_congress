 Mr. President, yesterday, I spoke about the disconnect  between the discourse here in Washington and the pain and uncertainty  that American families are feeling all across our country.   I spoke about the human toll of the Democrats' choice to play  politics with billions and billions of aid and block it all over non- COVID-related wish list items.   It has been clear for some weeks that the Speaker of the House and  the Senate Democratic leader are treating this crisis like an ordinary  political game.   The New York Times says Speaker Pelosi is ``playing hardball.''  POLITICO says she is ``taking a huge risk . . . as she remains almost  entirely unyielding in her demands.''   More than 160,000 Americans have been killed by the worst infectious  disease outbreak in more than a century. More than 16 million Americans  are out of work. An entire school year for our kids is in limbo, but  Democrats are playing political games like this were some run-of-the- mill typical negotiation.   Speaker Pelosi's own Democratic House Members call her proposal  ``Washington gamesmanship,'' ``partisan gamesmanship,'' and ``playing  politics.'' Those are House Democrats I am quoting on the House  Democratic bill.   Yesterday, literally a few minutes after I said on the floor that  Democrats should stop treating this crisis like a game, the Democratic  leader came to the floor to talk about who ``ran down the clock,'' who  ``tossed up an air ball,'' and who ``subbed themselves out of the  game.''   So, look, the Democrats aren't taking this as a serious issue. They  aren't acting like this is serious, and the American people are hurting  in the meantime.   Let's get outside the beltway and listen to how this crisis has  impacted real American families and how the Democrats' stonewalling  continues to hurt them.   Since we passed the CARES Act, I have been visiting healthcare  facilities in my home State of Kentucky--places like St. Claire's  Healthcare in Morehead and King's Daughters Medical  [[Page S5392]]  Center in Ashland--always wearing a mask and social distancing, of  course.   I have thanked the frontline workers and heard how the Senate's last  rescue package has helped them save lives and stay safer themselves  while doing it. That is because the CARES Act provided $1.3 billion for  Kentucky healthcare providers alone, on top of more than $120 million  we had already sent for testing.   But Kentucky's incredible nurses, doctors, and hospitals are not  finished fighting the battle on behalf of their communities, and  Congress must not be finished helping them do it. That is why Senate  Republicans proposed major new investments in health providers.   We want to send tens of billions more to expand testing, to reimburse  healthcare facilities for unplanned pandemic expenses, to speed the  development and rapid distribution of COVID-19 treatments, and to find  a vaccine to finish this fight once and for all.   That is what Republicans would like to do, but Democrats have about  blocked all of it over non-COVID-related, liberal demands.   Let's talk about the PPP--the historic program from Chairman Collins  and Chairman Rubio that has kept Main Street alive and kept millions of  Americans from losing their jobs.   This program has been transformational for Kentucky. Our small  businesses and their workers have received more than $5 billion of  payroll support. As the director of the Dare to Care Food Bank in  Louisville told me recently, PPP funding is what has allowed his  facility to keep its entire workforce--precisely when our community  needs were the greatest.   And I heard from the director of a Kentucky museum that ``[t]he PPP  program was the one hope that we had to keep our business alive.''   But these small businesses and nonprofits are now nearing the end of  that help. The PPP had to close its doors last Saturday for new  applications, and many employers are exhausting the money they had  already received. Our country is approaching another small business  tipping point, and workers could begin getting pink slips instead of  paychecks.   That is why Senate Republicans wrote up plans for another whole round  of PPP--a full second draw for the hardest hit businesses. House  Democrats left this out of their bill entirely and essentially turned  their backs on those benefiting from PPP. But Republicans want to keep  helping Main Street workers.   One woman-owned small business in Northern Kentucky shared:         We are grateful for the $465,000 in the PPP. [But] we have       used all of it for payroll and employee related costs . . .       18 weeks of expenses. We are seeking [more] financial help to       keep our most treasured asset, our people, employed.    And the president of an inspection company in Louisville says this:         You have no idea how much this second draw on PPP will help       us. We were actually in the process of figuring out how we       were going to make it through to our fall work season. . . .       If we get this, we could make it into our season with no       layoffs.    Republicans want to get more aid to these workers, but Senate  Democrats have blocked every bit of it over non-COVID-related liberal  demands.   Let's talk about our university presidents who are worried about  testing and funding in the fall. Our K-12 school boards and  superintendents want legal protections so they can reopen.   So Republicans proposed billions for education--actually, even more  than House Democrats in their bill. But now Democrats are blocking it  all over unrelated, liberal demands.   Republicans want another round of direct checks--direct checks to  households across Kentucky and across America.   I just heard from one constituent who said:         With my first one, I was able to get an eye exam and new       glasses. . . . I appreciate all you can do. Some of us are       hurting and need help.    I want to put more cash in her pocket right now, but Democrats are  blocking every penny over unrelated, liberal demands.   So do you see the pattern? Kentuckians need more help; Americans need  more help. The American people are not done fighting this virus, and  Republicans are not done crafting policies to help them. But the  difference between now and March is that Democrats seem to be finished  being reasonable.   The Speaker of the House and the Senate Democratic leader have cut  all their colleagues--all of them, all of their committees--out of  negotiations. They are doing this alone, and they have declared that  none of the priorities I have named will see a single dime unless--the  two of them have declared none of the priorities I have named will see  a single dime unless millionaires in Brooklyn and San Francisco get a  massive tax cut, States get a trillion-dollar slush fund to cover  budget problems long before the pandemic, and we tax essential workers  to pay unemployed people a higher salary to stay home.   Republicans wanted to reach agreement on all these issues where we  could find common ground and fight over the last few issues later. But  the Speaker and the Democratic leader say nothing can move unless every  one of these unrelated, far-left items tags along.   These two individuals are letting the wish lists of wealthy coastal  elites stand between every working family in America and the additional  help they deserve.   So maybe in a few moments the Democratic leader or somebody on the  other side will try again to explain how this is all some big political  game.   Well, Kentuckians know differently. They need results. All of our  States need results. And Republicans will fight until we actually get  an outcome                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
