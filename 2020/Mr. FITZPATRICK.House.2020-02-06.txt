 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Bucks  Coalition Against Trafficking, a group working to eradicate human  trafficking in Bucks County and in our entire region. The Bucks  Coalition Against Trafficking is a project created by the Network of  Victim Assistance, working to end this modern-day slavery.   Members of NOVA received recognition recently from the Bucks County  Board of Commissioners for their work to educate our community and to  raise awareness.   The project was established to encourage victim identification,  community education, enhancement of arrests and prosecution of  traffickers, legislative advocacy, and a coordinated response for  survivor services.   Mr. Speaker, it is estimated that 25 million people across the globe  are victims of human trafficking, and approximately 75 percent of these  victims are women and girls. Statistics show that one in seven children  who run away from home end up being trafficked.   Mr. Speaker, one of the first bills I introduced this Congress, the  End Banking for Human Traffickers Act of 2019, would increase the role  of financial institutions in combating human trafficking, which is an  incredibly important part of this fight.   I call upon the House to bring this commonsense legislation to a  vote, and to continue to work to support the victims of human  trafficking.                                time  1015      Recognizing 2019 School Psychologist of the Year, Dr. Julia Szarko     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Julia  Szarko, who was recently named the 2019 School Psychologist of the Year  by the Association of School Psychologists of Pennsylvania.   Dr. Szarko is in her 23rd year as a school psychologist, currently  working at Cold Spring Elementary in Central Bucks County,  Pennsylvania. A former president of the Association of School  Psychologists of Pennsylvania, Dr. Szarko has worked for years to  expand school-based mental health services in Pennsylvania and to  address the national school psychologist shortages across the country.   Ensuring students have access to mental health resources is vital to  their current and their future success, along with that of their peers  as well. With only 20 percent of America's youth receiving the mental  health services they need, further action must be taken to expand  access to these services in schools, which is legislation that Dr.  Szarko helped us draft.   We need more people like Dr. Szarko working to ensure that children  in Pennsylvania and across our Nation have the resources and support  they need to succeed.               Honoring the Life and Legacy of Leslie Kolifrath     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Leslie Kolifrath, who recently passed away after a brave and  courageous fight with breast cancer.   A lifelong resident of Bucks County, Leslie always put the needs of  others ahead of her own. She was very much beloved by her family, her  friends, her pets, and her coworkers.   Mr. Speaker, I got to know Leslie personally through the amazing work  she did throughout Lower Bucks County, particularly Bristol Township,  and helping so many people. The one thing that we all remember about  Leslie is that no issue was too small for her to tackle when it came to  protecting and serving the residents of Bristol Township and Lower  Bucks County.   So we offer our prayers to Leslie's family. We stand by her family in  this very difficult time.   She is now enjoying her eternal reward for a life she lived serving  others in Bucks County and across our region.              Recognizing Ivy Hill Therapeutic Equestrian Center     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of an  organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, changing the lives for  individuals with cognitive, physical, emotional, behavioral, and  psychological needs.   For over 20 years, the Ivy Hill Therapeutic Equestrian Center in  Hilltown, Bucks County, has created therapeutic programs for people of  all ages and levels of ability utilizing the equine experience.   In addition to equine-assisted activities, Ivy Hill collaborates with  several community partners to provide job training through specialized  programs dedicated to an exponentially-growing special needs population  in our region and across the country. Through these programs, Ivy Hill  serves over 150 program riders with more than a dozen trained therapy  horses, led by nearly 200 staff members and volunteers.   Mr. Speaker, their motto is: ``Horses + Love = Hope'' and, having  heard firsthand the heartwarming testimonials of riders and their  families, it is clear that this equation is holding very true. We are  very thankful for all they do for our special needs population and  everybody in our region.                            ____________________
