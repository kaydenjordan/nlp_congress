 Mr. President, first, let me thank my dear friend and  colleague from Illinois. As I have always maintained, he is one of the  most articulate and eloquent Members of this Senate, on either side of  the aisle, and it is a joy to listen to him--not the subject but the  way he articulates it, the subject we are interested in but not happy  about, which is the tax bill.
