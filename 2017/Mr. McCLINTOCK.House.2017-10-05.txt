 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to present the Republican Study  Committee's 2018 budget, Securing America's Future Economy.   This proposal combines savings that have been proposed by the  Congressional Budget Office, many RSC members, and public policy think  tanks, including The Heritage Foundation, Citizens Against Government  Waste, and the National Taxpayers Union. It is based on a simple  principle that government should spend its money as carefully as  families spend what they have left after they have paid their taxes.   By restraining the growth of spending and refocusing resources on  core government responsibilities, adopting commonsense reforms, and  placing Medicare and Social Security back on sound financial footing,  we believe there is still time to save this country from financial and  economic ruin. But time is running out.   On our current course, the Congressional Budget Office warns that,  within 4 years, our deficits will balloon to $1 trillion annually,  adding about $8,000 a year to an average family's debt that they will  have to pay off in future taxes. Two years after that, interest on  [[Page H7858]]  the national debt will reach $654 billion. That is more than we  currently spend for the entire defense establishment.   Let me repeat that so it sinks in. Six years from now, we will spend  more than our current defense budget accomplishing nothing but renting  the money that we have already borrowed and spent. Three years later,  Medicare will collapse. Six years after that--if we get that far-- Social Security runs out of money.   This approaching crisis can be described with just three numbers: 26,  35, and 49. Once you understand those three numbers--26, 35, and 49-- you can plainly see the root of our problems.   Twenty-six percent is the combined population and inflation growth  over the past 10 years. Thirty-five percent is the growth in Federal  revenues. Clearly, this is not a revenue problem. The problem is that  third number. Forty-nine percent is the growth in spending--nearly  twice the rate of inflation and population combined.   We are about to hear about the draconian cuts from the opposition.  Let me emphasize, the RSC budget continues to grow the Federal  Government every year. I repeat, the RSC budget spends more every year.   Over the decade, we have provided for more than $1 trillion of  government growth. Only in Washington can that be described as a cut.  The RSC budget merely restrains the growth of spending over the next  decade to give families the time and room to catch up.                                time  0915    By doing so, we can arrest the ruinous spiral of debt and interest  costs that now threaten the very solvency of our Nation.   This budget gores a lot of sacred cows, because we want to point out  the wide range of savings available to achieve. But I would ask the  opponents of this budget to consider one thing as we race toward the  looming fiscal crisis just 4 years down the road: you cannot provide  for the common defense or general welfare or do all of the other things  our government is called upon to do if you cannot pay for them. Our  mountainous debt, driven by out-of-control spending, now threatens our  ability to do so.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Walker), the chairman of the Republican Study  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from North Carolina.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would remind my friend from Kentucky that Ronald  Reagan reduced the Federal income tax rate from 70 percent down to 28  percent, and income tax revenues doubled.   He is correct that we expect things from our government. We have seen  a 49 percent increase in spending in the last decade. Have we seen a 49  percent increase in the quality of education or a 49 percent increase  in our infrastructure or our defense capability?   What we have seen is a 49 percent increase in bureaucracy and  government.   I would remind the gentleman that when we squander the people's  money, we rob them of the means to meet the disasters and unforeseen  circumstances that confront our country.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Flores), my friend and former chairman of the Republican Study  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Palmer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the Speaker of the House.    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record letters of  support of the Republican Study Committee budget from the Committee for  a Responsible Federal Budget, the Council for Citizens Against  Government Waste, FreedomWorks, and Heritage Action for America.                                         Committee for a Responsible                                                  Federal Budget,                                                  September 8, 2017.      Hon. Mark Walker,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Walker: I am writing you to express our       appreciation for the fiscally responsible budget released by       the Republican Study Committee.        Your budget would make important progress by putting debt       on a downward path as a share of GDP, reducing it from 77       percent today to 56 percent by 2027--instead of letting it       rise to 89 percent as under current law.        By calling for spending cuts and entitlement reforms, your       budget helps to keep the national debt on a sustainable path.        We applaud the Republican Study Committee for your serious       contribution to the ongoing budget debate.            Sincerely,                                                Maya MacGuineas,                              President, Committee for a Responsible      Federal Budget.                                   ____                                        Council for Citizens Against                                                Government Waste,                                    Washington, DC, October 4, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: You will soon vote on several       different budget proposals for fiscal year (FY) 2018. On       behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of       the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I       urge you to support the budget resolution as reported by the       House Budget Committee and the Republican Study Committee's       (RSC) budget resolution, both of which would put the nation       back on the path to fiscal sanity and pave the way for       comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform.        Under the leadership of Chairman Diane Black (R-Tenn.), H.       Con. Res. 71, as reported by the House Budget Committee,       would reduce spending by $6.5 trillion over 10 years and       balance the budget by 2027. H. Con. Res. 71 provides       reconciliation instructions for fundamental tax reform that,       if enacted, will allow Americans to keep more of their money,       simplify the filing of taxes, and allow small businesses to       boost wages and create jobs. While H. Con. Res. 71 would       increase defense spending above Budget Control Act mandated       cap levels, this legislation also calls for $203 billion in       spending cuts across various programs and a $700 billion       reduction in improper payments.        The RSC budget enacts many of the same reforms as the House       Budget Committee's plan, but it proposes to reduce government       spending by $10 trillion over 10 years and achieves balance       in six years. The RSC plan creates a pathway for tax reform;       repeals and replaces Obamacare; makes Social Security       solvent; rescues Medicare and disability insurance; and       decreases FY 2018 non-discretionary spending to $394 billion.        Tax reform presents an historic opportunity to unleash the       economic potential of the American people. While Congress is       well-positioned to enact tax reform, that cannot occur until       a budget resolution with reconciliation instructions is       adopted. I urge  [[Page H7862]]       you to support both the House Budget Committee's FY 2018       budget resolution as reported and the RSC's FY 2018 budget       resolution. All votes on the FY 2018 budget resolutions will       be among those considered in CCAGW's 2017 Congressional       Ratings.            Sincerely,                                                        Tom Schatz,      President, CCAGW.                                   ____                      [From FreedomWorks, Oct. 4, 2017]        Key Vote Yes on the McClintock Amendment to H. Con. Res. 71         On behalf of FreedomWorks' activist community, I urge you       to contact your representative and ask him or her to vote YES       on the amendment offered by Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) to       H. Con. Res. 71, the budget resolution for FY 2018. The       amendment, which includes reconciliation instructions for       fundamental tax reform, is the Republican Study Committee's       FY 2018 budget alternative.        The Republican Study Committee's (RSC) FY 2018 budget would       reduce federal spending by more than $10 trillion over the       ten-year budget window, bringing the budget into balance in       FY 2023. The RSC's budget would repeal ObamaCare and enact       other patient-centered health insurance reforms, make Social       Security and Medicare solvent, and reform federal welfare       programs. It also promotes free trade, regulatory reform, and       other free market, limited government principles.        The current text of H. Con. Res. 71 and the McClintock       amendment include language that allows the House Ways and       Means Committee to produce legislation to reform the tax       code. Riddled with loopholes and special interest deductions,       America's tax code has become far too complex. According to       the Tax Foundation, Americans spent 8.9 billion hours and       $409 billion complying with the more than 74,000-page tax       code.        It has been more than 30 years since Congress passed       fundamental tax reform. Congress has a generational       opportunity to reform the tax code by consolidating and       lowering tax rates, broadening the tax base, and promoting       job creation and international competitiveness for American       businesses. This will make the tax code fairer and simplify       the filing process, allowing the vast majority of Americans       to file their taxes on a postcard.        FreedomWorks will count the vote on the McClintock       amendment to H. Con. Res. 71 on our 2017 Congressional       Scorecard. The scorecard is used to determine eligibility for       the FreedomFighter Award, which recognizes Members of the       House and Senate who consistently vote to support economic       freedom and individual liberty.            Sincerely,                                                      Adam Brandon,      President, FreedomWorks.                                   ____               [From Heritage Action for America, Oct. 3, 2017]       ``Yes'' on the RSC's Budget: Securing America's Future Economy                            (By Andrea Palermo)         On Thursday, the House will vote on the Fiscal Year 2018       (FY18) Budget offered by the Republican Study Committee (RSC)       as an amendment to the committee-approved FY18 budget       resolution. The RSC's Budget: Securing America's Future       Economy, introduced by RSC Budget and Spending Task Force       Chairman Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), would balance in 2023,       reduce non-defense discretionary spending, reestablish       national defense spending to support the military, break the       ``firewall'' between defense and nondefense discretionary       spending, fully repeal and replace Obamacare, repeal Dodd-      Frank by implementing the Financial CHOICE Act, reform       entitlement programs, and finally, enact pro-growth tax       reform. If passed, the RSC's budget would give lawmakers a       serious conservative blueprint for reform.        Pro-Growth Tax Reform. Republicans campaigned and promised       to fix America's broken tax code. The current code has become       a significant obstacle to economic growth, job creation and       higher wages for American workers. The RSC budget would       fulfill the Republican campaign promise by enacting tax       reform that cuts taxes for families, makes American       businesses competitive around the globe, ends double       taxation, and simplifies the code.        Repealing Obamacare. Republicans owe their majorities to       their unwavering opposition to Obamacare, a reality that is       reflected in the RSC's budget. The budget remains committed       to fully repealing the law despite recent Republican       failures, and sends a signal to the American people that       conservatives will continue to push for free-market, patient-      centered health care reforms.        Funding Defense. Although the Budget Control Act of 2011       has put significant pressure on our military, a conservative       budget would align military spending with strategic       priorities by breaking the firewall. The RSC's budget does       not rely on the much-discussed OCO gimmick, but increases       defense spending to a total of $668 billion in FY18, which is       $119 billion above the current defense cap. Importantly, that       cost is offset by lowering non-defense discretionary spending       to $394 billion in FY18, which is $122 billion below the cap.        Reforming Entitlements. The RSC's budget maintains the       Medicare premium support reforms, which are widely       established and broadly supported. In addition, the budget       lays down bold markers on Social Security, Social Security       Disability Insurance and Medicaid. It takes a similarly       aggressive approach on mandatory program spending like food       stamps (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP)       and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) by       building on the success of the 1996 welfare reforms and       enacting work requirements as outlined in the Welfare Reform       and Upward Mobility Act (H.R. 2832/S. 1290) and the       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Reform Act (H.R.       2996).        Other important items in the budget include: Enacting the       Financial CHOICE Act, eliminating the Consumer Financial       Protection Bureau (CFPB), holding federal agencies       accountable, reducing funding for the Environmental       Protection Agency (EPA), separating food stamps and farm       programs, ending commodity subsidy programs, reforming crop       insurance, ending unconstitutional amnesty for illegal       immigrants, enforcing existing immigration laws, securing our       borders, delegating elementary and secondary education to       states and localities modeled after the Academic Partnership       Leads us to Success (A-PLUS) Act, reforming Higher Education       by passing the Higher Education Reform and Opportunity (HERO)       Act, eliminating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, returning       transportation and infrastructure policy to the states,       reorganizing the executive branch, and protecting the life of       the unborn.        Taken as a whole, the RSC's ``Securing America's Future       Economy'' demonstrates a seriousness of purpose when it comes       to governing. If passed, this budget would provide a fiscally       responsible path forward for our nation, limit the size and       scope of our bloated federal government, and unleash economic       prosperity for all Americans.     Mr. Chairman, Just a few steps from this Hall, Thomas  Jefferson addressed his first inaugural address. After listing all of  the blessings that our country enjoys, he asked what more do we need to  maintain a happy and prosperous society. He said: ``Still one thing  more, fellow citizens. A wise and frugal government, which shall  restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free  to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall  not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the  sum of good government. . . .''   We have it within our power to restore that wise and frugal  government and the prosperity and happiness that free societies always  produce the moment we summon the political will to do so. The  Republican Study Committee seeks that shining city on a hill and today  offers this map to get us there.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
