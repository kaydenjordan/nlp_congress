 Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friend, Congressman  Smith, for his efforts in this regard.   Madam Speaker, I have talked before about my wife's and my first  child being born prematurely. We didn't know if we were going to get to  keep her. My wife had to stay in the hospital in Tyler. They took our  precious daughter many weeks early to Shreveport.   The doctor there said: Her eyes are not working properly. She can't  see, but she knows your voice. She has heard it for a number of months  now. It will give her comfort. So caress her, let her know you are  here, and talk to her. Let her feel your presence. Let her hear your  presence.   They said: You can stay a maximum of 2 hours before you have to take  a break.   While I was touching her little hand, she took my finger and held it.   The doctor came along in an hour or so and said: Have you looked at  the monitors? That erratic breathing is now much smoother. Still very  shallow, the heart rate still very fast, but it is not erratic. She is  drawing life, and she is drawing strength, through you.   I am telling you, these children, unborn and born prematurely and  born full-term, they want to live. They want a shot at life.   I know there is so much out there: Oh, but a woman has a right to  choose.   But we should speak up for the most vulnerable who can't speak for  themselves.   That is what Ramona Trevino did, former director of the Sherman  Planned Parenthood. She said what finally drove her out of Planned  Parenthood were the monthly statistics. The most important statistic  was how many young children, as young as 12, are you getting on birth  control pills, because the younger you get them on birth control pills,  the more likely they will miss days, but they will be sexually active,  multiple partners, and the more likely they will get pregnant, and we  make a lot of money off the abortions. So the most critical thing: get  them on those birth control pills.   Where in the world does that end up being good for the child? Where?   We have people in China; they abort female children right and left.  Let's speak up for the females, for the unborn. Give them a chance. Let  them live. You will be better. They will be better.    This is an important week in history as I was taught in  law school that courts do not take up cases to merely give an advisory  opinion, that there has to be someone who is actually harmed by some  action about which they are suing.   As we know, in the Roe v. Wade case, at the time it was adjudicated,  there was no justiciable issue. The plaintiff in that case now publicly  states she was used by the pro-abortion groups, she was manipulated,  and that she has suffered because of what the pro-abortion groups  talked her into. She has dedicated her life to try to undo the wrong  that has been done purportedly for her.   So I appreciate my friends' speaking up. As I said, in my case, I  will never forget my child, many weeks early, holding on, breathing  rapidly, but doing everything she could to live.   Most of us have seen the in utero photograph of an unborn baby, an  unborn child, grasping the finger of a doctor. They want to live. They  want to grow. They want to be. They want to know.   Though my child couldn't see me with her eyes because they weren't  far developed, as the doctor said: She knows your voice. You give her  comfort because she knows your voice.   We heard testimony in our Judiciary Committee previously from a  doctor who did maybe 1,000, I think he said, late-term abortions. It is  difficult to take as he described.   Of course, the female body is not able to birth or get rid of a child  without intervention, so if somebody wants an abortion of a child that  is further along and is developed, he described--and I won't use the  detail he did because it gets me too emotional.   He would go in with clamps, find something that felt like an arm or a  [[Page H711]]  leg, grasp hold, pull it off from the body, dispose of that, reach for  something else that felt like an arm or a leg and pull it off, because  the body with the head and the limbs attached cannot be brought out.   He would rip one after another the two arms and the two legs off.  Then, as he would describe, the last thing you reach for is something  bulbous, and when you find it, you have to crush it so you can get the  child out of the womb.   After he lost his daughter in a tragic accident, he simply could not  pull another child apart like that. He gave it up and regretted all of  those abortions that he had done with no feeling until he lost his own  daughter in an accident.   I want to say I appreciate Majority Leader Hoyer bringing up a  request that people speak civilly about each other. I get pretty  frustrated with some folks here, some in the Senate, and that is just  my own party.   But I keep hearing--and we have heard this in the Judiciary  Committee. We have had hearings on it. People keep wanting to say that  the biggest problem is this rising anti-Islam hate crime body that is  emerging.   But we have got the numbers here from 2015, 2016, 2017. Even one  hate-based crime is too many. There were 257 incidents in 2015  involving anti-Islamic feelings, hatred, prejudice, 307 victims. That  can include yelling, but normally, the offenses, there were 301.   But anti-Jewish, in 2015, there were 664 incidents, 695 offenses, and  731 victims. That is pretty much 2 to 3 to 1 more anti-Jewish hate  crime offenses and incidents than anti-Islamic. One is too many, but I  hope that people who are in the House will cease the anti-Israel  bigotry and the anti-Israel hatred.   After 6 million Jews were slaughtered during World War II, before  that and leading up to it, they needed a place, and, of course, it  satisfied and fulfilled a great deal of prophecy that Israel came back.  There are no descendants of anyone who preceded the Jewish people in  that area currently alive. Yet there is so much hatred for the Jewish  people.   I saw it in Germany last year. I couldn't believe I was seeing hatred  rising again. Much of it was from people who were refugees, but it is  shocking.   Germany was trying to show the world how loving, open, and accepting  they were, so they took in all of these refugees, most of whom were  Muslim, and now they have all this anti-Jewish hatred. So, hopefully,  this House can set the proper precedent by stopping the anti-Semitic  comments.   For heaven's sake, I have been mad at Senator Graham over different  things, but one of our House Members accused him of being compromised  and then made allegations insinuating that he is really hateful. So I  am hopeful that my friends across the aisle will be able to avoid going  to those hateful places so that we can have rigorous, tough debate  without trying to assassinate character.   One of the places we see a tremendous amount of bigotry, hatred, and  racism is in the Judeo-Samaritan areas from the Palestinian Authority.  It is unbelievable that, in today's time, an area the United States is  sending a tremendous amount of money, that we would be mute while the  Palestinian Authority sentences a man apparently of Arab descent, Issam  Akel. He is a U.S. citizen. But he was abducted by Palestinian  Authority intelligence October 11 in Ramallah, and he has now been  sentenced to life at hard labor because he sold what they say is  Palestinian property to a Jew.   That is incredible. We are sending them money to help cultivate that  kind of bigotry and hatred against Jews? Really? This day and time we  are doing that? It needs to stop.   I have seen literature that is being used in Palestinian areas to  teach children to hate Jews, to think of them, as Farrakhan said, like  termites or rats, for heaven's sake. Then I see friends across the  aisle in pictures embracing Farrakhan as he has said some of the most  hateful, vile, mean-spirited, and bigoted comments about our Jewish  friends. Really?   I would share the desire and the hope that one day we really will  achieve Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s dream where people are judged by  the content of their character and it won't be necessary to ask people  on forms what race they are.   I think it is important to know if people are citizens or not because  that is how we arrive at how many Representatives, that kind of thing.  Those are important things. It helps a lot with governmental decisions  when we know who is a citizen and who isn't, that kind of thing.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to the day we don't have to ask race.  Everybody would just check ``human race,'' and it won't matter. It  doesn't matter if you are Hispanic, black, white, red, or green. It  won't matter.   And I look so forward to that day. Then we won't need any groups that  use race or skin color to delineate the group, because we will have  other things and other priorities that draw our interests; and we will  be determined by those kind of groups, not hate groups, but groups that  come together because of shared interests, and race doesn't matter. I  look forward to those days.   But in the Palestinian areas, the Palestinian Authority is  multiplying the hate, and we keep funding them. I was glad we cut back  some of the money being sent that is still being spent and still going  there.   The other thing that we keep hearing more about than anything is how  hateful, immoral, and mean-spirited walls are, even though everybody  who talks about walls has an outer wall around their home or their  apartment building. Whatever they live in, there is an outer wall.   Why? Madam Speaker, it is because you don't want everybody coming and  parading through your home unless you invite them.   Yes, Madam Speaker, just because there are burglars who can get past  your dead bolt lock or break through your window, you still have a  wall. You still have dead bolts because it will help slow people down  from trying to get in, and hopefully they will be caught before they  can get in and do damage.   Hopefully, just the presence of an outer wall around your home--I  understand most people want to have interior walls to give family  members some privacy, but if walls are immoral, why would you have one  around your home, the outer wall of your home? It is because they work.  They are not immoral.   Some people say, oh, it is a 14th century solution. Actually, it is  more like a 3000 B.C. solution.   I have a picture in my office of some of our military there at a  place called Ur, where Abraham came from. There has been a massive wall  there since about 3000 B.C.   They are used to slow down people whom you don't want coming in  without your permission.   So it isn't a 21st century problem with having people walk into your  home or homeland unimpeded. It is as old as humanity itself, and walls  can help.   Madam Speaker, that is why I had the picture the other day, earlier  this week, of the huge fence barrier that was put up at the 2016  Democratic National Convention, because the people in charge there--and  Hillary Clinton was the nominal head of the party, being the nominee.  Those folks understood those help keep out people you don't want in.   Nobody told the head of the Democratic National Committee, including  their nominee, that fences, barriers, and walls don't work. So they had  it out there on full display because they didn't want anybody coming in  they didn't want there, and that includes people who were not delegates  or the people they wanted. They knew that walls, fencing, and barriers  would work, but only if you have security there to watch over them.   So it is a good thing. So we had that picture.   Then here is a picture of a wall and fence. A lot of people say  Israel has a wall around it, because they do have some wall, but most  of it is fence. It works because they guard it.                                time  1530    We ought to be doing the same thing because, if we allow this Nation  to continue to have people pouring in, even people who pour in well  motivated, coming in illegally, they haven't been educated on how you  keep a self-governing country, and you lose it.  [[Page H712]]    Mostly, in history, they haven't lasted 200 years. That is about the  end. We are beyond that. But we are headed to the dustbin of history  unless we begin to teach all those here how you keep a republic.   And I know some have been miseducated and think socialism is the way  to go--oh, it is so much more caring; you have got billionaires pouring  in hundreds of millions of dollars--because they think, when all is  said and done, they will be part of that top ruling class. In socialism  you never have just one class--that is the way it is sold--but you have  the big, powerful, rich ruling class, like oligarchs in Russia, and  then you have the ruled class.   Actually, I saw it firsthand as an exchange student in the Soviet  Union. You have got the rulers and you have got the ruled, and you  don't really have a middle class. It is not a good way to live because  you have got to have a totalitarian government, as Khrushchev found out  when he tried to come up with a plan to get rid of government and go  just to the ``share and share alike'' philosophy. He disbanded the  commission because it didn't work. There is no way to ever go without a  totalitarian government that tells you everything you can or can't do.   Anyway, Israel, walls work, fences work, those barriers work. And I  think this is a lovely wall and fence.   My understanding is this one is part of--well, it protects the  Hillary Clinton Chappaqua residence, Chappaqua, New York. Nobody has  gotten word to Hillary Clinton, apparently, that these things don't  work. You have got security. You have got the walls. You have got the  fence.   I know she is saying otherwise now, but she knows. That is why she  has got a wall and a fence. She knows it works. It is not immoral,  trying to protect what you have got, protect the people you love, what  you love.   There are just so many examples around the world.   I needed this marked. I believe this is Bill de Blasio's. I am not  certain. I think this is his wall and fence because, even though he has  said something like, ``They have got plenty of money; it is in the  wrong hands,'' he doesn't realize he is one of the wrong hands it is  in.   And if he would get rid of his wall, he could invite all those people  into his home, and he could stop saying walls are immoral, because he  got rid of his immoral wall.   And, obviously, for those who don't understand sarcasm, that is  sarcasm.   And these are examples here of walls, fences that work. They keep  people out.   Now, the Iron Curtain, that was a different matter, because they were  keeping people in that didn't want to be in, shooting people that  didn't stay in.   But they work. That is why they are around prisons. That is why they  are around jails or jail facilities. Yes, they work. We have found that  for thousands of years.   So I hope that we will be more realistic in the arguments and debates  that go on here, stop the ridiculous rhetoric.   Everybody in here knows walls work. That is why their home has outer  walls instead of just some partitions in the middle of the home where  anybody can walk in and around and through their home. They know those  walls work.   So let's talk about what most people in here have voted for. Let's  get the government reopened because we agree to do something to stop  the death, the human carnage, the rape, all of these horrendous things  brought about by drug cartels controlling our southern border. Let's  stop it. Let's dry up the cartels.   And for those who don't care about the Americans, if your number one  goal is to help the people of Mexico, help the people of Central  America as well, the thing to do is get a barrier, get a wall where we  need it, but secure the whole thing. Then we dry up the money to the  drug cartels and Mexico becomes a top ten economy; they have a  burgeoning middle class and they have a better standard of living.   The best thing we can do for Mexico and Central America: build a wall  where we need it; secure the border; cut off the money, then, flowing  to the drug cartels; and give the people of Mexico a life they deserve.   Having some trickle in--they have got 130,000 or so in Mexico. Having  a million come in a year, that is still not helping the people of  Mexico, and it is bringing down our own country because we are not  prepared and able to take care of such mass illegal invaders on top of  the million-plus legal visas we give people to come in our country.   Why? Because we are the most generous country in the world when it  comes to philanthropy and when it comes to giving visas, because we  know it is a strength to have many races, to have many national  origins.   But the one thing that I loved about 9/12--when we gathered in our  town square and we held hands, we sang hymns together, we prayed  together--that day, for that day, there was not a single hyphenated  America out there. Every person there said, ``I am an American''--all  races, creed, color, national origin, age. On 9/12, we were one nation,  under God. And I hope and pray we can get back to that place.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
