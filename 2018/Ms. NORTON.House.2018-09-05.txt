 Mr. Speaker, as the Kavanaugh hearing proceeds, the House  gets no say on Supreme Court nominees, but our constituents have much  to lose if Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed.   As chair of the Congressional Black Caucus' Judicial Nominations Task  Force, I have studied Judge Kavanaugh's record closely. African  Americans have the most to lose because they, more than other  Americans, have advanced their rights through the court.   However, most Americans have much to lose, too, as Kavanaugh's record  on the Affordable Care Act, criminal justice, and reproductive rights  shows. Let the House also note, Kavanaugh's vision of executive power  would enhance the authority of the executive at the expense of the  other branches of government, including Congress, and, therefore, would  pose a special danger to the Constitution's careful balance of power.   Brett Kavanaugh does not belong on the Supreme Court.                            ____________________
