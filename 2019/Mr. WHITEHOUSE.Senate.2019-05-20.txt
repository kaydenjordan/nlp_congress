 Madam President, it is an honor and a true pleasure  to join Rhode Island's senior Senator here on the floor today to honor  the work of Salve Regina University's seventh president, Sister Jane  Gerety. Like Senator Reed, I have enjoyed Sister Jane's friendship,  companionship, wise counsel, encouragement, and occasional course- correction suggestions over many years.   She will retire next month, capping a decade of service to her  university, to the Newport community, and to Rhode Island. Sister Jane  has accomplished remarkable things in her tenure. She established a new  satellite campus in Warwick to help working Rhode Islanders take  graduate and continuing education courses. She helped establish online  study options, bringing the university's many offerings directly to  Rhode Island students in their homes. She launched new programs of  study, including a master of fine arts and creative writing,  experiential learning opportunities in a range of fields, and a  doctoral program in nursing. She raised millions of dollars in funding  to strengthen Salve's endowments, supporting every facet of university  life. She supervised numerous improvements to Salve Regina's beautiful  Newport campus, including a $46 million renovation of the O'Hare  Academic Building.   Sister Jane's work has contributed much to the city of Newport and  the State of Rhode Island. Newport is home to an array of legendary  Gilded Age mansions and other culturally significant buildings set atop  cliffs overlooking the shining Atlantic Ocean. Many of these  architectural masterpieces now belong to her university and have needed  significant upkeep. From the outset, Sister Jane recognized the value  of Salve's stewardship of the architectural heritage of Newport, RI.  The beautifully maintained campus, replete with the newly dedicated  Gerety Hall, named in honor of Sister Jane, is a gem of an asset for  the city and for the State.   Sister Jane's work has extended beyond our State's border. Under her  management, Salve strengthened its Pell Center for International  Relations and Public Policy. Today more than ever, the Pell Center is a  fitting reflection of its namesake, Senator Claiborne Pell, for whom  our democratic ideals held limitless power. The center's academic  programs, publications, and forums spread important ideas around the  globe, advancing American domestic and foreign policy, cyber security,  and diversity in leadership.   As impressive and praiseworthy as those professional accomplishments  is the immediate personal and lasting difference Sister Jane has made  in the individual lives of so many around her, including Senator Reed  and myself. A  [[Page S2959]]  member of the 2019 Salve class says he will remember Sister Jane en  route to ``bring candy and snacks to student athletes for conference  games'' and her willingness to meet with any student in her office.  Indeed, when visiting Newport, young alums in search of graduate school  advice or a word of encouragement have known that they are welcome to  stop by Sister Jane's office to find an open door, a warm heart, and  wise counsel.   Over the course of her career, Sister Jane embodied the values of her  Catholic order, the Sisters of Mercy. The Sisters were founded with a  mission to spread the gift of education and care for those in need in  their community. Last year, Sister Jane told Newport Daily News she  sees the institution she led as ``imbued with mercy,'' adding, ``I hope  I've helped to cultivate that spirit.''   I should note that with regard to the legacy of the Sisters of Mercy,  in her service, Sister Jane also honored an extraordinary tradition of  extraordinary female leadership.   As I am giving these remarks, I am so glad that the Presiding Officer  in the U.S. Senate is a woman Senator.   Sister Therese, who was Sister Jane's predecessor, was a skilled and  beloved leader of Salve Regina, and Sister Lucille--before Sister  Therese and before Sister Jane--was another powerful and effective  leader. This impressive tradition of leadership by women is worth  celebrating on its own as we celebrate the achievements of Sister Jane,  and Sister Jane has shown herself well worthy and advanced that  tradition.   Sister Jane, it is clear to all who know you--and that is pretty much  all who love you--that the spirit of mercy has flourished at Salve  Regina and has been enhanced in our State under your leadership. We  wish you well in your next chapters.   I join my senior Senator in these sentiments.    Mr. President, I am here today for the 243rd time to  call on this Chamber to wake up to the reality of climate change. I  thank my colleague Senator Cornyn for his recent statement  acknowledging that the days of ignoring this are over. Now it is time  to do something with keeping global warming below the 1.5 or 2 degrees  Centigrade threshold target.   I speak regularly about the fossil fuel industry's relentless grip on  Congress and how that grip prevents action on climate. Don't get me  wrong--they are still at it, but they are not the only thing slowing  progress. Another impediment is the wide swathes of our news media that  cover the issue torpidly or not at all or as actual propagators of  falsehood.   Look at the big climate stories the media ought to be covering just  from 2018. The year 2018 brought two landmark climate science reports.  One was the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on what  warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels will do. The  other was the Trump administration's own National Climate Assessment.  These two studies delivered the starkest warnings on climate change  ever--that the damage from climate change is already occurring, that  world economies are now at risk, and that we are almost out of time to  prevent the worst consequences.   Even the fossil fuel industry and its stooges in the Trump  administration didn't contest the science behind these reports. They  know their science-denial campaign is phony. They know the real science  is irrefutable. So it is better to hide from it than fight it, I guess.   The year 2018 also brought devastating natural disasters linked to  climate change. Out West, wildfires in California broke records.  Hurricanes supercharged by warming oceans slammed the east coast, gulf  coast, and Caribbean. Floods, droughts, and rising seas were reported  across the United States and around the globe.  [[Page S2983]]    Mr. President, 2018 also brought dire warnings of economic dangers  from climate change. At the U.N. climate summit in December, a group of  415 global investors--not environmentalists; investors--managing $32  trillion of investments warned that unless carbon emissions are  urgently cut, the world faces a financial crash worse than the 2008  economic meltdown. The group called for the end of fossil fuel  subsidies and the introduction of substantial prices on carbon to  rebalance the market failure.   The Union of Concerned Scientists separately found that over 300,000  coastal homes, with a collective market value of over $130 billion, are  at risk of chronic flooding by 2045. UCS showed that by the end of the  century, 2.4 million homes, worth more than $1 trillion, could be at  risk. Decisions we make now will determine whether those risks come to  pass. By the way, First Street Foundation found that coastal property  values are already beginning to slide.   Unprecedented catastrophes, forceful warnings from scientists and  financial experts--surely the viewers of America's top television  networks should be focused on these things--or not. According to the  media watchdog Media Matters, our major television networks--ABC, CBS,  NBC, and FOX--aired 45 percent less climate change coverage on their  marquee news programs in 2018 than in 2017. Climate coverage on network  nightly news and Sunday morning political shows fell to just 142  minutes in all of 2018, down from an already lame 260 minutes in 2017.  That is less than 1 minute a day of coverage from all four major  networks combined.   Kudos to NBC, which actually upped its coverage by about one-quarter  from the year before. Without NBC, the numbers look even worse. Media  Matters found CBS's climate coverage down 56 percent from 2017 to 2018.  ``FOX News Sunday'' is down 75 percent, and ABC is down a whopping 81  percent from a pretty low performance to begin with.   I have noticed this trend, so I have begun keeping an eye on the  Sunday shows' coverage this year. Each month, I look at how many  substantive segments on climate change each show runs. It is not good.  In April, for instance, there were only two substantive segments on  climate change across all five shows. They have basically become Sunday  morning political gossip columns.   If you move from quantity to quality, well, with TV still the top way  Americans get their news, the quality of news coverage really matters.  How are television news shows doing in that department? Too often, also  badly. Many of these shows still give airtime to clownish climate  deniers just to create a pro and con.   The Weather Channel tracked reaction on television shows to the Trump  administration's National Climate Assessment this past fall and found  airtime still given to debunked climate nonsense--for instance, the  American Enterprise Institute's Danielle Pletka's ridiculous falsehoods  about recent cold weather; conservative political commentators Rick  Santorum and Stephen Moore's argument that climate scientists cooked up  the assessment to enrich themselves; and a Member of Congress's  argument that ``our climate always changes, and we see those ebb and  flows through time,'' as if million-year climate changes are in any way  comparable to the rapid punch in the face we are giving to our climate  with carbon emissions right now, manmade.   Allowing this falsehood on the air tilts Americans' perception of  climate change. ``Placing a climate contrarian behind a scientist is  effectively shrinking the 97 percent consensus on the issue to 50  percent--two people arguing opposite sides,'' the Weather Channel  pointed out.   In the Columbia Journalism Review last month, author and journalist  Mark Hertsgaard and editor and publisher Kyle Pope describe this  troubling trend as follows:         Climate deniers are still given respectful treatment by US       news outlets across the ideological spectrum. [They] in fact       deserve to have their social licenses revoked, just as       tobacco companies did. More than anyone else, it is       climate deniers who got us into this mess; they don't get       to decide what we do with it now.    Again, on this front, NBC has been the best. In December, NBC's  ``Meet the Press'' devoted an entire show to climate coverage, delving  into the science and discussing climate solutions in detail. It began  with a clear message from host Chuck Todd. He said:         We're not going to debate climate change, the existence of       it. The Earth is getting hotter. And human activity is a       major cause, period. We're not going to give time to climate       deniers. The science is settled, even if political opinion is       not.    That is the right place to start the discussion in the media on  climate change. Facts are facts. Falsehood is falsehood and does not  deserve equal time. I hope other networks take note.   If they want to cover climate denial, cover it the way it should be  covered: investigatively, as a fraudulent enterprise with big secret  money behind it. Trust me, there is a lot to investigate. Don't  legitimize lies.   Newspapers and online news are a mixed bag. As a group, our top  national papers are improving their coverage of climate change.  According to the University of Colorado Boulder's International  Collective on Environment, Culture, & Politics, the five major national  newspapers--the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Wall Street  Journal, USA Today, and the Los Angeles Times--published 282 articles  about climate change in January 2009. A decade later, January of this  year, those papers published 469--282, up to 469. That is a good sign.  So, too, generally is the quality of coverage. Big publications like  the New York Times and Washington Post and smaller, independent, and  web-based publications like InsideClimate News, Years of Living  Dangerously, and Grist have brought us into the midst of climate crisis  with brilliant reporting and storytelling. The Guardian, from overseas,  may be the best of all. The Guardian just decided, as editorial policy,  to use ``climate emergency crisis or breakdown'' instead of ``climate  change,'' ``global heating'' instead of ``global warming,'' and  ``climate science denier'' instead of ``climate skeptic.'' These  outlets all offer readers captivating photos, videos, and graphics that  illustrate exactly how the climate is changing and what that will mean.   In Rhode Island, our Providence Journal has done exceptional  reporting on carbon pollution's effects on our climate and oceans. This  year alone, the Journal has published indepth, front-page articles on  how Rhode Island's real estate market is already experiencing the  effects of climate change, on scientists' warnings of massive flooding  risk to coastal towns, and on the risks facing Providence's hurricane  barrier as sea levels rise and storm surges loom in the decades to  come. Here is an example of that, like that from our home State paper.   Mr. President, other Rhode Island papers, like the Newport Daily  News, the Westerly Sun, and ecoRI, cover climate change in their  communities with vigor and skill. They supply the news Rhode Islanders  need to understand and prepare for the effects of climate change.   Elsewhere, the record is not so good. Take USA Today, a paper with a  circulation to 1.8 million Americans and a broad online readership.  According to the University of Colorado, the paper ran 25 articles on  climate change in January 2009. It ran only 14 this January.   On its editorial page, however, USA Today's editorial board wrote one  of the strongest climate editorials so far this year, making the case  for meaningful action on climate change. They cited real science and  dismissed Republican leaders' cynical campaign against the Green New  Deal. The editorial concluded: ``The critics owe this and future  generations more than scorn; they have an obligation to put better  ideas and solutions on the table.   Bravo and well said to that.   The reverse is the Wall Street Journal, with pretty good news  coverage. It is a respectable news-gathering newspaper--in fact, a  first-order one. But its opinion page emits toxic climate waste. For  decades, the Wall Street Journal's editorial page has been a haven for  outlandish science denial, but they truly outdo themselves when it  comes to climate denial. Take a piece that the Journal published just  last year titled, ``The Sea Is Rising, but Not Because of Climate  Change.'' Riddled with scientific errors, it ignores all of the  legitimate science on  [[Page S2984]]  climate change. The author whom they published, a notorious climate  denier, has for years been affiliated with or funded by the Heritage  Foundation, the Heartland Institute, the Cato Institute--a rogues'  gallery of industry-funded climate denial front groups.   The sum of this is an American media too often asleep at the switch  when warnings need to be made.   The Washington Post media columnist and former public editor of the  New York Times, Margaret Sullivan, wrote this past fall:         Just as the world, especially the United States, needs       radical change to mitigate the coming crisis, so too for the       news media. . . . This subject must be kept front and center,       with the pressure on and the stakes made abundantly clear at       every turn. . . . Just as the smartest minds in earth science       have issued their warning, the best minds in media should be       giving sustained attention to how to tell this most important       story in a way that will create change.    There is some exceptional climate change coverage reaching readers  today. Indeed, American voters increasingly name climate change as a  big priority for them at the ballot box, but the pace of climate  disruption demands urgency. Columbia Journalism Review's Hertsgaard and  Pope write: ``If American journalism doesn't get the climate story  right--and soon--no other story will matter.''   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
