 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to celebrate the centennial  of the House passing an amendment granting women the right to vote in  all States in this country.   One hundred years ago, the unrelenting efforts of women suffragists  over the course of a 72-year campaign paid off in the passage of the  19th Amendment.   For example, the first woman to hold Federal office, Republican  Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana, was actually elected 3  years before women were allowed to vote at the Federal level in all the  States at the time. She went on to introduce legislation similar to  what would eventually become the 19th Amendment.   My home State Republican Senator, Aaron Sargent from California,  introduced the first legislation to amend the Constitution and grant  women the right to vote. It failed on the Senate floor, but it  represented the beginning of an unstoppable movement that culminated in  the ratification of the 19th Amendment in August 1920.   This Chamber is where it all began. I am proud to be standing here  today and joining my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to  celebrate the 100th anniversary of this great victory for women and the  values of our Republic.                            ____________________
