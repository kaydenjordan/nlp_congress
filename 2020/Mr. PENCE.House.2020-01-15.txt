 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an American hero, PFC  Louis Wiesehan, Jr., of Richmond, Indiana, and celebrate his return  home to the Sixth District of Indiana.   PFC Wiesehan was a fellow marine who gave the ultimate sacrifice  while fighting on the island of Betio in the Pacific Ocean during World  War II. After 77 years, PFC Wiesehan is finally coming home. His  remains will be buried in his hometown.   Thank you, PFC Wiesehan, for your service and sacrifice. You will  never be forgotten. Semper Fi.                                March for Life     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give my wholehearted support  for the upcoming March for Life rallies taking place across the Nation  next week.   I am a passionately pro-life American and I will always fight for  unborn children. It is our duty to protect the most vulnerable and  speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.   As millions of Americans march across the Nation next week, I pledge  to always stand with their cause.                 Greenfield-Central High School Radio Station     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Greenfield- Central High School Radio Station WRGF for being on air for 20 years.  The high school station was established in 1999 and is now a 24/7 on- air public radio station run completely by students and their teacher,  Jonathan Hudson.   Greenfield-Central's radio/TV classes draw 70 students a semester who  are able to learn and gain professional experience before they enter  college or the workforce. I was able to witness the advantages that  these students are able to gain while visiting the facility last fall.   Happy anniversary to WRGF and all the students who participate in the  program.                Congratulating New Palestine Coach Kyle Ralph     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate New Palestine  football coach, Kyle Ralph.   Coach Ralph is among the list of only 32 coaches nationwide who are  finalists for the 2019 Don Shula NFL High School Coach of the Year  Award. In his 7 years as head coach at New Palestine, Coach Ralph has  built a program that has become a statewide powerhouse.   Throughout his tenure, Coach Ralph has amassed an amazing 88-4 record  and has brought three State championships home to New Palestine.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Coach Ralph the best of luck during the ceremony  at the NFL Pro Bowl.                                 NEPA Update     Mr. Speaker, I applaud the Trump administration for  proposing to update the totally outdated National Environmental Policy  Act regulations.   These policies haven't seen reform in over 4 decades. As a result  countless infrastructure projects have been backlogged for years.   It is time to roll back burdensome regulations that stifle growth.   Modernizing NEPA regulations will allow schools, bridges, and other  vital projects to finally move forward safely and efficiently.   I pledge my support for these updates and look forward to the  continued improvement of America's infrastructure.                            ____________________
