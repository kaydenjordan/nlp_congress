 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding me time.   You know, here we go again. We started this session with a terrible  tax bill that was written in the dark of night, not one single hearing,  not one single expert witness, an unpaid-for $2.3 trillion tax cut. We  find out after it is passed that it is fraught with problems.   Now we are going to end the session with another tax bill, not quite  as fiscally irresponsible as the first, but $100 billion unpaid for-- again, no hearings, no expert witnesses.   Why in the world do you think this one is not going to be fraught  with problems? This is the height of irresponsibility and just one more  example of the Republicans' borrow-and-spend philosophy and practice.   Once again, I am sure we are going to hear from our friends on the  other side that now that we have done this, now that we have charged  all this money to future generations, we are going to have to come back  and put on our fiscally responsible hat and cut Medicare and cut Social  Security.   This is shameful, and it is irresponsible.   If that is not bad enough, now, in this bill, you are going to try to  provide false hope to people who were victimized from natural disasters  all across the country, from hurricanes, tornados, fires. You know this  bill is not going anyplace. The Senate is not going to take up this  bill. So you are providing false hope to folks who really need our help  right now.   Mr. Speaker, revictimizing people who were terribly hurt during these  disasters, it is shameful; it is irresponsible; and I urge a ``no''  vote.
