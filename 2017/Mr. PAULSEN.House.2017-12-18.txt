 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor and supporter  of the bipartisan Dialysis PATIENTS Demonstration Act, which provides  better care for patients who are suffering from end-stage renal  disease, also known as kidney failure.   Currently, there are about 9,000 Minnesotans who suffer from end- stage renal disease. Many of these patients spend hours and hours  enduring multiple hospital visits each and every week to treat this  disease; and, on top of that, they oftentimes also have to travel to a  different location to get treatment for other health conditions they  may have as well.   This legislation will allow dialysis centers to provide integrated  care for patients by bringing in providers so that people can receive  comprehensive treatments all in the same place. These patients will  also be able to see additional benefits, like transportation services,  dental care, and vision care.   Mr. Speaker, let's pass this bill so we can improve the quality of  life for this vulnerable patient population by coordinating the care  system and making it easier for them to receive their treatments.                            ____________________
