 Mr. Speaker, over the past year, Congress passed five  bipartisan and targeted relief bills, totaling $3.7 trillion, to  respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. These packages succeeded in  supporting our economy through the worst of this crisis.   Now, Democrat leadership wants to spend another $2 trillion on an  excessive plan that directs just 1 percent toward vaccines, 1 percent,  and provides far beyond what is needed to fuel our continued recovery.   States will receive $350 billion on top of the $500 billion already  allocated. Revenue is actually up in these States.   Supplementing unemployment compensation while small business is  hurting for employees is the wrong move to be made at this time.   Mr. Speaker, in this bill, felons, including currently incarcerated  murderers, were not exempt from receiving these stimulus checks that  are intended for taxpayers.   Federal workers, Mr. Speaker, will receive up to $35 an hour, in  addition to their full salary, to care for a child learning from home.   Why do Federal workers deserve such privilege, Mr. Speaker, when we  should be focused on economic recovery, getting our children back to  school, and vaccine distribution? That is what is in the interests of  the American people.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Ohio for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, once again, Democratic leadership is proposing  legislation that would do nothing to prevent criminals from accessing  firearms while greatly restricting the Second Amendment rights of law- abiding citizens.   These bills are being sold to the public as an effort to pass  universal background checks. But House Democrats fail to recognize that  every commercial gun sale in the United States already has a background  check.   Mr. Speaker, ending gun violence in America is a goal we all share,  but H.R. 8 will subject law-abiding gun owners to criminal penalties  for simply handing a firearm to another person.   For instance, if you loaned a friend a rifle to go hunting, they  could face a year in prison or a $100,000 fine. This is simply  ridiculous.   The same would be true, Mr. Speaker, if you loaned an abuse victim a  firearm for self-defense. H.R. 1446 would create arbitrary delays for  firearm purchases and could allow the FBI to delay a firearm transfer  indefinitely.   These bills would do nothing to keep Americans safer and, in fact,  threaten the public safety and our constitutional right to bear arms.                                time  1530
