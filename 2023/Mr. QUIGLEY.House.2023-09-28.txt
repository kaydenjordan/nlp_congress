 Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule. It concerns me that my  friend, the chairman of the Rules Committee--and I believe that I say  this correctly--described this as part of the normal democratic  process. If that is true, then that is the new normal and it is more  evidence of dysfunction and the inability to govern than it is anything  else.   A few years ago, Fiona Hill said that polarization in this country is  now a national security threat because it shows the rest of the world  that we can't function, we can't govern. No one outside this body is  going to see this rule and this tactic as anything other than at least  an attempt to defund the efforts to help Ukraine.   I get it. The Speaker has the sword of Damocles over his head because  of a few Members in the far right that have disproportionate control.  We are not  [[Page H4795]]  talking about the tail wagging the dog, it is the tip of the dog's  tail. The rest of the world is watching this, understanding the  underlying reasons why this so matters.   Ukraine's fight is the reason we fought the Second World War. It is  the reason we formed NATO, and it is the reason we formed the United  Nations. We simply cannot let a sovereign democratic country get wiped  off the face of the Earth. We grew up hearing and believing ``Never  again.'' Yet, as I stood in Bucha in Ukraine and saw the mass grave and  heard the horrors there, it made me think that it will happen on a more  massive scale if we don't act.   To quote FDR in his last, shortest inaugural address: ``We have  learned that we cannot live alone, at peace; that our own well-being is  dependent on the well-being of other nations far away.'' He was right  then and he is right now.
