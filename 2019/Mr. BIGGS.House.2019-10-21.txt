 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I  rise to give notice of my intention to raise a question of the  privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   Whereas President Trump released the transcript of a call between him  and the President of Ukraine;   Whereas President Trump subsequently released the whistleblower  complaint of August 12, 2019;   Whereas, in a September 26, 2019, hearing on the whistleblower  complaint, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff purported  to relay the content of the phone call to the American people;   Whereas, instead of quoting directly from the available transcript,  Chairman Schiff manufactured a false retelling of the conversation  between President Trump and President Zelensky;   Whereas this egregiously false and fabricated retelling had no  relationship to the call itself;   Whereas these actions of Chairman Schiff misled the American people,  bring disrepute upon the House of Representatives, and make a mockery  of the impeachment process, one of this Chamber's most solemn  constitutional duties;   Whereas, for more than 2 years, Chairman Schiff has spread false  accusations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia;   Whereas, on March 20, 2017, then-Ranking Member Schiff read out false  allegations from the Steele dossier accusing numerous Trump associates  of colluding with Russia;   Whereas then-Ranking Member Schiff falsely claimed in a March 2017  interview to have ``more than circumstantial evidence'' of collusion  with Russia;   Whereas then-Ranking Member Schiff negotiated with Russian comedians  whom he believed to be Ukrainian officials to obtain materials to  damage the President of the United States politically;   Whereas, according to a New York Times article on October 2, 2019,  Chairman Schiff's committee staff met with the whistleblower prior to  the filing of his complaint, and staff members communicated the content  of the complaint to Chairman Schiff;   Whereas Chairman Schiff concealed his dealings with the whistleblower  from the rest of the Intelligence Committee, and when asked directly in  a television interview whether he had any contact with the  whistleblower, he lied to the American people and said, ``We have not  spoken directly with the whistleblower.'';   Whereas members of the Intelligence Committee have lost faith in his  objectivity and capabilities as chairman, with every Republican member  on the committee having signed a letter calling for his immediate  resignation as chairman; and   Whereas Chairman Schiff has hindered the ability of the Intelligence  Committee to fulfill its oversight responsibilities of the intelligence  community, an indispensable pillar of our national security: Now,  therefore, be it   Resolved, That--   (1) the House of Representatives censures and condemns Representative  Adam Schiff for conduct that misleads the American people in a way that  is not befitting an elected Member of the House of Representatives;   (2) Representative Adam Schiff will forthwith present himself in the  well of the House for the pronouncement of censure; and   (3) Representative Adam Schiff will be censured with the public  reading of this resolution by the Speaker.    Yes.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
