 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to support the joint resolution of  disapproval and to urge my colleagues to do so as well.   Let's be clear, there is no national security emergency at the  southwestern border. The President and his administration continue to  mislead Americans about what really is happening at the border in order  to fulfill a misguided campaign promise to build a wall. After weeks of  threats and toying with the idea of declaring a national emergency to  circumvent Congress, the President, in my view, wrongly issued such a  proclamation on February 15 under the authority of the National  Emergencies Act.   This proclamation redirects military construction funds provided by  Congress to the Department of Defense for projects deemed important to  the readiness, welfare, and missions of our Armed Forces. This action  is an extreme overreach of Executive authority. No President has ever  declared a national emergency to circumvent Congress for a construction  project he failed to get approved through legislation.   In fact, this authority to use military construction funds in an  emergency has only been used twice for projects in the United States-- first by President George Herbert Walker Bush during Operation Desert  Shield and then by President George W. Bush in the aftermath of the 9/ 11 terrorist attacks--and those projects addressed  [[Page S1830]]  immediate and recognized needs of our warfighters. While the  administration claims President Obama also used this authority, the  distinction is, he used it for its true intent, to provide facilities  quickly in overseas locations for our warfighters in combat zones. To  say those needs are the same as President Trump's campaign pledge to  build a wall is simply wrong and misleading.   The President tries to justify this emergency as responding to a  humanitarian crisis at the border, but the wall is not an effective  solution to that crisis. What he ignores is the fact that the House and  Senate overwhelmingly approved $22.54 billion in border security  funding in the recent appropriations bill to enhance physical barriers  at ports of entry, to hire additional law enforcement personnel, to  address the humanitarian needs of migrants, and to increase  counternarcotics and counterweapons detection technologies used at the  border. Moreover, I would argue that to truly stop the influx of  migrants at our southern border, there has to be a much more  coordinated international effort led by the Department of State to  address the conditions in Central America that cause migrants to leave  their homes. Stopping mass migration at the source is the most  effective and humane policy.   In its statement opposing the resolution before us today, the  administration characterizes increasing numbers of ``family units,  unaccompanied minors, and persons claiming a fear of return'' as a  national security threat and a national emergency. Let us be clear.  These groups of people present no military threat to our Nation.  General O'Shaughnessy, Commander of U.S. Northern Command, confirmed  this in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on  February 26, when he said: ``The threats to our nation from our  southern border are not military in nature.'' So I have a hard time  understanding why the administration thinks it is acceptable to use  Department of Defense dollars for a wall that would provide little to  no value to the Department of Defense in countering the very real  military threats our Nation does confront across the globe.   Some have argued that the wall is a necessary response to the opioid  crisis we are experiencing. There is no doubt we have a serious  substance abuse crisis in this country. According to the Centers for  Disease Control, over 70,000 people died in 2017 of drug overdoses.  That means more people died that year because of drug overdoses than  due to car crashes or gun violence. These numbers are staggering, and  no community is immune. Congress has worked in a bipartisan manner to  combat this crisis, passing landmark legislation and historic increases  in funding, but the administration has failed to live up to its  commitments. A wall will not fix this problem.   Indeed, while the administration would have the American people  believe these drugs are coming across the southwestern border between  ports of entry--where they want to build this wall--the facts from the  Drug Enforcement Agency's 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment reveal  otherwise.   In the case of heroin, in their words, ``The majority of flow is  through [privately owned vehicles] entering the United States at legal  ports of entry.'' This will not be stopped by building a wall.   When it comes to fentanyl, according to the National Drug Threat  Assessment, smaller quantities but of higher purity are ``transported  into the United States in parcel packages directly from China or from  China through Canada.'' A wall on the southwest border will not stop  packages of fentanyl coming through the mail from China. Again,  according to the DEA, the fentanyl that is smuggled in from Mexico is  most commonly, in their words, ``concealed in [vehicles] . . . through  [southwest border ports of entry]''--not through the terrain where the  President wants to build a wall.    To underscore this point, just 2 days ago, Customs and Border Patrol  announced the seizure of the biggest shipment of cocaine recovered at  the ports of New York and New Jersey in 25 years. About 1.6 tons of  cocaine were seized from a shipping container that arrived at the port  in Newark, NJ. President Trump's wall would not have stopped this  shipment.   Instead of addressing, for example, the high-purity fentanyl and  fentanyl precursors coming from China or improving law enforcement's  ability to detect and seize drugs at the ports of entry, this emergency  declaration for a wall will divert billions of dollars from our troops  and other national defense priorities and will not make our country any  safer. Canceling or delaying military construction projects will have  damaging impacts to the military services. These projects are intended  to improve deteriorating airfields and piers, provide modern training  and maintenance facilities, rehabilitate antiquated and hazardous  hospitals and schools, remediate environmental contamination at former  bases, and contribute to alliance and partnership responsibilities  around the globe.   Bypassing congressional intent that these funds be used on vetted  military construction projects in order to build a border wall Congress  has rejected time and again is an affront to our Nation's system of  checks and balances. It is also an abuse of the power of Congress  granted to the President to use in times of true security emergencies  or in times of war to address the immediate needs of our Armed Forces.   Furthermore, the administration wants to use another authority, title  10 United States Code, section 284, which allows the Department of  Defense, without requiring an emergency declaration, to ``provide  support for the counterdrug activities or activities to counter  transnational organized crime of any other department or agency of the  Federal Government,'' to include the ``[c]onstruction of roads and  fences and installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors  across international boundaries of the United States.''   This seems to be within the realm of the President's contemplation,  but because there is only about $238 million remaining in this  counterdrug account, the administration plans to reprogram roughly $2.5  billion appropriated in other DOD accounts into this counterdrug  account to use for the wall. We know much of the funds being  transferred would not be used for their original intent.   For example, the Army will have excess funding in military pay  because it will not meet anticipated end strength, and fewer personnel  opted into the new blended retirement system than anticipated, which  created savings. However, instead of transferring these dollars to  higher priority defense needs, DOD will have to use these amounts for  the wall.   Ironically, the $238 million now remaining in the counterdrug  accounts will not be used for its original purpose of providing  critical intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and other  detection capabilities for drug interdiction in the Caribbean, Central  and South America, and Asia. It will be used to build a wall that will  not solve the Nation's drug problems. We are literally taking money  that is now being used to help interdict the flow of drugs through the  Caribbean, in the Pacific, et cetera, and will put it into the ground  in Mexico, where the drugs are not passing through.   We also know DOD has immediate and compelling needs of its own that  we should be addressing. The Air Force and the Marines need billions of  dollars to clean up and rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base and Camp Lejeune  after hurricanes devastated both installations last year. According to  the Marines, it is about $3.5 billion to Camp Lejeune, and--according  to some numbers I have seen for Tyndall--it is about $5 billion for  Tyndall. Instead of fixing Camp Lejeune and Tyndall Air Force Base, the  President is going to take that $8 billion and put it into a wall  through the deserts of the Southwest.   What is more important to the national security of the United States  than rebuilding our major Marine Corps facility on the Atlantic Coast  and rebuilding our major Air Force facility in the Florida Panhandle? I  think, clearly, we should invest in our troops in the Marines and Air  Force. We know all of the services continue to have readiness gaps in  aircraft maintenance, depot maintenance, and ship overhauls. We know  there continues to be a shortage of childcare facilities in certain  locations, but these very real needs in our military are put in  jeopardy because of the President's obsession with building a wall on  the border.  [[Page S1831]]    As I indicated, the President intends to fill the 284 account by  reprogramming funds. Congress authorizes this reprogramming process to  allow the Department of Defense to conduct a certain amount of  transfers of funds between accounts for unforeseen problems. By  tradition and custom, reprogramming is done with the specific approval  of the defense oversight committees, but this time, when DOD transfers  dollars to pay for the President's wall, Congress will have no say. The  administration will only notify Congress it is happening. Again, this  is another example of complete disregard for the legislative branch's  role, as directed by the Constitution, in approving and appropriating  funds for the activities of the executive branch.   Furthermore, the amount of funds that can be reprogrammed in a year  has a $4 billion limit, and DOD will use a significant portion of that  $4 billion to transfer money for the wall. This means that billions of  dollars of other high-priority defense needs will not be met this year,  needs like ship maintenance, unexpected fuel costs, vehicle upgrades,  and other equipment shortfalls we will see at the end of this year. The  Department of Defense is in a situation where they have ships that have  to be refueled, they have ships that have to be overhauled, they have  equipment that must be prepared for the readiness of the troops that  they will not have the money for because it has been spent already, and  they have exhausted their reprogramming not serving the needs of the  military but building a wall in the middle of the deserts of the  Southwest.   We need to address the real issues at our southwest border. To do so,  I will continue to support effective border security measures, such as  those in the recently passed Homeland Security Appropriations Act to  invest in new technology and equipment, increase the number of Customs  and Border Protection agents, and make smart physical improvements at  ports of entry.   This law also included funding to increase the number of immigration  judges to help reduce the backlog in our immigration system, provide  humanitarian aid for Central American countries, and address  humanitarian concerns at the border.   These efforts are important and appropriate for the true nature of  the situation, but I cannot support diverting billions of dollars of  money from the needs of our men and women in uniform to fulfill a  campaign promise. Therefore, I will vote in support of the resolution  to terminate the President's inappropriate declaration.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I would like to discuss the situation in  Yemen and express my continued support for the resolution that is  currently before us.   The conflict in Yemen is approaching its 4th year and has resulted in  the most severe humanitarian crisis in the world. The human cost of  this war is truly hard to fathom. According to the United Nations,  approximately 20 million people--or more than two-thirds of Yemen's  population--have no reliable source of food or access to medical care;  roughly 10 million Yemenis are on the brink of famine; more than 3.3  million Yemenis have been displaced from their homes; and credible  reports indicate that approximately 80,000 children have died of  starvation and another 360,000 children suffer from severe acute  malnutrition.   The international community must come together to demand an end to  the violence in Yemen and a sustainable political agreement. I strongly  support the efforts of the U.N. Special Envoy for Yemen Martin  Griffiths, in partnership with the United States and other engaged  nations, to expeditiously negotiate an end to the conflict and bring  relief to the Yemeni people. The December 2018 Stockholm Agreement and  resulting ceasefire around the port of Hudaydah was a critical  confidence building measure that will hopefully provide a foundation  for continued negotiations.   I commend my colleagues Senators Sanders, Murphy, and Lee for their  steadfast efforts to keep focus on the suffering of the Yemeni people.  As the events of the last 4 years have made clear, there is no military  solution to this civil war.   I remain deeply concerned about the significant number of civilian  casualties that have resulted from airstrikes by the Saudi-led  coalition. I strongly supported the decision last fall to cease U.S.  aerial refueling support to the coalition, an outcome I long advocated  for. It is appropriate for the U.S. to help the coalition avoid  civilian casualties, but those efforts have not yet yielded sufficient  results. Secretary Pompeo acknowledged this fact when he told Congress  in September that ``Recent civilian casualty incidents indicate  insufficient implementation of reforms and targeting processes'' and  ``Investigations have not yielded accountability measures'' into the  behavior of coalition pilots flying missions into Yemen. It is clear  that the coalition has not sufficiently minimized the impact of the war  on Yemeni civilians, and more must be done. The U.S. should use all  available leverage to affect better outcomes.   The resolution before us would make clear that Congress does not  support the introduction of U.S. forces into hostilities in Yemen  absent an affirmative authorization for the use of military force. I  believe that any U.S. assistance to members of the Saudi-led coalition  should be explicitly limited to the following objectives: enabling  counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda and ISIS; defending the  territorial integrity of Saudi Arabia and UAE, including against  specific, imminent ballistic missile and UAV threats; preserving  freedom of navigation in the maritime environment around Yemen; and  enhancing the training and professionalism of their armed forces with a  primary focus on the adherence to the Law of Armed Conflict and the  prevention of civilian casualties. With particular regard to defense  against ballistic missile and UAV threats, the United States cannot be  in the position of providing targeting information in Yemen that would  be misused by the Saudi-led coalition either deliberately or through  carelessness.   Continued U.S. engagement is critical to helping to resolve the  conflict in Yemen, but any assistance to the Saudi-led coalition should  be provided in accordance with the principles outlined above,  activities which I do not believe conflict with the War Powers  Resolution. From a policy perspective, the provision of U.S. support  that could be used to enable offensive operations against the Houthis  runs counter to our objective of ending the  [[Page S1835]]  civil war and risks exacerbating the suffering of the Yemeni people.  Beyond the humanitarian crisis, the conflict continues to negatively  impact the strategic security interests of the United States, Saudi  Arabia, and UAE, including by emboldening Iran and relieving pressure  on al Qaeda and ISIS. It is time for this war to end, and Congress  should take every opportunity to make its voice clear on this point.                              Order of Business
