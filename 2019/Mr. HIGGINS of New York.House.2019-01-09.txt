 Mr. Speaker, the storied Shea's Seneca  building on Seneca Street in South Buffalo reopens to the public after  18 months of extensive renovations made possible by Federal and State  historic tax credits.   Built in 1929, the former movie theater was the anchor of the once- thriving Seneca Street business district, and it will reopen this  Thursday. The use of Federal historic tax credits added more than $1  million to this historic preservation project.   There is new hope and optimism about the future of Seneca Street  because of the vision of developer Jake Schneider and his wise use of  the Federal Historic Tax Credit program that made the Shea's Seneca  project a reality.                            ____________________
