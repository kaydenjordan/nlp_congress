 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member of the  Committee on the Judiciary for his distinguished service and my good  friend from Texas for his managing of this bill on which we have a  vigorous and active disagreement, but realize that the role of the  Committee on the Judiciary is to enhance justice for all Americans, no  matter what size business, what ethnicity, racial background, what  issue they bring, whether they bring a commercial issue or whether they  are for criminal justice.   That is why I rise to oppose this legislation, for it is important  that we monitor, promote, coddle, and respect justice. I oppose the  legislation that aims to restore a long-discredited version of Federal  Rule of Civil Procedure 11, in effect from 1983 to 1993. I use as a  premise of my argument a letter from the Committee on Rules of Practice  and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, in  particular written by two distinguished Federal judges from Arizona,  the chair of the Committee on Rules and the chair of the Advisory  Committee on Rules, both Federal district court judges. But more  importantly, my luck was to meet with a series of judges in the past  week, Federal judges, Republican appointees and some Democratic  appointees, and there was a vocal outcry of the outrage of this  legislation, asking and begging that this legislation not be put in  place.   Let me give you a description from the Federal courts, recognizing:  ``We of course share the desire of the sponsors of LARA to improve the  civil justice system''--and that is the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act-- ``in our Federal courts, including the desire to reduce frivolous  filings. But LARA creates a cure worse than the problem it is meant to  solve.''   ``Moreover, as we are both Federal trial judges, our perspective is  informed by our ongoing daily experience with the practical operation  of the rules.''   I, too, am concerned about small businesses. That is why we need to  proceed as we are proceeding. It gives thoughtful judges the ability to  protect those entities. The facts do not, according to the letter,  support any assumption that mandatory sanctions deter frivolous  filings.   ``A decade of experience with the 1983 mandatory sanctions  provision,'' they go on to say, ``demonstrated that it failed to  provide meaningful relief from  [[Page H2028]]  the litigation behavior it was meant to address, and instead generated  wasteful satellite litigation that had little to do with the merits of  cases.''   What good is that for the small litigant? What good will they have  when they might be subject to satellite litigation? And so, Mr.  Chairman, why would we want to return to the failed, discredited  sanction regime rightly abandoned in 1993? H.R. 720 would require  courts to impose monetary sanctions for any rule 11 violation,  eliminating the safe harbor provision that currently allows attorneys  to correct or withdraw a filing before rule 11 proceedings commence.  That is justice: I made a mistake, I want to withdraw it. I am suing a  small business, I have a different perspective. I know the facts, let  me withdraw it.   The cost-shifting provision was eliminated by the courts because it  encouraged satellite litigation, and many cases required parallel  proceedings. Here is the worst of it: Suppose we were back in 1954.  Would Brown v. Board of Education be a frivolous lawsuit subject to  sanctions, a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court that  declared State laws establishing separate public schools for Black and  White students unconstitutional? What about Griswold in 1965? It would  also be judged as a frivolous lawsuit.    Mr. Chairman, Griswold was a landmark case in which  the Supreme Court ruled that we had a right to privacy. Or what about  the famous case that was made into a movie, Loving v. Virginia? I think  for almost 25 years this mixed-marriage couple could not live in their  own State. A lawsuit would have been considered frivolous. Loving was a  landmark case which decided Virginia's antimiscegenation statute was  unconstitutional.   New York Times Co. v. United States in 1971, the question was on the  constitutional freedom of the press. It reinforced the First Amendment.   Mr. Chairman, it is impossible to go back to the old days. I ask my  colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, to come up and to  oppose the underlying bill in the name of justice for all.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a list of seven notable cases  the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act may have barred from a courtroom.   seven notable cases the ``lawsuit abuse reduction act'' may have barred                              from a courtroom         Contrary to proponents' claims, LARA does not deter       frivolous lawsuits. Rather it deters meritorious cases by       imposing a one-size-fits-all mandate for federal judges.       Mandatory sanctions inevitably chill meritorious claims       particularly in cases of first impression or involving new       legal theories, including cases to protect civil rights, the       right to privacy, the environment, collective bargaining and       the First Amendment. Our system of justice is a moving body       of law, and novel legal theories have the ability to shift       public policy and law.        Below are seven notable cases that LARA may have prevented       because the cases presented what--at the time they were       presented to the court--would have been considered novel       legal theories:        Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954):       Brown was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme       Court that declared state laws establishing separate public       schools for black and white students unconstitutional. The       decision overturned the Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896       which allowed state-sponsored segregation. The Court's       unanimous decision stated that ``separate educational       facilities are inherently unequal.'' As a result, de jure       racial segregation was ruled a violation of the Equal       Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United       States Constitution. This ruling paved the way for       integration and the civil rights movement.        Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965): Griswold was       a landmark case in which the Supreme Court ruled that the       Constitution protected a right to privacy. The case involved       a Connecticut law that prohibited the use of contraceptives.       By a vote of 7-2, the Supreme Court invalidated the law on       the grounds that it violated the ``right to marital       privacy.''        Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003): In Lawrence, the       Supreme Court considered the issue of whether adult       consensual sexual activity is protected by the Fourteenth       Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law. The       Court found that the petitioners were free as adults to       engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their       liberty under the Due Process Clause. The decision       decriminalized the Texas law that made it illegal for two       persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual       conduct.        Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, 549 U.S.       497 (2007): In this case, twelve states and several cities of       the United States brought suit against the United States       Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to force the federal       agency to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases       as pollutants. The Supreme Court found that Massachusetts,       due to its ``stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign       interests'' as a state, had standing to sue the EPA over       potential damage caused to its territory by global warming.       The Court rejected the EPA's argument that the Clean Air Act       was not meant to refer to carbon emissions in the section       giving the EPA authority to regulate ``air pollution       agent[s].''        Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967): Loving was a       landmark civil rights case in which the United States Supreme       Court, by a 9-0 vote, declared Virginia's anti-miscegenation       statute, the ``Racial Integrity Act of 1924,''       unconstitutional, thereby ending all race-based legal       restrictions on marriage in the United States.        New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971):       This case considered whether the New York Times and       Washington Post newspapers could publish the then-classified       Pentagon Papers without risk of government censure. The       question before the Court was whether the constitutional       freedom of the press, guaranteed by the First Amendment, was       subordinate to a claimed need of the executive branch of       government to maintain the secrecy of information. The       Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected the       right of the New York Times to print the materials.        Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978)       (The Snail Darter Case): In TVA, the Supreme Court affirmed a       court of appeals' judgment, which agreed with the Secretary       of Interior that operation of the federal Tellico Dam would       eradicate an endangered species. The Court held that a prima       facie violation of Sec. 7 of the Endangered Species Act, 16       U.S.C. Sec. 1536, occurred, and ruled that an injunction       requested by respondents should have been issued.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 720, the ``Lawsuit  Abuse Reduction Act of 2017,'' because it is both unnecessary and  counterproductive.   I oppose this legislation that aims to restore a long-discredited  version of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, in effect from 1983 to  1993.   The current Rule 11 allows federal courts, in their discretion, to  impose sanctions for frivolous filings and it encourages litigants to  resolve such issues without court intervention.   As written, H.R. 720 would change the sanctions for a violation of  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11 to a cost-shifting sanction payable  to the opposing party, an antiquated version of the Rule in effect from  1983 until 1993.   Why, Mr. Chair would we return to the failed and discredited sanction  regime rightly abandoned in 1993?   H.R. 720 would require courts to impose monetary sanctions for any  Rule 11 violation, eliminating the safe harbor provision that currently  allows attorneys to correct or withdraw a filing before Rule 11  proceedings commence.   That cost-shifting provision was eliminated by the courts because it  encouraged satellite litigation; many cases required parallel  proceedings--one on the merits of the lawsuit and one on the Rule 11  motion.   The 1983 rule had a particularly negative disproportionate impact on  plaintiffs, especially plaintiffs in civil rights cases, because  plaintiffs in such cases often raise novel legal arguments, leaving  them vulnerable to a Rule 11 motion by a defendant.   Reinstating this mandatory fee shifting rule, as H.R. 720 does, will  again have a chilling effect on plaintiffs' claims, especially  individual plaintiffs taking on large corporate interests.   Sanctions were more often imposed against plaintiffs than defendants  and more often imposed against plaintiffs in certain kinds of cases,  primarily in civil rights and certain kinds of discrimination cases.   A leading study on this issue showed that although civil rights cases  made up 11.4% of federal cases filed, 22.7% of the cases in which  sanctions had been imposed were civil rights cases.   The imposition of mandatory fees and costs ultimately shifts the  purpose of the Rule from deterrence to compensation, encouraging  parties to always file Rule 11 motions in the hopes of gaining  additional compensation.   Both the Judicial Conference of the United States and the U.S.  Supreme Court support preservation of the current version of Rule 11(c)  and restoring the true balance between punishing unwarranted conduct  and deterring unnecessary litigation.   Given the highly problematic experience under the 1983 rule, which  sparked extensive and costly litigation, the rule burdened already  strained federal court system, adversely affecting cases of all types,  including civil litigation among businesses.   Congress should be looking for ways to decrease, not increase  wasteful burdens on  [[Page H2029]]  courts, and should avoid rule changes that have a discriminatory impact  on civil rights, employment, environmental, and consumer cases.   For these reasons and more, I oppose this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, let me again emphasize our mutual  commitment to justice and why I think the underlying bill skews justice  and tips the scale of justice on Lady Justice.   I again refer you to the sitting experts, and that is the Judicial  Conference of the United States, comprised of Federal judges all across  America. I can't help but recite this sentence that strikes me as one  as strong as possible to have been cited in a letter.   Their referral to LARA, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, in this one  sentence, recognizing the concern about frivolous lawsuits or filings,  they say:         But LARA creates a curse worse than the problem it is meant       to solve.    I think that that one sentence says it all. We are not here solving a  problem. We are here creating a problem.   I am particularly struck by the comments regarding small businesses.  My amendment improves H.R. 720 by preserving the current law and  practice of courts awarding attorneys' fees when justice requires.   As written, H.R. 720 would change the sanctions for violation of  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11 to a cost-shifting sanction,  payable to the opposing party, an antiquated version of the rule in  effect from 1983 until 1993. That cost-shifting provision was  eliminated by the courts because it encouraged satellite litigation.   The Jackson Lee amendment would preserve the sanctions currently  available under rule 11, which provide the correct balance in punishing  unwarranted conduct--this is under the present status of rule 11-- without encouraging unnecessary litigation.   Specifically, my amendment will strike a provision of the legislation  that mandates the award of reasonable attorney fees and costs. Instead,  it restores judicial discretion to award such fees and costs when  warranted.   Take small business A, who is mad at big bank XYZ. They mishandled my  account, and they filed a lawsuit. Unfortunately, the bookkeeper--not  accountant--bookkeeper that the small business used really made the  mistake, but the judge, recognizing the small business had good  intentions, would not have to mandatorily force them to be sanctioned  and to pay attorneys' fees but might then have discretion. That is how  you help small business A.   I ask my colleagues to support the reasonable Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee  Amendment to H.R. 720.   My amendment improves H.R. 720 by preserving the current law and  practice of courts awarding attorney fees when justice so requires.   As written, H.R. 720 would change the sanctions for a violation of  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 11 to a cost-shifting sanction  payable to the opposing party, an antiquated version of the Rule in  effect from 1983 until 1993.   That cost-shifting provision was eliminated by the courts because it  encouraged satellite litigation.   The Jackson Lee Amendment would preserve the sanctions currently  available under Rule 11, which provide the correct balance in punishing  unwarranted conduct, without encouraging unnecessary litigation.   Specifically, my amendment will strike a provision of the legislation  that mandates the award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and  instead restores judicial discretion to award such fees and costs when  warranted.   The Jackson Lee Amendment preserves the balance found in the current  version of Rule 11, which gives the court discretion to determine an  appropriate sanction.   H.R. 720 seeks a return to the failed and discredited sanction regime  rightly abandoned in 1993.   By eliminating the mandatory fee-shifting provision, the 1993 Rule  discouraged satellite litigation and encouraged parties to move forward  with the merits of the case.   Under the prior Rule 11, during the 1983-1993 time, mandatory fee- shifting was used to discourage plaintiffs from bringing meritorious  claims using novel legal theories in civil rights and employment rights  cases.   Reinstating this mandatory fee shifting rule, as H.R. 720 does, will  again have a chilling effect on plaintiffs claims, especially  individual plaintiffs taking on large corporate interests.   The Jackson Lee Amendment would preserve the current version of Rule  11(c) and restore the true balance between punishing unwarranted  conduct and deterring unnecessary litigation.   The old rule disproportionately affected plaintiffs, especially  plaintiffs in civil rights cases.   Sanctions were more often imposed against plaintiffs than defendants  and more often imposed against plaintiffs in certain kinds of cases,  primarily in civil rights and certain kinds of discrimination cases.   A leading study on this issue showed that although civil rights cases  made up 11.4% of federal cases filed, 22.7% of the cases in which  sanctions had been imposed were civil rights cases.   The imposition of mandatory fees and costs shifts the purpose of the  Rule from deterrence to compensation, encouraging parties to always  file Rule 11 motions in the hopes of gaining additional compensation.  [[Page H2032]]    For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  Jackson Lee Amendment.          Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the             Judicial Conference of the United States,                                    Washington, DC, April 13, 2015.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: We write to present the views of the       Judicial Conference Rules Committees on H.R. 758, the Lawsuit       Abuse Reduction Act of 2015.        As the current chairs of the Judicial Conference's       Committee on the Rules of Practice and Procedure (the       ``Standing Committee'') and the Advisory Committee on the       Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (the ``Advisory       Committee''), we oppose H.R. 758, which seeks to reduce       lawsuit abuse by amending Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of       Civil Procedure. The bill would reinstate a mandatory       sanctions provision of Rule 11 adopted in 1983 and removed as       counterproductive in 1993. The bill would also eliminate a       provision adopted in 1993 that allows a party to withdraw       challenged pleadings. Our concerns mirror the views expressed       by the Judicial Conference in 2004 and 2005, and by the       Standing Committee and Advisory Committee in 2011 and 2013,       in response to similar legislation, and reflect our ongoing       daily experience with the practical operation of the rules.        We share the desire of the sponsors of H.R. 758 to improve       the civil justice system in our federal courts, including the       desire to reduce frivolous filings. But legislation that       would restore the 1983 version of Rule 11 would create a cure       worse than the problem it is meant to solve. Such legislation       also contravenes the longstanding Judicial Conference policy       opposing direct amendment of the federal rules by legislation       rather than through the deliberative process Congress       established in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C.       Sec. Sec. 2071-2077.        A decade of experience with the 1983 mandatory sanctions       provision demonstrated that it failed to provide meaningful       relief from the litigation behavior it was meant to address,       and instead generated wasteful satellite litigation that had       little to do with the merits of cases. The 1983 version of       Rule 11 required sanctions for every violation of the rule,       and quickly became a tool of abuse. Aggressive filings of       Rule 11 sanctions motions required expenditure of tremendous       resources on Rule 11 battles having nothing to do with the       merits of the case and everything to do with strategic       gamesmanship. Many Rule 11 motions in turn triggered counter-      motions seeking Rule 11 sanctions as a penalty for filing of       the original Rule 11 motion.        The 1993 changes to Rule 11 followed years of examination       and were made on the Judicial Conference's strong       recommendation, with the Supreme Court's approval, and       effective only following a period of congressional review.       The 1993 amendments were designed to remedy the major       problems with the rule, strike a fair balance between       competing interests, and allow parties and courts to focus on       the merits of the underlying cases. Since 1993, the rule has       included a safe harbor, providing a party 21 days within       which to withdraw a particular claim or defense before       sanctions can be imposed. If the party fails to withdraw an       allegedly frivolous claim or defense within that time, a       court may impose sanctions, including assessing reasonable       attorney fees. Under the 1993 amendments, sanctioning of       discovery-related abuse remains available under Rules 26 and       37, which provide for sanctions that include awards of       reasonable attorney fees.        Minimizing frivolous filings is vital. The current rules       give judges tools to deal with frivolous pleadings, including       the imposition of sanctions where warranted. Rule 12(b)(6)       authorizes courts to dismiss pleadings that fail to state a       claim. Section 1927 of Title 28 of the United States Code       authorizes sanctions against lawyers for ``unreasonably and       vexatiously'' multiplying the proceedings in any case. Other       tools to address frivolous filings include 28 U.S.C.       Sec. 1915(e), which requires courts to dismiss cases brought       in forma pauperis that are frivolous, malicious, or fail to       state a claim, and 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1915A, which requires       courts to dismiss prisoner complaints against governmental       entities, officers, or employees that are frivolous,       malicious, or fail to state a claim.        Some may ask, why not give courts another tool to deter       frivolous filings by reinstating the 1983 version of Rule 11?       The answer is that the very process Congress established to       consider rule proposals exposed the 1983 version of Rule 11       as superficially appealing, but replete with unintended       consequences, chiefly an explosion of satellite litigation.       Congress designed the Rules Enabling Act process in 1934, and       reformed it in 1988, to produce the best rules possible       through broad public participation and review by the bench,       the bar, and the academy. The Enabling Act charges the       judiciary with the task of neutral, independent, and thorough       analysis of the rules and their operation. The Rules       Committees undertake extensive study of the rules, including       empirical research, so that they can propose rules that will       best serve the American justice system while avoiding       unintended consequences. Experience has shown that this       process works well. Direct amendment of Rule 11 will not only       circumvent the effective Rules Enabling Act process Congress       implemented, but as the careful study of Rule 11 undertaken       by the Rules Committees over many years demonstrates, direct       amendment of Rule 11 as envisioned by H.R. 758 would work       against the laudable purpose of improving the administration       of justice.        Before proposing the 1993 amendments, the Advisory       Committee reviewed several empirical studies of the 1983       version of Rule 11, including studies conducted by the       Federal Judicial Center in 1985 and 1988, a Third Circuit       Task Force report on Rule 11 in 1989, and a New York State       Bar Committee report in 1987. In 1990, the Advisory Committee       issued a call for general comments on the rule. The response       was substantial and clearly called for a change. The Advisory       Committee concluded that Rule 11's cost-shifting provision       created an incentive for too many unnecessary Rule 11       motions. Amendments to Rule 11 were drafted by the Advisory       Committee and approved by the Standing Committee and Judicial       Conference. The Supreme Court approved the amendments and       transmitted them to Congress in May 1993 after extensive       scrutiny and debate by the bench, bar, and public in       accordance with the Rules Enabling Act process.        The amended rule has produced a marked decline in Rule 11       satellite litigation without any noticeable increase in       frivolous filings. In June 1995, the Federal Judicial Center       conducted a survey of 1,130 lawyers and 148 judges on the       effects of the 1993 amendments. The Center found general       satisfaction with the amended rule, and that a majority of       the responding judges and lawyers did not favor a return to       mandatory sanctions when the rule is violated.        In 2005, the Federal Judicial Center surveyed federal trial       judges to get a clearer picture of how the revised Rule 11       was operating. A copy of the study is enclosed. The study       showed that judges on the front lines--those who must contend       with frivolous litigation and apply Rule II--strongly believe       that the current rule works well. The study's findings       include the following highlights:        More than 80 percent of the 278 district judges surveyed       indicated that ``Rule 11 is needed and it is just right as it       now stands'';        87 percent prefer the existing Rule 11 to the 1983 version       or the version proposed by legislation (e.g., H.R. 4571 (the       Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2004) or H.R. 420 (the Lawsuit       Abuse Reduction Act of 2005));        85 percent strongly or moderately support Rule 11's safe       harbor provisions;        91 percent oppose the proposed requirement that sanctions       be imposed for every Rule 11 violation;        84 percent disagree with the proposition that an award of       attorney fees should be mandatory for every Rule 11       violation;        85 percent believe that the amount of groundless civil       litigation has not grown since the promulgation of the 1993       rule (for judges commissioned before 1992) or since their       first year as a federal district judge (for judges       commissioned after January 1, 1992); and        72 percent believe that addressing sanctions for discovery       abuse in Rules 26(g) and 37 is better than in Rule 11.        The findings of the Federal Judicial Center underscore the       judiciary's united opposition to legislation amending Rule       11. Lawyers share this view. The American Bar Association has       opposed H.R. 758. Indeed, of the 200 lawyers, litigants,       judges, and academics who participated in the 2010 conference       at Duke University Law School convened by the Advisory       Committee to search for ways to address the problems of costs       and delay in civil litigation, nobody proposed a return to       the 1983 version of Rule 11.        Thank you for considering the views of the Standing       Committee and Advisory Committee. We look forward to       continuing to work with you to ensure that our civil justice       system fulfills its vital role. If you or your staff have any       questions, please contact Rebecca Womeldorf, Secretary to the       Standing Committee.            Sincerely,      Jeffrey S. Sutton,        United States Circuit Judge Sixth Circuit,Chair, Committee       on Rules of Practice and Procedure.      David G. Campbell,        United States District Judge District of Arizona, Chair,       Advisory Committee on Civil Rules.     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, reading again from the Judicial  Conference letter, it says: The facts do not support any assumption  that mandatory sanctions under H.R. 720--that is what the bill is  about--deter frivolous filings. All it does, after a decade of  experience, is that it demonstrates that it failed to provide  meaningful relief from the litigation behavior it was supposed to  address.   What it will do is it will punish the small business. By eliminating  the mandatory fee-shifting provision, the 1993 rule discouraged  satellite litigation. Reinstating this mandatory fee-shifting rule, as  H.R. 720 does, will again have a chilling effect.   The Jackson Lee amendment would give the courts discretion to protect  against the mom-and-pop business from having to pay because they  mistakenly thought big bank XYZ did them in, and it really was a  mistake on their part.   Sanctions are more often imposed against plaintiffs than defendants,  more often imposed against plaintiffs in certain kind of cases,  primarily civil rights and certain kinds of discrimination cases.   The Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka might have been perceived  to be outrageous--how dare you try to strike down the separate but  equal--and yet it has had an amazing impact and a case of moment in  history.   Or the Loving v. Virginia, when two individuals who loved each other  still were kept out of Virginia because they were of different races,  it was absurd to file that lawsuit at that time. Yet, if they had not,  or if these kinds of penalties were in place, they might be suffering  mandatory sanctions and kept out of the courthouse.   A leading study on this issue showed that, although civil rights  cases make up 11.4 percent, 22.7 percent of the cases in which  sanctions have been imposed are civil rights cases.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.  In order to foster justice, support the Jackson Lee amendment, which  restores to the courts judicial discretion on penalties and sanctions,  if you will, and listen to the Judicial Conference: this is a curse  worse than the problem.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I support Representative Conyers'  amendment.   I include in the Record in support of our amendment a Judicial  Conference letter dated April 13, 2015, and letters from a number of  organizations, including the Alliance for Justice and the American  Association for Justice.   I also include in the Record a letter from the American Bar  Association, who begins their message:   ``On behalf of the American Bar Association, ABA, and its over  400,000 members, I am writing to urge you to vote against H.R. 720, the  Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act . . . which is scheduled for a floor vote  this week.''       Re Groups Strongly Oppose Attacks on Civil Justice.       Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. John Conyers, Jr.,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: On       February 2, the House Committee on the Judiciary is scheduled       to mark up several bills that collectively would make it more       difficult for Americans to enforce their legal rights, and       would place unreasonable burdens on the federal judiciary and       federal enforcement officials. The undersigned organizations       strongly oppose these bills as harmful and unnecessary.               H.R. 720: THE LAWSUIT ABUSE REDUCTION ACT (LARA)         LARA would make major, substantive changes to Rule 11 of       the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, bypassing both the       Judicial Conference of the United States and the U.S. Supreme       Court in the process. Rule 11 provides judges with authority       to sanction attorneys for filing frivolous claims and       defenses. It provides judges with discretion to decide, on a       case-by-case basis, if sanctions are appropriate. LARA would       remove this judicial discretion, mandating sanctions. LARA       would reinstate a rule put into effect in 1983 that was so       unworkable it was rescinded in 1993 after many problems and       nearly universal criticism. Among those problems were: the       rule had a chilling effect on the filing of meritorious civil       rights, employment, environmental, and consumer cases; the       rule was overused in civil rights cases as sanctions were       sought and imposed against civil rights plaintiffs more than       against any other litigants in civil court; and the rule       burdened the already strained federal court system with       satellite litigation over compliance with the rule. These       burdens adversely affected cases of all types, including       business-to-business civil litigation. Congress should be       looking for ways to decrease, not increase, wasteful burdens       on the courts, and should avoid rules changes that have a       discriminatory impact on civil rights, employment,       environmental, and consumer cases.                 H.R. 725: THE INNOCENT PARTY PROTECTION ACT         This bill would upend long established law in the area of       federal court jurisdiction, specifically addressing the       supposed overuse of ``fraudulent joinder'' to defeat complete       diversity jurisdiction in a case. It was previously known as       the ``Fraudulent Joinder Prevention Act.'' However, this bill       is not about fraud. It is a corporate forum-shopping bill       that would allow corporations to move cases properly brought       in state courts into federal courts. Corporate defendants       support this bill because they prefer to litigate in federal       court, which usually results in less diverse jurors, more       expensive proceedings, longer wait times for trials, and       stricter limits on discovery. For plaintiffs, who are       supposed to be able to choose their forums, this legislation       would result in additional time, expense, and inconvenience       for the plaintiff and witnesses. Moreover, there is no       evidence that federal courts are not already properly       handling allegations of so-called ``fraudulent joinder''       after removal under current laws. The bill would result in       needless micromanagement of federal courts and a waste of       judicial resources. While it purports to fix a non-existent       problem, it creates problems itself.                  H.R. 732: STOP SETTLEMENT SLUSH FUNDS ACT         Under existing laws, settlement terms that result from       federal enforcement actions can sometimes include payments to       third parties to advance programs that assist with recovery,       benefits, and relief for communities harmed by lawbreakers,       to the extent such payments further the objectives of the       enforcement action. This bill would cut off any payments to       third parties other than individualized restitution and other       forms of direct payment for ``actual harm.'' That restriction       would handcuff federal enforcement officials by limiting       their ability to negotiate appropriate relief for real harms       caused to the public by illegal conduct that is the subject       of federal enforcement actions. This bill would be a gift to       lawbreakers at the expense of families and communities       suffering from injuries that cannot be addressed by direct       restitution.        We urge you to oppose each of these bills.

ABA Urges You To Oppose Passage of H.R. 720, the Lawsuit Abuse                               Reduction Act         Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Bar       Association (ABA) and its over 400,000 members, I am writing       to urge you to vote against H.R. 720, the Lawsuit Abuse       Reduction Act of 2015, which is scheduled for a floor vote       this week.        Even though this legislation may seem straightforward and       appealing on initial review, a thorough examination of the       concerns the bill is designed to address provides compelling       evidence that, rather than reducing frivolous lawsuits, H.R.       720 will encourage civil litigation abuse and increase court       costs and delays.        H.R. 720 seeks to amend Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of       Civil Procedure by rolling back critical improvements made to       the Rule in 1993. The legislation would reinstate a mandatory       sanction provision that was adopted in 1983 and eliminated a       decade later after experience revealed its unintended,       adverse consequences. It also would eliminate the ``safe       harbor'' provision, added in 1993, which has helped reduce       frivolous lawsuits by allowing parties to withdraw claims       within 21 days after a motion for sanctions is served.        The ABA urges you to oppose enactment of H.R. 720 for three       main reasons. First, the legislation was drafted in an       empirical and historical vacuum without the input of the       judicial branch. Second, there is no demonstrated evidence       that the existing Rule 11 is inadequate and needs to be       amended. And third, by ignoring the lessons learned from ten       years of experience under the 1983 mandatory version of Rule       11, Congress incurs the substantial risk that the proposed       changes will harm litigants by encouraging additional       litigation and increasing court costs and delays.    I. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL RULES SHOULD BE VETTED THROUGH THE RULES                            ENABLING ACT PROCESS         The Rules Enabling Act was established by Congress to       assure that amendment of the Federal Rules occurs only after       a comprehensive and balanced review of the problem and       proposed solution is undertaken by the Judicial Conference of       the United States, the policy-making arm of the federal       judiciary, in consultation with lawyers, scholars,       individuals, and organizations devoted to improving the       administration of justice. Prior to submission to Congress, a       proposed amendment undergoes extensive review and public       comment, a process that often takes over two years and offers       Members assurance the proposed amendment is necessary and       wise.        In stark contrast, H.R. 720 proposes to amend the Federal       Rules over the objections of the Judicial Conference and       despite compelling evidence that it will adversely affect the       administration of justice.   II. THERE IS NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT RULE 11 IS INADEQUATE AND NEEDS                               TO BE AMENDED         Proponents state that the legislation is needed to stem the       growth in frivolous lawsuits that, according to the written       statement of the National Federation of Independent Business,       has ``created a legal climate that hinders economic growth       and hurts job creation.''        There simply is no proof that problems created by frivolous       lawsuits have increased since 1993 or that the current Rule       11 is ineffective in deterring frivolous filings. In fact, it       is more likely that problems have abated since 1993 because       Rule 11's safe harbors provision provides an incentive to       withdraw frivolous filings at the outset of litigation.  [[Page H2035]]       In addition, according to Professor Danielle Kie Hart and       other researchers, after the current version of Rule 11 went       into effect, there was an increased incidence of sanctions'       being imposed under other sanction rules and laws, including       28 U.S.C. Sec. 1927, as well as pursuant to the court's       inherent power. Judges have numerous tools at their disposal       to impose sanctions and prevent frivolous lawsuits from going       forward.        III. THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT H.R. 758 WOULD IMPEDE THE    ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE BY ENCOURAGING ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND                     INCREASING COURT COSTS AND DELAYS         Most importantly, there is no evidence that the proposed       changes to Rule 11 would deter the filing of non-meritorious       lawsuits. In fact, as stated earlier, past experience       strongly suggests that the proposed changes would encourage       new litigation over sanction motions, thereby increasing, not       reducing, court costs and delays. This is a costly and       completely avoidable outcome.                                IV. CONCLUSION         The 1983 version of Rule 11 was ill-conceived and created       significant unintended adverse consequences that harmed       litigants and impeded the administration of justice. We urge       you to avoid making the same mistake and to oppose passage of       H.R. 720.

Sincerely,                                                  Thomas M. Susman.
