 Madam Speaker, I want to thank so much my esteemed  colleague Barbara Lee, who speaks for me tonight, and also Sheila  Jackson Lee. I thank them both so much for leading us in this  commemoration tonight of our shero Shirley Chisholm. I am also grateful  for the words that were spoken earlier by our leader, our shero of the  Congressional Black Caucus, Joyce Beatty.   Black History Month is a time for us to commemorate all of those who  came before us and to celebrate those who helped pave the path of  progress that we find ourselves on today.   Shirley Chisholm is truly one of those trailblazers. She was a woman  who lived her truth and told her story boldly time and time again. She  was a trailblazer ahead of her time who had a deep and lasting impact  on our communities, on our country, and, most specifically, on  communities of color.   It is not hard today to see that very impact. We now have a new  generation of leaders who are shaping the policy of this Nation's  future, who looked to the past and continue to look to leaders like  Shirley Chisholm to see all the  [[Page H1001]]  places we still need to go. Yes, we have a long way to go.   Young women around the world, and especially young women of color,  have been forever inspired by her example, with all the barriers that  she broke down. It can be easy to forget all that she did, all that she  helped to build.   Shirley was instrumental in strengthening voting rights; she was a  force in demanding women's rights; and she was a leader in the fight  for civil rights.   It was the way that she worked all those years ago that has shown  time and time again why we must continue these very same fights today.   In my home State of Georgia, we are at the forefront of the fight for  voting rights once again. We are, again, fighting against attempts at  the worst voter suppression we have seen since Jim Crow. At a time when  our voting rights are under attack, we must once again lead in the  efforts to protect these very sacred rights.                                time  2030    So, to all the women of color who have followed in Shirley's  footsteps, the work you do has never been more important. The times  have found us, and it is in these moments that we must continue to rise  to this occasion. We have been prepared for this moment, a moment that  beckons us to fight for equality and strive for justice, the equality  and the justice that every one of us deserves.   That preparation is because of leaders like Shirley Chisholm, and now  because the leaders of tomorrow grew up watching the leaders of  yesterday, we will continue to make indelible marks on the world.   Because of women like Shirley Chisholm, women of color have found  their own power to stand up and to speak out and to advocate for the  change that we know is possible, but more so the change that we know is  necessary.   So, as we continue to follow in the footsteps of the giants who came  before us, as we honor and celebrate the titans of the movement, I want  to thank each and every person who wakes up every day in this country  and does this work. Because this work is not easy, but changes only  ever come from those who have brought their lived experiences into  these Halls of power.   For all of you in this Chamber, for the brave Black women who have  carried this country forward, I want to say to each of you, I want to  say that the work that you are doing as women and as women of color has  never been more important. I want to thank you from the bottom of my  heart because I would not be here had it not been for you.   I want to say how proud I am of each of your accomplishments, of your  triumphs, and your successes, and I want you to remember that we are  all doing the best that we can and that each day God continues to give  us new grace.   As we move forward, we must be courageous in the fight for justice,  human rights, and a future that celebrates the diversity and the power  of who we are as a people.   We should all strive to extend the path that Shirley helped build for  us to follow. We should all strive to be like Shirley and be our best.    Thank you for sharing that.
