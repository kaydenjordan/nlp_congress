 Mr. President, as those who are following on C-SPAN have  probably noted, we are not overwhelmed with business on the floor of  the U.S. Senate, nor have we been during the course of this year.   We have considered several bills--you could count them on one hand-- including the Defense authorization bill, and, of course, the  momentous, historic legislation 2 weeks ago, the tax treaty with  Luxembourg, which had been pending before the U.S. Senate for 9 years.  It finally made it to the floor of the Senate. That was the highlight  of the week, as we have watched the U.S. Senate ignore some of the most  important issues of our time.   Let me tell you one that strikes at the heart of our democracy, which  we should be focused on today and until it is resolved. Last week,  former FBI Director and Special Counsel Bob Mueller testified before  the House Judiciary Committee about his report on Russian interference  in the 2016 election. The hearing clarified several important things.  For example, President Trump loves to claim that the Mueller report  completely exonerated him. Trump's tweets, one after another, talk  about how he was exonerated by that report. Director Mueller made clear  that is ``not what the report said.''   When asked by the House Judiciary chairman ``Did you actually totally  exonerate the President?'' Director Mueller answered ``no.''   President Trump likes to say the Mueller investigation was a witch  hunt. He has said that about 1,000 times. But the investigation  actually led to 37 indictments and over $42 million in assets forfeited  to the government. If this were a witch hunt, it certainly found a lot  of wealthy witches.   Some Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee tried to  attack Director Mueller's credibility, but Mueller has a lifetime  record of being a straight shooter, by-the-book investigator, and  prosecutor. He did this country a service when he took on the role of  special counsel.   One thing Director Mueller tried to remind the American people of is  the reason the investigation was necessary. He said:         Over the course of my career, I have seen a number of       challenges to our democracy. The Russian government's effort       to interfere in our election is among the most serious.    Mueller went on to say: ``This deserves the attention of every  American.''   One of the most important takeaways from the Mueller report is that  Russia did successfully attack our democracy in 2016. Page 1 of the  Mueller report says: ``The Russian Government interfered in the 2016  presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.''   The report detailed numerous examples, including an ``intelligence- gathering mission'' that employees of the Internet Research Agency,  known as the IRA, took in June of 2014.   The IRA was the Russian troll farm that waged information warfare  against the 2016 election by using stolen identities, fake social media  accounts, and fake campaign events.   The Mueller report and the earlier indictment of several IRA  employees noted that two of the Russians arrived in the United States  for a 3-week trip ``for the purpose of collecting intelligence to  inform the [IRA's] operations.''   The report also detailed the Russians' attack on my own home State  board of elections. In July 2016, the Illinois State board of elections  discovered that it was the target of a malicious, month-long cyber  attack that enabled the intruder to access confidential voter  information and view the registration data of approximately 76,000  voters in my State of Illinois.   These efforts to influence the election and attack campaign  organizations and State and local election administrators and vendors  continue to this day. What are we going to do about it?   What has been the response so far of the U.S. Senate, the body sworn  to uphold the Constitution and to protect against enemies, foreign and  domestic? Nothing. We are too busy with the trade treaty with  Luxembourg to deal with Russian interference in our elections. In the  face of Russia's threat to our elections, this Senate has been quiet as  a graveyard.   Let's start in 2016. Top officials from the administration's national  security and intelligence community came and warned congressional  leadership of Russia's ongoing attack on our elections, rightly asking  for a bipartisan statement to tell Russian dictator Putin to stop. What  was Senate Majority Leader McConnell's response to this obvious request  to protect our Nation? He said: No thanks. I am not going to do it.   History will no doubt look back in infamy at that decision.   What about the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a historically  recognized body with key jurisdiction over Russian attacks on the  United States? That committee did not even conduct an investigation  into Russia's actions in the last Congress.  [[Page S5213]]    Republicans were silent when Trump repeatedly accepted Russian  dictator Vladimir Putin's brazen denials over American intelligence  experts and all of the evidence to the contrary.   They were silent again after the Mueller report's devastating  findings of Russian interference. And they were silent when President  Trump subsequently said he would gladly accept election help from a  foreign power again.   Now look at the current Congress. Several bipartisan bills have been  introduced to respond to this Russian threat, including the Election  Security Act. This is a critical, comprehensive bill that would provide  States with much needed resources and establish a robust Federal effort  to protect our democracy.   Unfortunately, Republican Senate Leader McConnell is blocking all  efforts to bring this important legislation to the floor for a debate  and vote. This legislation could thwart Russian interference in the  2020 election. Senator McConnell refuses to bring it to the floor.   I end with the questions I have asked before here on the floor: How  can the party of Ronald Reagan continue to sit by while this President  pursues policies aligned with the former KGB agent, Vladimir Putin? Why  didn't the first bills in this new Senate under Republican control deal  with this threat to the election process in our democracy? Why isn't  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee holding urgent hearings on these  stunning dalliances between an American President and a Russian  dictator? Why isn't the Senate Foreign Relations Committee moving  bipartisan legislation that would protect U.S. membership in NATO?   Quite frankly, we barely do anything in this legislative graveyard of  the Senate under Republican control. You would think we would at least  focus, on a bipartisan basis, on making certain that the outcome of the  next election is not influenced by a foreign power, whether it is  Russia or some other malicious force in the world today.   But because it bruises the President's ego and it may invoke a nasty  tweet, the Republican-controlled Senate prefers to do nothing. It is  time for the Republican majority to stop protecting President Trump at  all costs.   There reaches a point when the Senate Republican leadership needs to  put the country before fear of the President's tweets.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker), the Senator from Delaware  (Mr. Coons), the Senator from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand), the Senator  from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms.  Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator  from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren).
