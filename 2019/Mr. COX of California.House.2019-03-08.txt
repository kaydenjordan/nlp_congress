 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  the McFarland High School girls basketball team. Undefeated in regular  season Division IV play, our girls were moved up to Division III for  State. Undaunted, the team's motto is ``relentless,'' and that is what  they have been.   On Tuesday night, our girls brought home the school's first Southern  California Regional Championship. They are a textbook example of what  can be accomplished through hard work, practice, and teamwork.   Led by coaches Johnny Samaniego and Gino Barajas, the girls: Lucia  Barajas, Heiry Bojorquez, Neli Diaz, Angelica Gonzalez, Emily Gonzalez,  Julie Hernandez, Adilene Lopez, Shania Perry, Lucia Rocha, Kathy  Rodriguez, and Pilar Samaniego are now playing Oakland High School,  represented by my friend and colleague, Barbara Lee, in tonight's State  Championship game.   I ask my colleagues to join me in sending them the best of luck. We  are so proud of our girls and their families.   Go Cougars.                            ____________________
