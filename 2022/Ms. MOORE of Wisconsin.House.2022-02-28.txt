 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding, and I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  who have worked  [[Page H1155]]  tirelessly to get the supermajority necessary to consider S. 321 to  award a Congressional Gold Medal to the Women's Army Corps 6888th  Central Postal Directory Battalion.   Let me just say that I am so pleased to be a sponsor of this bill,  particularly as we end Black History Month, honoring these women, and  as we begin Women's History Month. The intersection of those two things  is certainly a very appropriate time to mention the Six Triple Eight.   You have heard about the heroic efforts of this only-Black-female  battalion in history that served in World War II who are being honored  here today. They are being honored because their heroic efforts enabled  them, as a central battalion for the delivery of mail, to give people  that little measure of a piece of home when they were away.   I just have to ask my colleagues: When there are 7,500 Robert Smiths  who weren't able to get their mail during World War II, who did they  call? The Six Triple Eight, Black women.   When they were coming under fire and there were 17-and-a-half million  pieces of mail that were backlogged and couldn't be sent to these  soldiers, who they did call? Oh, yeah, the Six Triple Eight.   When mothers were worried that their sons and wives were worried that  their husbands had lost connection, who kept that connection going? The  Six Triple Eight.   Their motto was ``no mail, low morale.'' They weren't just sorting  mail. They were, in the words of Judi Glaeser printed in the Niagara  Gazette on May 21, 2021:         Their work was more than sorting mail. It was ministering       to the souls of soldiers, making sure they received that       piece of home that reminded them that they were not       forgotten.    Today, we are not forgetting them.   I say, in the name of my constituent, who is still alive and will be  enjoying her 98th birthday on March 5, Anna Mae Robertson, I  congratulate her on this gold medal.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to enter into the  Record the names of First Lieutenant Fannie Griffin McClendon of  Arizona; Corporal Lena Derriecott Bell King of Las Vegas, Nevada;  Private Catherine Romay Davis of Alabama; Private Hilda Griggs of New  Jersey; and Private Crensencia Garcia of the Bronx, New York, who are  still alive.   And to the son of their leader, Major Charity Adams, I thank the  Major for leading the Six Triple Eight to this great victory today.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Bonnie Watson Coleman  for her stewardship over this bill. I also want to thank Ayanna  Pressley, Ilhan Omar, and so many women who rose up to support this,  not only this session but last session as well. I want to thank State  representative LaKeshia Myers in my State in the city of Milwaukee for  the ordinances and the bills that they have passed, which are similar  to the CROWN Act.   Mr. Speaker, just let me say, with my short 2 minutes here, that my  being instilled with low self-esteem started before I got to  kindergarten, and it all revolved around my nappy hair and the way it  just coiled. Two minutes is not long enough to carry you on this  journey of what it is like to have your employers tell you that you are  making them look bad because of the way your hair looks, and having hot  combs, lye, chemicals, and being burned so that you can look White.   When I ran for this office in 2005 because I had so many pictures  with my hair coifed in a European style, my handlers wouldn't let me  change it. After 20 hours a day of campaigning every day, I had to  figure out how to straighten my hair out. Thank God for the CROWN Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank God for being able to stand here under the e  pluribus unum as my authentic, nappy-headed self.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 2142, to honor Ms. Indiana Hunt-Martin, a member of the Women's  Army Corps (WAC) groundbreaking 6888 Central Postal Directory Battalion  (Six Triple Eight), the only all-black WAC battalion deployed overseas  during WWII.   As a cosponsor of this bill and the author of the House measure to  award a Congressional Gold Medal to all the women of the Six Triple  Eight that the Congress will soon enact, Ms. Hunt-Martin's story is the  story of most of the women who served in the 6888.   According to her daughter, ``she was born in a time and place where  share cropping, lynching, and hatred of people, especially males of  color were everyday occurrences.''   Yet, she was not deterred from serving her country. Born in Georgia,  she moved to New York in the 1920's when she was still a young child.  After graduating high school, she read about an effort by First Lady  Eleanor Roosevelt and Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, the founding president  of the National Council of Negro Women, to ensure that women of color  could join the war effort as part of the WAC.   So she applied. And waited. And after, her application was apparently  ``lost'', she did not give up. She applied again, was accepted, and  enlisted.   She was subsequently chosen to serve in the Six Triple Eight. And  served honorably with that groundbreaking unit.   After her military service, she worked for the New York State  Department of Labor, retiring after some 40 years of service. In 2014,  in a story that is very familiar to me, she reached out to her local  congressman, Mr. Higgins, for help getting the medals she had earned  through her service so many decades earlier. This story is familiar to  me because my own constituent, Ms. Anna Mae Robertson, who also served  with the Six Triple Eight, similarly reached out to my office around  the same time to help her get the service medals she had earned.   This evening, I will have the honor of hosting Ms. Hunt-Martin's  daughter in my office as we celebrate the passage of this bill and my  Six Triple Eight Gold Medal bill (H.R. 1012/S. 321). While Ms. Hunt- Martin and the vast majority of the women who served with the 6888 may  no longer be with us, today we make sure that their service and  sacrifice is not forgotten.   As noted by Debbera Ranson, the commander and founder of the Johnetta  R. Coles AmVets post in Buffalo, NY, ``There are so many times when  African American soldiers have done wonderful things but it takes  forever for them to get recognized. Many times, the honors that they  eventually received--if they even do--is way after they have passed.  And so, as we do these different honors, at least family members will  be able to enjoy knowing that their loved ones have been honored.''
