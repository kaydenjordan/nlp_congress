 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life  of my friend, Barbara Yaroslavsky, who died on December 26, 2018, at  the age of 71.   Barbara dedicated her life to public service, activism, and  supporting her community in as many ways as she could find.   Born in Los Angeles on August 9, 1947, Barbara was raised with the  belief that community involvement was the key to making a difference in  the lives of those around her. She took a special interest in education  and healthcare issues, championing the welfare of children and  families.   She also actively participated in the Jewish community, sitting on  several boards at the Jewish Federation of Greater L.A., and ensuring  the Jewish community's voice was heard in government and policymaking.   Additionally, Barbara volunteered with many nonprofit organizations.  She served on the L.A. Commission on Community and Family Services, the  California Board of Registered Nursing, the Advisory Board for L.A.'s  Best, and Friends of the Saban Community Clinic. She was also a past  chair and member of the California Medical Board.   Barbara and her future husband, Zev Yaroslavsky, met while he was a  hall monitor at the L.A. Hebrew High School, and she was at the front  desk of the American Jewish University. They married in 1971, 4 years  before Zev was elected to the L.A. City Council. Zev then vacated it to  run for the L.A. County Board of Supervisors, where he served for many  years.   Barbara is survived by her husband, Zev, two children, David and  Mina, and four grandchildren.   I hope that Barbara's family takes comfort in knowing that her memory  will live on in the lives of people she helped throughout her life.                            ____________________
