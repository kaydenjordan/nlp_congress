 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the full  committee, Mr. Scott, for continuing to find ways to collaborate with  his members and others to ensure that we respond to the crux of  opportunity in America, and that is education.   I am so grateful to be able to stand and support S. 1098 and to take  this brief moment to thank my fellow alum,   David Price, for being  persistent in this legislation and serving the American people over the  years that he has done. I had a chance to get a second bite of the  apple. David was here and then came back. I have enjoyed every moment  of his commitment to opportunities for Americans over the years,  including housing and transportation and homeland security, and I  certainly want to say to him that the American people are better for  his service to this Nation. I thank him so very much.   I am grateful to finally be able to say, Chairman Scott, to a  constituent who I saw over the weekend that called the number of the  bill--most times, constituents don't know bill numbers. They said: ``I  need you to support S. 1098.'' Obviously, this is something so many of  us have been looking to because we have heard this from our  constituents.   I am very grateful that this legislation now allows a married couple  who has previously consolidated their Federal student loans, because we  were allowed to do that--many people thought that was a good thing to  do, to submit a joint application to the Department of Education to  sever their loan, allowing each former spouse their proportional  responsibility. Each former spouse would still be obligated for a share  of the loan, but their share of responsibility would be benchmarked to  the proportion of the debt that they brought into the consolidated  loan. Without loan severance, if a spouse refused to pay their share,  the other spouse remains responsible for full payment.    This is important legislation as it relates to divorce and domestic  violence or economic abuse. Bearing the risk of the full responsibility  for a consolidated loan after divorce can dramatically restrain a  spouse from moving on with their life, from supporting their children,  from getting a house, from feeling safe.  [[Page H7997]]    The Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act also addresses the  especially volatile situation of former relationships in which an  individual was subjected to domestic or, as I said, economic abuse.   As a sponsor of the Violence Against Women Act that became law in  March of last year, I am especially concerned about women who have  experienced physical, mental, sexual, emotional, even psychological  abuse at the hands of a spouse or partner. S. 1098 allows them to  separate from toxic relationships, get away from the economic abuse,  and retain or maintain their credit so that they can go forward. This  can also apply to a male who may be suffering from the same situation.   Two married borrowers of Federal student loans could combine their  debt into a single loan, but we can also come back now to ensure that  they can separate it. This is an important step forward.    Mr. Speaker, we enthusiastically add this to the  component of making sure, under the Violence Against Women Act, that  there is an expanded understanding of what happens when one spouse  abuses another or the idea of economic abuse.                                time  1500    Just as an example, when one spouse is not being timely, is not being  responsive, for whatever reason is not able to be found, then the  credit of the remaining spouse being dutiful is completely, if I might  use the term, mutilated.   I am eager to ensure that this bill is passed. I certainly  acknowledge the Senator from the State of Texas, Senator Cornyn. We  have worked together on other matters.   I will let everybody know this bill is bipartisan, and I will let  everyone know that what we will be doing is ensuring that people can  restore their lives. They can stand up again and be able to pay their  debt.   As I finish, I am stunned by people who don't want to see us move  forward for people to pay their debt. They can pay their debt. Let us  all support S. 1098.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1098, the Joint Consolidation  Loan Separation Act allowing a jointly-held loan debt to be separated.   This legislation would allow a married couple, who had previously  consolidation their federal student loan debts, to submit a joint  application to the Department of Education to sever their loan,  allotting to each former spouse their proportional responsibility.   While each former spouse would still be obligated for a share of the  loan, their share of responsibility would be benchmarked to the  proportion of debt that they brought into the consolidated loan.  Without loan severance, if a spouse refuses to pay their share of the  loan, the other spouse remains responsible for full payment.   This is very important legislation because it is a key to  independence following a divorce. Without being able to sever their  loan obligation after divorce, people are forced to continue  interacting with their former spouse.   Bearing the risk of full responsibility for a consolidated loan after  divorce can dramatically restrain a spouse from moving on with their  life, both financially and emotionally, as they are forced to maintain  communication with someone from whom they no longer want to be closely  associated.   The Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act also addresses the  especially volatile situation of former relationships in which an  individual was subjected to domestic or economic abuse from the other  individual.   As the sponsor of the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act  that became law in March of this year, I am especially concerned about  women who have experienced physical, mental, sexual, emotional, or  psychological abuse at the hands of a spouse or partner.   Thus, it is especially important that S. 1098 make it easy for women  who have suffered from abuse to sever their loans, to help them sever  their toxic relationships.   Indeed, S. 1098 allows one borrower to submit a separate application  in the event that the individual has experienced domestic or economic  abuse from the other individual borrower or is unable to reasonably  access the loan information of the other borrower.   In the case of this occurring, the other non-applying individual  borrower shall become solely liable for the remaining balance of the  joint consolidation loan.   Joint consolidation loans were first created for the good of  Americans to combat growing default rates.   Two married borrowers of federal student loans could combine their  debt into a single loan.   While the legislation was intended to proactively accommodate these  life situations, joint consolidation forms came with no guidance from  the Department of Education for cases of domestic or economic abuse.   A divorce decree could not remove one spouse from the debt, nor could  have any other agreement as both people were now legally responsible  for the combined debt.   If an ex-spouse refused to pay their share of the monthly payment,  the other spouse would have to make the entire payment themselves.   If a former couple wanted to make their student loan payments under a  payment plan, both spouses would need to pay the loan under the same  plan and provide their financial information.   If one of them failed to do so, they would both be denied access to  the payment plan.   Because of all these loopholes, Congress eliminated access to joint  consolidation loan applications in 2006.   However, it did not provide a way to separate responsibility for  existing loans, even in cases of domestic violence, economic abuse, or  an unresponsive partner.   With the Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act, we can now provide  a way out for those facing domestic violence or economic abuse, as  victims in this position face challenges beyond their own control.   As reported by the CDC, about 1 in 4 women and nearly 1 in 10 men  have experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner  during their lifetime.   According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence,  between 94 and 99 percent of domestic violence survivors have also  experienced economic abuse, which includes coerced debt and withholding  access to money.   There are currently 776 borrowers with spousal consolidation loans,  according to the Student Borrower Protection Center.   It is our responsibility to do right for these borrowers who fell  victim to the consequences of previous legislation.   As the sponsor of H.R. 1620, the Violence Against Women Act  Reauthorization Act, I proudly support S. 1098's efforts to provide  options for victims of violence, especially for women who are at a  significantly higher risk.
