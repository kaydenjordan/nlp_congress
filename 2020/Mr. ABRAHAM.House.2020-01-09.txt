Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member McCaul, for giving me  additional time to finish the list that I started earlier.   These are 44 young Americans from Louisiana who died by IEDs in the  most active part of Iraq when Soleimani and his proxies were engaged.  They designed, they built, and they implemented these IEDs; and in  Louisiana alone, 44 young Americans gave their lives for the United  States of America.   President Trump, he had the authority, he has the right, and,  thankfully, he had the courage to terminate Soleimani and remove this  cancer from this Earth.   Mr. Speaker, to my Democratic colleagues and friends, I say, if you  can look these Gold Star families in the face and tell them that this  was not a justified strike and that Soleimani needed to be removed from  this Earth, then God have mercy on you.
