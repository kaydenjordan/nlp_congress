 Mr. Speaker, this so-called health bill is actually just  mostly targeted for tax cuts for the wealthiest among us.   Let's look at it this way: a millionaire will get a $30,000-a-year  tax cut. A 64-year-old senior who earns $30,000 a year--that is all he  earns, just the tax cut the millionaire gets--they will see their  premium go from $1,700 a year, to $15,000 a year. That is half their  income.   They are going to have a choice: give up their house so they can buy  health insurance or don't buy health insurance, pray you don't have a  health emergency, and go bankrupt or die. Those are great choices.   This says a lot about the values of the Republican leadership and  their obsession. Instead of fixing the problems with the Affordable  Care Act, they want to kill it. It says a lot about their values. They  are pathetic.
