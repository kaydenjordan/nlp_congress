 Mr. Speaker, I am the Congressman who represents the great  city of Memphis.   Right now much of the national media is looking at Memphis, as there  was an awful killing of a 29-year-old African-American man by five  police officers within the last few weeks. The five police officers  have been fired by the police department for violating their oath. The  DA will announce charges in a few hours.   It could be a situation where people want to exercise their First  Amendment rights to protest the actions of the police department, and  people should, but they should be peaceful and calm.   We have a new DA, we have a new U.S. Attorney, and we have a new  police director. They are the right people at the right time to bring  about reform and to deal with this case to see that justice is  rendered.   I grieve for the life of Tyre Nichols whose life should not have been  extinguished. He was an outstanding young man, and it is extremely sad  that he was killed.   I pray for my city.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would prevent any new oil and gas  production under the proposed plan if those activities will have a  negative effect on the air quality.   I am a strong proponent of efforts to lower energy costs, promote  energy independence, and create a stronger, more secure economy.  [[Page H384]]    I recognize this will take a multifaceted approach, but it must  include more investment in renewable energy sources and a smart  transition away from oil and gas.   The fact is, for the past couple of decades the Federal Government  has issued far more drilling permits than oil and gas companies have  acted upon.   Nearly 80 percent of offshore oil is in areas that are already open  for exploration, according to the National Resources Defense Council.   Oil and gas drilling is a dirty business, and we should think long  and hard before we invite more of it on our Federal lands.   Drilling releases several pollutants that are making our air more  smoggy and more dirty and harmful to breathe.   The toxic particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, ozone,  and volatile organic compounds released by oil and gas drilling can  lead to many poor health outcomes, including premature births, asthma,  and heart disease.   It is often low-income and minority communities that bear the brunt  of these awful effects. We should continue the work of the Inflation  Reduction Act and create a new clean energy economy and not move  backward with an empty political gesture that will ultimately do little  to address oil and gas prices and our energy security and independence.   I might note that Exxon did a study in the early 1970s on these  issues, and their scientists found that what has occurred with fossil  fuels and the effect on our climate and our air was accurately  predicted 50 years ago, but they didn't release it.   It has been found that what they predicted was almost exact, 50 years  ago, on what this would do to our world climate, but they didn't  release it.   We must protect our environment and the health of our current and  future generations from the toxic effects of fossil fuel production.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
