 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I come to this conversation based on people I know who  live in manufactured housing. A lot of folks call it mobile homes or  trailer parks. We call it manufactured housing. But I have walked those  places, sat in those rooms, and just been with my neighbors, friends,  and constituents who live in manufactured housing. I appreciate them  tremendously. They are wonderful folks. The folks I know are just part  of those 17 million people who live in manufactured housing.   If Congress got rid of manufactured housing, the national  homeownership rate would fall about 6 percent. So manufactured housing,  no doubt, is important and is an affordable alternative for many  people.   But that doesn't mean the lender can rip them off. That doesn't mean  the lender can pick their pockets, and that doesn't mean that the  lender can let some big monopoly reach in the borrower's pockets and  take their money away from them.   Just because the loan payment on manufactured housing might be lower  than rent doesn't mean they get to up the skim. They have still got to  be fair to people.   Look, for folks who are watching this debate, it is important to  understand what we are really talking about. I am going to boil it down  as best I can. We are saying: If you live in manufactured housing and  if the loan is going to be extra high in the interest rate, if the  interest rate is 6\1/2\ or 8\1/2\ above the annual percentage rate,  which could bring you as high as the ranking member said, 18 percent,  then certain things kick in for you.   If they are going to charge borrowers that kind of interest rate, the  law says we are going to look out for them by saying that the lender  has to explain the consequences of default--it will ruin the borrower's  credit--that the lender has to disclose the loan terms in the monthly  payments, that the lender has to ensure that the borrower receives  homeownership counseling. And this is really important: under another  regulation, the lender is forbidden from being the dealer and steering  that person to a lender. In the case of Clayton Homes, they are both.    They will sell the borrower the unit and give them the loan. They  will say: Hey, do you know what? We are going to sell you a nice new  unit here. Don't worry about borrowing or where to look for a loan. We  got you covered. We are in that business.   They are a monopoly. What is happening here, Mr. Speaker, is that all  those protections that a high-cost-loan borrower is about to face this  legislation takes away. That is all we are talking about here. We are  saying that if a borrower is going to get a high-cost loan, then he  should get certain protections. The borrower should get information and  counseling. People should tell the borrower what is going to happen if  he defaults.   They are saying: Hey, man, that is getting in the way of my money. We  don't want you telling them what their rights are because that is  interfering with the millions and millions that we are going to get off  of them. A dumb consumer works out for our monopoly just fine, a smart  one not so much.   That is what this is all about.   Now, I want to just say--giving my friends on the other side of the  aisle the best of intentions--that we do have a philosophical debate  here. We believe that the problem--if there is one--of people lending  in this market is not that there are consumer protections, but it is  that there is a huge monopoly.   If the Congress wants to fix the problem of manufactured housing  lending, then break up that monopoly. If the Congress wants to get more  entrants into the market and get some downward competition in price,  then break up the monopoly.                                time  0945    But if the Congress just tells the monopoly you can charge these  people more now, you don't have to give them the protections, you don't  have to inform them, you can steer them, and you have got to get a  really high-cost loan before they get any protections, then all that is  going to do is benefit the firm that is already occupying this market  space.   The firm that already sells the unit and gives the loans, the one  that has all the advertising set up, the one that has all the sales  force set up, the one that has all the infrastructure already set up,  the monopolists will be the ones who will benefit from this  legislation.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.  [[Page H9579]]        Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman  from Minnesota an additional 30 seconds.    The theory of this legislation is that consumer  protection is why you have seen some entrants, some lenders, not be in  this space. Our knowledge and our facts indicate that it is because we  have got a big, giant monster that controls the whole market.   If Congress wants to do something for manufactured housing residents,  we can do it, we can do it now, and we urge Members to vote ``no'' on  this piece of legislation.
