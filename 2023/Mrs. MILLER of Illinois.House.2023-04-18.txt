 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and to submit extraneous material into the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for  joining me tonight in this Special Order. I am honored to join together  to celebrate April as Faith Month, and I am calling on people of faith  to join in prayer and in celebration.   As a Member of Congress, I am happy to reaffirm my commitment to the  Judeo-Christian values and the freedom of religion on which our country  was founded.   In Congress, my colleagues and I will always fight to protect the  right of all Americans to exercise their faith and maintain the freedom  of religion. People of faith seek to be a positive force in their  communities, especially in difficult circumstances.   Religious organizations in America have a rich history of charitable  engagement in helping the poor, the sick, and the afflicted, and they  should be appreciated.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman (Mrs. Harshbarger), my friend  and colleague from Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman  Harshbarger for speaking. It has been a privilege to join with her  weekly and with other members to pray for our country.   Our Nation is in crisis because our society has turned away from God  and has embraced a culture that now tells children that life has no  value. This year, I launched the Congressional Family Caucus because I  believe we have a moral obligation as servant representatives to save  our American values and to defend the natural family as ordained by  God, a husband and a wife committed to each other for life with their  children.   We need to defend the natural family from attempts by the radical  left to erode this core foundation of our society. In Deuteronomy 6, in  the context of the traditional family, in the home, we are to  diligently instruct our children to love God and to obey His  commandments.   During Faith Month, I would like to recognize that a happy family is  a blessing from God and is foundational to human flourishing. I will  always proudly stand up for faith and for our families in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I agree with Congressman Clyde  that we do need to defend these core principles and our freedom to  exercise our faith.   This year during Faith Month, we celebrate and thank God for the  historic victory of the end of Roe v. Wade. The end of Roe is the  beginning of a new chapter where we can now embrace a culture of life  with reverence for all of God's children. I applaud the Justices who  stood bravely up to the radical abortion industry and defended life. I  also applaud President Trump who gave the American people a Court that  delivered a pro-life win for our Nation.   The Bible tells us in Psalm 139 that we are fearfully and wonderfully  created by God, knitted together in our mother's womb. This verse  reminds us that every human life is created by God and has inherent  worth and dignity at every stage of development.   What a shame that today we are teaching our children that they are  the result of cosmic dust and are here without purpose instead of  intricately woven and designed and purposed by God.   Defending life has been one of the most meaningful fights that I have  contributed to during my time in Congress. I have had the opportunity  to stand with pro-life colleagues from across the country by supporting  the Life at Conception Act, the No Taxpayer Funding For Abortion Act,  and cosponsoring the Protecting Life on College Campus Act.   During Faith Month, I would like to recognize the incredible strides  we have made for the pro-life movement over recent years. I will always  defend the lives of the unborn.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Allen for  his words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Fulcher).    May I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  words and his testimony.   To conclude, during Faith Month I hope that you will join me in  praying for our Nation. Clearly, there has been an attack on our First  Amendment right to exercise our freedom of religion and our faith  beliefs.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say that if you took instinct out of a  beehive, you would have chaos. When you take God out of a society, you  have chaos also.   I will never be afraid to speak up in defense of our faith, our  freedom, and for our children. We need to protect the American way of  life. We have been criticized by radical leftists, and they are trying  to remake America into a Communist, atheist experiment. Our Founders  were men of faith, and there are many of us here in Congress that are  men and women of faith also.   We pray for our country. I encourage everybody to continue to pray  for our great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.
