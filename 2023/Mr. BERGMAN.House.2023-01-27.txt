 Mr. Chair, I am recorded as voting ``nay'' on rollcall  No. 64, an amendment offered by Mr. Schneider that would prohibit the  leasing plan from including the Great Lakes. I misrecorded this vote. I  duly intended to vote ``aye'' on rollcall No. 64.                  Amendment No. 59 Offered by Mr. Magaziner     Mr. Chair, please accept this personal explanation as I  was unexpectedly detained during vote proceedings. Had I been present,  I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 65.                  Amendment No. 58 Offered by Mr. Magaziner     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for taking leadership  on this; and I have to just correct one thing for the Record. I was  born in Minnesota, but now I represent Michigan; and that is okay. I  have roots in both because I was raised by a Minnesota farm girl, and  now I am married to an Iowa farm girl. So now if we can get Iowa in  there at some point, we will be in good shape. I will be happy at home.   When I just referenced my mom and my wife, my dad was in World War  II. My father-in-law was in World War II. When we think about the  sacrifices everyone in our country made, it was really the families  that sacrificed on the front end to ensure that their loved ones,  servicemembers deployed around the world to end the tyranny of World  War II, that the family members at home sacrificed to ensure their  servicemembers could fight the fight.   I think, today, it is true, and still is true, that when you talk  about TRICARE and all the services that it provides, it is not about  the servicemember, it is about the servicemember and their family  because without the comfort of knowing that the family is being taken  care of by the TRICARE system; that it is a system that does not  institute change for the wrong reasons.    What we are hearing today, this is change for profit's sake, and that  is the wrong reason.   So when you think about, what is readiness? Our troops have to be  trained and ready to deploy at a moment's notice to protect our  national security. That readiness includes family readiness.   Family readiness includes the availability of TRICARE, the  availability of prescriptions, especially in my district, in the Upper  Peninsula of Michigan, and northern and lower Michigan, where we have a  lot of rural and remote families that can't get to the pharmacy every  day; that cannot--whether it is snowstorm, whether it is age, whatever  it is, we need to ensure that our TRICARE system is robust, it is  complete, it is fair pricing to make sure that, in the end, everybody  wins, not just a couple.   We have got roughly--the Department of Defense requirements--TRICARE  supports about 9.4 million servicemembers, retirees, and their families  around the world. That doesn't seem like much in a Nation of 330  billion. But guess what? It means everything to that 9.4 million  servicemembers and their families.   The comprehensive nature of TRICARE, as we saw during the COVID time,  advancement of telehealth, the advancement of diagnosis, the  advancement of treatments, prescriptions, and all of that, it all  blends the work going forward and what we need to do to support our  servicemembers and their families.   It is incumbent upon us, as Members of the House of Representatives,  and the Senate, and the President, to ensure that no policy is put into  place that gives any entity an unfair advantage when it comes to their  priorities versus the needs and the priorities that we have and our  commitment to our members of the Armed Forces.   So with that, we know this is ongoing; and I can tell you one thing,  as a member of the VA Health Subcommittee, and on the Committee on  Armed Services, I look at this issue from the front end of recruiting  and enlistment standards, to retention, to retirement, to going into  the VA system, all the way along in that servicemember's life and their  family's life, and we are committed here to doing the right thing for  those folks because they did the right thing for our country.
