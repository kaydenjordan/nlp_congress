 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   I proudly stand today in support of H.R. 1808, the Improving Support  for Missing and Exploited Children Act.   This bipartisan legislation reflects both Democrats' and Republicans'  desire to protect and care for our greatest resource: our children.   In my home State of North Carolina, the trafficking of young women  has become an epidemic. There were 181 human trafficking cases reported  in North Carolina in 2016, and Charlotte was home to more of them than  anywhere else.                                time  1430    That figure gave us the dishonor of being ranked among the top 10  States in the Nation in the number of trafficking reports, and that  doesn't even account for those children who have not yet been  identified as victims of this shameful practice.   In North Carolina, lawmakers have sponsored efforts to establish  pilot programs to help victims and train law enforcement to recognize  the signs of trafficking. It is time Congress does its part and passes  H.R. 1808 to support States in their efforts.   This bill would improve efforts by both law enforcement and the  general public to combat trafficking, and it would enhance the  identification and location of missing children and their abductors.   It would protect children from being victims to online predators and  keep a promise that was made 33 years ago, when Congress first passed  the Missing Children's Assistance Act and we vowed to assist the  National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in protecting and  recovering our missing and vulnerable youth.   I am a parent, I am a grandparent, Mr. Speaker, and I am a concerned  member of my community; and my district and my State have been torn  apart by human trafficking.   This is an opportunity for us to come together as Americans and  support an initiative that could save lives. I urge my colleagues to  pass H.R. 1808 and prove that we can all put politics aside when it  comes to protecting our children.
