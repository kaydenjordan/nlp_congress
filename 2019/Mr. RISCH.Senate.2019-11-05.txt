 Madam President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my Home State of Idaho.  However, in honor of Veterans Day on November 11, this month I will  honor a veteran-owned small business for each of the 10 days the Senate  is in legislative session. The personal sacrifices made by America's  veterans have protected the very freedoms and values that give each of  us and our children the ability to achieve the American dream. The  skills veterans learn as members of the military are invaluable and  undoubtedly contribute to Idaho's flourishing veteran business  community. I am proud of the sacrifices veterans have made to protect  our country and that they are choosing Idaho to call home when they  complete their service in the military. As your U.S. Senator from the  great State of Idaho, it is my pleasure to recognize Rhino Metals,  Inc., in Caldwell as the Veteran-owned Idaho Small Business of the Day  for November 5, 2019.   Rhino Metals, Inc., is owned and operated by U.S. Air Force veteran  Don Suggs and is known for its quality, hand-crafted products. The  company began in the 1990s as an aircraft restoration business and  eventually expanded to sell gun safes, tool chests, and custom  furniture. Suggs was inspired to open Rhino Metals following his time  serving in the Air Force as a fighter pilot flying a McDonnell Douglas  F-4 airplane, known as the ``rhino'' for its toughness and long nose.   After transitioning back to civilian life, Suggs used the skills and  work ethic acquired during his military service to build his business.  Rhino Metals makes an effort to give back to fellow veterans seeking to  reenter civilian life. As a result, Suggs employs a large number  veterans and remains committed to the values he learned while serving  in the U.S. Air Force.   Congratulations to Don Suggs and all of the employees at Rhino  Metals, Inc., for being selected as the Veteran-owned Idaho Small  Business of the Day for November 5, 2019. You make our great State  proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
