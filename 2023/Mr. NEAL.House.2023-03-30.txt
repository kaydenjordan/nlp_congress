 Madam Speaker, I join with my Massachusetts colleagues to  mourn the passing of two of our former colleagues, Congressman John  Olver and Congressman Brian Donnelly.   John Olver, an MIT-trained chemist, dedicated his life to public  service, working as an educator at the University of Massachusetts  before beginning his political career. He spent 12 years in the  Massachusetts Legislature prior to his election to Congress.   Over the course of his 22 years in the U.S. House of Representatives,  John was an effective leader and a steadfast advocate for the people of  western and central Massachusetts.   His approach to policymaking was a good lesson for all. It wasn't  about tweeting or texting or cable TV appearances. He lacked any malice  whatsoever, and he always had the purest of intentions, focusing solely  on delivering for the people he felt privileged to represent. In  addition, I don't know anybody who mastered the details of public life  and complicated policy more than John Olver.   He was a devoted husband to his wife, Rose, of 55 years and a loving  father to their children.   Madam Speaker, we send our best wishes to them at this difficult  time.   Madam Speaker, I likewise rise to honor our former colleague Brian  Donnelly, a close personal friend of mine for the years that we served  together in this institution.   He was a steadfast public servant, a son of Massachusetts, and,  perhaps more importantly, a son of Dorchester.   From his days in the Boston Public Schools to the State legislature  to the hearing rooms of the Ways and Means Committee, Brian lived the  American Dream.   I will forever be grateful to him for his retirement plan that opened  up a seat on the Ways and Means Committee for me, understanding that  for 70 years, Massachusetts, in straight order, has had a seat on the  Ways and Means Committee.   He grew up in a working-class, Irish-American household. He never  forgot his ancestral roots in Galway, and he used his time in Congress  to advocate for Irish nationals both in Ireland and the United States.   Thousands of young immigrants secured visas through what is known as  the Donnelly visa program, giving countless families the opportunity to  live out the same American Dream that he knew so well.   Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Donnelly family during  this difficult time, and I appreciate, Madam Speaker, you providing us  the time for a moment of silence.                            ____________________
