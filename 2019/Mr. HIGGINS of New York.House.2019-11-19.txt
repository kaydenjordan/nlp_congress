 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I  demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, last weekend, a train derailed  in Niagara Falls, New York, tossing several cars filled with butane on  their side within yards of neighborhoods, residences, and local  restaurants.   The Niagara Falls Fire Department and Niagara Falls Air Reserve  Station responded quickly and, fortunately, this time, the emergency  didn't rise to the level of placing the community in great danger.   According to the United States Department of Transportation, over  1,300 train derailments took place in 2018 alone, leaving no doubt that  situations like this will occur again.   That is why I have introduced, along with Congresswoman Herrera  Beutler, the Fire Department Proper Response and Equipment  Prioritization Act. This bipartisan legislation ensures that our brave  first responders have access to Federal grants that support the  specialized training and equipment necessary to respond to rail-based  incidents, making the safety of our communities a priority.                            ____________________
