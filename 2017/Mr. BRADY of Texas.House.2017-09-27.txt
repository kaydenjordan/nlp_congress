 Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Mr. Curbelo  for his leadership in crafting this disaster relief package for our  communities, and Chairman Shuster for his leadership on this bill as  well.   I rise today not only on behalf of the people in my district in Texas  who have been just hammered, but on behalf of everyone in Texas, Puerto  Rico, Florida, and the Virgin Islands, who have been devastated by this  fall's destructive hurricanes.   These are people who desperately need the support of our bill, the  Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act. Hundreds of  thousands of families have lost everything, even loved ones. This bill  will help them begin to recover through meaningful, targeted tax relief  they need now.   Earlier this week, as communities continued to be decimated by  record-high wind gusts, flooding, and storm surges, regrettably, my  House Democratic friends opposed this critical bill, putting politics  above the very people they represent.   I stand here today to say we all have to do better. We have to show  the Nation we can stand together in times of great tragedy to help each  other and our neighbors, just as our people did in our district in the  aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge support for this bill.
