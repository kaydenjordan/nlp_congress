 Mr. President, I rise today to thank Dr. Susan  ``Sue'' Peterson Thomas for her many years of service to the State of  Kansas and Kansas State University--K-State--as well as honor her for  all that she accomplished during her career.   The daughter of a dairy farmer and former mayor of Abilene, KS, Sue  began her journey at K-State as a student, where she graduated with a  bachelor of science degree in political science and history. She would  go on to earn a master of public administration degree from the  University of Kansas, and a Ph.D. in curriculum and instruction from K- State.   Sue's service to the State of Kansas began in 1978, where she worked  for Mike Hayden during his time as the speaker of the Kansas House of  Representatives and Governor of Kansas. She also served on the  transition teams for Governor Hayden and Governor Sam Brownback.   Sue would go on to work for her alma mater, beginning her  distinguished career at K-State in 1989. During her 33 years of service  to the university, Sue worked her way up to chief government relations  officer, where she was directly responsible for all university liaison  activities with the State and Federal legislature. She also served as a  political science instructor since 1992, where she taught Kansas  politics and government to over 1,000 students.   During her time at K-State, Sue was responsible for multiple  different projects that have had a tremendous impact on the university.  She was instrumental in securing State funding to renovate Farrell  Library and add 153,000 square feet of new space to the library on K- State's Manhattan campus; she coordinated the successful legislative  effort to merge the Kansas College of Technology in Salina into K-State, forming the K-State Salina campus; she led the efforts to  secure State and Federal funding for the construction and equipment of  Pat Roberts Hall, the home of K-State's Biosecurity Research Institute.  The fruits of her labor culminated at the U.S. Department of  Agriculture's National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility's ribbon-cutting  ceremony this last May, which she worked tirelessly on, helping pass  multiple pieces of legislation that were crucial to the State's efforts  to land the facility adjacent to K-State's campus in Manhattan.   Throughout her career, Sue has been recognized at the local, State,  and national levels. She has been awarded the prestigious Marvin D.  ``Swede'' Johnson Achievement Award, the Flinchbaugh Family Wildcat  Pride  [[Page S2122]]  Award, and the Career Excellence Award from the Association of Public  and Land-Grant Universities' Council on Governmental Affairs.   Sue officially retired from K-State on April 7, 2023, after 33 years,  8 months, and 6 days of service to the university. I now ask my  colleagues to join me in recognizing the distinguished career of Dr.  Susan Peterson Thomas, as well as thank her for all of her work on  behalf of the State of Kansas and Kansas State University.                            ____________________
