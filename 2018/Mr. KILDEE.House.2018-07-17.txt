 Mr. Speaker, like many Americans, yesterday I watched and  was dumbfounded by the words and the actions of the President of the  United States as he betrayed our principles and our national interests  on the world stage.   Never before have we seen a President of the United States so quickly  surrender our longstanding values and our national security interests  to an adversary like Vladimir Putin. The President's pathetic  performance was an embarrassment for the United States.   Just last week, of course, his own Justice Department indicted 12  Russian intelligence agents for the very act that he denied ever took  place. When he had a chance to take sides between American interests  and the American intelligence community, he wrapped his arms around  Vladimir Putin, a KGB spy with a history of jamming his opponents and  killing journalists. This is outrageous.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my bipartisan  amendment that would provide $1 million for the United States  Geological Survey to eradicate grass carp in the Great Lakes. Grass  carp are an invasive species, one of the four species of Asian carp  that pose an immediate threat to the Great Lakes and its coastal  wetlands.   Since being introduced in Lake Erie, the grass carp population has  been increasing, threatening our coastal wetlands and our region's  economy that relies so heavily on the health of the Great Lakes. Our  coastal wetlands are important to Michigan's environment and the  wildlife they serve as a natural water filter and habitat for fish and  waterfowl.   Since 2010, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which has been  supported by Democrats and Republicans in Congress, has helped to  restore the wetlands the grass carp are now consuming. The immediate  threat of grass carp in Lake Erie jeopardizes the investment and the  goals of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.   This amendment is simple. It empowers and funds the United States  Geological Survey to track and monitor grass carp so that we can stop  their spread in the Great Lakes.   By passing this amendment, the United States Geological Survey would  have additional resources to find out where grass carp are breeding so  we can know how to stop their invasion and remove them from the Great  Lakes. Funding from this amendment will double our efforts in Lake Erie  to ensure we protect our coastal wetlands, our wildlife, and the Great  Lakes themselves. With this amendment, we have an opportunity to  address this urgent threat of invasive species such as grass carp.   Madam Chair, I thank my friend from Michigan, Congressman Walberg,  for working with me on this bipartisan amendment. I also thank our  friends on the Appropriations Committee--Congresswoman Kaptur,  Congressman Joyce, and Congressman Moolenaar--who have also been  involved and helped on this. And I, of course, thank Chairman Calvert  and Ranking Member McCollum for their efforts in working with us on  ensuring that this amendment receives fair consideration.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for his support, and I  [[Page H6443]]  thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for their efforts in  dealing with this really important issue. It is particularly important  to those of us who live in the Great Lakes region, but it is important  to all of us. This is really not only a question of maintaining this  ecosystem, but it is important to our economy.   Madam Chair, I thank all of my colleagues for their support. I urge  the passage of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
