 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the families of  Uvalde, Texas. One year ago this week, 21 souls walked through the  doors of their classrooms for the very last time.   They were teachers, artists, athletes, aspiring police officers, and  honor roll students. Hours later, they were dead, gunned down by a  teenage shooter with weapons designed for the battlefield.   At the morgue, their bodies were so ravaged they had to be identified  through DNA testing.   I have three children: 9, 7, and 1. When I drop my older children at  school, I think of the families in Uvalde who never had a chance to say  goodbye to theirs.   Over the last year, those same families have held back tears in our  committee rooms as they begged Congress to end America's gun violence  epidemic.   We know how to stop school shootings. We know that assault weapons  bans, universal background checks, and a higher age for gun purchases  will save American lives.   The teachers and children who died cannot change the law, but we can  honor their memories by having the courage to act.                            ____________________
