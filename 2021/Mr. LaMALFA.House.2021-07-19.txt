 Madam Speaker, I am pleased to see that this week we are  taking up H.R. 678, the PHONE Act.   This bipartisan piece of legislation is common sense and helps real  people after natural disasters.   This bill would place a moratorium on phone companies reassigning  people's landline phone numbers when their house is destroyed by a  natural disaster, such as forest fires, which I am having so many of in  my district.   I have heard countless stories of people whose houses are burned down  in wildfires that continue to get charged for their landline phone  number, or their number is reassigned to a new customer.   This bill would help alleviate some stress and give people one less  thing they have to deal with.   I am proud to cosponsor a bill that is stepping up and providing a  solution to help out wildfire victims and other natural disaster  victims.   The goal of recovery is to bring back a sense of normalcy, and  helping people maintain their phone number is a good step.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I want to speak with the body here about  the situation in the West with wildfire and drought.   As so many of you know from the news, there is wildfire breaking out  all over in the western States. My home State of California has several  going on right now. I represent the very north part of the State, the  First Congressional District, and we have fires routinely reaching now  the five-digit mark, including the newest one known as the Dixie fire;  it is over 30,000 acres. My understanding is, there are 11,000 new  acres just last night burning up in the area of Feather River Canyon.   But this is not, unfortunately, news this time of year in the West.  Anything west of the Rocky Mountains pretty much seems to be on the  line.   What is going on is that for many years we in this country value the  Smokey the Bear principle of putting out fires when they occur in the  forest. And I think we still do value that. But what we haven't done on  the back side of that is to manage our forest lands.   And so what we have seen in the decades since, a good-minded policy,  a good-intended policy, is that the forests have built up so much fuel.  So much damage gets done from all this fuel being built up from fire  season. It kind of creates its own drought situation inside the forest  there when you have more inventory per acre than what the forest can  sustain, especially during a drought period. And so in the West, in  California, it is known you are going to have drought years, you're  going to have wet years. And it kind of goes with the program there.   So I am disturbed that we can't advance the ball more on really the  type of forest management we need to be doing. We can sustain X amount  of trees per acre, and this is depending on tree type, tree age,  particular landscape, the particular weather pattern in a micro area,  but if we are not doing that then we are going to see this year after  year.   So the U.S. Forest Service has kind of transitioned from--not that  many years ago--about one-third of their budget would go for fire  suppression and two-thirds for the good green work we call it, green  harvest, permits, maintenance of forest roads and all the other things  you do in the off season in order to make the asset protected from fire  and also usable to the people, Because this is indeed the people's  asset. And they are getting less and less access to it because of fire,  but also just flat being closed down because of other environmental  concerns that have been brought up.   That is a key part of the argument here is that we have had hundreds  of thousands of acres burned. I will just stick with California for a  moment here. And simple projects after the fact when we are talking  salvage, salvage timber that needs to be removed after a fire, if you  do that within a reasonably soon amount of time after a fire then you  can still get value out of that timber. If you do it soon. No more than  a year would be ideal.   But what happens is that when Forest Service goes to try and contract  or do some of the work post fire to remove trees that will be dead or  are already dead but still have a salvage value, you can make a timber  product out of that, they get sued. The environmental groups come in  and sue them saying, oh, we think you are going to take away habitat  for the black-backed woodpecker or something like that. And indeed,  what has already happened is the environment has already been ruined  for quite a few years where the spotted owl might have been, where  other owls might have been, or other wildlife had been.   You should see some of the horrific pictures of how the wildlife is  affected in a fire like this. And these are not just a slow-moving  fire, but these conflagrations that we have these days that move from  treetop to treetop across the whole landscape.   And one of the saddest stories you will see is a rancher just right  in my home county of Butte on the east side who wrote the story about  how their family had been there for at least five generations and long- time ranchers there, and a fire whipped through there and took out so  many of their livestock, but also the legacy, the land that they love  has been ruined by fire in eastern Butte County, California, last year.                                time  1930    So what are we going to do? Are we going to continue to watch this go  on year after year after year?   I have run legislation to try and make it just a little bit simpler  to do basic, I think, commonsense idea of trimming around power lines,  moving hazardous trees and foliage away from power lines. But that  means you are going to have to cut some trees. That  [[Page H3662]]  means you are going to have to do some trimming. You are going to have  to do some actual work. The environmental groups even sue over that.   I am hearing reports that one of the latest fires might have been  where a hazardous tree fell into a power line. Why can't we create a  zone around all power lines? The lines are already there--it is not  like we are putting in new ones--to make it where there is enough  distance around power lines so that if a tree does fall, it doesn't  fall into them, and you get two bad things: a fire and blackouts.   So we will continue in Congress here to try and legislate that way.  And I want to convince my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that  this is very important, because we are losing millions of acres every  year to wildfire, losing millions of acres of habitat for wildlife,  millions of acres of wood products. As you see with wood products,  spiraling--through the roof. It has added $30,000 to $40,000 easily to  the cost of a new home because of the high cost of wood products.  Anybody that has been to any of the vendors to buy a piece of plywood  or two-by-four, it affects everybody. It isn't just those building  homes.   I mean think about the folks that need--for other disasters, our  friends that have to suffer hurricanes down there. Where do they get  the plywood to be able to board up for that? We have to produce these  products. We have to produce them domestically. We can't import  everything in this country.   In my real life, I am a farmer. And we can't continue to have the  situation where we are going to rely on imported food or somehow  replace our wood products. For some reason, the United States is the  number two importer of wood of all countries. Why are we importing wood  when we have so much of an overload and over-inventory in our western  States? So we should be employing our people and getting that material  out.   Now, people are going to be fearful that, Oh, you are talking about  clear-cutting. No, it isn't clear-cutting. That is the first thing they  want to ask you when you have a press conference or something about it:  ``So you want to clear-cut everything.'' No. We do this in zones. We do  this with thinning. You do areas where you might do a 30-acre spot but  then you plant it back, especially on private land. And you can tell  what the private land is versus the Federal land that is basically  almost not managed by flying over it after a fire or especially 5 years  after a fire when you can see the checkerboard pattern you find so  frequently of land ownership in forested areas. The private lands have  already reclaimed. They have already salvaged. They have already  started planting back. You can see the green; you can see order coming  back to those forests there.   In the Federal land, you can still see the same snags. The same ghost  trees--they call them--are there, left behind to--who knows when they  will ever get around to it.   And what does that mean? It propagates the next fire, the next time  lightning strikes, or the next flame blows through, or the next time  there might be some kind of an accident.   So I really, really want to get the attention of my colleagues here  in Congress, those that regulate the forest, those in the U.S. Forest  Service, and those of the American people, their attention to what is  going on, because this is not sustainable. It is not good. It is not  good for anything I have talked about with wildlife, the asset the  American people own in these Federal lands.   And we must do something to address some things that might be  inconvenient: cutting some trees--not all of the trees--you might have  control burns during the correct time of the year to get rid of some of  the slash. But on the positive side, why aren't we using this biomass,  taking this wooded material out here that doesn't turn into a two-by- four or baseball bat, or what have you, and turning that into something  useful that we can use to generate electricity.   Heaven knows, we don't have an oversupply of electricity generated in  California. We even saw Texas was a problem last winter. So we are  going to need to develop these sources, and that means jobs in these  rural communities, jobs cleaning up the forests, any dependable 24/7  electricity supply because you could control the fuel. Solar, you don't  control the fuel. You have to have a sunny day without clouds or have  it not be nighttime.   The wind machines, you can't control them either. 24/7 fuel sources,  whether it is hydro, whether it is new, whether it is natural gas, or  biomass using these wooded products, we need to use for something  positive anyway, we need to put them to work so we have a stable grid.   Heaven knows, with all the new demands that are being made by  environmental-minded people on more electric cars, getting rid of gas  stoves, getting rid of gas water heaters--all for electricity. Where is  all this electricity going to come from? We can be generating it with  things that come from our forests with these byproducts, so we need to  be putting them to work.   So I just implore everybody that has a role in making a decision  around here, in Congress, with our Federal agencies, environmental  groups, could you please back off a little bit and let some of this  good work happen. And the American people, listen to what we are  talking about and encourage those folks that may be timid or not  inclined to want to do the type of forest management, encourage your  Member of Congress this has got to be done, because this air quality  affects all the west. Last year, some of it even blew back all the way  to the East Coast from fires that were happening in California and the  West. So we can do a heck of a lot better.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the time here tonight. I yield to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer), my good colleague.                    In Recognition of John ``Bam'' Carney     Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Comer for his tribute to the  good people of Kentucky and the service you do there. They are served  well by him and the work he does here in Washington, D.C.   Madam Speaker, I would like to resume for a few moments to what I was  mentioning beforehand on forestry and the effects on our natural  resources. Year after year, as I was mentioning, there are tens and  hundreds of thousands, even millions, of acres of wildfire affecting  our habitat and air quality. What I didn't get to touch on was water  quality as well.   You will find, when you burn these mountainsides, you burn those  slopes, and indeed, with so much inventory on hand there of trees per  acre and brush and other dead vegetative materials, when this all  burns, it burns catastrophically. In a lot of cases, you get a  moonscape that is left behind. With that, there is a great amount of  ash and other material that, because it is on a mountainside and  hillside, it eventually is picked up by the next rainfall and/or  snowpack and washes down the whole watershed into our brooks, creeks,  streams, rivers, and, eventually, the lakes that we have.   This also creates a toxic environment, when you have that much ash  material going down and almost actually plugging the lakes, for  example.   I talked to folks in the hydroelectric business there. With all that  ash and soil erosion--really, the soil erosion is a big, big part of  that, too--they have to go in and clear the bottom of the lakes in some  cases to keep their hydro projects running. Otherwise, you have less  and less electricity being generated and the cost of all that to the  taxpayers and to those water rights holders, et cetera.   When we talk about wildfire in the West, it isn't just, yes, we lost  a few trees and some deer got burned, some mountain lions and bear, and  all that, which is all really important, but there is a lot more than  meets the eye with all this.   If we talk about the electricity grid for a moment, if the  hydroelectric plants can't operate--and we are already stretched the  way we are for electricity in the country and in the West because the  shift has been pushed, with so much emphasis on doing it all with solar  or wind power because we want to fulfill these renewable ideals. They  are fine. They are fine in their own segment, what have you, but they  are not fulfilling that big of a percentage of our grid yet.   We are still reliant upon a big part of our grid coming even as  legacy from coal, natural gas, hydro, and nuclear. We are not just  going to replace that overnight, and we are not going to do it,  certainly, cost-effectively with these expensive forms of electricity.   Everything still needs to remain on the table. It is very important  that we are domestically in charge of our electricity generation, our  energy, and our energy policy not relying on imported.   The wildfire effects do have a wide ripple across a lot of our lives.  It gets back to: Are we going to manage our forests, or are we going to  watch them burn?   Manage it means jobs for us. It means wood products that are grown  domestically, paper products. Heaven knows, we use plenty of paper  around here. Why not have that product come from something that is  going to employ somebody and help make our forest a better place?   For the power grid, we always seem to be on the edge, in the hot  summer, of having to shut off. Indeed, they call it Flex Alert in  California, where they are asking people to shut down the usage of  electricity. They already contract ahead of time with large  manufacturers like the cement manufacturers and others to say that we  might need you--they are contracted ahead of time to shut down at a  phone call, basically, saying: We are going to have to shut you off for  the rest of the afternoon. Stop that production and stop that work  because the rest of our power grid is going to be in trouble if we  don't get these voluntary, precontracted sign-ups shut down.   They are asking regular households to do that. I saw an alert the  other day--it is almost hysterical--asking people to not charge their  electric cars between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. This is at the same time we are  getting the bum's rush to say: Hey, convert to electric cars.   California has a mandate to eliminate new combustion engine cars by,  I think, 2035. Just make it up out of nowhere, no more of those cars.   Are we going to have a power grid that can do that? And then, do  people want to buy these cars? Is it more than  [[Page H3664]]  just idealists who want to purchase these vehicles or more who want to  just drive in the special high-occupancy vehicle lane that has a  sticker on it in California so you can use your car there?   Is this what vehicle choice looks like for folks? I am not against  them, but I don't like having things crammed down people's throats like  that either.   So, what are we going to do? Our forests, our energy grid, all of  these things work together. I was talking about the fires that break  out because the trees and other foliage can come in contact with power  lines, or a downed power line might light up a forest as well.   We have to be wise about how we are managing these things. Forestry  is required that takes that into account.   Our power lines, we still need to deliver the power from where it is  generated. We have so much hydroelectric power up in my area, yet they  want to remove dams. They want to remove the dams that are making this  clean, 100 percent renewable power up in the Klamath Basin, where  farmers this year are getting zero percent of their allocation of  water--zero.   How do you do that to a group of people, just taking that away?  Especially in the Klamath Basin, these farmers own the water rights for  that Klamath Project that was built by the Federal Government, and  Oregon, of course, has upheld that water right. Yet, the Federal  Government muscles the water away anyhow, just muscles it away because  it thinks it can.   Agriculture in California has taken devastating hits on water supply  this year. Some districts are as low as 5 percent, and even others  getting zero. Others are getting smaller cuts but still getting cut.    In our State, we have many crops that we grow over 90 percent of what  the United States uses. In my area, there are a lot of olives grown,  table olives and olive oil. Imagine not being able to get that  commodity and having to rely on imports totally for that because we  don't have a heads-up plan in this country that accounts for what we  produce and should be producing.   Our wood products need to come from the U.S. Our ag products need to  come from the U.S. Our energy, so we can be self-sufficient, needs to  come from the U.S.   We need to store more water in the Western States so we can produce  these things, so we can produce hydroelectric power, so we can produce  these ag products. We have environmental groups pushing to tear dams  out that are already in place, stretching our power grid, stretching  the food that comes to your table.   Just look them up. How many crops come from California that you rely  on nationally that you wouldn't get if they weren't grown there, or we  can turn to other countries to import from?   There was kind of a popular saying or a bumper sticker amongst  agriculture some years ago: If you like imported oil, you will love  imported food.   At what point are we going to wake up to this? Environmental groups  are doing a lot of winning on this. Yet, at the end of the day, what  they are pushing for doesn't actually do much to help the species they  claim to be saving.   The delta smelt, which is part of the delta just east of the bay area  in northern California, since 1992, I think they have been usurping and  taking away more and more water from agriculture, from human use, to  run through the delta to try to keep the salinity level low, with the  theory that will help the delta smelt.   The population has continually decreased since that time to where,  when they are out there doing surveys--they call them trawls. The last  several surveys, they haven't found any. They are not finding the  species. Yet, hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of water and more are  just being flushed through the delta because they still have the  biological opinions put out by somebody in government and somebody  willing to sue to stop the ability of that water to be used properly,  for people use or even a purpose that would be helpful for the economy.   Why does it have to be this way? There is a page on Facebook that I  would invite everybody to look at and to watch if you are interested at  all in where your food comes from and why our resources in California  and the West are being managed the way they are but especially with the  intent being on our water supply in California.   California water supply isn't just important to California. It is  important to the whole country for these fresh fruit and vegetable  products, the nut crops, and other things that are produced there that  are not produced anywhere in this country otherwise or in very, very  tiny percentages elsewhere.   All of your almonds pretty much come from California. Yet, there is  all this rhetoric out there, like the almonds are using all the water,  that we are exporting all the water. No, the water doesn't actually  leave the State. Each almond nut doesn't have that much water in it. It  goes back into recharging the groundwater. It goes back into keeping  the local economy growing those trees that replace CO2 with  oxygen.   Madam Speaker, I would like for you to check out this page on  Facebook. It is called the California Water for Food and People  Movement. A young lady named Kristi Diener on there puts out excellent  information all the time on all the different aspects of California  water and why that is important to everybody.   We have the possibility of adding more water supply to our States. We  could raise the Shasta Dam located in Shasta County near Redding,  California, far up north. You could raise it 18 feet and augment it by  about 630,000 acre-feet of additional water supply when you fill the  lake.   Also, another one called Sites Reservoir in the western part of the  Sacramento Valley, it is about 70 to 80 miles south of the Shasta Dam.  That would mean up to 1.5 million acre-feet of water that could be  stored there when you fill that project.   Those chunks of water would go a long way toward helping to keep the  crops growing, as well as people's needs and cities.   It is my view, as low as the lakes are getting right now, Lake  Shasta, Lake Oroville, Lake Folsom, San Luis Reservoir, where water is  transferred to after having been pumped through the delta--except they  can't because the State pumps and the Federal pumps are hardly running  because they think they are helping the delta smelt. If these  reservoirs are all full, we can go up to 5 years if we are not wasting  the water on biological things that don't make sense.   We need to do a lot more to augment our water supply so we can keep  growing the crops and have an economy of domestically grown products  that are high quality and that people enjoy. And they won't know they  are missing it until you can't get it.    For seeing good information, on this Facebook page, the California  Water for Food and People Movement, check into that because it is at  least a counterargument to what you hear all the time in the press and  in the news about what farmers are doing or how water storage is bad  and how dams are bad.   Dams, you get several good things by their existence. You get stored  water for people in ag, as well as water that would not exist in  summertime or in the fall that you could help with fish flows. Imagine  that? You get hydroelectric generation. You get prevention against  floods because you can store this water during the wild rainy season  and keep that.   The Army Corps of Engineers runs those operations for flood control  around the country. Imagine the flooding you would have in those  regions that can have that high flow during extraordinary rain events.   You get recreation. You get a lot of good things from storing water,  and we used to do that. We used to think ahead to do that. Now, we  think we are getting ahead by tearing out this infrastructure that  people need and actually can be beneficial and is beneficial to nature  as well.   We have to start thinking soundly and logically about what we are  doing. That is why I have spent so much time on the Agriculture  Committee, the Natural Resources Committee, and the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee talking about these issues. We have an  opportunity with an infrastructure bill or two or three coming up here  to do some real things in that.                                time  2000    I think most people when they think of infrastructure are thinking of  our  [[Page H3665]]  highways, the basic transportation they use every day. They are  thinking of things like levies, whether that is in my area of northern  California or Louisiana or all around the country, that help prevent  floods and keep water where we want it instead of where we don't want  it, and water storage itself, the dams that make so much possible, as I  mentioned, hydroelectric power, stored water, recreation, and flood  control. It just makes sense.   Why aren't we getting back to a sensible way of thinking about that?   We are just letting the environmental groups and the press--they seem  to want to cozy up to their argument and not get the counter side to  this.   Meanwhile, I have many constituents who aren't farming at all this  year, not growing crops and doing that honest, good work that they have  done for generations. These are good, hardworking people. Sometimes I  wonder why they keep doing it because they don't seem to be appreciated  for what they are doing. It is always a fight. They always have got to  be heading into town to defend something, defend their water supply,  defend their land uses, or defend against some more regulations thought  up by somebody in Sacramento or in Washington, D.C., who really doesn't  understand or seem to care about why they do what they do.   It makes this hard sometimes because as a Representative I go back  home, and I tell them: We are not having any really great answers  coming out of Washington, D.C., lately.   Under the Biden administration they are talking about pushing to  reinstall the WOTUS regulations, the Waters of the United States. There  are those in the Federal Government and environmental movements who  think that every drop of rainfall somehow belongs to the Federal  Government or State government for them to regulate.   Madam Speaker, you have people trying to collect rainwater off their  roofs into rain barrels and getting in trouble for that sometimes. The  water running off their driveway, they can't corral that water. They  can't build a stock pond to keep water for their stock because somehow  that is affecting the whole water table or the whole water system. That  is how far they want to interpret things--Waters of the United States.   I tell you what, Madam Speaker, not everything belongs to the  government. We have operated agriculture in this country for 200 years  and done pretty well for the most part, and we are always working to  improve and have better, more efficient water usage, better  fertilizers, developing herbicides and things that leave less of a  footprint behind or zero footprint behind and still produce a safe  crop.   People really should be asking questions. Ask these questions of the  Biden administration. Ask them of the EPA. Ask them in your home State,  Madam Speaker, as you see this stuff going on.   Where are we going to get our food supply?   Where are we going to get our electricity supply?   Where are we going to get our wood supply?   Where are we getting our fuel from?   Enjoy this $4 fuel--almost $5 as I saw on the way to the airport  today in Sacramento.   It doesn't have to be this way.   We need pipelines, we need domestically produced energy, and we can  do it ecologically soundly. This isn't new ground. This isn't the 1850s  or the 1860s when they hydraulic mined old mountain sides and they  killed all the buffalo and cut all the trees. We are way smarter than  that.   Yet, Madam Speaker, you would still think that from the way the media  covers it and the way the environmentalists talk about it in their  groups and their fundraising pushes that it is the 1860s all over  again. It isn't. We are pretty wise about how we manage our resources  for our farms.   These are our families' legacies.   Why would we not take care of them?   Why would we not take care of the soil?   We do. We can do it better than any of those folks with their wide- eyed ideas who come around saying: ``We could put your land into a  long-term legacy that we help control,'' and pretty soon you are eating  from their hand on how you manage your own farm, how you manage your  own land, or maybe you decide to manage not to farm it for a while. You  might be required to farm it anyway because it is now a habitat.   Where did all this come from?   Don't we trust rural people anymore to make good decisions?   Don't we trust these people who work from sunup to sundown who  provide for us from their heart and from their soul?   Don't we trust them?   Do we trust bureaucrats in D.C. or Sacramento or other State  capitals?   I don't. Not anymore.   We have got to do better, and it is going to take the American public  getting behind this, not just politicians here and not just ones  locally because sometimes they are hesitant, and they are afraid to. We  have to be bold. We have to be loud about this. And we have to speak up  every 2 years at election time if they are not doing it because we are  in big trouble right now.   If California doesn't get above average rainfall next year, I don't  know how much of agriculture is going to be in business. The lakes are  getting to be at record low pretty soon. If California is not farming  nearly to the percentage of what it does, it will affect everybody in  this country. They will see it in prices, and they will see it in  availability.   Look at the store shelves already, how hard it is to keep certain  things on the shelf when you go in and ask for it and it is not there,  Madam Speaker. In restaurants if you ask for certain menu items, they  are not even there.   I went through a drive-through the other day, and half the items  weren't available.   What is going on in production?   Yes, we know it has been a year of COVID, but production of basic  hard items, car parts, any other manufactured item, nobody is going to  work, or nobody can get the resources mined and shipped and made into  an end product that people need.   We have to wake up here.   What is going on that the means of production we are either exporting  it or we are shutting it down and we are putting the clamps on it?   Heaven knows $6 trillion out of thin air spending last year because  of the COVID mess, and yet trillions and trillions more are being  proposed and sought to be spent upcoming on things that are not going  to produce a rebounding, stronger economy but instead fulfill political  goals.   What are we doing?   They are still pursuing high-speed rail in California--something the  voters were told would cost $33 billion when it was voted on, I think  in 2008, $33 billion the voters were told. That price now is over $120  billion. It is only partially done. It is going to stop in an orchard  somewhere around Bakersfield and go to another town in the northern  part of the valley there where it will be a full rail line. For a $120  billion price tag we could build three large dams and lakes, and  California would not be worried about water supply once those were  built and filled.   Yet we chase these boondoggle things, either to fulfill campaign  promises or some kind of idea of that something will be green and  environmental. We are not going to have the resources we need the way  we are going to fulfill the power grid for the amount of electricity  that needs to be produced. We are not going to have it. We are going to  wake up someday with electric cars that won't go and appliances that  won't turn on because of shortsighted thinking.   Do the math, Madam Speaker. We have got to do the math and hold  accountable the people who are spreading this misinformation. If it  just doesn't seem right or sensible to you, Madam Speaker, trust your  little voice. Trust your instinct on that because when this stuff  doesn't add up, you are probably right. It doesn't. I have seen it  enough around here to know it doesn't add up long-term.   I don't normally do this open mic business here, but I am watching my  constituents being burned out of where they live. I am watching them  being pushed out by an economy that doesn't support what they used to  produce of things that people need and people used to need and still  will need. I am watching normal, hardworking Americans feeling a little  hopeless right now, and I don't feel great about it because there is  not more I can do as one of 435 in this room to help fix it.  [[Page H3666]]    But we get up every day, and we try and get this message out. That is  why I use this microphone, because we can't let this fall on our watch.   I ask the people to dig in, pay attention, and hold accountable those  who are putting the noose around the neck of our rural economy and  things that all Americans rely on.   Help us out. We desperately need it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
