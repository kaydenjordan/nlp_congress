 Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the `I Am  Vanessa Guillen Act' that addresses longstanding systemic problems in  the way that the military responds to sexual harassment and sexual  assault. I thank Representative Speier and Representative Mullin for  reintroducing this important legislation in the U.S. House of  Representatives.   Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen disappeared from her Fort Hood,  Texas, Army base in April 2020. Tragically, last June, Fort Hood  officials confirmed that remains found near the Leon River in Bell  County, Texas, were Vanessa's. Vanessa had told other soldiers at Fort  Hood that she was being sexually harassed and confided to her family  that the perpetrator was a fellow Army Soldier. A separate fellow  Soldier was suspected of beating Vanessa to death with a hammer, and  then, with his girlfriend, dismembering, burning, and burying Vanessa's  body about 30 miles from Fort Hood. This other Soldier--the suspect in  question--fatally shot himself when confronted by authorities for  questioning off post. His girlfriend has been charged in federal court  with conspiracy to tamper with evidence.   The Army finally acknowledged that Vanessa did report being sexually  harassed by a superior in her chain of command in the months leading up  to her murder. Vanessa's family has called for changes to how the  military handles reports of sexual harassment and assault and has asked  for a law to allow a third-party investigative team to look into  reports of sexual harassment within the military. They are right to  demand better from the military--as should we all.   Despite on-going efforts to root out the toxic culture of sexual  harassment and sexual assault in the military, it is still very much  alive. And that's not just my opinion--the Army itself has confirmed  that sad fact in recent months following their release in December 2020  of the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee Report, which shockingly  included as one of its findings that the Command Climate at Fort Hood  has been permissive of sexual harassment and sexual assault.   How long will victims of sexual harassment and assault continue to be  afraid to report their abusers? It seems that the military justice  system is rather the military system without justice where survivors of  these crimes cannot have confidence to know that their reports will be  confidential, taken seriously, and adjudicated properly.   We need to address this injustice now. An effective and strong  military unit is one that relies on the trust between all members of  that unit. Sexual harassment and sexual assault have no place in our  military--they break that critical trust. It is a betrayal of every  Soldier, Sailor, Airman and Marine if leaders do not do everything  possible to eradicate the toxic culture which allows sexual harassment  and sexual assault to fester and erode good order and discipline within  the ranks.   To ensure our military readiness, we need to do everything possible  to help ensure victims and survivors of these heinous crimes are  supported, treated with respect, and not traumatized again, and that  their perpetrators are held accountable in a military justice system  they can trust. These are fathers and mothers, daughters and sons,  sisters and brothers, who have volunteered to give the ultimate  sacrifice when called upon. They should not have to fear their fellow  servicemembers at home nor feel that when they raise concerns, they are  not taken seriously.   Therefore, I am reintroducing the ``I Am Vanessa Guillen Act''. The  provisions in this legislation will move prosecution decisions on  sexual assault and sexual harassment cases outside of the chain of  command to an Office of the Chief Prosecutor within each military  service; create a standalone military offense for sexual harassment;  establish trained sexual harassment investigators who are outside of  the chain of command of the complainant and the accused to investigate  all claims of sexual harassment; implement the recommendations of the  Fort Hood Independent Review Committee Report to strengthen the  independence and effectiveness of the Army's Sexual Harassment/Assault  Response and Prevention (SHARP) Program; require both DoD and the  Comptroller General to conduct separate evaluations of the military  services' sexual assault prevention and response programs; and  establish a process by which servicemembers can make claims for  negligence against DoD in the case of sexual assault or sexual  harassment. I was quite pleased to hear that DoD's Sexual Assault  Independent Review Commission recently released initial recommendations  to the Secretary that tracked closely with several of the provisions in  this legislation: moving prosecution decisions on sexual assault and  sexual harassment cases outside of the chain of command to an Office of  the Chief Prosecutor within each military service and requiring all  sexual harassment allegations to be investigated outside the immediate  chain of command.   These changes will encourage survivors to come forward to report  sexual assault and sexual harassment, more effectively bring justice  for survivors, and strengthen the ability of the military services to  protect its most important resource--the people who wear the uniform of  the United States.   We need to pass the `I am Vanessa Guillen Act' to fix a broken  military justice system.  [[Page S2526]]                                ____________________
