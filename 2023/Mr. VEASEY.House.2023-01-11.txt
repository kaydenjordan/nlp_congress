 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of  James Thomas Wilbun of Fort Worth, Texas.   Born November 7, 1918, in Hope, Arkansas. Mr. Wilbun grew up there  where he obtained his education, including agriculture school. A  dedicated veteran, Mr. Wilbun served in the United States military  during World War II. For his service, he was given a number of honors,  including recognition at the World War II museums in Washington, D.C.,  New Orleans, Los Angeles, and a ceremony that I was able to attend for  him several years ago in Fort Worth.   Following his career in the military, he built a career as a  landscaper and also served with the Fort Worth Independent School  District until he retired.   A great listener and a happy man, Mr. Wilbun loved gardening,  listening to gospel music, going to church, laughing, and he was an  avid fan of the Texas Rangers and the Dallas Cowboys.   But most of all, he loved spending time with his friends, family,  children, great-grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren, along  with a host of other relatives.    I want to end by commemorating Mr. Wilbun for 104 years on this  Earth, and to his service to the city of Fort Worth and our independent  school district.   Madam Speaker, our prayers go out to all of his loved ones.                            ____________________
