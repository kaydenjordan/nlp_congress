 Mr. President, for over 40 years, inspectors general have  acted as independent, nonpartisan watchdogs tasked with preventing and  uncovering fraud, waste, and abuse in the Federal Government. Simply  put, inspectors general make sure government is doing what it's  supposed to do. To accomplish this immense task, inspectors general  must be experienced in oversight, trusted by both political parties,  and ready to hit the ground running on any audits, investigations, and  other reviews of their agencies.   Unfortunately, the nominee for inspector general that we considered  last week does not meet this basic test.   The Department of Transportation is charged with ensuring that  America has the safest, most efficient and modern transportation system  in the world, so that Americans are able to travel safely and  efficiently by road, rail, or air. The Department has an annual budget  of over $87 billion and employs over 55,000 personnel, with a footprint  in every State.   The DOT inspector general must be ready to oversee the full range of  these activities, from every dollar that funds our highways to every  safety decision issued by DOT regulators. To meet this task, the office  employs over 400 personnel, with an annual budget of over $94 million.   Eric Soskin, the nominee for DOT inspector general, is not qualified  to oversee an agency of this size and scope, or to lead the activities  of one of the largest Offices of Inspector General in the Federal  Government. Mr. Soskin does not have any experience managing large  organizations. He has never worked in an Office of Inspector General,  and he does not have experience in many of the basic activities of such  an office, like audits or inspections. Although he has legal  experience, he has not focused on DOT or transportation issues at any  point in his career.   While I appreciate Mr. Soskin's service at the Department of Justice  and his enthusiasm for the position, he simply lacks the qualifications  to ensure DOT is fulfilling its responsibilities.   I am most troubled, however, by the increasing politicization of  inspectors general by the President and by the majority.   Since 1981, this body has confirmed over 150 inspectors general;  until last week, all but two of these nominees had been confirmed by  unanimous consent, a voice vote, or a unanimous vote. The reason for  this is simple: To do their jobs, inspectors general must be trusted by  each member of Congress and by every American, regardless of political  party.   Until this Congress, when an inspector general has faced significant  opposition, the Senate either worked through any concerns or declined  to advance the nomination. The majority did not force through partisan  or unqualified nominees. That is how we have upheld this institution.  That is how we have maintained trust in the independence,  qualifications, and integrity of inspectors general.   This Congress, we held our first party-line vote in 40 years to  confirm a deeply partisan inspector general nominee. We have now  confirmed yet another inspector general on a party-line vote during a  lameduck session, with a nominee who was already rejected by nearly  half of the Commerce Committee and as well as on the Senate floor.   The inspector general is a position that continues across  administrations. It is one with tremendous authority to look at every  agency record, to interview any employee, and to carry out criminal  investigations. We cannot transform this institution into one of  Democratic inspectors general and Republican inspectors general. This  is not and cannot become a political position.   Inspectors General hold government accountable to the law and to the  American people. And it is our responsibility to protect this  institution and reject any nomination that will undermine their  independent, nonpartisan work.                            ____________________
