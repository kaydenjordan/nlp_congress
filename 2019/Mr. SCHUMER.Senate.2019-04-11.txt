 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, well, if anyone wonders whether Attorney  General Barr is a straight shooter, this week, we got our answer.   Yesterday, at the Senate Appropriations Committee, the country saw  another disconcerting performance by the Attorney General. In the face  of serious questions surrounding the release of the Mueller report, the  Attorney General did exactly what President Trump wanted: He dodged  questions, peddled a conspiracy theory, and, like the President, lobbed  baseless accusations. It is clear that for Mr. Barr, the title he holds  is far less important than the boss he serves.   What he did not say is that Russia attacked our democracy, as all 17  Agencies of our intelligence community have confirmed. What he did not  say is that the intelligence community concluded that the Russians  infiltrated our democracy to help Donald Trump. What he also didn't say  is why he continues to wait on releasing the Mueller report. It took  him less than 48 hours to summarize over 300 pages but over 2 weeks,  and counting, to release the report itself.   Instead of giving straight answers, Mr. Barr seems to be nothing more  than a spokesperson for the President's campaign. He seems more like  the President's Press Secretary than the Attorney General. He is even  using the President's own tactics: Admit nothing. Deny everything. Make  counteraccusations.   Many of us tried to give Mr. Barr a chance, but after this week's  performance, it is clear as day he and the President are working off  the same playbook and planning to withhold crucial facts from the  American people.   What is really important is this: When Attorney General Barr issues  his report, his objectivity will be in total doubt. No one will  believe, when he redacts large parts of the report, that it was done on  the merits; people will believe he redacted parts of the report to help  President Trump. How will the American people be able to trust Mr.  Barr, and how will the American people be able to believe that his  version of the report is the real version when he has been so, so  partisan and was willing to peddle FOX News conspiracy theories before  the Appropriations Committee yesterday?   When Mr. Barr was first nominated as Attorney General, the question  posed to him was, would he be part of the Trump legal team or an  independent agent of the law? I think we have our answer, as we watch  him echo President Trump's statements and enable President Trump's  worst instincts. Whether it is defending the administration's dangerous  healthcare lawsuit or perpetuating conspiracy theories, Mr. Barr is  acting more like a member of the President's campaign than the  independent Attorney General he is supposed to be.   Mr. Barr is letting down thousands--tens of thousands--of hard- working people at the Justice Department. They are doing their job.  When someone is given real information that Russia interfered with our  elections, of course they are supposed to look into it. That is part of  their job. For Mr. Barr to label this as spying, echoing some of the  worst conspiracy theorists in the country, he loses all credibility,  and that credibility is vital because he will be issuing a report with  redactions.   When Mr. Barr issues his report, in terms of what should be redacted  and what shouldn't, his objectivity will be in total doubt because of  his performance yesterday.   Again, how will the American people be able to trust that the  Attorney General has given them the most information he can rather than  the least and that he has given them a full view of what happened  rather than protecting the President? People are just not going to  believe it.   The bottom line is that yesterday's performance calls into complete  question the objectivity and even the judgment of the Attorney General.  He does not seem to be an independent actor pursuing the rule of law.  Rather, he seems to be somebody simply ready to help the President no  matter what the price.                                   H.R. 268    Mr. President, on another matter, disaster relief, it is an absolute  travesty that this Chamber is recessing without a compromise on much  needed funding for disaster relief.   From the start, Democrats have supported an ``all of the above''  approach to helping every part of America that is struggling from  natural disasters. We need to help everyone hurt last year and everyone  hurt this year--everyone hurt in Puerto Rico, everyone hurt in the  Midwest, everyone hurt in Florida, and everyone hurt in Texas, Alabama,  Mississippi, and Georgia. In the American tradition, everyone comes  together when we have disasters, and we help everyone.   Our Republican friends seem to have a different view. They want  disaster relief that explicitly denies Puerto Rico the help it needs,  even though they are American citizens like everybody else. They heard  President Trump's temper tantrum at their lunch a few Tuesdays back,  and they have obeyed. This is un-American. We should not be picking and  choosing who gets disaster relief.   When Americans suffer, we all step in. We all help. President Trump  does not believe that, but where are our Senators who are standing up  for this principle? The compassion of the American people is much  greater than President Trump's small-minded contempt for the people of  Puerto Rico. The Senate, particularly Senators from the disaster States  who need that money, ought to have the courage to resist it instead of  making up stories and pointing fingers of blame.   Republicans have refused to present a serious solution that can pass  the House and the Senate. We all know that if Puerto Rico is not  treated equally, it will not be seen on the floor of the House. We all  know that the Governor of Puerto Rico has said that the solution  Republicans are supporting is not adequate for Puerto Rico. We all know  that.   It is a tragedy that the Republican leadership in this Chamber has  refused to help American citizens before going into recess. They own  the mess they  [[Page S2406]]  are creating across America, and with each passing day, the American  people see it.
