 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the nearly 5,000  farmers in my district, 96 percent of which are family-owned farms.   Every time I am home, I meet with farmers about the major challenges  they face today. The need to modernize and make more effective our H2A  visa program is consistently flagged.   That is why I am proud to support the bipartisan Farm Workforce  Modernization Act, a historic bill that both simplifies and broadens  the scope of the H2A application process. In addition to ensuring  critical protections for work, the bill will finally allow dairy and  other farm operations to access the H2A farm worker program, a critical  priority for farmers in New York-19.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of upstate produce and vegetable growers,  dairy operators, and all farmers in my district, I applaud the  bipartisan work of my colleagues in negotiating this important  agreement. Now let's come together and get this done.                            ____________________
