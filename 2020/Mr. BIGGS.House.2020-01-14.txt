 Madam Speaker, my eloquent friend so ably made his case,  and I would suggest that it is undercut in some respects when one  introduces and discusses impeachment the day after the election in  2016, before President Trump even came to office.   That isn't protecting the country, is it? What that is suggesting is  that one knows more than the voters of this country.   I am also always intrigued when the complaint comes up about the  majority in the Senate, when the majority in the Senate is going to  determine the rules for the trial in the Senate because the  Constitution says that the Senate holds the trial.   We just heard that there have to be 51 votes over in the Senate.  Oddly enough, I didn't hear complaints when the majority in the House  controlled the inquiry. In fact, the term ``coverup'' was used  preemptively regarding the Senate, but what I saw in the House was a  coverup.   We didn't get to introduce all of our witnesses. I sit on the  Judiciary Committee. Who did we get as witnesses? We got three or four  law professors who came in. That is who got to come in to testify  before the Judiciary Committee.   We didn't have the witnesses who had factual evidence come in. We  requested. We gave lists. We were told we couldn't have them. That is  part of the problem.   Adding to this hypocrisy, we heard over and over again that we must  impeach the President of the United States because it is an imminent  danger for him to continue in his office. But once that vote was taken,  the Speaker held the Articles of Impeachment and would not transmit  them. Here we sit, 27 days following that vote, with no transmittal.   We hear that there is going to be a transmittal tomorrow. I am  interested to see if that really takes place.   Madam Speaker, I am joined today by a number of my colleagues, and I  am grateful to have them here.   I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona, (Mr.  Gosar).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Cloud).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Perry).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio's  comments.   I want to add one comment. When you consider the aid that was the  subject of this issue where people said that he withheld aid as a quid  pro quo, the one thing that America has not heard enough of is this:  the aid was released in perfect compliance with the law. It was  released in the time constraints required by the law. In fact, it was  released 3 weeks prior to its being required to have been released.  That has not been said enough, nor has it been understood enough. So  that charge has always been bogus.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith).    I would ask the Speaker how much time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate those who shared their  thoughts on this matter, and I want to just cover a couple of things  that I think are absolutely critical to remember. They have been  touched on, but not emphasized enough for me, and that is this: when we  start looking at how this began and we look at the timeline, you will  see that this began before President Trump was elected, it proceeded  after he was elected but before he was sworn into office, and then the  day he was sworn in, the media said: Let the impeachment begin.   Ten days later the attorney for the whistleblower said:         Let the impeachment begin, let the coup begin, more power       to the attorneys.    That is what they were talking about, a search, as one of my  colleagues said earlier, for a modus vivendi for impeachment. That is  really what this was about.   Or you get in a phone conversation, and in that phone conversation  there is an amicable discussion of numerous things. That phone  conversation has been misquoted, and it has been deliberately  fabricated by the person who no doubt will be one of the House managers  going over to the Senate. This is the chairman who basically out of  whole cloth created a dramatic reading that was not representative in  any way of the actual transcript. This is the same individual who  promised us we would get to interview and depose the whistleblower  because where this engine got started is with the whistleblower. That  never happened.   So along the way, as witnesses were subpoenaed to talk and the  President exercised his executive privilege, my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle said that we do not have time to go to the court and  determine whether that executive privilege is being exerted in an  overly broad manner, whether we can narrow it, or whether it is  completely inappropriate. We just don't have time. Because do you know  why? We have got to impeach this President tomorrow because it is as if  he is an absolute destructive force and an immediate danger to this  Republic.   The reality is they got their vote, and here we sit. Here we sit, a  total of 27 days since the day of the vote. That day was there. We were  told it was going to go tomorrow. My colleague from Virginia has very  ably explained that there is a distinction between informing the Senate  procedurally and having the vote on House managers. But the point he  was making, and I wish to also join in, is this: you simply have seen a  process that has been devoid of the normal rules of precedent in this  House.   When we see these amorphous charges, these articles, passed by this  body, it tells you two things that make this a supreme danger to the  Republic going forward. All I am pointing to is what my colleague from  Florida said, is the danger that the impeachment process will be  misused for political purposes.   And that is this: Number one, process matters. Process always  matters. It is why we have these wonderful folks who sit in front of us  to make sure that we are following the rules of the House and to make  sure that we are following the rules of precedent. It is not unlike  international law, quite frankly, where all you are relying on is  precedent, and you just change it very simply. If you don't have those  rules and you don't have integrity to the rules, then the minority  rights are abused.   When the minority rights are abused in this place, that means the  right of representation of tens of millions of Americans is diffused  and abused. So you have that problem.   Then you have the fundamental idea of trying to impeach on things  like obstruction of Congress. Well, I just told you how Congress was  not obstructed. Congress had a remedy. You cannot have obstruction if  you have a remedy. The remedy was to go to the other branch and resolve  it. They chose not to.   These are the two problems in the most virulent way.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
