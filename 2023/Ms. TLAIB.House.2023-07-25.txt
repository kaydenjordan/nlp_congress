 Madam Speaker, I still remember the first few months here  almost 5 years ago. One of the people I looked for was a young woman  sitting to the left of the House Chamber. I would lock eyes with her,  and when she smiled at me, it was always with a warm welcome.   Joyce Hamlett will be sorely missed as she retires as the Keeper of  the Mace and Assistant Sergeant at Arms.   She took her role very seriously. I know because I was one of the  Members she reminded every so often of the rules of the House.   Ms. Joyce would even take out one of the laminated black and white  articles in plastic. Check it out in the drawer right in front of her.   Ms. Joyce worked so hard for the last 35 years here in this Capitol.  Her story is inspiring, Madam Speaker. She is not only the first Black  woman to hold this post, but she also was so proud of growing up in the  tobacco fields of Broadway, North Carolina, and to come here to make  history in Congress. She never forgot her roots and the strong  character that her grandparents instilled in her.    In a place that can sometimes be harsh, Madam Speaker, she always  remained kind and fair to all. I will dearly miss Mother Joyce and  never forget her hugs on some of the toughest days in this Chamber. She  may be considered the Keeper of the Mace for many here in the House  Chamber, but she will always be my khalto.                            ____________________
