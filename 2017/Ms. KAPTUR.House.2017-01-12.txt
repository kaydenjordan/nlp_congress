 Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today as co-chair and  founding member of the Polish, Hungarian, and Ukrainian House Caucuses.   I am also a strong defender of NATO and of its purpose in linking the  free nations of Europe and the United States through this historic,  hard-won alliance and security treaty among Europe's sovereign nations  that respect the rule of law and our shared passion for liberty.   Our Nation and NATO's members paid the ultimate price in the last  century for our priceless gift of liberty. We won the cold war, and our  most treasured democratic values of life, liberty, freedom of assembly,  press, and religion are under siege today by a predatory and repressive  Russia. Go no further than any major business in your district and ask  them how many times they are hacked daily by Russian predators--to get  a sense of what is going on.   My purpose this morning is to remind our citizenry of the continuing  and major, real threat to our NATO alliance and to the destabilization  of Europe by Russia that necessitates our strengthening the alliance,  not weakening it, to ward off Vladimir Putin's expansionist dreams.   I must say I am concerned by our President-elect's loose talk about  Russia. His naive assumption that personal friendships with Russia's  oligarchs--some of whom are active members of Russia's notorious  mafia--can overcome strategic, expansionist imperatives that fill  Vladimir Putin's mind are truly not in America's interest.   So let's review some recent history.   Domestically, Mr. Putin has suppressed the basic freedoms of the  Russian people. His leadership has resulted in countless infringements  of human rights violations and other actions that directly conflict  with our foundational values in Western democracies.   Putin has an aggressive and very hostile foreign policy toward us-- toward the United States--and our top allies. Russia has invaded  neighboring sovereign countries, including the Republics of Georgia and  Ukraine. Russia has threatened and harassed U.S. military personnel and  diplomats overseas, not in the last century, now, orchestrating an  anti-American propaganda campaign--the largest since World War II--both  in our country and around the world; and it is conducting cyber  warfare, as I speak, against our country, our government, our  interests, as well as European governments; against political  institutes; against our think tanks; against our State voter data  systems, as our intelligence services have just informed us; and  against our cities and counties, journalists, and individuals.  [[Page H399]]    Information about Putin's aggressive behavior is well-documented and  is specifically highlighted in the intelligence briefings that our  President-elect began to receive when he secured the Republican Party  nomination last year. Despite this, throughout his campaign and as  President-elect, Mr. Trump continues to praise and support Putin. He  has even taken the foreign dictator's side over those of the leaders of  our country he was elected to represent.   Here are examples:   December 18, 2015: During an interview on ``Morning Joe,'' host Joe  Scarborough asked Mr. Trump about Putin's alleged killing of  journalists and political opponents. Trump answered: ``He's running his  country, and at least he's a leader. Unlike what we have in this  country.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of dozens of journalists  in Russia who have been murdered in cold blood because they were  reporting on corruption, on growing repression in that society--on what  Russia was executing around the world.

The official       investigation pinned the murder on a Chechen rebel who was       killed by an air strike, but her colleagues and human rights       activists believe this is a cover-up.        26.
