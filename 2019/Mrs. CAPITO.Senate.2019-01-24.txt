 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today as the chairman  of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee to express my  strong support for the End the Government Shutdown and Secure Our  Borders Act. This legislation includes many important priorities, and  they are important priorities that we need to address now.   In the past several days and weeks, there has been a lot of talk  about who has more leverage, who is winning, and what the political  stakes are. You hear a lot of different answers to those questions,  depending on whom you ask, quite frankly, but I will tell you one  thing: Those are not the questions on the minds of our Federal workers.   Just this morning, at about 4 o'clock, I had a conversation with  several TSA agents at Yeager Airport, where I fly out of to come to  Washington. In talking about the situation, what I got in response from  them was a lot of headshaking and a lot of questions. Their questions  had to do with this: How are they going to pay their bills and when is  this going to end? I understand their frustration. I am frustrated.   That is exactly why I have always said that a shutdown is no way to  govern. It is not in anyone's best interest. It is a disservice to our  Federal works. It is a show of our inability to do our jobs in  conjunction with those on the other side of the aisle, and it is a  signal to the American people that we think this confusing and  ineffective way to govern is OK, when it is not. It is not OK.   We are here in this body to work together, to get over the rifts that  we may have, and to move forward to do the people's work. We have to  fix this situation, and we have to fix it now.   We have an opportunity today to do that, and I plan to do that by  voting for the President's proposed compromise. This proposal does two  things that we should all want. It reopens the government, and it helps  to secure our southern borders. If we pass this amendment--and I hope  we do--we will bring our furloughed workers back to work, and they will  get paid. We will pay the dedicated men and women of our Coast Guard,  our Federal prison guards, our TSA and Border Patrol personnel, and  many others--many of whom I have talked with--and we will take a major  step forward in securing our Nation.   I believe the resources in this bill are necessary because I believe  we do face a crisis on our southern border. Last year, in the last 3  months of 2018, over 153,000 people were apprehended illegally crossing  the southern border. And that number does not include the people who  crossed illegally, but were not apprehended. The number of illegal  border crossings was up more than 80 percent in the last 3 months of  2018, as compared to the last 3 months of 2017.   The composition of those being detained for crossing the border is  changing. In 2000, 98 percent of those detained for illegally crossing  the border were Mexican nationals, and most were single adults. They  could be repatriated to Mexico very quickly, within hours. But, in  2018, more than 56 percent of individuals detained were from places  other than Mexico. A large portion were from Honduras, Guatemala, and  El Salvador.   Increasingly, individuals are showing up at our borders from all over  the world. Forty percent were either unaccompanied minors or arrived as  part of a family unit. That number is way up. That number is way up.  That means longer detention proceedings that have placed a burden on  our immigration court system, and it means an increased need for  facilities to safely and responsibly house these people for a longer  period of time.   I have visited the detention centers in Texas. I believe the facts  make it very clear that there is a crisis. The amendment that we will  vote on today offers a solution.   We also know that physical barriers work. In the San Diego, Tucson,  El Centro, and El Paso regions, where there are constructed physical  barriers, the illegal border crossings have gone down by more than 90  percent. That is undeniable. Right now, we have 654 miles of physical  barrier in place.   I have heard folks say that we don't have any walls or that we don't  have any barriers. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. If we pass this amendment,  we can build 234 miles in areas like the Rio Grande Valley, where  career Border Patrol personnel tell us it is most needed.   There has been a lot of talk that the professionals should be in  charge here in terms of telling us how and what the best methods of  protecting our borders are. Well, they are in charge. As subcommittee  chair, I have had several meetings with them for them to tell me what  their border security plan is, and the CBP has that.   This amendment would fund the bulk of the top 10 requests. They have  a 33-point plan. This would get us through the top 10.   The funding in this bill provides for a border wall system--a  system--which is much more than just a physical barrier. It provides  lighting, sensors, cameras, and access roads to help our Border Patrol  agents gain and maintain operational control of the border. These are  the things that the Border Patrol has asked for. A wall is not the only  solution, but it is a critical part of the solution.   The resources included in the amendment for the southern border are  important to the security of our Nation, and they are especially  important to address our drug crisis. Fentanyl seizures by the Border  Patrol away from ports of entry are up 122 percent over last year.   Remember, fentanyl is a killer. Over half of the deaths by overdose  in our State in some bit or in some part involved fentanyl.  [[Page S546]]    Methamphetamine seizures by the Border Patrol away from ports of  entry are up 75 percent in the last three years. The border wall system  will reduce the flow of these illegal drugs between our points of  entry.   We know that much of the heroin, fentanyl, and methamphetamine that  are hurting so many Americans cross our border at the ports of entry.  This amendment addresses that issue as well. It provides $805 million  for technology, canines, and personnel to stop the flow of illegal  drugs into our country. That is what West Virginians are interested in.  This drug crisis is really impacting us. This would be an unprecedented  investment in these types of detection capabilities--a complete game  changer.   The amendment would allow us to hire more people, which is another  thing the CPB says that they need--750 new border agents and 375 new  Customs officers to complement these investments.   The combination of technology and personnel, both at our ports of  entry and along the border, with the border wall system, would enhance  our security. It will choke off a major source of the heroin and  fentanyl that has devastated my State, and I am sure the Presiding  Officer's State, as well, and across our country.   Resources are also included in the amendment to detain those who are  apprehended for illegally crossing our border. I support the important  work of the men and women of ICE, and I want them to be able to  maintain custody of offenders, rather than being forced to release  those who have entered our country illegally due to a lack of space. In  my view, that is not only more safe and secure for us, but it is  actually more safe and secure for anybody who is involved in the  immigration system.   They and many more of the brave men and women of the Department of  Homeland Security continue to perform these difficult tasks without  getting paid during this shutdown.   Chairman Shelby's amendment is not a short-term patch. We are kind of  past the time where we need a short-term patch. We need to move  forward. It is not a continuing resolution that runs our government on  autopilot for a little while and denies the Senate the ability to make  smart choices in exercising the power of the purse.   Instead, it includes seven full appropriations bills that received  significant bipartisan support in the Appropriations Committee, one of  which is my bill at the Homeland Security Subcommittee, which was  passed in a bipartisan way. Four of these bills passed the Senate floor  with overwhelming support. I am very proud that the bill that I put  forward in committee, along with some additions, are a part of this  package.   There is $11.9 billion provided for our Coast Guard--this was in my  bill--including to begin construction of something that I think is  critical to our national security, which is the polar security cutters.  More than $4.8 billion is provided for the TSA to improve  transportation security, and $19.8 billion is appropriated for FEMA to  make sure we have the necessary resources to respond to past and future  natural disasters.   There are important priorities within these bills from other  subcommittees as well. A couple I would like to highlight are these.  The Agriculture title has $550 million for a rural broadband pilot  project that I strongly support as part my Capito Connect plan in the  State of West Virginia. The FSGG title has resources for the Drug-Free  Communities and High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program, which is  critical for stopping the drug epidemic that I have spoken about. The  CJS title has $468 million to combat the opioid epidemic and another  $30 million for economic development assistance to coalfield  communities. These are just a few examples of what the Shelby amendment  has.   The amendment that the Democratic leader has proposed reopens the  government through February 8. It provides no new resources to address  the security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border. Let me  repeat that. It provides no new resources to address the security and  humanitarian crisis on our southern border. Passing the Schumer plan  would put us in the same position on February 8 that exists today.   We don't need to pause the shutdown for 15 days and ignore border  security. Article I of the Constitution gives us, as the Congress, the  power of the purse, and we should exercise it by making smart choices  based on the situation that is in front of us today.   Continuing resolutions only cut and paste the choices that we made  last year. Instead, we should pass the seven appropriations bills  before us to fund the government for the rest of the year in a  thoughtful way, in a bipartisan way, while also providing the necessary  resources to protect our Nation.   President Trump has made a significant concession by asking that we  include a provision giving 3 years of certainty to those covered by the  DACA Executive order, as well as those who have been on temporary  protected status. That provision is included in this amendment. This is  the type of reasonable compromise that is necessary to pass major  legislation during a period of divided government. No one--not the  President, not any Senator, not any Representative--gets everything  they want in this bill or any bill, really.   The bill includes items that many of us individually might have left  out if we wrote the bill ourselves, but that is the nature of  compromise.   The seven appropriations bills that make up the Shelby amendment are  the product of significant bipartisan compromise on behalf of the  Nation. I believe we should embrace the spirit of compromise to end  this shutdown and secure our border. What can't be compromised is our  Nation's security.   We just celebrated Martin Luther King, Jr., Day last Monday. As was I  reading a lot of his famous quotes, I thought about this one because of  the situation that we find ourselves in right now:         If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if       you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to       keep moving forward.    Let's start moving forward together. I hope that all of my colleagues  will embrace this sentiment, and I hope that as I vote for the Shelby  amendment, we will get enough to push it over the Senate floor and over  to the House.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
