 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the career of Dom  Betro, a resident of my district, who is retiring this month as the  president and CEO of the Family Service Association of Western  Riverside County.   Over the last 33 years, Dom has overseen phenomenal growth in the  impact of this agency, which today helps more than 75,000 people a  year. Under Dom's leadership, the FSA developed more than 90 units of  senior housing and provided counseling and childcare service to  countless individuals.   Dom's record of public service includes volunteer work for  organizations such as the Nonprofit Policy Counsel of California. He is  a lecturer at California State University San Marcos and served for 4  years on the City of Riverside City Council.   The legacy of Dom's dedication to the Inland Empire will continue  long after his retirement. He has made our community a better place to  live. On behalf of my constituents, I want to thank him for his  service.                            ____________________
