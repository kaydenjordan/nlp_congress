 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1941, the Coastal  and Marine Economies Protection Act, to ensure we safeguard our  environment against the threats of offshore oil drilling. I am proud to  have worked with Chairman Grijalva, Chairman Lowenthal, and  Representative Cunningham to make sure that this measure also includes  my legislation, H.R. 279, the California Clean Coast Act. This would  make certain that there is no future offshore oil and gas leasing off  California's coast and put the interests of the American people first.   We cannot put corporate profits of Big Oil above protecting our  environment. My constituents in the central coast have seen firsthand  the damage oil spills inflicted on our communities and our local  economies. During the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, over 100,000  barrels of crude oil spilled into the Santa Barbara Channel. This was  the largest oil spill in California's history. It fundamentally harmed  Santa Barbara's unique marine ecosystem and wildlife, recreational  interests, and commercial fishing.     Paired with the 2015 Plains Refugio oil spill, where  cleanup costs hit $92 million, these incidents show us that we cannot  afford another disastrous oil spill.   In contrast, California's coastal region tourism generates over $1.9  trillion of GDP per year. It also supports more than $731 billion in  wages. Any future oil drilling would pose a direct threat to our local  economies and the success of local businesses that are tied to clean  oceans and healthy ecosystems. We must safeguard our planet and economy  for future generations, including my two grandchildren, Roman and  Gianna. This is why I urge passage of H.R. 1941, the Coastal and Marine  Economies Protection Act.
