 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  bill. It includes funding for State and local governments, for our  healthcare workers, cops, firefighters, and teachers--those on the  front lines working for us.   The tax provisions in this bill help small businesses pay their fixed  costs and the wages of their employees so they can keep the lights on  throughout this crisis. That is why small businesses support this bill.   It improves the PPP to help the small businesses and help their  employees, and it includes the FEED Act, a bipartisan, bicameral bill  that enables restaurants and small family farmers to feed hungry  people.   The HEROES Act is an investment by the Federal Government to help the  American people get through this pandemic.   Pass this bill.
