 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment allows the admission of scientists and  technical experts from foreign countries to work on the national  security innovation base. Without a clear provision forbidding foreign  nationals from hostile regimes like China and Iran, we should strongly  oppose this amendment.   The Democrats' open border policies have produced the largest illegal  mass migration in our Nation's history. Since they took power,  including deliberate releases and got-aways, the Democrats have allowed  into our country an illegal population larger than that of the entire  population of West Virginia.   We have apprehended at the border scores of persons on the terrorist  watch list, and we have no idea how many more have come in among the  800,000 got-aways who evaded apprehension as the Border Patrol was  overwhelmed processing these unprecedented numbers.   The Democrats' unconditional surrender to the Taliban last year  released more than 5,000 terrorists held at Bagram Air Base. Ten days  later, one of those terrorists detonated the bomb that killed 10  marines at Abby Gate. We have no idea where the other 5,000-plus are  today, but it is a good bet that more than a few have been among those  got-aways coming across our open southern border. Obviously, the  security of the United States is not high on the Democrats' list of  concerns.   Now, instead of addressing this national security crisis, the  Democrats have pursued one measure after another to encourage still  more immigration--legal and illegal--and this amendment should concern  us all.   Now, some of our greatest military breakthroughs have come from  foreign-born scientists--the Manhattan Project comes to mind. But so  too, some of our worst security breakdowns have come from foreign  scientists, and I do not trust this administration to know or even care  about the difference.   China, for example, is so intent on using our U.S. immigration system  to steal our sensitive technologies that the Trump administration had  to issue a proclamation suspending entry of certain Chinese students  and researchers.   The Trump Administration found that ``the People's Republic of China  is engaged in a wide-ranging and heavily resourced campaign to acquire  sensitive U.S. technologies to bolster the modernization and capability  of its military.''    The proclamation warned that ``students or researchers from the PRC  studying beyond the undergraduate level are at high risk of being  exploited or co-opted by the PRC.''   In fact, the Department of Homeland Security warned us in 2020 that  the Chinese Government requires its nationals to ``support, assist, and  cooperate with State intelligence work.''   The idea for this amendment came at least in part from the Commission  on Artificial Intelligence which called for ``increasing China's brain  drain.'' So clearly the green cards contemplated under this amendment  would go to Chinese nationals.   The last thing we should do is make it easy for the Chinese Communist  Party to gain access to our national security innovation base work,  Department of Defense research, or other critical technologies.   I would also note that sadly our new woke Department of Defense does  not  [[Page H6460]]  have a great track record regarding immigration programs. Many of you  may remember that the Department of Defense supported and encouraged  the military accessions vital to the national interest--or MAVNI  program--through which foreign nationals were able to enlist in the  U.S. military. Once enlisted, they were eligible to nationalize.   The Obama administration was forced to halt this program when it was  discovered that the Department of Defense had allowed some Chinese  spies to enlist in the military.   Let that sink in: the Department of Defense allowed Chinese spies to  enlist in the U.S. military.                                time  0100    Add to this the Biden family's questionable financial ties to China  and the ingratiation of Chinese spies with several Members of Congress,  and this amendment becomes most disturbing. Accordingly, I urge the  House to oppose it.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The Democrats' record speaks for itself: no concern for the dire  national security implications of their open borders policy; no concern  for the infiltration of hostile foreign agents into our military; no  concern for the ingratiation of foreign agents into our legislative and  executive branches.   Americans should be concerned. They should be very concerned. Until  there is a sea change in the attitude of the ruling Democrats toward  our national safety, our security, and our sovereignty, amendments like  this should be utterly rejected.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
