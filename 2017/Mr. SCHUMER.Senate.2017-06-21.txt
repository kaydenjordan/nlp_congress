 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Madam President, we are only a little more than a week  away from having to vote on a secret Republican healthcare bill,  according to the timelines given by the majority leader to the press-- just 1 week away from voting on legislation that will reorder one-sixth  of our economy and impact every single American in this country, and  not a soul in America has seen it.   I have never seen a more radical or reckless legislative process in  my time in politics--write the bill in secret; discuss it in secret;  send it to the CBO in secret; then rush it to the floor with no  committee hearings, no amendments, and just 10 hours of debate for the  minority.   That is not how America ever got big things done. That is not how we  do big things like healthcare in the Senate. That is hardly how we do  small things, and my Republican friends know it.   Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, said: ``I've always  said I would have preferred a more open process.''   Republican Senator Murkowski, from Alaska, said: ``If I'm not going  to see a bill before we have a vote on it, that's just not a good way  to handle something that is as significant and important as health  care.''   I couldn't have said it better myself.   Republican Senator Moran said: ``My hope is that we treat the bill  seriously, that we have hearings, that we have witnesses. I want  regular order to work.''   In addition, Republican Senators Rubio, Corker, Gardner, McCain,  Collins, Paul, Daines, Fischer, Johnson, and Lee have all complained  about the lack of transparency in the process.   Why did they flatly refuse to say to the majority leader: Let's have  a hearing. Let's accept amendments in committee. Let's have regular  order and real debate on this bill. It is too important.   If they do not want to say it to the majority leader directly, I hope  they express their frustration with this process with their votes on  the motion to proceed, which looks like we will have next week.   We Democrats had all of the things they had asked for. They did not  vote for our bill, those who were here, but at least they had input.  They could offer amendments on the floor or in the committees, if they  were in the relevant committees. They could debate.   Not today. Not next week.   Now, why is it that my Republican friends have resorted to such  secrecy?   There is only one reason: They are ashamed of their bill. They must  think  [[Page S3659]]  they are better off not talking about the bill publicly. We all know,  if my Republican friends believed it was a good healthcare bill, one  that actually lowered costs and improved care and helped more Americans  afford insurance, they would be preaching it from the mountaintops.  There would be a brass band down every Main Street in America that  would be announcing this new legislation--but no. They are afraid to  even whisper about their bill. They want it out in the open for as  little time as possible in order for it to receive as little scrutiny  as possible. They do not want the American people to see that their  healthcare bill is little more than a vehicle to give another tax break  to the wealthy, made possible by cutting care and raising costs on  middle-class Americans and those who are struggling to get to the  middle class.   They do not want the American people to know their healthcare bill is  mean, like President Trump said it was, because they do not think it  could survive an open process so they are keeping it secret and leaving  almost no time for its review. If a bill cannot survive scrutiny or  public debate, if a bill cannot survive a committee process or the  threat of a single, open hearing, it should never become law--plain and  simple.   Now, for months, we Democrats have tried to reach out to Republicans  to bring an end to this dangerous game and move toward a bipartisan  process. We want to improve our Nation's healthcare system. If  Republicans were serious about wanting to improve our healthcare  system, too, they would get the President to guarantee the cost-sharing  payments, stop sabotaging our healthcare system, and come talk with  Democrats about bipartisan solutions. Instead, they are just sabotaging  the bill.   As for the insurance companies which are pulling out of some  exchanges and raising premiums, ask them; the No. 1 reason: no  permanent cost sharing. Who is standing in the way of permanent cost  sharing? The President and our Republican colleagues. They are the  reason people are pulling out of exchanges and premiums are going up.  They cannot escape that.   We Democrats were willing to try to work with our colleagues. We  asked to have a bipartisan meeting in the Old Senate Chamber so we  could discuss this--just the 100 Senators--among one another. We were  rejected on that. We have been rebuffed overall, but the invitation and  sentiment remains. I would remind my Republican colleagues that time is  getting short for them to change their minds.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on another matter, Russia  sanctions.   Just last week, the Senate approved a package of Russia sanctions  that would lock in existing sanctions, give Congress the ability to  review any sanctions relief, and implement tough, new sanctions to  punish Mr. Putin and his allies for meddling in our election.   The importance of this legislation is reflected in the overwhelming  bipartisan vote of 98 to 2. Now we are hearing that the House of  Representatives is under pressure from the White House, and they might  blue-slip the bill, which could delay or prevent it from passing.   Never mind the fact that the Senate bill was written to avoid such a  problem, as my friend, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee,  Senator Corker, said when he heard the news. Never mind that, and make  no mistake about it, the blue-slip threat is nothing more than a  procedural excuse by House Republicans who dredged it up to cover for a  President who has been far too soft on Russia. This administration has  been far too eager to put sanctions relief on the table. That is what  this is about.   Many people, from one end of America to the other, are asking: Why?  Why is he afraid of tough sanctions on Russia?   Just yesterday, the White House spokesperson said that he had never  spoken to the President about Russia's interference in our election.  What has Russia concluded from all of this? Putin now knows he will not  suffer any consequences for disinformation campaigns, for buzzing our  ships and planes, for threatening our European allies, for cyber hacks,  energy coercion, or his ongoing support for Russian separatists in  Ukraine.   Now, in a short time, the Trump administration is sending one of our  most senior diplomats to Russia to meet with his Russian counterpart.   Is the White House encouraging House Republicans to delay this bill  so they can offer the Russians something in their upcoming talks? We do  not know. It sure seems possible, even likely, and it is a flatout  wrong approach, as Democrats and Republicans in this Chamber agree.   The United States should not be afraid to engage with Russia, but we  cannot look the other way or, worse yet, reward Putin after he directed  an assault on our democratic institutions. That is why the Senate  passed this package of sanctions, sending a powerful message to  President Trump that he should not lift sanctions on Russia.   Responding to Russia's assault on our democracy should be a  bipartisan issue that unites both Democrats and Republicans in the  House and in the Senate. The House Republicans need to pass this bill  as quickly as possible. Their blue-slip excuse does not hold water.                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, a word on China and North  Korea.   Yesterday, the President tweeted: ``While I greatly appreciate the  efforts of President Xi and China to help with North Korea, it has not  worked out. At least I know China tried!''   We will wait to see if this tweet actually signals a shift in U.S.  policy--you never know with these tweets--but no doubt it is a  confession that the President's conciliatory approach toward China has  failed.   Just months after he was elected, President Trump said he was willing  to offer a better trade deal if China worked with us on North Korea-- going back on years of campaign rhetoric about getting tough on trade  with China, which is something I have fully supported and opposed,  frankly, both President Bush and President Obama for being too weak on  trade with China. When I heard that President Trump, during the  campaign, was going to be tough on China, I was glad. I thought this  was an area in which we could work together.   Yet the minute he sits down with Xi, Xi sort of wins him over, and he  says: Well, we will get something out of North Korea.   I told the President on the telephone that China will not back off  and help us with North Korea unless they feel the sting of economic  sanctions for their illicit, unfair trade practices which have robbed  millions of American jobs.   The idea that China would suddenly start to cooperate with the United  States after President Trump dropped his threats to get tough on China  was always unrealistic and misguided. China has been unwilling to  cooperate with the United States in the economic or foreign policy  spheres for decades. China puts itself first. That is what it is doing  now.   Let's not forget that millions of American workers have been hurt by  China's rapacious trading practices over the decades. Selling out those  American workers and simply hoping that China, out of its good graces,  would start working with us on North Korea never made sense.   The best approach to dealing with China is to be clear and consistent  and tough about America's foreign policy and economic interests.  President Trump, rather than going soft on trade with China, should get  tough on trade with China. That is the best way to get China to work  with us on North Korea, and it is the right thing to do for the  American worker.   I have some hope that President Trump's tweet yesterday means he has  come to this realization and will work with us to get tough on China on  trade.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
