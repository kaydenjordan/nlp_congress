 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Thompson) for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise to honor the life and the accomplishments  of Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick. He was a great and trusted colleague.  More importantly, he was a good friend, and he was my friend.   He didn't seek the spotlight; he just sought to do the right thing.   He was all about representing his district. Representing his district  put him at odds, oftentimes, with popular sentiment around here, but  Mike wasn't bothered by any of that. He was true to his convictions; he  was true to his family; and he was true to his friends.   Guys like Mike Fitzpatrick who come here, serve, and stay focused on  what is important and stay true are hard to find and even harder to  replace.    We wish God's blessing on Mike Fitzpatrick and his entire family. We  pray the Lord will fill the intolerable emptiness of his passing.   I would just like to say: We miss you, Mike Fitzpatrick, and  Godspeed.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, this resolution is insincere and unserious. It is  insincere because this is just: We don't like the President and he took  action, and we can't stand it.   It is unserious, because if they really wanted to limit the actions  of our government to defend our country and defend those in uniform,  this wouldn't be a nonbinding resolution, they would limit it. If they  want to limit it, go ahead and do it.   For the people in America that say, ``Well, we don't know this  Soleimani guy. How come we don't know him?'' That is a great question.  How come they don't know?   Well, let me introduce folks to him. He got busy with his work as a  terrorist in Beirut, killing 241 marines; the Khobar Towers, killing  Americans; hundreds of American personnel wearing uniforms dead by  EFPs, explosively formed penetrators; and thousands maimed walking  around the United States, walking around the Halls of this Congress.  That is Soleimani.   But they don't know him because this body, the executive branch,  Republicans and Democrats, have sent their young men and women to war  without dealing with this killer, this terrorist, because it was too  hard, too hard in Iraq to deal with Iran, because it might make them  mad, they might do something about it.   Our colleagues say that the President is reckless, without a plan.   Here is what is reckless: appeasement. Appeasement has gotten  Americans killed, has gotten people around the globe killed because of  this guy. What is the point of designating him a terrorist if you are  not going to do anything about it?   Doing the bidding of Iran on this floor is unacceptable. We don't  want to be in a war, that is true, nobody wants to be in a war, but I  have got a news flash for everybody: Iran slapped us in the face in  1979 and they have been fighting with us ever since.   Us saying we are not going to defend ourselves does not stop Iran  from fighting the war that they have with us. Appeasing Iran will only  kill more Americans. It hasn't worked.    That is what is happening here today, Madam Speaker: the defense of  the appeasement strategy of the last administration and administrations  in the past.   We cannot allow this strategy to continue and Americans to be killed  or Iran to have a nuclear weapon.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas.   This resolution is insincere and unserious. If my colleagues on the  other side really want to limit the President's ability to defend the  United States, then they ought to take the vote and limit him and stand  for that vote.   Now, if you are not familiar with terrorist Soleimani, let me just  acquaint you.   His reign of terror for Americans started with 241 marines in Beirut,  Lebanon. He and his organization continued on to the Khobar Towers,  hundreds and hundreds of Americans dead by IEDs and thousands maimed. A  servicemember from Pennsylvania incinerated--incinerated--in the  vehicle that he was in.   Thank you terrorist Soleimani.   The President does not desire war with Iran or anyone else, but Iran  has been fighting us since 1979.   I have got a news flash for everybody: They have been at war with the  United States since they punched us in the face in 1979.   Washington has been appeasing Iran, and the policy of appeasement has  been getting Americans killed since 1979.   542, that is the number of drone attacks under the Obama  administration in places like Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan.   Oh, by the way, not the theatre of war for the United States. Not a  peep, Madam Speaker, not a peep from the other side.   The terrorist state of Iran cannot continue killing Americans and  cannot have a nuclear bomb. Madam Speaker, it is time to stand up for  America and Americans, including this President.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for taking  the time to discuss this with the American people and allowing me to be  part of it. I saw the gentleman and I didn't want him to have to carry  the freight alone.   There was a lot to be said today, and probably neither he nor I got  to say everything we wanted to say about the proceedings over the last  couple of weeks. And it frustrates me that our colleagues, right here  in the House of the Congress will say, America assassinated General  Soleimani.   You can put a general's rank on a puppy dog, or a rabbit, or you name  it, on a car or a truck. This guy is a terrorist, no matter what he is  wearing. He is a terrorist from a terrorist state, and that is his  claim to fame. That is who he is. Responsible for the deaths of  hundreds, if not thousands of Americans, and certainly responsible for  the deaths and maiming of thousands of Americans.   And when they say, well, this President is starting a war. I wonder  to myself, my goodness, where have you been for the last 40 years?  Since 1979, right?   The gentleman knows this. Louie Gohmert knows this, right?   We were all present and watched when Iran punched America in the face  40 years ago. It hasn't stopped.   So finally, after 40 years of appeasement--and the gentleman knows  this well, because he is a great student of history.   Appeasement didn't work in World War II, right? And the results, the  results of appeasement, leading up to World War II, was the untold  deaths and untimely deaths and miserable suffering deaths of millions  of people across Europe because of appeasement.   Yet, we have tried it with Iran for 40 years. Iran is playing long  ball. People say, well, they were complying with the JCPOA and we let  them out of it. Well, of course they were complying. There was nothing  in it that stopped them from doing everything they wanted to do, which  was get to a nuclear armed program where their ballistic missile  program caught up to it, right?   So for 10 years all they had to do is not let us inspect their  military sites, because we didn't demand or require that in the deal.  They could keep on doing whatever they are doing there. Perfect their  ballistic missile capabilities so they can deliver the payload to  Israel or the United States.   Oh, and in 10 years we will have nothing to say about it because we  approved all of this. And then we have a terrorist nation that uses  terrorism as statecraft with a nuclear missile.   What is our leverage then? We have none, right? We have got another  North Korea, is what we have.   So it befuddles me that--I am sure our well-meaning colleagues on the  other side think that this is going to work. Einstein, of course, he  described the definition of insanity; it is doing the same thing over  and over and over again and expecting a different outcome.   Appeasement is dangerous. It is provocative. It encourages despots to  be despots. And so far, for 40 years, that is what we have watched.   And finally, the President gave them warning after warning. They  said, well, it wasn't warranted. We didn't have enough intelligence.   There was open source reporting. They told us what they were going to  do. Do you remember the 9/11 attacks, where there was open source  reporting? And then, after the fact, everybody said, where were the  intelligence and law enforcement agencies? Why weren't they talking?   Here, our enemy, who says they are going to kill the Great Satan and  the Little Satan--that's what they say, right?                                time  2145    They tell us what they are going to do, yet it is not enough for some  of my  [[Page H145]]  colleagues who would have then said: Mr. President, what did you know  and when did you know it? And why didn't you do something about it?   You know this, right?    You are absolutely right. There is the moral equivalency.  If we would just give the criminal, the terrorist, the murderer their  money back, it is legitimate. It is theirs. Just disregard the fact  that these are killing, murdering terrorists.   There is no moral equivalence. You don't give murdering terrorists  money, whether it is theirs or anybody else's. You throw them in jail.   These people should probably legitimately be in The Hague for crimes  against humanity, not getting their money back. Among all the things  that frustrate me, that is one of them. The other one, of course, is  this whole war powers thing.   We have had a year in this Congress, a year of escalation of Iran  attacking American targets. In November and December alone, 24 or 25  times, over two dozen times, attacking American targets, but it was  never an issue.   You know when else it wasn't an issue? The kind gentleman from Texas,  it wasn't an issue for 8 years when almost 4,000 people under the Obama  administration, terrorists, rightly were killed by drone strikes. You  know what came from the other side of the aisle regarding the War  Powers Act? Nothing.   We agree with President Obama on that. We didn't agree on many things  as Republicans with President Obama, but we agreed that eradicating  terrorists was a good thing. He did it not in the war zone of Iraq, as  approved by this Congress. He did it in Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan,  sovereign nations. The United States was going and killing people,  including American citizens, outside the combat zone, but not a peep.   Yet today, with Iran watching, with our enemies watching, today is  the day that we have to revise the War Powers Act and rein in a wayward  President because he is trying to defend the country.   The good Representative from Texas, it has nothing to do with the War  Powers Act. This resolution that is never going to go to the President  was all about campaign messaging.   It is also messaging our enemies that we are divided in this country.  We are not divided. We might be divided in this House, but we are not  divided in this country.    Will the gentleman yield?    What I have heard on this House floor today is the  President is capricious, irresponsible, doesn't have a plan, doesn't  have a strategy. If the gentleman will please tell the audience, under  the Obama administration and under Secretary Clinton, what was the  strategy in Libya?    I wasn't in Congress. I didn't have the honor to be in  Congress at that time. Maybe you were, or maybe you were more attuned  to things, but I am just wondering, at that time, without a strategy,  without a plan, firing on a sovereign nation, killing their leader.    It facilitated, yes.    So to make the correction absolutely clear, the United  States did not kill the leader of Libya, but we helped facilitate it,  in some respects.    Because if you were present, did somebody in this House  say that this President is reckless, that he is destabilizing the  region, that we are assassinating or aiding and abetting the  assassination of leaders of foreign countries? Was any of that  occurring in this House?    Will the gentleman yield?    Did we have an Authorization for Use of Military Force in  Libya?    Was Libya an American combat theater?    So when our good colleagues on the other side of the aisle  say that this was illegal and unconstitutional, meanwhile knowing that  the  [[Page H146]]  Authorization of Use of Military Force, whether we agree with it or not  it is in statute right now, in a combat theater where we are authorized  to be by that AUMF, by votes of Congress, signed by a President, with  an armed combatant who, by the way, as you probably know, is listed on  the terrorist list by the United States and others and is not supposed  to be out of Iran, his home country.    Yet, he was traveling to Syria and then through Iraq as a  combatant and as a terrorist on the terrorist list. What is the point  of putting terrorists on the list if you are not going to do anything  about the terrorist on the list?    Will the gentleman yield?    I just happened to notice on CNN about the time of the  attack that they had the spokesperson for the Iranian Government during  the hostage crisis speaking on CNN. NPR did something very similar. It  is not just Iranian Americans who are unhappy with the situation, the  propaganda not only by elected officials but by our media that is  taking up the side of the enemy that wants to destroy America. It is  disgusting.    Will the gentleman yield?    Was there a briefing? Was there a consultation from the  President to the leaders of Congress or to Congress? Was there adequate  information substantiating the imminence of an attack? Was there any of  that, or was there any human outcry that there was none of that and  then a rush to judgment on the President's authority to do that from  our good friends on the other side of the aisle?
