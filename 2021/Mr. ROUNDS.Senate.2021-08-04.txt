 Mr. President, I rise to support the Senator's motion and  the amendment. This is a case where we are trying to eliminate the  silos within the Federal Government. When it comes to cyber security,  this is a really good example of one where you have multiple Agencies  trying to work together.   This makes it very clear that it is not just a matter of discussing  or consulting but, rather, that it will be a coordinated effort. It  recognizes once again that the Department of Homeland Security and the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are taking the lead  role.   With that, I would offer my full support as well.   Thank you, Mr. President.
