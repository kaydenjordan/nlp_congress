 Mr. Speaker, today, I am here with a very heavy heart  to honor Master Sergeant Joseph Kapacziewski, a member of the 3rd  Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment.                                time  1030    Army Rangers are some of the most elite soldiers in the world, and  Master Sergeant Kapacziewski, nicknamed Kap, was no exception.   In April 2010, while serving in eastern Afghanistan, his team of Army  Rangers was locked in combat with a group of armed insurgents. When one  of his comrades was hit, Kap sprinted through the fire to provide aid.  With the help of a fellow Ranger, they dragged the wounded soldier to  safety, actions which earned Kap an Army Commendation Medal with valor.   Kap's actions would be remarkable under any conditions, but  considering his experiences from a few years earlier, they were  inconceivable.   A native of Connecticut, Kap enlisted in the United States Army  following his senior year of high school in September 2001, just days  before the 9/11 attacks. In 2002, he was deployed to Afghanistan, and  the following year, he parachuted into Iraq for the initial invasion.   With only 2 days left in his fifth deployment to Iraq in 2005, Kap's  convoy was ambushed by heavy fire. A grenade exploded inches away from  Kap after falling through the hatch of his vehicle. Shrapnel ripped  through his body, shattering his right leg and severing an artery in  his right arm.   Severely wounded, Kap collected himself, directed his vehicle to  cover, and alerted the rest of the convoy to the attack. It wasn't  until then that he allowed his wounds to be treated. Kap was evacuated  to Walter Reed Hospital, and while his arm recovered, his leg did not.   Despite numerous surgeries, his leg was barely functional.  Ultimately, there was only one choice--to amputate it. With the pain  gone, Kap was fitted with a prosthetic, and he completed hundreds of  hours of physical therapy. He had one sole objective during his  difficult and lengthy recovery: He wanted to return to combat with his  unit.   Everyone thought it would be impossible for Kap to achieve that goal.  No one under his circumstances had ever returned to combat, and they  agreed Kap had completed his service to our Nation. Kap didn't care. He  completed the 12-mile ruck march test, parachuted with a combat load,  and not only regained his squad leader title but was promoted to  platoon sergeant.   Kap became the first Ranger in United States Army history to return  to combat action with a prosthetic limb. He was awarded the Bronze Star  with valor and a Purple Heart, among numerous other decorations. Kap  was deployed to combat 11 times to fight the global war on terrorism,  five of which were while he had a prosthetic leg.   He wrote a book about it called ``Back in the Fight.''   There is more to any of our soldiers or warriors than what they do in  uniform. I have had multiple friends reach out to me who talked about  the impact that Kap had on them as a leader and as a friend, whether it  was riding motorcycles together or just hanging out after a tough day  at work, in training, or any other way. He never lost sight of how he  came to be where he was.   Unfortunately, Kap's life ended far too soon last week at the age of  40 due to a significant enemy our veterans face right here at home:  suicide.   Our Nation has a moral obligation to not only prepare and equip the  servicemembers we send into harm's way but to support and care for them  when their duty is done. Yet, we have drastically failed countless  numbers of our veterans who have sacrificed everything, including their  lives, to protect us.   President Lincoln's promise to care for the men and women who have  ``borne the battle'' is one of the most important functions of our  government, and we must do better.   Kap's wife, Kimberly, and his sons, Wyatt and Cody, as well as the  rest of his family and friends, are in my prayers through this  difficult time.   Kap will always be remembered by many for his warrior spirit and his  extraordinary story of resiliency that made him an inspiration and a  military legend.   Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of lyrics to a song one of my friends,  Darryl Worley, sings called ``The 22.''   Let me share a few of the lyrics:       You can't unsee what I saw      You can't get back what I lost      I've lost a wife      Five brothers      My kids and the man I was      I thought that I left the front lines      But the fight for my life rages on      We've lost 21 soldiers in only a day      And that's the unthinkable truth      So I'll lay down my gun      And I'll soldier on, and I will not be 22      I'll lay down my gun      I'll soldier on, and I will not be 22.    At the end of his journey, the Apostle Paul said: I fought the good  fight; I have kept the faith; and I have finished the race.   I pray that everyone would live a full and natural life, fight that  battle, and never surrender to it.   I thank you, Kap.                            ____________________
