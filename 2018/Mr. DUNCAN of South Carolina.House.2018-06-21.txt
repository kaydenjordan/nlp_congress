 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome  our guest chaplain, Reverend Dr. Alexander S. Campbell, ``Alex'' to  those who love him. He is of Christ Reformed Church in Anderson, South  Carolina.   In 2007, Dr. Campbell and his family moved from Columbia, South  Carolina, to Anderson to become the senior pastor of Christ Reformed  Church and have faithfully served the community of Anderson, South  Carolina.   Dr. Campbell received his undergraduate degree from Clemson  University--Go Tigers--in 1985, his master's of divinity from Columbia  International University in 2001, and his doctorate of ministry from  Reformed Theological Seminary in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2015. In  addition, Dr. Campbell is a chaplain in the South Carolina State Guard,  where he faithfully serves, and he is wearing his uniform today.   Dr. Campbell is married to his wonderful wife, Nancy, and has four  adult children--Zan, Meg, McBryde, and Ian--some of whom are joining us  in the gallery for this special moment.   I am proud to join Dr. Campbell on the floor of the people's House  and thank him for his service to his God, his country, and his  community. May God continue to bless him and his family, the State of  South Carolina, and the United States of America.                            ____________________
