 Mr. Speaker, I want to join Ranking Member Thornberry in  noting the passing of John Lewis. His heroism and his eloquence  challenged us all, and he will be sorely missed.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to begin by thanking Chairman Adam Smith.  Our chairman reached out to the other side and said that he wanted to  do a bipartisan bill. That sounds easy, but in this environment, it is  not. It is highly substantive. It takes negotiation. It takes a lot  more work than a partisan bill does. And he achieved that with a  unanimous vote coming out of committee. That takes compromise, but this  bill does not compromise at all for national security.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize our ranking member, who will  be retiring. I have served with him for 18 years. I have appreciated  his mentorship, and I am very glad that this bill bears his name, in  honor of his time here.   This bill also authorizes the administration's full request for the  National Nuclear Security Administration. These funds are critical to  ensuring our nuclear weapons enterprise remains safe, secure, and  effective. We have put off this investment too long; we do not have any  additional time.   Our nuclear forces are at work every day. They stand as a silent  testament to deter our adversaries and to support our allies. Without  our nuclear forces as a credible and silent deterrent, the world would  be less safe.   This bill fully funds the ground-based strategic deterrent, the  replacement for the Minuteman III. It is critical that Congress support  this effort with this funding.   The bill also provides progress for Space Force, provides stability  for the National Security Space Launch program, and makes investments  in missile defense by funding two of the Missile Defense Agency's  highest priorities, including the 10 SM-3 Block IIA and the eighth  THAAD battery.   The NDAA will provide support to the people who defend our country.  Our troops are receiving a 3 percent pay raise for the second year in a  row. This  [[Page H3323]]  bill expands the rights of men and women in uniform and their families  residing in military housing and provides more oversight over the  private companies responsible for maintaining the health and safety of  these homes.   This bill also provides remarkable strides in military justice. Over  the last decade, we made great strides in military justice.   This bill also provides protection for sexual assault victims. They  are gaining more rights on appeal, greater access to court records, and  additional protection from retaliatory punishment.   I also want to thank Congressman Anthony Brown for his work on  advancing diversity and equality in our servicemember ranks. I was very  proud to work with Congressman Brown to advance concrete steps to  promote diversity. This year's NDAA creates the position of chief  diversity officer for DOD and establishes a diversity and inclusion  advisory council. It creates more scholarship opportunities in  historically Black colleges.   The NDAA enhances our national security and improves the lives of our  servicemembers. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. Any cuts in  funding to this bill would severely weaken our Nation at a time when we  are facing some of our clearest threats.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment  because this is another one of these unilateral disarmament movement  provisions that come before this body every year.   Mr. Speaker, I would love to take a vote in this body to restrain  China, to restrain Russia, to restrain North Korea, to actually  restrain our adversaries. But instead of restraining our adversaries or  enter into negotiations where we come to agreement, we give things up.   Mr. Speaker, in this, we are giving something up. There is a  Presidential directive. This isn't even trying to undo law. There is a  Presidential directive that President Clinton signed, and every  President since him, that said that we will do very limited testing  because we do testing of our stockpiles and experimental work to ensure  the reliability and the fact that our nuclear weapon system is reliable  and safe. We do so because our adversaries see that deterrent as a  means to restrain them from their adventuresomeness across the globe.   But the other aspect--again, back to, ``I would like to restrain our  adversaries''--right now, China and Russia are developing brand-new  nuclear weapons. They are deploying hypersonic weapons. Russia has a  new nuclear-powered cruise missile that can circle the globe and then  come in.   But every year, when we bring the National Defense Authorization Act  back, we are more focused on how we can restrain ourselves than  restrain our adversaries. And that makes us less safe.   The way that this amendment is drafted actually doesn't allow us to  continue to do what we are doing. It says zero-yield standard. We  actually have subcritical testing that would exceed what you have in  here that we do right now that is essential for what we do.   This is an amendment that is trying to solve a problem that doesn't  exist.   Lisa Gordon-Hagerty just issued a letter, as you said, in June. We  are not even going to do this, I mean, not the way you are worried  about us doing it. We are not headed toward testing.   But if we pass your amendment, it is going to stop us from being able  to do what we are currently doing. We are going to restrain ourselves  in a way that our adversaries aren't, and we are going to be less safe.    Mr. Speaker, let's just be honest. This amendment does  not do anything for funding for COVID or funding for healthcare. This  is, straight and simple, defund DOD, and that is it.   We have just come off of sequestration where we saw our planes  falling out of the sky during training, where we saw our men and women  in uniform  [[Page H3375]]  working in buildings that we couldn't even repair. At my own base,  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, they didn't even have enough money to  turn the lights on in buildings that people were working in.   This is not sequestration. This is like sequestration on steroids.  This would be the biggest cut, much more than sequestration ever had.   It actually works out to about a 16 percent cut, not 10 percent,  because of the things that are exempted. So the money doesn't go where  the author says it is going to go to.   It does hurt our national security, and it does hurt our men and  women in uniform. It cuts military housing; it cuts education; it cuts  military family programs; it cuts research and development; but, most  importantly, it cuts training. It goes right to the heart of making it  unsafe once again for our men and women in uniform just to keep our  country safe.   This isn't money down the drain. This is money every day that keeps  us at peace.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciate that the advocate to  the amendment slipped into his comments that Russia cheats, because  that is why we are stepping out.   Mr. Speaker, you can't have a treaty with just yourself. You have to  have a treaty with two parties or more, and those parties have to  comply or you really don't have a treaty.   Unfortunately, though, the gentleman went on to state that no one  benefits more than the United States. It is just absolutely not true.  Very publicly, we have held hearings on this in my subcommittee. The  intelligence community and the DOD have openly stated that the  information that we receive from Open Skies is duplicative and is even  inferior to the other sources of information we have.   With respect to our allies, we don't kill this treaty by stepping  out. They can stay in. If they want to do flyovers, they can do their  own flyovers. The thing that we are not going to do is do the flyovers  for them and then hand them the information.   But what is really important about the ``yeah, Russia cheats'' is  let's talk about how Russia cheats.   Trust but verify? You can't verify if they cheat. The Kaliningrad in  Europe is one of the places where Russia hosts missiles that hold all  of our allies and the United States at risk. Russia limits overflights,  and then Russia does a really neat trick like they invade Georgia. They  declare the areas that they invade as totally new countries and then  say that we can't overfly what they are doing in these areas that they  occupy of our ally Georgia.   It is incredibly important that we step out of this treaty. They are  not complying. It does not provide benefit to us.   The other aspect that I think probably should be the most concerning  to every American listening to this, in our hearings in our committee,  the DOD absolutely states that Russia incorrectly uses this information  to target assets in the United States--target, that is right, to bomb  the United States--which is completely a violation of the treaty.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Cheney).    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, we have before us, the National Defense  Authorization Act that is proceeding as a bipartisan bill. Chairman  Smith committed himself to that, and Ranking Member Thornberry worked  diligently to make this a bipartisan bill. So you only see the  differences, as Congresswoman Cheney was saying, when you come to these  amendments.   What is unfortunate about the differences between this side and that  side of the aisle is amendment after amendment has been paraded on the  other side of the aisle that want to disarm the United States, restrain  our weapons programs, and shackle us to treaties where the other side  cheats. I would have loved to have stood here while the time for this  amendment was spent to implore Russia to stop cheating and to implore  Russia to come to the table and begin to comply with the treaties that  they have undertaken.   I would love for the time when there were discussions of amendments  on the other side to shackle our nuclear weapons programs to instead  point out that China is launching more ballistic missiles for testing  and training than the entire rest of the world combined.   I would have loved for the speakers on the other side of the aisle to  march down to the microphone and tell this country about Skyfall, the  new weapon ICBM that Russia is putting together that is nuclear powered  that can orbit the planet before it comes down and does its  devastation.   I would have loved for our adversaries to be the target of the words  from the other side and not our own programs to defend our Nation.   It is absolutely essential that we not stay in treaties that are  negative to the United States and where our adversaries are not  complying.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
