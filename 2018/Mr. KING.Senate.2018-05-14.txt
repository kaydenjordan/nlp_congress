 Will the Senator yield for a comment?    Mr. President, I join in thanking the majority leader for,  No. 1, going to see Senator McCain and, No. 2, for the comments he  made. I came here 5\1/2\ years ago and had never met John McCain, but I  have gotten to know him over that period by serving on his Armed  Services Committee and by traveling with him.   Over the weekend, I told some friends in Maine that traveling with  John McCain is like a long march with Paul McCartney. You work hard,  and everyone in the world knows it. He is an extraordinary leader and  one of the most principled people I have ever met. I was speaking to a  college graduation in far northern Maine and characterized him, almost  spontaneously, as a person whom I consider to be the greatest living  American. The audience broke into spontaneous applause because, I  think, they agreed.   I thank the Senator for the time he has taken to acknowledge this  great American today, and I join my comments with his in recognizing  one of the most extraordinary careers in American history. I thank the  Senator for his comments.
