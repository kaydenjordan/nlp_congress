 Mr. President, I rise today to share a resolution of  support for the Pledge of Allegiance as an expression of patriotism and  to honor the 246th anniversary of the creation of our U.S. flag.   Today, we celebrate Flag Day. As we pause to recognize all that our  flag represents, let us also honor those who have sacrificed everything  to defend it.   In 2002, Senator Tom Daschle raised a similar resolution with  unanimous support from the Senate. It passed on the floor uneventfully.  Today, I ask this body to reaffirm our support of the Pledge of  Allegiance.   I rise today also to honor a Hoosier who understood the innate value  of the Pledge of Allegiance to our civic education. In 1969, Red  Skelton, the American entertainer who was well known for his program  ``The Red Skelton Hour,'' wrote a speech on the importance of the  pledge. Reflecting on his time in Vincennes, IN--not many miles from  where I was born and raised in Jasper--he spoke about the values  instilled in the students by one of his high school teachers. After the  performance of the speech, CBS received 200,000 requests for copies.  The speech would go on to be sold as a single by Columbia Records and  performed at the White House for President Nixon. To honor Mr.  Skelton's memory and the importance of the pledge, I will recite his  speech today on the Senate floor.   In the words of Mr. Red Skelton, as applicable today as it was many  years ago:         When I was a small boy in Vincennes, Indiana, I heard, I       think, one of the most outstanding speeches I ever heard in       my life. I think it compares with the Sermon on the Mount,       Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, and Socrates' speech to the       students.        We had just finished reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, and       he [Mr. Lasswell, the Principal of Vincennes High School]       called us all together and he says: `[Uh] boys and girls, I       have been listening to you recite the Pledge of Allegiance       all semester, and it seems it has become monotonous to you.       Or, could it be, you do not understand the meaning of each       word?        If I may, I would like to recite the pledge and give you a       definition for each word.        I--Me; an individual; a committee of one.        Pledge--Dedicate all of my worldly good to give without       self-pity.        Allegiance--My love and my devotion.        To the Flag--Our standard. ``Old Glory''; a symbol of       courage. And wherever she waves, there is respect, because       your loyalty has given her a dignity that shouts, ``Freedom       is everybody's job.''        ``Of the United''--That means we have all come together.        States--Individual communities that have united into 48       great States; 48 individual communities with pride and       dignity and purpose; all divided by imaginary boundaries, yet       united to a common cause, and that's love of country--    And, of course, 48 States dates when that was done--   [[Page S2092]]              Of America.        And to the Republic--A Republic: a sovereign state in which       power is invested into the representatives chosen by the       people to govern; and the government is the people; and it's       from the people to the leaders, not from the leaders to the       people.        For which it stands.        One Nation--Meaning ``so blessed by God.''        Under God.        Indivisible--Incapable of being divided.        With Liberty--Which is freedom; the right of power for one       to live his own life without fears, threats, or any sort of       retaliation.        And Justice--The principle and qualities of dealing fairly       with others.        For all--For All. That means, boys and girls, it's as much       your country as it is mine.    Afterwards, Mr. Lasswell asked his students to recite the Pledge of  Allegiance together with newfound appreciation for the words.         I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of       America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation       under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.    I call upon the U.S. Senate to recommit to the meaning of these  words. This is why today, on National Flag Day, I am requesting  unanimous consent from my colleagues that my resolution expressing  support of the Pledge of Allegiance is passed.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 252, which is  at the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution  be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    I yield the floor.
