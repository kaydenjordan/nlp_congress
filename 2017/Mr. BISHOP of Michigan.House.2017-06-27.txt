 Mr. Speaker, we need to get back to the core  values that our Nation embraced 241 years ago. That is why this year I  have reintroduced my Patriot Week resolution, H. Con. Res. 12, which  creates a national week of appreciation for the brave individuals,  documents, and values that define our Nation's history to be taught in  schools and honored in workplaces across America.   Patriot Week would begin on the solemn anniversary of September 11  and end with Constitution Day on September 17.   Mr. Speaker, our founding principles have been ignored and eroded.  Society has seemingly lost interest in the longstanding history that  made our country great.   As we approach Independence Day, we must reflect on who we are as a  nation and how we can improve what is good for generations to come.  America has become too divided, and we must get back to the core values  that make our country great.   Just as immigrants learn the history of our country, high school  seniors should be able to pass, at minimum, the same citizenship exam  upon graduation. Ronald Reagan once said that ``freedom is never more  than one generation away from extinction.'' His words must serve as a  wake-up call to every one of us today.   I urge my colleagues to support Patriot Week, and I would like to  take this opportunity to wish our Nation a happy and safe Independence  Day. We are grateful for all those who serve to keep us safe at home,  in our Nation's Capital, and all over the world.                            ____________________
