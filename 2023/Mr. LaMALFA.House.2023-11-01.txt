 Mr. Speaker, a year and a half ago, Riley Gaines bravely  spoke out when she was forced to compete against a biological male, Lia  Thomas, at the 2022 NCAA swimming championships.   It is still an issue. Riley and Lia at the time tied for fifth place  in the 200-yard freestyle after Lia had won the 500-yard freestyle the  previous night.   On the podium, the NCAA handed Lia the fifth place trophy for the tie  that Lia and Riley had and gave Riley the sixth place trophy, telling  Riley she would receive her correct trophy in the mail later, not even  deciding by a coin flip or some other tiebreaker.   I remember hearing this story and being completely appalled. I was  sympathetic for Riley and for the heartbreak and disrespect she and all  of the other women and girls had who worked their whole lives to  compete at the highest level in collegiate swimming or even in high  school and lower levels.   I also remember hearing calls and rebuttals from those who  sympathized with Lia Thomas and transgender kids across the country:  Just let Lia compete. She deserves it. Transgender kids have the  highest rates of suicide. Let them play sports and they will be happy.  It is not happening often. Don't worry about it. This is just a one- time thing. This won't open the floodgates.    Unfortunately, this is not a one-time thing. This is happening often,  and the floodgates have been opened at all age ranges. In the last year  and a half, we have seen countless stories of opportunities being taken  away from young women by biological males competing in their sports,  whether it is being bumped from first place to second place or top two  or males in running events where the girls are losing out on Olympic  spots, endorsement deals, college scholarships, or even whether they  are going to make the varsity team or not. All of these tragedies for  women and girls in sports deserve outrage from all Americans.   In addition, the left has silenced young women who have stated that  they feel uncomfortable sharing locker rooms with biological males.  Instead, for the case of Lia Thomas' teammates, these young women have  been outrageously--get this--told to get counseling.   Just a few years ago, we had the #MeToo movement in which we were  told to believe all women, yet a few years later we are being told not  to believe women or even see what their feelings and thoughts are but  rather believe the biological male who believes he is a woman.   Speaking of believe all women, last week, up in Canada, a 50-year-old  biological male was allowed to participate in a swim meet with 13- to  14-year old girls because he identified as a 13-year-old girl. You  cannot make this stuff up. This 50-year-old man was able to use the  girls' locker room to change with underage young women. I cannot  express how angry this makes me and many sensible Americans and  Canadians.   Where are the adults in the room? How can any responsible adults  allow this to happen, to just blindly stand by and say: Oh, this is no  big deal?   The safety, fair competition, and happiness of these young girls  should be prioritized over this deranged 50-year-old man who somehow  believes he has the right to violate everyone else's rights for his  pathetic interest in competing against girls.   We see this other sports as well, in ring fighting and others, where  a biological male can actually do very devastating damage to a woman.   What can we do about all this? In the House, we passed H.R. 734, the  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, back in April. It passed,  unfortunately, on a party-line vote. Sadly, not one Democrat could find  the way to support and vote in keeping girls' sports for biological  females.   I am proud of the Republican Conference for making the safety,  privacy, and opportunity of women and girls in sports, and in general,  a top priority.   I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to bring this bill up for  a vote, to put your name on the line as to what you think about the  sanctity of women's sports and women's and girls' place in society in  general.   In addition, many State legislatures have since passed bills to  protect women's sports in their State. Some of their Governors even  felt the need to pass a bill titled: the Women's Bill of Rights, which  defines the word ``woman'' because of increasing numbers of challenges  as to what the words ``man'' and ``woman'' mean. Unfortunately, this is  necessary because if we do not codify the definition of sex-based  terms, laws that prohibit sex discrimination don't mean anything.   It is amazing that the media figure Matt Walsh has a film titled:  ``What is a Woman?'' that many on the left cannot even answer the  question, or they give such contorted answers in their nonanswer that  it is just pathetic. Even a Supreme Court Justice nominee had to avoid  the language. Lord, help us.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, the House Committee on Ways and  Means is marking up a comprehensive tax relief bill for disaster  survivors. My bipartisan bill, H.R. 4970, the Protect Innocent Victims  Of Taxation After Fire Act, is included as a provision.   H.R. 4970 will exempt all wildfire relief payments from Federal  income taxes and is especially time-sensitive given the recent  extension from the October 16 tax filing deadline in California until  November 16.   It is essential that Congress get this done and every Fire Victim  Trust beneficiary has this massive tax headache alleviated. Fire  victims need this tax relief to help rebuild their lives, and they  should not go through this tax season with this uncertainty about what  they are going to have to pay this year.   The initiative has been a long time coming. Indeed, the fifth year  anniversary of the Camp fire in Paradise, California, and surrounding  communities is coming up in 1 week.   In the previous term, we had a similar bill included in the  government funding package at the end of the year,  [[Page H5187]]  but it was removed by the Senate because of a disagreement on tax  policy.   The bipartisan bill is a top priority. I commend and thank my  colleague   Mike Thompson, from the wine country, in helping, and our  Ways and Means chairman, Jason Smith, in seeing it through in committee  in order to bring this relief to disaster survivors and fire victims.                            ____________________
