 Mr. Speaker, today's Resolution, falsely conflating  socialism with communism, is the latest in a long history of Republican  scare tactics about Democrats and socialism.   In 1935, Republican Representative Robert Rich said here in this  chamber, ``Roosevelt is a socialist, not a Democrat.''   In 1946, during the Truman Administration, Republican Senator Robert  Taft called a national health insurance bill ``the most socialistic  measure that this Congress has ever had before it.''   In the 1960 election, Republican Senator Barry Goldwater called the  platform of John F. Kennedy ``a blueprint for socialism.''   In 1964, when Lyndon Johnson passed Medicare, George H.W. Bush called  it ``socialized medicine.''   In 1976, Barry Goldwater claimed that Jimmy Carter would bring about  a ``suicidal slide toward socialism.''   In 1993, Newt Gingrich called the Clinton health care plan  ``socialism now or later.''   Barrack Obama was routinely called a socialist, including by three of  the Republican candidates in the 2012 election.   And several Members of this House have called Joe Biden's bipartisan  infrastructure law ``socialist.''   Having reviewed this history, it's clear that this Resolution  denouncing the horrors of ``socialism'' is an attempt by Republicans to  trap Democrats on a vote by tying them to socialism.   I neither admire nor ascribe to socialism, and the merits of this  Resolution are none, in my view. It makes no mention of the real  threats to democracy like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the  right-wing attack on the Capitol two years ago, and the challenge to  our democracy of the movements of white nationalism, election  denialism, the alt-right, and fascism.   Let's end these cynical debates about socialism and get back to the  work our constituents sent us to Washington to do.
