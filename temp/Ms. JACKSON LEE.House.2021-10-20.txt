 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to pay tribute to  Secretary Colin Powell, America's general.   Secretary Powell was more than an astute general and outstanding  civic leader who served our Nation's President. He was kind-hearted, a  genuine American hero. He was a man of conscience and integrity who  bravely stood against divisiveness and lived life bringing people  together.   As the son of two hardworking Jamaican immigrants, he knew the  importance of education and hard work. General Powell, as he prefers to  be called, was the first African-American National Security Advisor,  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Secretary of State, and he  had 35 years of service in the military for this Nation.   He described himself in a New York Times article, and he talked about  himself in the third person: ``Powell is a problem-solver. He was  taught as a soldier to solve problems. So he has views, but he is not  an ideologue. He has passion, but he is not a fanatic. He is, first and  foremost, a problem-solver.'' And that he did.   In Vietnam, he was a hero when the helicopter that he was in crashed,  and he pulled out his commander, Major General Charles M. Gettys.   Also, he was a passionate servant of the people. When he retired, he  organized America's Promise. America's Promise helped at-risk children.  I remember seeing his program, hearing about his program, and  supporting his program.   To his wonderful wife, Alma, and his children, he remains to us an  extremely beloved individual. I am reminding all Americans, let us  remember that a general can be soft and strong and remain a hero to all  of us in nature, spirit, sacrifice, and deeds.   The Nation has lost a great leader, but more importantly, the Nation  has lost a symbol of what is best and great about America.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  I am delighted to be with the gentlewoman and as well to be fighting  for what is right, and that is what we are doing here today. We are  fighting for what is right.   I am amazed when I hear people want to try to understand whether or  not we are on the floor of the House talking about a safety net or  whether we are on the floor of the House trying to create a care  economy.   Well, let me be very clear. The clearness of my point is that the  care economy is alive and well. It may be called by many names, but it  is millions of women who have in the decades--some without names, some  without categories--have been working to take care of people. They have  been layered from those, as we have heard my sisters and my colleagues  indicate, that they have been parents who were in the last stages of  life, they are working mothers who need childcare, and they are  particularly care workers themselves who don't have childcare.   So the Build Back Better Act is what you want, America.   Many people say: What is in the bill?   This is what you want. You already have gotten portions of the child  tax cut. It is a credit, but I like to call it a child tax cut. That is  in there to be continued.   And I have heard the stories from my constituents, making ends meet,  getting diapers and formula, and paying rent to be able to keep a roof  over the head of toddlers and babies of single parents, mostly women.  So we know how important the child tax credit is.   But then we talk about childcare and when we talk about kindergarten  that will be universal. These are in the early stages of life. So I am  excited.   Let me just mention one deviation, Madam Speaker. Let me just mention  one deviation, and that is that in Texas we have got a compounded  problem, people without childcare and people without healthcare because  we never opted in--I say we--the State Government never opted into the  expanded Medicaid. So we have working parents with 766,000 who are  uninsured in the State of Texas.   Can you imagine, Madam Speaker, working parents with children who  have no childcare; and they are not insured, and they have no  healthcare?   So can we ease their burden?   Can we ease their burden?   Quickly let me ease their burden and ensure that--very quickly let me  pay tribute to a school in Humble, Texas, where I met a young woman by  the name of Aquila Gillespie who runs a subsidized childcare facility  who desperately needs this childcare program which is going to allow  her working parents--they are working parents in the care industry--who  come to her with children at night, who have children who are, in fact,  in early education, meaning that they are first and second grade. She  works hard to open this school because most of the parents who enroll  them in the school cannot afford childcare. These men and women are  working people, and they work at night.                                time  1830    I stand here to join with my colleagues to say, what does America  want? They want to know that this bill is going to help them. You can  see how colorful it is, Creative Kids.   And that is Aquila. I want her to be known on television because she  did this as a young woman, a young woman who was a single parent at the  time. She hires and employs mothers and others who are in the working  class.   Let me say childcare, America, is what you will get with the Build  Back Better Act.
