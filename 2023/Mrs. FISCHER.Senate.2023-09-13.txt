 Madam President, China is on track to triple its  nuclear arsenal by 2035. Russia continues its saber-rattling in  Ukraine. North Korea is hell-bent on developing the capability to  deliver nuclear weapons at longer ranges, conducting dozens of missile  tests in this last year, and Iran is weeks away from obtaining nuclear  weapons. But on Sunday night, President Biden said, and I am quoting  him:         The only existential threat humanity faces even more       frightening than a nuclear war is global warming going above       1.5 degrees in the next . . . 10 years.    The leader of the free world believes that global warming is a bigger  threat to global security than nuclear war.   Now, I am not dismissing the importance of our climate. We should  continue to take responsible, commonsense action to address climate  change, and we should support an ``all of the above'' energy strategy.  We should promote policies to ensure that we have clean air, clean  water, and we should do that without hindering economic prosperity or  burdening hard-working Americans and their families. But the  President's claim that global warming is more frightening than nuclear  war sends the wrong signal to our adversaries and to our allies. It  demonstrates a total ignorance of the instability of today's global  threat environment.   The Strategic Forces Subcommittee, where I am ranking member,  specifically oversees our country's nuclear  [[Page S4426]]  forces, and based on the hundreds of official hearings, briefings, and  documents we have analyzed, I can tell you with all confidence that the  most frightening threat to global security today is the Chinese  Communist Party.   The CCP made it crystal clear that it wants to fundamentally alter  global deterrence dynamics. China's relentless military buildup has  outpaced anything that we could have imagined. Like I said earlier,  China wants to triple its nuclear arsenal over the next decade, and it  is well on its way to meeting that goal, if not exceeding it.   U.S. Strategic Command, or STRATCOM, is located in my home State of  Nebraska, and they confirmed earlier this year that China possesses  more intercontinental ballistic missile launchers than we do here in  the United States. China is developing a subsonic stealth bomber that  is essentially a copycat of our B-2 bomber. It is continuing work on  Jin-class submarines capable of carrying over 12 nuclear missiles at a  time.   To the people of the United States, let me say this: For the first  time in history, the United States will face two adversaries who are  peer nuclear powers--China and Russia--and that is the biggest national  security threat we face.   When the President says that climate change is more frightening than  nuclear war, he is downplaying the serious, terrifying possibility that  China puts its nuclear weapons to use.   This administration neglects our nuclear arsenal while our  adversaries, well, they prioritize theirs. This administration has done  things like try to cancel the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile Program, or  SLCM. SLCM would fill a known--a known--capability gap. It would allow  us to more effectively deter China or Russia from using a nuclear  weapon, which is part of their ``escalate to deescalate'' strategy.   Well, Congress has pushed back on the President in a bipartisan and a  bicameral way when it comes to him canceling SLCM. It is past time for  this administration to get serious about the existential threat that  China poses. The President needs to tackle this issue head-on and not  trivialize it.   One way that President Biden can do this is by signing this year's  National Defense Authorization Act. The Senate successfully passed this  year's NDAA by a significant bipartisan majority, 86 to 11. I led  provisions to accelerate the modernization of our nuclear triad--our  land-, our sea-based nuclear weapons, and our air-based ones. These  military capabilities that we have are essential to keeping adversaries  like China in check. China will be less likely to use its weapons if it  believes that we can and that we will hit back harder.   Once the NDAA gets to the President's desk, he should sign this  legislation without hesitating for a moment. Let's not put nuclear war  on the back burner. Let us step forward. Let us show China that it has  no chance against the United States of America.   I yield the floor.
