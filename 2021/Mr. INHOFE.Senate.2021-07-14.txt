 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I complete  my remarks before the vote is called.    Madam President, this is my fourth speech this year  arguing how we are going to have to match our defense resources to our  national defense strategy. And this is a reminder--this is the National  Defense Strategy. People seem to be forgetting about this. It was put  together in 2018. Here are the names of the individuals. One was a  former colleague; it was Jon Kyl. So we had 12, 6 Republicans and 6  Democrats. Everyone agreed that this is what we need to do, not just  for 2018 but for each year afterwards. For this year, for example, they  actually have in here that we should be increasing the defense budget  by between 3 and 5 percent. I show this because we all adhered to  these, Democrats and Republicans, up until this year.   This is the first time I have had a chance to talk about this budget  in the Biden administration where we now have a lot of the details  actually released in terms of the budget and what it does to our  military.   Remember, our expert, bipartisan NDS Commission Report said that we  need 3 to 5 percent real growth in the defense budget each year to  actually execute this strategy. The defense budget the Biden  administration sent us does not achieve this goal. In fact, it is  really a cut, in this administration.   Even worse, just last week, the Fed predicted that inflation next  year will be bigger than predicted. If that continues, this budget will  mean even bigger cuts than expected and will hamstring our troops even  more than we thought.   A lower defense top line than last year is just the first problem.  The details of this budget are also worse than we forecasted. We have a  flow chart here that shows that the budget puts shipbuilding on a  starvation diet. The Navy tells us that we need 355 ships, probably  more than the 400 that we have--that we are talking about right now.  Right now, we are under 300 ships, and the trend is down, not up. What  is the administration's answer? They joke around about having a 355- ship Navy with only tugboats, but we don't have the luxury of jokes.   The people don't know this out there. The people don't realize that  China is ahead of us and that Russia is ahead of us in some of these  areas. They assume that we are always like it was right after World War  II for so many years.   The Chinese Navy already has 355 ships. They already have them. That  is not something they are looking for like we are right now. We are at  300 ships and looking for 355. They already have them. Then there are  the Russians to add to that. That is another 223. So we are talking  about far more that they have right now than we have, and nobody  understands that. It is as if we have only one opposition out there,  one adversary. We don't. We have several. The two prime adversaries are  China and Russia, and they are up right now to 595 ships, and we are at  300. So what does that tell you?   I am not the only one who is concerned about this. A lot of people  say: Well, the Republicans are the only ones who are concerned about  our military.   And that is not true. Democratic Congresswoman Elaine Luria said it  well. She said: The Navy budget is not a serious budget for great power  competition.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record her recent article about the Navy's fleet   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:          [From the Texas National Security Review, June 14, 2021]      War on the Rocks--Look to the 1980s to Inform the Fleet of Today                           (By Rep. Elaine Luria)         When I was a naval officer, my ships always had a plan when       we left port for where we were going, how we would get there,       and what we would do when we arrived. While that remains true       of individual ships in the Navy, it's not true of the Navy as       a whole today. The Navy lacks a comprehensive maritime       strategy that defines what the Navy needs to do, how it needs       to do it, the resources required, and how to manage risk if       those resources aren't available. The Navy had a strategy       that did these things in the past. The maritime strategy of       the 1980s articulated a clear vision for the Navy's purpose       and how Navy leaders planned to achieve it. The nation would       be well-served by the Navy's developing such a strategy       again.        I entered the U.S. Naval Academy in 1993 and was part of a       new generation of officers who assumed the watch after the       fall of the Soviet Union. We were the beneficiaries of a       nation that had a clear and defensible maritime strategy, an       administration that provided the vision, a Congress that       funded it, and a Navy that executed it. Throughout my career,       I deployed on both the Navy's oldest and newest ships, but       they were all designed for the Cold War against the Soviet       Union.        With China, the world has seen the meteoric rise of a       maritime power that threatens U.S. and allied interests as       well as free access to the maritime common. The United States       and like-minded nations are engaged in a new great-power       competition. As the Navy focuses almost exclusively on future       capabilities, it risks overlooking the immediate threats       posed by that competition today. A Battle Force 2045 plan       does little to ensure a ready battle force in 2025. Today, no       longer in uniform, but as the vice chair of the House Armed       Services Committee, I believe the constitutional role of       Congress ``to provide and maintain a navy'' should be based       on something more than future hopes in technology and budget       expectations. We need to be prepared now for any       contingencies that may occur on our collective watch.        Understanding the 1980s Maritime Strategy During Great-Power                                Competition         In August 1982, Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. William       Small ordered the development of a document ``to connect       national strategy with defense programming.'' Developed in       just three weeks using briefing slides and speaking notes,       this document birthed the Navy's first global maritime       strategy, which was designed to inform the Navy budgeting       process.        The authors developed the briefing using then-current war       plans, contemporary directives on national defense policy,       and intelligence estimates of the Soviet threat, brought       together with Secretary of the Navy John Lehman's concept of       a 600-ship navy. Over 18 months, the briefing evolved until       it was finally signed by the chief of naval operations and       issued as the Navy's 1984 Maritime Strategy. As Lehman noted,       ``Once we had established the maritime strategy, we set about       relating and conforming everything else we did in the Navy       and Marine Corps to it.'' Because of the global reach and       strength of the strategy, the Navy's stated need for a 600-      ship fleet was defensible, and clearly tied to the numbers       and types of ships needed to win in conflict. With the full       support of the president, this strategy launched the nation       on a trajectory to a massive Navy build-up, which nearly       realized this fleet before the conclusion of the Cold War.       The strategy clearly showed why the Navy needed 600 ships and       indicated exactly where they would be deployed in global       wartime operations. Additionally--and often overlooked when       discussing the strategy--the strategy articulated the       requirement for a peacetime presence to fill deterrent roles,       reduce response times, and provide policymakers with naval       crisis-response options. One-third of the ships needed for       wartime missions in each theater would always be forward       deployed under the strategy. Ensuing force-structure       assessments have lacked this clear strategic vision for the       role of naval forces.                              Back to the Future         Lehman recently noted, ``In some previous and current       periods, naval strategy (if you could call it that) has been       derived from predicted budgets. During the 1980s, the process       was reversed: first strategy, then requirements, then the       [Program Objective Memorandum], then budget.'' The difference       between strategy preceding budget or budget preceding       strategy is the difference between going to the store with       a shopping list to make a specific meal, and going to the       store, looking in your wallet, and asking, ``What could I       buy with that?'' According to Lehman, a good strategy is a       living document  [[Page S4891]]       that must be tested, refined, and tested again. Most       importantly, however, the strategy should be simple,       logical, achievable and focus on the enemy's       vulnerabilities above all else.        The Navy's most recent strategy document, the tri-service       maritime strategy issued in December 2020 known as Advantage       at Sea, correctly acknowledges the maritime nature of the       United States as a nation whose security and prosperity       depends on the seas, and highlights the great-power       competition faced today. It acknowledges the current world       environment and gives guiding principles for prevailing in       long-term strategic competition. But this document is not a       strategy. It is a vision. One cannot design a fleet to meet       current challenges, develop a naval force structure for the       future, or create a budget input solely from a vision--these       require a global maritime strategy to fight and win against a       peer competitor, while simultaneously deterring other malign       actors.        U.S. maritime leaders need to answer the question: How       would the U.S. Navy deter or defeat Chinese naval aggression,       which may perhaps be compounded and complicated by other       states such as Russia, Iran, or North Korea acting       opportunistically while U.S. Navy forces are engaged       elsewhere? How can the U.S. Navy make a strategic difference?       Irv Blickstein served in the senior executive service in the       Navy's programming office in the 1980s. In a recent       interview, he said, ``If you look at the vision the Navy has       today, nobody quite understands what they want to do . . .       the Congress is not convinced, and they would like to better       understand what the Navy's plan is.'' As Lehman noted, ``A       critical lesson from the Maritime Strategy is that the Navy       must restore credibility with Congress and the public that it       knows what kinds of ships, aircraft, and technologies are       needed.'' What is missing is a concept of operations, broadly       stated.        Today's national security climate is different than that of       the 1980s when the United States and Soviet Union faced off       at the Cold War's apex. The Navy does not have the decades-      long at-sea experience with China that it did with the Soviet       Union after the World War II. Today, the Navy has fewer than       half the ships that it had in the 1980s. While modern U.S.       Navy forces are more capable than those of the 1980s, the       same is true of America's competitors' forces, especially       China's. In the 1980s, the F-14 program was less than a       decade old, as new programs like the F-18, Aegis, Vertical       Launch System, and Nimitz-class carriers matured. These were       state of the art platforms and systems developed to counter       specific Soviet threats and tactics. By comparison, the       platforms the Navy has today are either (like the littoral       combat ship) designed for a low-threat, post-Cold War       environment, or designed to counter the same Soviet threats       and tactics, as the Zumwalt-class destroyers are. Meanwhile,       the Chinese have designed platforms and weapons, such as the       DF-26 ``carrier killer'' missiles, to counter the heart of       the U.S. fleet.        Not only does the Navy have a problem with lagging       technology, the Navy also has a numbers problem. China is       outbuilding the U.S. Navy at a rate the United States has       been unwilling as a nation to match. Three-quarters of U.S.       surface combatants are more than a decade old, while three-      quarters of Chinese naval vessels are less than a decade old.        In addition to growing in size, China's naval forces have       grown their sea legs. Since 2009, more than three dozen       Chinese anti-piracy flotillas have deployed to the Indian       Ocean and elsewhere. These flotillas from the North, East,       and South Sea Fleets have gained nearly as much experience as       have U.S. Navy deployed strike groups over the same period.                             The Lost Generation         Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy has lost a generation of       shipbuilding to failed programs. For example, the DD-21       program office (which resulted in the Zumwalt-class       destroyer) was established in 1998. Originally scheduled for       a 32-ship production line, but pared down to just three, the       Zumwalt and her two sister ships have not deployed. One of       the game-changing weapons those ships were to use, the       electromagnetic railgun--which had been under development       since 2005--was abandoned in the Navy's current budget.       Similarly, the CVN-21 program executive office, which was set       up to produce what became the Gerald Ford-class aircraft       carrier, was established in 1996. The USS Ford has not yet       deployed.        To put this in perspective, I graduated from the U.S. Naval       Academy in 1997--between the years in which these programs       were established. I retired four years ago after a full naval       career and have since twice been elected to Congress. Yet in       all of that time, neither ship class has deployed. America       cannot afford for it to take multiple decades to design,       build, and deploy the next generation of warships.        Even new shipbuilding programs that have resulted in       deployed ships have been troubled. Multiple challenges with       the Littoral Combat Ship program have resulted in some of       those ships being slated for decommissioning only a few years       into their intended lifespan. The Constellation-class       frigates, intended to provide a more capable alternative to       the lightly armed littoral combat ship, will not be present       in the fleet in significant numbers for a decade or more.        In its Fiscal Year 2022 budget request the Navy proposes       decommissioning almost twice the number of ships it plans to       build this year. Among the ships the Navy wants to retire are       seven cruisers, some of which were only recently modernized       at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. The Navy has       argued that the maintenance costs on these decades-old ships       would be better spent on new, modern programs and       capabilities. This is one example of the broader ``divest to       invest'' strategy reflected in this year's budget, which does       not instill confidence in the likelihood of fielding a       capable fleet in a timely manner. Just as the planned railgun       in the Zumwalt class did not come to fruition, history shows       that reliance on hopes and dreams for ``game-changers'' is a       poor substitute for forces and strategy.        With flat or reduced budgets, the Navy has no good options.       It can sacrifice readiness, sacrifice research and       development, or sacrifice fleet size. Those are the Navy's       only options--and they are all bad. I empathize with the       position that Navy leadership finds themselves in today, as       they have inherited a scenario created by decades of their       predecessors' failed shipbuilding efforts--a scenario that       has no real solution without the commitment of significant       additional resources. Regardless of administration, the       United States has been unwilling as a nation to prioritize       shipbuilding, much to its eventual detriment with regard to       Chinese aggression and control of the maritime commons. China       isn't waiting until 2045 to realize its fleet. Neither should       the United States. America needs a ready Navy that can       credibly deter a potential conflict with a confident and       overwhelming opponent.'                           A New Maritime Strategy         For the past three years--in numerous hearings and through       information requests--I have sought to determine the Navy's       current global maritime strategy. What I have discovered is       that it does not exist. There is not a clear plan similar to       the 1984 Maritime Strategy that can inform and clearly       articulate the fleet needed today to deter Chinese       aggression, fight and win a war with China if required, and       also employ naval forces globally in response to other malign       actors such as Russia, Iran, and North Korea. I have heard       many buzzwords, acronyms, and platitudes, but as naval       strategist Sir Julian Corbett said, ``Nothing is so dangerous       in the study of war as to permit maxims to become a       substitute for judgement.''        Former Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Madly confirmed       as much to me when we spoke recently. According to him, We've       had oscillating and unrealistic shipbuilding goals, and a       variety of operational warfighting plans designed for fairly       static contingencies. Neither of these have been the       byproducts of a coherent national maritime strategy that       addresses our biggest threats, the broader geographies we       must protect, or the unpredictable nature of the future. The       national maritime strategy we need today must be an agile one       that allows for rapid development and adaptation. The force       structure it defines should also have the same       characteristics. The strategy must be developed with a sober       look at our adversaries and global responsibilities. Further,       it must be implemented with a national consensus because such       implementation, without a doubt, will be costly to the       taxpayers.        The United States needs a Navy capable of maintaining       maritime superiority and preserving free trade and freedom of       the seas for America and its allies and partners. The Navy       immediately should develop a bold global maritime strategy,       which will clearly define the fleet required today. This       global strategy should focus on Chinese vulnerabilities, of       which there are many, including dependence on access to       shipping lanes to fuel their economy. The U.S. Navy should be       ready to target critical mainland infrastructure and close       maritime chokepoints to strangle the Chinese economy.       American forces should be agile and unpredictable, using       geography to their advantage with mobile capabilities. This       type of strategy will require a larger Navy in concert with       the other services. Day to day, the U.S. Navy should be       present in the East and South China Seas, exercising with       allied navies, testing the strategy, and refining it. From       this new maritime strategy will flow an informed force       structure that will compellingly spell out to lawmakers and       the American public the essential and urgent need to invest       in a larger Navy to deter Chinese aggression and hold at bay       other malign actors who may seek to take advantage of any       future conflict in the Pacific. As Lehman notes in discussing       the development of the 1984 Maritime Strategy, 90 percent of       the deterrent power of this buildup could be achieved in the       first year. This was done by publicly declaring and       explaining the strategy, especially its naval component, and       taking actions that left no doubt among friend and foe that       it would be achieved. Those actions included [the need] to       submit a revised Defense budget to Congress that fully funded       the buildup.        Today, U.S. Navy leadership should heed the words of       Lehman: ``First strategy, then requirements, then the POM,       then budget.'' The global situation and America's competitors       and adversaries may have evolved, but the process by which       the U.S. Navy designs and builds the fleet should take a       valuable lesson from the 1980s. If the United States is to       remain a global power, it needs a Navy fit for the purpose       and the United States, as a nation, needs to make the       commitment to prioritize national defense and make this       investment.  [[Page S4892]]         This budget also fails to make any progress in a growing  or modernizing Air Force. Instead, the Biden budget procurement  actually decreases by almost 15 percent across the entire military. The  Air Force is 20 percent. President Biden's own nominee for the  Secretary of the Air Force told us that one of the best things that we  could do is to accelerate the buying of additional F-35s, but this  budget doesn't do that. The fleet just gets older and smaller.   Perhaps the greatest casualty of the Biden budget is the Army. I  guess I am used to that by now. I was a product of the Army, and all my  Army friends remember what happened back in 1994. I was in the House at  that time and on the House Armed Services Committee. At that time, I  can remember when someone who was in a hearing--an expert--predicted  that, in 10 years, we would no longer need ground troops. Of course, we  know what has happened since that time. The greatest casualty is always  the Army. Instead of investing, it deeply cuts the Army across the  board in its modernization, procurement, force structure, and  readiness.   I can't understand why we decreased full spectrum training just as we  have started to get healthy after the readiness crisis of 2017, and we  all remember what happened in 2017. That was the last 5 years of the  Obama administration, and they were the years that cut our military  substantially. They actually did reduce our budget in the last 5 years  by 25 percent, the military budget. At the same time, China was  increasing theirs by 78 percent. This is the problem that we had back  then, and it is still going on.   Don't take my word for it. General McConville told us last week that  most of the Army's weapons systems are 1980s vintage. Yet the Biden  administration is slow-walking the Army's modernization efforts while  our adversaries are relentlessly advancing--and they are. Secretary  Wormuth, who is the Secretary of the Army, said the service is still  under stress in some areas, including defense, which is a critical  priority, and that is unacceptable.   Additionally, while Secretary Austin kept his promise to fully fund  nuclear modernization, this is an area I can't blame anybody for  because this has been going on for a long period of time, since after  World War II, that being that our nuclear modernization program has not  been substantial. Others have been catching up with us slowly but  surely, and that is where we are today. So he kept his word. His  promise was to fully fund nuclear modernization.   I remain concerned about the $600 million cut in the NNSA's deferred  maintenance budget. Now, with the NNSA, we are talking about nuclear  now, our nuclear capabilities. It would have fixed crumbling  infrastructure that is necessary to keep the nuclear weapons program on  track.   Now, you can't see this very well, but when you look closely, it is  worth coming up to look. We see some of the oldest equipment here, and  it is obvious just by looking at it that it doesn't work. So not only  are other countries catching up and passing us, but our equipment has  not been modernized. That is what we were going to do, and this is what  Secretary Austin wants to do, but we have not been able to pay for it  yet. We have to get that done. It would have fixed crumbling  infrastructure that is necessary to keep nuclear weapons on track.   The reality of this budget cut is on display in the unfunded  priorities list that was put together by military services and the  combatant commanders. No one knows more than the combatant commanders  about our state of readiness. In total, we are looking at $25 billion  in key equipment weapons--and more that our services could use--but  this budget can't support it.   Many people call these wish lists. I call them risk lists. The reason  we don't hear a lot about people who are talking about the risks, the  military people, is that ``risk'' means lives. When military people  talk about risk, they talk about losing lives. People don't like to  talk about that, but we are now in the position whereby we have to talk  about it. We can only kick the can down the road so far, generating  more and more risk. We don't talk about risk. We never do. We just  demand that our military do more with less. We keep divesting, but the  investments never follow. This trend of increased risk has only  accelerated. It is already clear that the administration is signaling  they want to cut the military even deeper next year.   Earlier this month, I read in the press about a memo by the Acting  Secretary of the Navy as he tried to minimize the damage and risk of  his sailors resulting from the significant budget cuts. He was very  sincere about this. He said the Navy is forced to choose between  modernizing ships, subs, and aircraft. Does anyone in here believe that  the Chinese are choosing between ships, subs, and aircraft?   Recently, our Nation's highest ranking military officer, General  Milley, told us that the Chinese and Russians combined actually spend  more than we on defense. Now, think about that for a minute. You don't  hear that. Nobody is talking about this. We have been told for so many  years that we don't need to spend more on defense because we already  spend more than our competitors. It turns out that this is just not  true, and the American people are not aware of this.   Now, part of the difference is that the Chinese and the Russians  don't take care of their people. I have talked a lot about the fact  that we don't do that. Do you remember all of the housing problems that  we were all concerned about? Are we spending enough on housing for our  people? Communist countries don't care about that. They just give them  the guns and say: Go out and kill people. They don't care about people.  The greatest expense that we have in supporting the military is the  expense that we have for housing and for the quality of life of our  troops.   By the way, I am drawing out a couple of Democrats when I talk about  the problem and the fact that this is a concern. It is not just a  concern of the Republicans. These are Democratic Members, and they are  concerned. Democratic Congressman Anthony Brown made this point  recently, and I agree with him.   He wrote:         We spend $1 billion more on Medicare in the defense budget       than we do on new tactical vehicles. We spend more on the       Defense Health Program than we do on new ships.    Now, that came from a Democratic Member of the House.   He concluded:         In total, some $200 billion in the defense budget are       essentially for nondefense purposes--from salaries to health       care to basic research.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record Congressman Brown's article because I think it gets it exactly  right, and this is coming from the other side   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From Defense News, May 14, 2021]                    The Case for a Robust Defense Budget                          (By Rep. Anthony Brown)         The United States is confronting a multitude of complex       domestic and global challenges brought about by the COVID-19       pandemic (https://www.defensenews.com/coronavirus/),       disruptive technologies, severe weather events (https:// www.defensenews.com/smr/energy-andenvironment/), systemic       racism, and great power competition with China and Russia.       Now more than ever, Congress has a responsibility to ensure       that we robustly fund our national security, even as the cost       of doing so rises every year.        We maintain our national security not only by the military       dollars we spend, but also by the resources we dedicate to       international diplomacy and development, and the investments       we make at home in infrastructure and education, in climate       change mitigation, and in health care, public safety and our       democratic institutions.        With ample defense and nondefense spending, we are better       able to secure our nation, revitalize our economy, defeat the       pandemic and restore U.S. global leadership.        The American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan are       bold initiatives that will strengthen our nation. They       comprise long-overdue investments in infrastructure,       innovation and our workforce, and they meet the equitable       needs of our children and families. They promote American       competitiveness and security. Yet, we should not       irresponsibly cut defense spending as a way to offset the       costs of these necessary investments. We cannot ``rob Peter       to pay Paul.''        We need a well-funded military because we ask the men and       women in our armed forces to do more today than ever before.        Our military deters aggression from China and Russia. China       seeks to exert more control over trade and resources (https:/      /microsites-livebackend.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/      conflict/territorial-disputes-  [[Page S4893]]       south-china-sea) in the Pacific and to challenge the security       of our critical infrastructure (https://www.C4isrnet.com/       critical-infrastructure/ 2019/11/ 22/how-the-fccs-new-ban-on-      huawei-benefits-the-miltary/) while investing (https:// media.defense.gov/2020/Sep/01/2002488689/-1/-1/1/2020-DOD- CHINA-MILITARY-POWER-REPORT-FINAL.PDF) significantly in its       military. Russia threatens (https://www.militarytimes.com/ flashpoints/2021/04/22/russia-orders-troop-pullback-but- keeps-weapons-near-ukraine/) our European partners and       allies, increasingly tests (https://www.airforcetimes.com/ news/your-air-force/2021/04/28/spike-in-russian- aircraftintercepts-straining-air-force-crews-in-alaska-three- star-says/) the boundaries of our air defenses and interferes       (https://www.npr.org/2021/03/16/977958302/intelligence- report-russia-tried-to-help-trump-in-2020-election) in our       elections.        Our armed forces defend the homeland against threats from       North Korea, which has tested missiles (https:// missilethreat.csis.org/country/dprk/) capable of striking our       capital, and Iran, which funds terrorism in the Middle East       and attacks our institutions through cyber operations       (https://www.csis.org/programs/technology-policy-program/ publicly-reported-iranian-cyber-actions-2019). And through it       all, our military maintains watch against terrorism.        The threats are real and increasing, and we must rise to       meet these challenges--not simply because we have an interest       in our own security and the international order, but because       the United States has a greater interest than any other       nation.        While we are less than 5 percent of the world's population,       we generate 20 percent (https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/economy-  trade) of global economic production. We are the leader in       international trade, with over $5 trillion in commerce       crossing our borders annually, including smartphones, cars       and the medicines that we need.        Securing the global economy on which we rely demands that       we field an expeditionary force capable of deploying to where       it is needed most. Whether securing the 60 percent (https:// chinapower.csis.org/much-trade-transits-south-china-sea/) of       maritime trade transiting the Indo-Pacific region, or       partnering in Africa to provide security for development, or       checking Russia's Arctic expansionism (https:// www.defensenews.com/smr/frozenpathways/2021/04/12/russian- military-buildup-in-the-arctic-has-northern-nato-members-  uneasy/) for newly accessible resources, our military must be       able to operate anywhere and everywhere around the world.        Success in these varied regions and missions requires us to       train and equip our forces to prevail over any adversary,       both in competition and in conflict. It means investing in       fighter jets that can counter Russian advanced aircraft and       developing submarines to avoid detection by Chinese sensors;       modernizing our Army so soldiers have 21st century technology       to fight and survive; and ensuring sufficient troop levels to       limit back-to-back deployments so our military has time at       home with family to maintain morale and readiness (https:// www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2020/o2/14/why_we_ should_grow_the_active_duty_army_115042.html). Having a       global force that is ready and lethal provides the necessary       presence to deter war and maintain peace in the global       commons.        At the center of this worldwide mission are the men and       women who serve.        Two million service members and civilians devote their       lives to our defense, and the Pentagon's budget funds the       everyday needs for them and their families: health care to 10       million Americans (https://health.mil/News/Gallery/ Infographics/2017/05/01/MHS-Facts-and-Figures), child care       for 200,000 children (https://crsreports.congress.gov/  product/pdf/R/R45288/7), retirement for 1.5 million veterans       (https://media.defense.gov/2019/May/14/2002131753/-1/-1/o/ MRS_STATRPT_2018%20V5.PDF#page=7) and K-12 education in       about 160 schools (https://www.dodea.edu/aboutdodea/ demographics.cfm) worldwide.        The benefits of defense spending reach beyond the military       and our contribution to the international order, returning       the investment through domestic dividends. During Hurricane       Katrina, the National Guard rescued over 17,000 people and       airlifted almost 22 million pounds (https:// www.nationalguard.mil/Features/2015/Remembering-Hurricane-  Katrina/) of cargo to the flooded areas. The Pentagon's $8       billion annual spend on research invigorates our academic and       tech sectors, resulting in technologies like GPS and Google       Maps, which were first invented by Navy scientists. Defense       innovations like radar are now in civilian use, and they       power the weather stations that detect increasingly severe       storms amid climate change. And the internet, the backbone of       the global economy, began as a Defense Department program.        We spend $1 billion more on Medicare in the defense budget       than we do on new tactical vehicles. We spend more on the       Defense Health Program than we do on new ships. In total,       some $200 billion in the defense budget are essentially for       nondefense purposes--from salaries to health care to basic       research.        In no place are these domestic benefits of defense spending       clearer than in the current pandemic. The Moderna vaccine,       developed in record time, was originally seeded by a Defense       Advanced Research Projects Agency investment in 2013, and a       subsequent Pentagon request to rapidly produce a human ready       antibody contributed to the delivery of multiple vaccines in       under a year. And 50,000 National Guard members are assisting       (https:/ /www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/covid-vaccination-crisis- national-guard-is-being-mobilized.html) in coronavirus       testing and vaccinations across the country, strengthening       our nation against a grave threat to our collective health.        We should neither view the nondefense and defense budgets       as opposite sides of the same coin, nor accept them as a       false choice between two competing options.        This nation was founded to form a more perfect Union, and       in doing so to provide for the common defense and promote the       general welfare. For 233 years, Congress has endeavored to       balance these responsibilities, and in doing so has often       found a way to secure our democracy and freedoms while at the       same time investing in America as the land of opportunity. It       is imperative that we in Congress meet these challenges and       fulfill our responsibilities.        Our national security depends on it.    We can disagree sometimes about how we compete with China  on nondefense areas. It is important. That is an important debate. We  want to do that, but we have to be on the same page when it comes to  national security.   Some people would say that my criticism of cutting the military is  because President Biden is a Democrat. I want to be really clear that  this is not about politics; it is about protecting this Nation and  making sure our men and women in uniform have the training and the  resources and the equipment they need to compete and complete their  missions and come home safely. I mean, this is what we are supposed to  be doing, and that is what we are doing.   I told President Trump, back when he sent his initial budget up when  he became President of the United States, that it was not adequate at  that time. I called up Secretary Mattis, and we met the President at  the White House. We showed him why it was inadequate, and it was  inadequate. So we were able to get something done at that time, and  that is something that we are concerned about today.   I happen to think President Trump wanted to spend even more on his  troops, but I think he got some bad advice from his advisers. I think  the same is true with President Biden. I think he wants a strong  military when he is up against our adversaries. I know this President  believes that a strong military underpins all of our other tools and  national power, including diplomatic efforts. I know the President  believes in America's role in the world and in the value of deterrence.  I know the President believes in the importance of our allies and the  partners who look to us for commitments and for investments to know  that we are very serious. Our President knows that. President Biden  knows this, but we don't have the budget to support it.   The President needs to be coming forth with adequate budgets to take  care of the problems that we are faced with today. We all know how  painful Obama's readiness crisis was as flight training hours were  slashed, and we didn't know all of the things that happened during the  last 5 years of his administration. This administration should remember  how dangerous that was not just for our deterrence but also because  there was a human cost. That is one of many reasons I am struggling to  understand the administration's cuts to the defense budget.   One thing we have been told is that anything more than this defense  budget is just not affordable. We have been told by the Pentagon that  we have to live more fiscally. That is one way to tell the military  that you don't care about them. This administration wants to spend  trillions in taxpayers' dollars on everything you can think of except  on the military, and this comes through very clearly when the amount of  increase they are having right now is between 16 and 20 percent and  ours is 1.6 percent.   In reality, the investments we need to strengthen our military in the  decades to come are minimal when compared to overall Federal budgeting.  Defense spending compared to our GDP is half of what it was in the Cold  War, and we live in a much more dangerous world now. We have been told  that the Pentagon must make hard choices as if hard choices are a  substitute for strategy-based budgeting. Yet we are not making hard  choices; we are just making bad choices.   All of our current military and senior DOD officials agree that we  have a  [[Page S4894]]  good military strategy for China and Russia, but the budget doesn't  support that strategy. As a result, I am worried that deterrence will  fail maybe today or maybe 5 years from now, and when it does, the cost  will be much higher than any investment we would make today.   We have made a sacred compact with our servicemembers. We tell them  that we will take care of them and take care of their families. We do  that very well, but we also tell them that we will give them the tools  to defend the Nation and to come home safely, but we are not holding up  that end of the bargain. With this proposed budget and the prospects of  further cuts, we are failing to give them the resources they need.   We can't simply spend our way out of our military problems, but we  can spend too little to give ourselves a chance. We have seen the high  cost of underinvesting in the military. Underfunding in the military  tempts our adversaries, raises doubts in our allies, and makes war  more, not less, likely.   So we need to make a generational investment in our defenses so that  our children and grandchildren don't have to, and we are not doing that  now.   We have a lot of impatient people right now who want to vote.   I yield the floor.
