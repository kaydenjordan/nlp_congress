 Mr. President, I move to discharge the Committee on Foreign  Relations from further consideration of S.J. Res. 35, a joint  resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the proposed  foreign military sales to the Government of Egypt of certain defense  articles and services.    Mr. President, according to tradition, King Menes united  the two lands of Europe about 5,000 years ago. Although Egypt appears  today as a single state on the globe, American foreign policy still  treats the country as if it were two completely different lands--one a  critical ally of American aid and one a tyrannical nightmare unworthy  of American security assistance.   A State Department human rights report details how General  Abdelfattah Elsisi converted a country into a prison. Among other  horrors, Egyptian security forces engage in extrajudicial killings,  torture, as well as harsh crackdowns on anyone who wishes to practice  the right of freedom of speech.   As a result of Egypt's abysmal human rights record, the Biden  administration recently blocked $130 million in annual security  assistance. At first glance, that might sound like a rebuke to Egypt.  Before applauding this supposedly principled act in solidarity with the  long-suffering Egyptian people, keep in mind that in the same week, the  State Department--the Biden State Department--approved a military sale  of Super Hercules aircraft, which are used to airdrop troops and  military equipment, to the Elsisi regime for $2.2 billion. On the one  hand, they blocked $130 million; on the other hand, they approved $2.2  billion.   In what may be only described by definition as a slap on the wrist,  the $130 million the State Department blocked is only one-tenth of the  annual $1.3 billion the United States has given to Egypt every year  since 1987. In fact, Egypt is one of the largest recipients of U.S.  military aid.   If the State Department strictly adhered to Federal Leahy laws, it  would insist that Egypt abandon its despotic ways before Egypt received  any more security assistance. This law was named after our colleague  Senator Patrick Leahy. These laws compel the United States to withhold  security assistance to countries that have committed gross violations  of human rights.   The Biden administration should strictly enforce the Leahy laws and  deny Egypt the American dollars it craves until it becomes a place  where human rights are honored and respected. Instead, as punishment  for their crimes, the ruling class of Egypt will somehow, some way,  have to make due with only 90 percent of what they annually expect in  largesse from the American taxpayer. Adjusting for inflation, the  decades-long transfer of wealth from America to Egypt amounts to over  $41 billion. Of the $41 billion, some estimate that the previous  President, Hosni Mubarak, and his family stole nearly half. The aid not  stolen is used by Egypt to buy American weaponry.   Since 2009, the United States has sold Egypt $3.2 billion in fighter  aircraft,  [[Page S1094]]  $1.3 billion in tanks and armored vehicles, $750 million in missiles,  $36 million in ammunition, and $328 million in military technology, as  well as $240 million in naval craft. As the United States prepares for  yet another military sale, perhaps we should review how one of our most  reliable customers treats their own people.   Human Rights Watch reports that ``Egypt's security apparatus has  arbitrarily arrested and prosecuted tens of thousands of persons'' and  that ``torture crimes against detainees in Egypt are systematic,  widespread, and likely constitute crimes against humanity.''   One such victim of torture is known as Hamza. He was arrested at his  home late one night for the crime of participating in a public  demonstration. Despite tireless attempts to track him down, his family  was unable to locate him for months. Later, it was revealed that the  officers who captured him--the officers of the government of Elsisi-- used electric shocks on his genitals, his head, and his tongue. But  even that was not enough for Elsisi's henchmen, who later suspended  Hamza from his arms until his arms were dislocated at the shoulder.   As a physician, I have treated patients who have dislocated  shoulders. It is a very painful injury. Imagine being hauled up by your  own government, suspended by your arms until your shoulders are  dislocated, and then when they finally cut him down, they left him on  the floor without medical treatment for 3 winter days without any  blankets.   Such torture would be virtually unbearable for any man. Hamza was not  even yet a man; he was a 14-year-old boy at the time of his torture and  arrest.   Hamza is not alone. The stories of other victims appear in Human  Rights Watch's 43-page report detailing Egypt's systemic torture of  children, including a victim as young as 12 years old.   In Egypt, journalism--journalism--is a dangerous profession. The  Committee to Protect Journalists ranks Egypt the third worst jailer of  journalists in the world behind only China and Myanmar.   Take just a few examples. When a 26-year-old man died in police  custody, a prominent Egyptian journalist, Islam el-Kahly, was arrested  for covering and reporting on the detainee's death. He is only one of  many well-known journalists to be imprisoned for the crime of keeping  his people informed.   Photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid was arrested in 2013 for covering  the violent break up of a sit-in protest--a peaceful sit-in protest--in  Cairo. Zeid was released after 5 years in prison, but he is still not  free. He is required to report to the police station at 6 p.m. every  night, where it is unknown whether the officer on duty will keep him or  not, whether he will be imprisoned every night of his life.   Perhaps no activity is more dangerous than running for Egypt's  Presidency. General Elsisi was reelected--if you can call it an  election--in 2018 with 97 percent of the vote, whose Soviet-style  results were made possible only after opposition candidates were  effectively eliminated.   Two candidates, Sami Anan and Ahmed Konsowa, were imprisoned. A third  candidate to run against Elsisi, Ahmed Shafik, was placed under house  arrest. A senior staffer to one of the candidates, Hisham Geneina, was  brutally attacked by three men, resulting in serious damage to his left  eye and orbital bones. When another candidate, Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat,  withdrew from the race, he said: ``It's like committing suicide to run  against someone like this.''   President Biden pledged to put human rights at the ``center of our  foreign policy.'' Torture of children, arbitrary arrests of dissidents  and journalists, sham elections, and the violent crushing of peaceful  opposition--if these are not gross violations of human rights, nothing  is.   The United States cannot proudly proclaim human rights to be the  center of our foreign policy while it arms a regime that has a war  against its own people. We should end military sales to Egypt's  criminal masters. Partially taking away some military aid while  offering new sales that are 10 times what we withheld shows weakness in  the face of repression.   Our weapons are an incredibly important part of America's power, and  we should not willy-nilly and without judgment give them to anybody and  everybody around the world. They could be used as leverage for  improving human rights. Instead, we just give them, and there is this  vicious cycle of enriching those who produce the munitions and no  concern for human rights.   Mere slaps on the wrists cannot hide the inescapable fact that the  United States has handsomely rewarded Egypt as it degenerated into one  of the most autocratic places on the globe. America should in no  uncertain terms demonstrate we will no longer strengthen a strongman.   My resolution is to cancel military sales. It offers a choice-- whether the United States will side with the Egyptian people or with  their oppressors.    Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the  small business, Burchett's Heating and Cooling of Paintsville, KY, as  the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Rogell Burchett had a keen eye for business opportunities, which is  why he opened Burchett's Heating and Cooling in 1978. As a gas company  employee, he could not ignore all the new homes being built in his area  when he knew there was little market for natural gas and furnace  installations. So he started what was then a side venture called  Burchett's Heating and Cooling. Rogell's vision and dedication allowed  [[Page S1115]]  that side venture to grow into a family business, now entering into its  third generation of management.   When the business was first founded, Burchett's operations mainly  involved natural gas and furnace work. However, as Kentucky saw the  coal industry abate, Burchett's Heating and Cooling adapted to include  more geothermal work, as well as some light commercial work. Clearly,  Rogell passed his sharp intuition for running a business along to his  children and grandchildren, as this transition took place over multiple  generations. Growing into what his father created, Neal Burchett took  over the business when his father Rogell retired. Later on, Neal's son  Ryan Burchett would also become part of the operation, serving as the  management arm of this family-owned business. Together, these three  generations of Burchett men have kept Paintsville warm during the cold  Kentucky winters and cool in the summers, with the comfort of  Paintsville citizens remaining their top priority.   With over 40 years of experience, Burchett's Heating and Cooling  maintains close relationships with customers that count on them for  quality, year after year. Of course, when the business stays in the  family as it has with the Burchett men, it is easy to see how the  community of Paintsville could place their trust in their services.  That being said, Burchett's Heating and Cooling remains an active  member of the Paintsville community outside of their normal business  operations. Staying true to their family-owned nature, the business  sponsors the local high school basketball and football teams, teams  that both Neal and Ryan used to play for during their high school  years. Burchett's Heating and Cooling also provides free services to  their local church so that parishioners can worship comfortably.   Small businesses like Burchett's Heating and Cooling are the  lifeblood of small towns across Kentucky, and they serve as an  inspiring example of how the entrepreneurial spirit transcends multiple  generations. Congratulations to Neal and Ryan and the entire Burchett's  Heating and Cooling team. I wish them the best of luck and look forward  to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  interns in my office be granted floor privileges until May 20, 2022:  Jacob Custer, Mia Kuchner, Wilson Beaver, and Pedro Rodriguez.
