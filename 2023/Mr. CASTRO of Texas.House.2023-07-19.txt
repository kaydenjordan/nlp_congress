 Mr. Chairman, I urge this Congress to support  amendment No. 71 to H.R. 3935.   My city of San Antonio is known as Military City USA. It is home to  tens of thousands of soldiers, airmen, intelligence professionals, and  cybersecurity experts who need direct access to Washington, D.C.   I hope that Members will support this amendment and support our  airmen and our soldiers and support national security.
