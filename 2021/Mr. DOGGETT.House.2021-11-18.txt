 Madam Speaker, this bill offers childcare; educational  opportunities from pre-K to post-grad; and the first belated,  substantial response to the climate crisis. My top healthcare priority  is providing assistance to 2 million Texans out of 6 million Americans  who were denied healthcare by sorry Republican Governors. Families left  out and left behind can finally see a family physician. From my bill to  strengthen Medicare, we at least cover hearing care, which is important  to reducing depression and dementia.   Had we overcome Big Pharma's stranglehold over this Congress, we  could have delivered much more. Savings from meaningful drug price  negotiations could have financed vision and dental. Without further  Biden administration action though, most Americans will still be  victims of prescription price gouging.   While so much remains to be done, this historic legislation offers  real hope and opportunity, reducing inequities and lifting up those too  often forgotten.
