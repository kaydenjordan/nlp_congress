 Madam President, this week, the Senate is going to take  up three Ninth Circuit judges, three Federal judges for the U.S. Court  of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.   And in the process, the Biden administration is going to smash an  institutional and constitutional norm between the executive and  legislative branches, particularly the executive branch, the White  House, and the U.S. Senate that every U.S. Senator--all 100 of us-- should be concerned about.   Let me explain. This is a really important issue.   Article II, section 2, of the U.S. Constitution says the following:         [The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice       and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two       thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate,       and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall       appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls,       Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the       United States.    Now, that includes Federal circuit court judges,   Throughout this, article II, section 2, provision of the  Constitution, it says: ``[W]ith the Advice and Consent of the Senate.''  We are ``of the Senate,'' right here. And this week, we will be voting  on three U.S. court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit.   Now, this provision in the Constitution, like so many which gives the  U.S. Senate the exclusive right for the advice and consent power, was  the result of compromise.   If you look at the history in Federalist Nos. 75 and 76, Alexander  Hamilton argued that this provision afforded a necessary means of  checks and balances against the executive branch, against the  President.   The Constitution--according to the U.S. Senate history that I am  quoting from--``also provides that the Senate shall have the power to  accept or reject  [[Page S9108]]  presidential appointees to the executive and judicial branches.''   This was born of compromise, as I mentioned:         In debating the issue, the framers addressed concerns that       entrusting the appointment power exclusively to the president       would encourage monarchial tendencies. Additionally, as the       Senate was to represent each state equally, its role--    The advice and consent role in the Constitution--       --offered security to the small states, whose delegates       feared they would be overwhelmed by appointees sympathetic to       larger states.    For these reasons, since I have been in the U.S. Senate, I have taken  this advice and consent role very seriously for all nominees: during  the Obama administration, when I was here for the last 2 years of that  administration; all of the Trump administration; and now the Biden  administration.   And as you can imagine, whenever I have asked for a meeting of any  nominee so I could meet with them under this constitutional provision  for a Senate-confirmed position, every single administration I have  dealt with--the three I just named--has said: Of course, Senator. That  is your constitutional role. Of course you should meet with them.   Why is that? Why has every White House said yes?   Because, as I just mentioned, they know that that is literally our  constitutional role, as I just mentioned.   So every time I have asked for one of these meetings for a Senate- confirmed nominee of any administration, it has always been granted,  until today--until today.   As I said, the Senate's business--a lot of the business this week is  actually going to be focused on the advice and consent constitutional  role that we have, especially as it relates to judges.   But I have been told by this White House, specifically the White  House Counsel, I guess--to be honest, it is often difficult to figure  out who is in charge over there--that I can't meet with any of these  Ninth Circuit judges that we are going to vote on this week before the  vote.   This is a shocking breach of constitutional norms between the White  House and the Senate that every Senator here--every Senator, regardless  of party--should be concerned about.   Why?   As I mentioned, the advice and consent role is really important for  every Senate-confirmed position, mandated by the U.S. Constitution, but  it is particularly important for judges--judges who will get life  tenure. By the end of this week, it is likely that these three Ninth  Circuit judges will be on the bench for the rest of their lives, and  right now I can't get a 1-hour meeting with them.   They have enormous power over American citizens. And I am going to  talk about the Ninth Circuit and the power it has over my citizens.   So my experience as a Senator is that I meet with as many judges as  possible, and whenever I have requested a meeting of any administration  to meet with a judge, it has always been granted. But I always, always,  always meet with the Ninth Circuit judges.    As I mentioned, until now, I had interviewed every single Ninth  Circuit judge that this body has voted on for the last 7 years--every  single one--during my entire time in the Senate.   Why is it so important to me?   Why is it so important to everybody?   Well, specifically, as it relates to the Ninth Circuit, if you can  look at this map, as many Americans know, our Federal court systems are  divided into what are called circuits. The Ninth Circuit, which is this  dark brown, is the biggest Federal court of appeals in the country. It  is huge. Look at all the States that are under the jurisdiction of the  Ninth Circuit: California, Idaho, Arizona, Washington, Oregon, Montana,  Alaska, Hawaii. It is enormous. Almost one in five Americans are under  the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit. It has enormous power,  especially over my constituents in the great State of Alaska.   But here is the thing. If you look at the number of judges that each  Circuit Court gets, another reason why the Ninth Circuit is so  important and so powerful is that it gets an enormous number of judges.  The Ninth Circuit is listed here on the far left. Out of 29 active  judges, one judge comes from the great State of Alaska. One judge comes  from the great State of Alaska. So, as you can imagine, discussing  legal issues with any judge from the Ninth Circuit is very important to  me and, more importantly, to the people I represent.   Here is something else about the Ninth Circuit. On so many issues  that matter to my constituents, the court gets the legal issues wrong.  The court gets the legal issues wrong.   Now, I have seen this firsthand. Almost 25 years ago, I had the honor  of being a Ninth Circuit law clerk for the only Ninth Circuit judge we  have in Alaska, Judge Andrew Kleinfeld, a phenomenal judge. I watched  panel after panel in the Ninth Circuit get cases related to the great  State of Alaska wrong.   Now, look. In some ways it is not their fault. Yes, they had  different views and a legal outlook. But if you are a judge and you  grew up in LA and all you know is LA and California laws, and now you  are a Ninth Circuit judge and you are supposed to rule on all these  Alaska-specific Federal laws, you really don't know what you are doing.  You don't really know what you are doing, and I saw that as a young  lawyer.   But don't take my word for it.   In the last 4 years, the U.S. Supreme Court has taken up three  specific Alaska cases, two of which were from the Ninth Circuit and one  of which was from the DC Circuit. These big, important circuits all got  them wrong. They are cases that would have changed the history and  future of my State.   So when I meet with nominees for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Ninth Circuit, it is usually always very cordial. I walk them through a  lot of issues, legal issues of which they know very little about-- again, not their fault--and to explain why these are so important to  the people I represent.   Again, if you are an LA lawyer or a lawyer from Phoenix, you don't  know about Native Alaskan law. You don't know about the Alaskan  National Interest Lands Conservation Act, called ANILCA--a Federal law,  1,000 pages--that the U.S. Supreme Court, in the last 3 years, twice  smacked down the Ninth Circuit, 9 to 0--9 to 0--because the Ninth  Circuit continually gets these Alaska-focused statutes wrong.   So I walk them through these issues. That is all I do. It is not a  big deal. It is actually trying to help the judges. I think every Ninth  Circuit judge I have met with appreciates it.   Let me give you a couple of examples of what I would do if I could  meet with these judges.   Like I said, ANILCA, or the Alaska National Interest Lands  Conservation Act, is a hugely important Federal law that was passed in  1980. We didn't want it, by the way. It federalized almost 100 million  acres of land in Alaska. Imagine that. Most States aren't even as big  as 100 million acres.   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 9 to 0 in favor of a moose hunter who  wanted access to Federal land. His name is John Sturgeon. He is a very  famous Alaskan right now.   It went back to the Ninth Circuit. They misinterpreted it. It went  back up to the U.S. Supreme Court--9-zip--they smacked it down again.   Justice Kagan, who wrote the second opinion, said: ``If [John]  Sturgeon lived in any other State, his [law]suit would not have [had] a  prayer of success. . . . Except that Sturgeon lives in Alaska. And as  we [the U.S. Supreme Court] have said before, `Alaska is often the  exception, not the rule,' '' when it comes to these kind of Federal  laws in Federal parks.   Do you think it would be good to have a Ninth Circuit judge getting  ready to get on the court to understand the Sturgeon case? It would be.  So that is what I do. I have the judges read Sturgeon. I have them read  other cases. It is all advice and consent. It is our constitutional  role. Until today, I have done it with every Ninth Circuit judge.   Like I said, I was over at the White House on Friday, really kind of  banging the table on the Biden administration's war on Alaska. Some of  you may have seen a speech I gave last week. There are 20 Executive  orders and Executive actions singularly focused on my great State--20-- crushing working families.   And I said: You know, one thing I would like to do is continue my  record of meeting with every Ninth Circuit  [[Page S9109]]  judge. I am available Sunday, Sunday night, all day Monday. Give me a  call. I haven't heard anything back.   Something else I do with these judges when they come before me is I  talk about Indian law. Now a lot of lawyers think, ``Hey, I really know  Indian law well.'' And my advice and counsel in the advice-and-consent  process, when it comes to Indian law in Alaska, is ``If you think  you are an expert, throw out everything you know about lower 48 Indian  law when it comes to Alaskan Indian law.    The Native Alaskan law, in Alaska--the Federal law--is 100 percent  different than it is in the lower 48. This is just advice I give judges  who are going on the Ninth Circuit. They don't know this. An LA lawyer  doesn't know this.   This week, we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Congress's  passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, what we call in  Alaska ANCSA, the largest settlement of indigenous land claims,  certainly, in America, and probably in the world. It is a really  successful act, not perfect, very innovative. But it has been litigated  like crazy.   We had a case from the Ninth Circuit several years ago that  essentially said: ANCSA created reservation land throughout the entire  State of Alaska.   That would have changed the history of Alaska forever. Of course, the  Ninth Circuit got it wrong. That case went up to the Supreme Court.  Nine-zip, the Supreme Court smacked down the Ninth Circuit. They said:  ANCSA doesn't do that. That is not what Congress intended.   Do you think it would be good for these judges this week, if I could  sit down with them, to understand that? It would be really good, really  important. It would help them for their job.   Just this year, the DC Circuit on another ANCSA-related case, the  Chehalis case, got ANCSA wrong again. And guess what. It went up to the  U.S. Supreme Court again. They just ruled on it 4 months ago. It was a  huge victory for my State, again.   We wrote an amicus brief--Senator Murkowski, Congressman Young, and  I. But it was enormously important. This wrong case of the DC Circuit  would have changed the history of Alaska forever. The Supreme Court, 6  to 3, said: No, you are misinterpreting Alaska.   Do you think these judges on the Ninth Circuit who we are debating to  confirm this week would learn a little bit about that if I could meet  with them? They would.   Finally, the other thing I always do with circuit judges is I talk  about the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment is really, really  important to the people I represent. We use firearms for food, for  self-defense in the wild. Well over 60 percent of all the homes in my  State have firearms for these reasons.   If you are an LA lawyer, you don't know this stuff. But, all of a  sudden, you are going to be ruling on cases that deal with Alaska or  Idaho or Montana. And here is the thing: They might not know these  issues, these judges. I have looked at their background. I wanted to  interview them. Remarkably, I can't get an interview with them.   And here is the thing: As soon as they get confirmed, they are going  to get these cases before them, in my State and other States, to rule  on these kinds of issues.   Do you think a meeting would help them?   ``Boy, I should really think about that. I remember Senator Sullivan  talked about ANILCA and the Sturgeon case. I am really glad I read the  Sturgeon case.''   This is why these advice-and-consent constitutional meetings are so  important.   And, as I mentioned, I have been doing this my entire time in the  Senate. I have never not had a meeting with a Ninth Circuit judge. It  doesn't matter where they are from--Montana, Arizona, Washington State.  They are going to rule on issues that relate to my State and my  constituents.   And these judges don't mind it. They actually, I think, enjoy it.  They learn. But this White House says: You can't meet with them.   This is absurd.   Here is the question: What are they hiding?   What are they worried about?   Are they hiding something? Are the judges hiding something?   Again, this is a precedent that Democrats and Republicans should all  be against, because we know what goes around comes around in this body.  And this just doesn't make sense.   All three of these Ninth Circuit judges will have life tenure and  enormous, enormous power over everybody in the Ninth Circuit. That is  20 percent of all Americans, and, certainly, enormous power over the  people in Alaska, whom I am privileged to serve and represent.   These judges are likely to know very little about these issues that I  just talked about. Well, I believe I have a constitutional role to help  them understand these issues better, and that is the way it has always  been. Nobody has complained.   Absurdly, the White House has said: Well, Senator Sullivan, you can  meet with a Ninth Circuit judge if they are from Alaska.   What? We have one judge, and she is not going to be retiring any time  soon. That is it.   Now, here is the thing. I just talked to the previous  administration's White House counsel this morning, when I called the  Biden administration's counsel this morning. I am still waiting for  that phone call, by the way, because I said: Look, if the White House  Counsel is saying no to a U.S. Senator to do his constitutional duty, I  would like to hear it directly from her.   So she hasn't called me back yet. But I talked to the previous  administration's White House Counsel, and I asked: By the way, did you  guys do this? I am just double-checking. I mean, I got to meet with all  the Ninth Circuit judges President Trump put forward. But did you  blackball Democrats? Did you do that?   And they said: Absolutely not.   I made a few phone calls to other people in the White House Counsel's  office. They said: To the contrary, when any Senator wanted to meet  with any circuit judge, we always made it happen.   So this is a new precedent. And, again, it doesn't matter if you are  a Republican or a Democrat. This is just a bad precedent.   And the notion that ``Well, Senator, you get to meet with a Ninth  Circuit judge from Alaska,'' when, by the way, California, I think, has  close to 20 Ninth Circuit judges--but the notion that you can only meet  with the one who is from your State is actually moronic. The people who  need to be educated are the ones who aren't from your State, because  they are all going to rule on issues from your State.   So I am still waiting for the White House Counsel to call me back--or  whoever is in charge in the White House.   But I am going to conclude with this. I am going to go around them. I  am going to go around them. Here is what I am going to do, and I hope  someone is watching from the White House. But, more importantly, I hope  someone is watching from the judge's chambers.   So, Judge Koh, we are getting ready to vote on your nomination  tonight.   Judge Sung of Oregon, we are getting ready to vote on your nomination  tomorrow.   Judge Sanchez of California, the rumor is, the majority leader is  going to file cloture on your nomination.   Those are three Ninth Circuit judges.   Judge Holly Thomas of California, you might get voted on this week  too.   Four.   Here is my ask: Give me a call. Give me a call. Give my office a  call. I will meet with you tonight. Let's do a phone call. Do you want  to learn about ANILCA? Do you want to learn about the Sturgeon case? It  will make you a better Ninth Circuit judge. Here is the number: (202)  224-1026. Give my office a call. I am ready to meet anytime.   Here is the thing for the judges: It is 1 hour of your time. You are  going to have lifetime tenure. It is 1 hour to talk to a U.S. Senator  who is doing his constitutional duty for the people he represents. It  shouldn't be that hard. As a matter of fact, this is probably your  first test of judicial independence. A U.S. Senator of the Senate--of  the Senate; read the Constitution--wants to undertake his advice and  consent, his constitutional role, with you, OK?   You guys have read the Constitution, those four judges I just  mentioned, but an unelected bureaucrat in the White  [[Page S9110]]  House--I guess the White House Counsel, but who the heck knows; it is  hard to tell who is in charge over there--is blocking this.   So, again, give my office a call at (202) 224-1026. I am ready to  meet and talk to you anytime before the vote. Don't worry--I don't  think President Biden is going to yank your nomination if you call me.  Heck, he probably doesn't even know this is going on. But you know this  is the right thing to do, Judges. You have read the Constitution. Heck,  if our meeting goes well, I might even vote for you.   But here is the thing: You will learn more about the issues that you  are going to have to deal with very soon in your tenure that you  probably don't know anything about--no offense to you. I have read your  backgrounds. You don't know anything about Native Alaskan law. You  don't know anything about ANILCA. You probably have very different  views than I and my constituents do on the Second Amendment. But you  need to hear these issues because you are going to be life-tenured on  the Ninth Circuit, and you don't have time to talk to me, a U.S.  Senator, who is a Senator representing a State from the Ninth Circuit?  You know it is wrong.   By the way, my colleagues in the Senate know it is wrong. So I hope  my Democratic and Republican colleagues realize that this is not a good  precedent. This is not a good precedent. It has never happened as long  as I have been here.   You know, from big things to small things, this administration has  really focused in many ways on smashing political and institutional  norms that have enjoyed strong bipartisan support. It is not good for  this body, and it is not good for the government.   The Wall Street Journal, today, had an article about Biden's Federal  regulators staging a coup against the Director of the FDIC on bank  mergers. One of these regulators doesn't even have the power over bank  mergers, and now he is trying to be in charge.   I serve on the U.S. Naval Academy's Board of Visitors. It is a huge  honor. The President comes in, President Biden, and fires everybody on  the service academies who was appointed by President Trump. Nobody has  ever done that before--no President. Everybody on the Board of Visitors  of the Naval Academy is furious--the Democrats, the Republicans. The  No. 1 thing they are saying is, this President is the first one to  politicize the service academies. Then, oh, by the way, he hasn't  appointed anyone yet to replace the people he fired, so we didn't have  a quorum for our meeting last week.   He is just smashing institutional norms. Yet this institutional norm  of advice and consent, when it comes to circuit court judges with life  tenure, is something that we have all agreed upon. The previous  administration certainly allowed for it. Yet, right now, I can't meet  with Ninth Circuit judges who are going to have enormous power for  their entire lives over my constituents.   So, to my colleagues, we shouldn't allow this. You guys know it is  wrong.   To the judges--like I said, Judge Sanchez, Judge Koh, Judge Sung,  Judge Thomas--give my office a call. Do the right thing. Your first  test of judicial independence is before you of the Senate. The U.S.  Senate--of the Senate, of which I am a part--wants to do our  constitutional role. Give us a call so we can do it. Ignore the very  bad advice you are getting from the White House Counsel or whoever is  in charge over there.   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I work  very closely with my colleague from Rhode Island on many, many issues,  and there is a pretty simple solution for my objection here, and it is  related to judges, and it is related to the Senate working with the  White House to get judges confirmed.   I gave a speech on the Senate floor just about an hour ago, talking  about a remarkable breach of Senate protocol, where the White House  won't let certain Senators from the Court of Appeals of the Ninth  Circuit States to meet with the nominees for the Court of Appeals for  the Ninth Circuit.   That is an outrage. In my entire time in the U.S. Senate, every time  I have requested to meet with a judge who is going for confirmation to  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, I have had the  opportunity to meet with that judge, and it is really important.   I am not going to repeat the argument I made just an hour ago, but  there is a simple solution here: We get to meet with the nominees whom  we are debating on the Senate floor this week, and I certainly will  lift the objection that I am about to make on these two nominees for  the Court of Federal Claims.   But I do want to just push back on my good friend from Rhode Island a  little bit. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle forced votes  on the Court of Federal Claims nominees during the Trump  administration, including Judge Solomon, who literally wrote the book  on the Court of Federal Claims.   So here is the thing. What often happens in the Senate is that what  goes around comes around. But what happened today, when I was  requesting what I have always been requesting--what my constituents in  Alaska expect me to do is to interview, meet, discuss issues with the  judge who is going to get life tenure, who is going to have enormous  power over my constituents--Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judges.   I don't know anybody who has heard this--that the White House Counsel  says: No, you are a Senator doing advice and consent, a constitutional  duty, and we are forbidding you to meet with a judge going through the  confirmation process who is going to have enormous power over your  constituents. That is unheard of since I have been here. And, by the  way, I talked to the Trump administration's White House Counsel, and  they said they never did that.   But here is the point. This could be easily solved. I am sure Mr.  Bonilla and Ms. Lerner are qualified. All I need is a call from the  White House Counsel's office saying: You know what, Senator, you can  meet with the nominees for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth  Circuit. We are going to let you do your constitutional duty.   Well, thank you--pretty simple.   And I think working closely with my colleague from Rhode Island, as I  have done throughout my career--and he is on the Judiciary Committee.  So maybe he can help convince the White House to take a bit of a  different stand when a Senator wants to meet with a judge who is going  to have enormous power over his constituents and have lifetime tenure.  And they can't take an hour out of their time? Heck, in my speech just  an hour ago, I put out my office's phone number and said to these  judges: Look, you don't have to have permission from the White House  Counsel. Just call me. Let's have a discussion.   I am trying to do my constitutional duty here.   So with that, Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.   I have a simpler solution here, and I have already mentioned it.   The White House has denied my ability to meet with one Ninth Circuit  judge who just got confirmed. Let me meet with the next two, and then  we will UC these. We will UC these nominees whom Senator Whitehouse has  been trying to move forward tonight.   I also want to mention to my colleague from Rhode Island that I am  certainly more than amenable to working with him on a principle that, I  think, all Senators should agree on--all of us--to strengthen this  institution, whether you are a Democrat, a Republican. That is this  simple idea, which I thought existed here because I have certainly been  able to do it: If a judge is up for confirmation, a circuit judge, and  if you are a Senator representing one of the States in the circuit and  that judge is going to have enormous power over your constituents for  life, we should, as a general rule, as a general principle, say always:  Of course, you get to meet with that judge. Of course, you can do your  constitutional advice and consent duty.   I would be for it for any Democrat who wants it if there is a  Republican. Again, I talked to some folks from the Trump administration  today. They said that they always offered that. So maybe there is a  misunderstanding. I don't want to say that my Senate colleague from  Rhode Island is not right or those guys. I don't know. That is what  they mentioned to me.   I just think, as a principle, every Senator here should agree with  it. Why wouldn't you want to do that?   Like I said, until today, I have met with every single Ninth Circuit  judge whom we voted on in my entire career here. Now, it has been a  relatively short career, but this is really important to the people I  represent because that court is really important to the people I  represent. The Ninth Circuit so frequently gets the law wrong as it  relates to Alaska, and it negatively impacts my constituents. This is  important.   So I object to this date certain request, but as I mentioned, if I  can meet with these--two more--Ninth Circuit judges, Senator Whitehouse  can come down here and UC these two Court of Federal Claims judges, and  I think he can move it. It is a real simple ask.   And the fact that the White House Counsel hasn't even called me  back--a U.S. Senator trying to do his constitutional duty, advice and  consent of the Senate? The Senator from Rhode Island and I are of the  Senate.   So why don't we work on this principle that, if there is a nominee, a  circuit judge nominee, and if a Senator from a State in that circuit  wants to meet with that nominee--to do his constitutional duty--that we  should all agree to do that no matter who is in the White House. I  would agree to that principle in a heartbeat.
