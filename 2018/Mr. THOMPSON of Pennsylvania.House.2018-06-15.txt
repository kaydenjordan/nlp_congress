 Mr. Speaker, June is Alzheimer's and  Brain Awareness Month. Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death  in the United States.   There is no effective treatment, no means of prevention, and no  method for slowing the progression of the disease. Sadly, one in three  seniors will die with the disease.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5.7  million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease. By 2050 this  number is projected to rise to nearly 14 million Americans.   Mr. Speaker, every 65 seconds, someone in the United States develops  this disease. This is unacceptable. Alzheimer's not only has a  devastating impact on those who are diagnosed with the disease, but  also their caregivers and loved ones.   More than 16 million Americans provide unpaid care to those living  with Alzheimer's and other dementias. In 2017 these caregivers provided  an estimated 18.4 billion hours of care.   Mr. Speaker, the time to act is now. Let's join the fight; let's take  the pledge to raise awareness about Alzheimer's disease and to never  stop searching for a cure.                            ____________________
