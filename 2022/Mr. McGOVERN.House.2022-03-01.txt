 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 950 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 950         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3967) to       improve health care and benefits for veterans exposed to       toxic substances, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. An amendment in       the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 117-33, modified by the amendment printed in       part A of the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying       this resolution, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs       or their respective designees; (2) the further amendments       described in section 2 of this resolution; (3) the amendments       en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution; and (4)       one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  After debate pursuant to the first section of this       resolution, each further amendment printed in part B of the       report of the Committee on Rules not earlier considered as       part of amendments en bloc pursuant to section 3 of this       resolution shall be considered only in the order printed in       the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, may be withdrawn       by the proponent at any time before the question is put       thereon, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be       subject to a demand for division of the question.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time after debate       pursuant to the first section of this resolution for the       chair of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs or his designee       to offer amendments en bloc consisting of further amendments       printed in part B of the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution not earlier disposed of.       Amendments en bloc offered pursuant to this section shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for 20 minutes equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs or their       respective designees, shall not be subject to amendment, and       shall not be subject to a demand for division of the       question.        Sec. 4.  All points of order against the further amendments       printed in part B of the report of the Committee on Rules or       amendments en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution       are waived.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I just want to state what  I think we are all feeling here today, and that is that our prayers are  with the Ukrainian people during this very perilous time.   I want to acknowledge the unity displayed in the yesterday afternoon  Rules Committee meeting when Democrats and Republicans came together  and with one voice condemned Vladimir Putin's blatant aggression, his  brutality, and the horrific actions the Russian state is now taking  against the people of Ukraine. It was almost as if there was no  distinction between political parties, and I think that is as it should  be because Vladimir Putin is not a genius, as some have said, and he is  not smart. He is a bully. He is a dictator.   I cochair the Human Rights Commission in Congress. We have done  countless hearings on his brutality against the Russian people. He  jails people he disagrees with, he kills people he disagrees with, and  he tortures people he disagrees with. He truly is an international  pariah.   After this latest action, he will be in the same category as Kim  Jong-un in North Korea.   So I just want to acknowledge the unity yesterday in the Rules  Committee, and I want my Republican friends to know how grateful I was  to have us all speak as one, especially during this difficult time. I  know it is important not just for the Ukrainian people but in Russia  that we are speaking as one because when people start to make excuses  for the Russian dictator or start to find ways to praise him, that gets  played on Russian TV and exaggerated in a way to indicate that somehow  we are not unified here when I believe that we are.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule,  House Resolution 950, providing for consideration of H.R. 3967, the  Honoring Our PACT Act, under a structured rule. The rule self-executes  a manager's amendment from Chairman Takano, provides 1 hour of general  debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and makes in order 28  amendments. Lastly, the rule provides en bloc authority to Chairman  Takano and provides one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, today we are here to stand up for our veterans. For a  long time now, more and more have been speaking out--pleading--to be  taken seriously about the health impacts of the toxic chemicals they  dealt with while serving our country.   Many encountered water at military bases that were contaminated with  toxins, like harmful forever chemicals. They breathed in toxic fumes at  burn pits where jet fuel was used to incinerate things like paint,  petroleum, and plastic. And they were exposed with radiation when being  tasked to clean up after nuclear tests, without being given the proper  safety equipment.   These were duties we demanded of them. And as a result, many veterans  have been left to suffer with severe health challenges like cancers,  infertility, and respiratory conditions. Many more have died, and  others are just too sick to work.                                time  1230    We aren't talking about just a few people here, Mr. Speaker. We are  talking about millions and millions of veterans who answered the call  to serve.   When they asked us to take care of them, for too long, they were just  brushed aside not just by Congress but also by the Department of  Defense, year after year after year.   They were told the science wasn't clear. And they were told that  providing the medical care that they needed and that they earned was  just too high.   Maybe some bureaucrat somewhere viewed denying veterans' disability  claims as an exercise in frugality. Maybe drowning them in paperwork  and setting an unreasonably high bar to get benefits just became the  norm. I don't know.   But that finally ends here and now, Mr. Speaker. The legislation  included in this rule will cut the burdensome red tape. It will  streamline the VA's review process, and it will get veterans exposed to  toxins the care that they so badly need.   H.R. 3967 tasks the VA with providing standardized trainings to  better handle these claims, and it requires them to conduct outreach  and provide resources to veterans exposed to deadly chemicals.   Thanks to this bill, no longer will the burden to prove toxic  exposure be placed on veterans themselves. And it is about damn time,  Mr. Speaker.   If this bill becomes law, it will help an estimated 1.4 million  veterans by fiscal year 2031. That is something that we should all be  proud of.   The Honoring our PACT Act recognizes that just thanking our veterans  for their service isn't enough. We must back up those words with  action.   Some may suggest that we should just maintain the status quo or make  the scope of this bill much, much smaller. Let me remind them that  Congress made the choice to spend trillions  [[Page H1188]]  of dollars over the last 20 years on sending our servicemembers into  harm's way. Those decisions came at a cost of more than $6 trillion.  That is trillion with a T.   How in the world, Mr. Speaker, can anyone justify spending trillions  of dollars on sending servicemembers to fight abroad just to nickel and  dime them on healthcare costs once they return home? That is  unconscionable.   Taking care of toxic-exposed veterans is a cost of war, period. If  anyone here has reservations about paying it, they should think long  and hard before calling for our servicemembers to fight in another  conflict halfway around the world.   Our veterans put their lives on the line for us. They made sacrifices  that are hard to even imagine. They fought to protect us, and they  shouldn't have to then fight their country for the benefits that they  have earned.   Let's take care of our veterans. Let's pass this bill and the  underlying legislation. And let's honor our veterans with more than  just words.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank the gentleman for his comments. I just want to say  that he is right. We could probably pass the very short bill that the  Republicans have put forward, H.R. 6659, and send it to the President.  But our bill, which is actually more than 80 pages, goes into much more  depth and covers a lot more.   Republicans want to do just a little bit. We want to actually solve  the challenges that so many of our veterans face.   By the way, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of  Administration Policy, which states that President Biden would  basically sign the bill we are discussing here today into law.                     Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 3967--Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT)             Act--Rep. Takano, D-California and 100 cosponsors         The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3967, which would       expand veterans' access to health care and benefits to       address the health effects of harmful environmental exposures       that occurred during military service.        The President believes that our Nation has only one truly       sacred obligation: to properly prepare and equip our service       members when we send them into harm's way and to care for       them and their families when they return home. Far too often,       military service comes with a cost, and we owe it to our       veterans and their families to address these consequences       comprehensively. Unfortunately, it has taken decades to       understand the deleterious effects of environmental       exposures--leaving too many without access to the benefits       and services they need.        H.R. 3967 would make changes to the definitions for who is       eligible for VA health care based on presumed toxic exposure       during military service, including from bum pits, radiation,       or other environmental conditions. H.R. 3967 would also make       changes to the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA's) process       for determining presumptive service connection and mandate       several research studies related to military related       environmental exposures. It would also establish new       registries related to exposures, which would provide new data       on the long-term impacts from environmental exposures. H.R.       3697 also would allow a Federal cause of action related to       contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and       establish training requirements for health providers, and       require an outreach plan to educate veterans about their       eligibility for benefits and services related to toxic       exposure.        The Administration looks forward to working with the       Congress to enact this legislation and ensuring it is       effectively implemented. We must address the toxic legacy of       environmental exposures sustained by veterans during their       military service and fulfill our sacred obligation to our       veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors. We must       also ensure that VA has the resources it needs to implement       this legislation.    We have an opportunity today to move a bill forward  that will pass the House, even if many Republicans will not vote for  it; send it to the Senate; get them to act on it; and send to the  President a bill for him to sign that will actually do the job and be  more than just a press release.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we begin on a note of basically saying that it was  wonderful that we were all united in standing up to Vladimir Putin and  speaking with one voice. I think we need to kind of amend that at this  point.   Let me just say that we need to stand with the people of Ukraine. We  need to stand with President Zelensky, who has had the guts to stand up  to Vladimir Putin, but also to the former President who tried to extort  him and who withheld essential defensive military aid in exchange for  trying to get from him some manufactured dirt on the President's son.  Let's be a little bit careful about what charges we are throwing around  here.   Again, I am sorry that my Republican colleagues are feeling the need  to come here and play partisan politics in the middle of a global  crisis, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised.   Yet, for all their criticism on how this administration is handling  the crisis in Ukraine, they have been all over the map on what they  would do differently. They talk about energy independence, yet they are  the ones who have consistently voted against and opposed green and  renewable energy here at home, which is the fastest way to achieve real  energy independence.   I include in the Record a February 23 Washington Post opinion piece  entitled ``Republicans say Biden is `weak' on Ukraine. What would they  do differently?'' By the way, just a spoiler alert, the answer is: They  have no idea.                 [From the Washington Post, Feb. 23, 2022]    Opinion: Republicans Say Biden is `Weak' on Ukraine. What Would They                              Do Differently?                             (By Paul Waldman)          There was a time in American history when foreign crises       were considered a moment for unity. We said ``politics stops       at  [[Page H1190]]       the water's edge,'' meaning that partisanship had to be put       aside so the country could show the world a united front, and       both parties usually agreed.         The public acted that way, too. Presidents' approval       ratings would rise whenever we found ourselves in any sort of       conflict with a foreign adversary; this was called the       ``rally 'round the flag effect,'' and it occurred even when       things went badly. For instance, President Jimmy Carter's       approval ratings shot up by almost 30 points after Americans       were taken hostage in Tehran.         But no more. Even the most straightforward of foreign       policy challenges become yet another opportunity for the       opposition to say the president is a failure and a villain,       which is what Republicans are doing now as we confront       Russian leader Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.         But that doesn't mean the Republican Party can decide what       it believes.         One of Donald Trump's legacies is that in some GOP       quarters, Putin is now regarded as akin to a hero. That       starts with Trump himself, who reacted to the invasion by       calling Putin's aggression ``genius,'' ``smart,'' and       ``savvy.'' Meanwhile, Fox News host Tucker Carlson has been       so relentless in passing on the Kremlin's perspective that       Russian state TV regularly airs clips from his show.         That exacerbates the profoundly unsettled nature of       contemporary foreign policy thinking in the GOP. The right       has struggled to find a singular voice over the past 15 years       or so, once the thrill of the Global War on Terror ran       aground in the disaster of the Iraq War.         In the 2016 presidential primaries, Republican candidates       struggled over whether and how to call the war a mistake, and       where that would leave the party's traditional hawkishness.       Then Trump took over, with less a foreign policy doctrine       than a shifting collection of impulses, including a distrust       of ambitious adventures and an obsequiousness toward Putin       that can be described only as pathetic.         So how should a Republican hawk respond to the current       crisis? The answer is clear: Just make it about President       Biden.         The GOP critique is both blessedly free of substance and       plays right into the anxieties about manhood that determine       approximately 75 percent of everything Republicans do these       days.         So whether you're a Putin fanboy or a cold warrior, you       can agree that the real problem here is weakness. Why is this       crisis happening? Because Biden is weak. What should America       do now? Not be weak, because Biden is weak. Is your favorite       baseball team going to win the pennant this year? They would,       if Biden wasn't so weak.         ``Biden weakness invited Russian aggression, Republicans       say,'' reads a Fox News headline. Biden is ``the weakest       president that America has ever had,'' says former Trump       administration ambassador to United Nations Nikki Haley. ``No       one fears this pathetic old geezer'' says the National       Review.         The House Republican Conference tweeted a picture of       Biden, with the caption ``This is what weakness on the world       stage looks like.'' Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the       third-ranking Republican in the House, tweeted, ``Biden is       unfit to serve as Commander-in-Chief. He has consistently       given into Putin's demands and shown nothing but weakness.''         Though some Republicans say the sanctions at the center of       Biden's strategy should have started earlier, you'll have a       hard time finding one who can specify in any detail what       Biden's ``weakness'' toward Russia has consisted of to this       point, nor what a ``strong'' president would be doing       instead. Mounting a ground invasion to take Moscow? Launching       nuclear weapons? What?         If the answer is ``What Biden is doing, but, you know,       more,'' that's not very persuasive. But as far as they're       concerned, ``strength'' isn't something presidents       demonstrate with their actions; it's more of an ineffable       quality that Republican presidents possess by definition       while Democratic presidents lack.         Consider Trump. Short of literally getting down on his       hands and knees to shine Putin's shoes, there's almost no way       you could imagine Trump having been weaker toward Putin than       he actually was. Trump continually praised the Russian       dictator, dismissed his misdeeds and went out of his way to       denigrate NATO--just as Putin would want.         It culminated in the utterly disgraceful display at the       2018 summit in Helsinki, when Trump was asked about Russian       interference in the 2016 election and declared he was taking       Putin's word over the analysis of U.S. intelligence agencies,       because ``President Putin was extremely strong and powerful       in his denial today.''         It was so embarrassing that even Republicans were shocked;       then-Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee said Trump ``made us look       like a pushover.'' Sen. John McCain called it ``one of the       most disgraceful performances by an American president in       memory.'' Nevertheless, today Republicans claim that when it       came to Russia, Trump was a paragon of strength.         And however this crisis ends, they will insist that       everything would have worked out far better if only Biden       were stronger. Whatever that means.         To be clear, everyone has the right to criticize the       president; having politics end at the water's edge brings its       own problems. Nor is there anything wrong with intraparty       differences. But rather than a lively debate over alternative       courses of action, what we're seeing now from the GOP is       mostly juvenile name-calling.         Not that we had much reason to expect anything different.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Ross), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am not going to respond, because I like  the gentleman too much.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, two quick things. One, my friends are touting this  whatever it is, this all-of-the-above approach to dealing with our  energy challenges. But I am looking at this proposal, and it just seems  it is the same old, same old, fossil fuels, fossil fuels, fossil fuels.  I wonder who wrote this. I wonder where this came from.   Why isn't there any mention of green energy or clean energy or solar  energy or renewable energy, any of the things that, quite frankly, the  majority of the American people want us to do? Why isn't it here?   Well, I will make a suggestion to people who are tuning in: Follow  the money. Follow the money. This is Big Oil's wish list. If you want  to continue to find ourselves in circumstances, whenever there is an  international crisis, that we have to kowtow to Big Oil, then listen to  them.   But on the Democratic side, we want to wean ourselves off of the same  old, same old. And ``all-of-the-above,'' by the way, is not just oil,  oil, oil.   The second thing I want to say is that my friends on the other side  always love to talk about how much they support our veterans. Well, we  actually have a bill here that will support our veterans. It is a big  deal. You all received a letter from all the leading veterans' service  organizations of this country saying to please pass this bill.   They don't want to talk about it. They say: Oh, support this  minuscule bill, the alternative that we are putting up here, by the  way, which our veterans' organizations do not prefer.   If you really want to help our veterans, if you are sincere about  what you say when you say let's support our veterans, then how about  voting that way. Talk is cheap around here. How about putting your vote  where your rhetoric is and supporting this underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr.  Welch).                                time  1300     It is amazing, Mr. Speaker, we are here talking about a  major veterans bill, and the gentleman couldn't even bring himself to  mention veterans once in his statement.   To the gentleman from Pennsylvania, talking about taking all cars off  the road, who is talking about that? I will tell the gentleman that if  we go ahead with what he wants to do on the Keystone pipeline, that is  equivalent to adding another 5 million cars on the road. That is what  that would mean to our environment.   My Republican friends, if they want to think small when it comes to  veterans, have at it. Veterans' organizations are watching. We are  hearing from veterans all across the country who want this bill passed.  They want us to pass this comprehensive bill. We will do that.   If you want to do your minuscule bill, you have a substitute, you can  vote for it. It is in your substitute. We want to actually do something  in a comprehensive way to meet the concerns that our veterans have  expressed for years and years and years. If you want to take a pass, go  ahead. That is what you do on our most important issues. This probably  is no exception.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Price).    Mr. Speaker, I would remind the gentleman that  President Biden didn't try to extort President Zelensky by withholding  money to get him to manufacture dirt on one of his political opponents.  But I find this a little bit comical.   My Republican friends say that they want to bring up this Senate  bill, which is much narrower than what we are doing right now, yet they  want you to defeat the previous question not so they can bring up that  Senate bill, but so they can bring up this giveaway to the oil  companies. Again, follow the money. Follow the money. This is a bill  that was written in some back room in some oil company and, quite  frankly, it is unconscionable. They never let a crisis go to waste.   Today we are talking about trying to help our veterans, and it would  be nice if on this one issue of helping our veterans we could all come  together, but I guess that is asking too much.   I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Cartwright).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an April 28, 2021,  Military.com article titled: ``VA Secretary Wants More Vets Sickened by  Burn Pits to File Claims, But Many Are Still Being Turned Away,'' and I  include in the Record an April 12, 2021, ``NBC News'' article titled:  ``Veterans Face Uphill Battle to Receive Treatment For `Burn Pit'  Exposure.''                     [From Military.com, Apr. 28, 2021]  VA Secretary Wants More Vets Sickened by Burn Pits To File Claims, But                      Many Are Still Being Turned Away                             (By Steve Beynon)         Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough       wants more veterans who believe they were sickened by       exposure to burn pits overseas to seek help from the       department, despite many being turned away.        ``We're urging vets to come forward with their claims,''       McDonough said at a press briefing Monday. ``Our commitment       is to treat each claim with the care it deserves. As we get       more claims, we can aggregate those claims to draw bigger       conclusions.''        As of March 31, the VA had denied 72% of burn pit claims,       according to agency data obtained by Military.com. Between       June 2007 and March 31, the VA processed 15,640 disability       compensation claims related to burn pit exposure. Of those,       3,510 veterans had at least one burn pit issue granted.        The top three diagnoses related to burn pits are bronchial       asthma, chronic bronchitis and allergic rhinitis, according       to department data. The most common reasons for a veteran to       be denied is not having a diagnosed medical condition or       being unable to connect the condition to their service--43.1%       and 42.8% of denials, respectively.        But the data doesn't reflect the scope of the issue. The       number of patients filing claims might be disproportionately       small given VA estimates that 3.5 million veterans have been       exposed to burn pits since 1990. It is unclear how many are       sick due to their exposure or have died as a result.        McDonough suggests that more data is needed, and he wants       more veterans to seek help from the VA so officials can get a       better grasp on the issue.        The burn pit data also could be inherently flawed. To get       the data, the VA had to use text mining, searching for       keywords such as ``burn pit'' and ``burn pits'' in its       patient databases, according to department records. This       means patients coming forward with issues related to burn       pits might not automatically be listed as burn pit patients       if that phrase wasn't used in their records.        Out of the 2.5 million Global War on Terrorism veterans,       781,384 have filed claims related to respiratory issues.       According to VA data obtained by Military.com, 63% were       granted. Of all the GWOT veterans, 42,686 filed for claims       related to cancer; 37% of those claims were granted.        The VA's research shows GWOT veterans are three times more       likely than non-deployed veterans to file claims related to       respiratory issues and twice as likely to file claims for       cancer.        ``Although the GWOT-deployed and GWOT non-deployed       population sizes are relatively the same, the GWOT-deployed       cohort has more than two times the number of service-      connected cancers,'' according to the agency's findings.        Burn pits are often referred to as the post-9/11       generation's Agent Orange, referencing the bureaucratic maze       and uneven claims process veterans have to navigate, and what       could be a decades-long legislative fight to issue easy-to-      access health care and disability compensation.        The House and Senate Veterans Affairs Committees and       advocacy groups have made toxic exposure the top issue this       year. Congress is looking at some two dozen bills, ranging       from incremental improvements to sweeping health care bills       for all 3.5 million veterans exposed to burn pits and other       toxic environments.        But it's unclear what can actually make it to President Joe       Biden's desk. Some lawmakers and advocates are concerned over       what is very likely to be a huge tab to cover the cost of       opening the VA up to a huge swath of new patients.                                   ____                       [From NBC News, April 12, 2021]      Veterans Face Uphill Battle To Receive Treatment for `Burn Pit'                                  Exposure                   (By Kenzi Abou-Sabe and Didi Martinez)         During Marine veteran Scott Evans' two tours in       Afghanistan, his work on a specialized team that used dogs to       sniff out explosives led him to spend large chunks of time       around open-air pits where trash was burned.        In August, Evans, 33, of North Carolina, received       devastating news: he had terminal pancreatic cancer. The       diagnosis placed him among a growing number of military       veterans who say they have developed serious and sometimes       fatal diseases after facing prolonged exposure to burn pits       at overseas bases.        The pits were a common feature at military bases during the       wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a crude answer to the basic       logistics problem of how to deal with piles and piles of       trash. Everything from electronics and vehicles to human       waste was regularly doused in jet fuel and set ablaze,       spewing toxic fumes and carcinogens into the air.        The Department of Defense estimates that roughly 3.5       million service members could have been exposed to burn pits.       The Department of Veterans Affairs has denied about 75       percent of veterans' burn pit claims, including Evans',       because it does not acknowledge a connection between       conditions like asthma and cancer to exposure to the flaming       garbage piles.        Veterans say that at the same time they face resistance       while seeking treatment from the VA, they have also been let       down by civilian medical providers who often lack an       understanding of the existence and dangers of burn pits.        ``Over the next decades, I'd be shocked if we didn't see       spikes in disease in these patients,'' said Dr. Tom Abrams,       an oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who has       treated two veterans affected by burn pits.        ``Whether it's cancer, respiratory illness or some other       disease that has yet to make itself known, I think we have to       be on the lookout and really be aware that these veterans are       at very high risk.''        Abrams and other medical experts acknowledge that it's       exceedingly difficult to draw a definitive link between burn       pits and the conditions veterans are reporting, but they note       that ample evidence already exists showing that long-term       exposure to toxic smoke can lead to serious health issues.        A VA spokesperson said it ``follows the science on       questions of health outcomes of military exposures'' and is       conducting a review of the hazards of burn pits.        The spokesperson referenced a 2020 report by the National       Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine that found       none of the 27 respiratory health outcomes it reviewed met       the criteria for ``sufficient evidence of an association.''       The evidence for respiratory symptoms such as chronic       persistent cough and wheezing met the criteria for ``limited       or suggestive evidence of an association,'' the spokesperson       added.        A Pentagon spokesperson said the Defense Department and VA       are ``continuing to fund studies to provide more evidence on       the potential long-term effects of burn pit exposure.''        Lawmakers in Washington have taken up the cause,       introducing multiple bills aiming to change the way the VA       deals with veterans who think they're suffering from a burn       pit-related illness.        On Tuesday, advocates and legislators led by Sen. Kirsten       Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and the       comedian Jon Stewart will take to Capitol Hill to rally in       support of a measure, which would force the VA to expand care       and benefits to veterans affected by certain burn pit-related       illnesses.        In an interview with NBC Nightly News' Lester Holt, Stewart       said the situation echoes the aftermath of the terror attacks       of Sept. 11, 2001, when first-responders were coming down       with serious illnesses and health officials were slow to       recognize them as being caused by toxins swirling in the air       at ground zero.        ``What the first responders were standing on top of was       essentially a burn pit,'' he said. ``The jet fuel from the       planes ignited it, but it was all those materials from the       World Trade Center.''        Stewart got involved in the effort after being approached       by Rosie Torres, the founder of the nonprofit Burn Pits 360.       Torres started advocating for veterans suffering from toxic       exposure-related illnesses after her husband, an Army       veteran, was diagnosed with constrictive bronchiolitis.        ``I would challenge any congressperson who says, `Well,       we're going to wait for the science to be settled,' to dig a       hundred-yard pit in the middle of a town where your       constituents live, and burn everything in that town with jet       fuel,'' Stewart said. ``And then come and tell me that,       `Yeah, they're cool with it, because there's a lot of       confusion about whether or not the science is settled that       this is harmful to your health.' ''  [[Page H1195]]         For most veterans who think they are suffering from a burn       pit or other toxic exposure-related illness, getting the VA       to acknowledge their condition and treat them has been a       losing battle. Veterans must prove to the VA that they were       exposed to a burn pit during their service, and that the       exposure caused their condition.        Further complicating matters, veterans affected by toxic       exposure often find themselves against the clock when it       comes to gaining access to health care through the VA. If       veterans don't seek treatment during an initial five-year       period in which the VA offers combat veterans free health       care--and experts say many of the diseases that stem from       toxic exposure typically manifest slowly--they have to wait       for their claim to be approved before getting care at a VA       facility.        Even if they do meet the burden of proof and have their       claim approved, veterans say the approval process can take       months to years, wasting precious time for those with       terminal illnesses.        Gina Cancelino, whose husband, Joseph, died of an       aggressive form of testicular cancer in 2019, said they only       learned about the possible link between burn pits and the       disease months before he passed away.        ``I said, `Hon, burn pits, burn pits in Iraq,'' she recalls       telling the former Marine Corps gunnery sergeant. `` `Look,       I'm reading about this. Were you near these?' And he's like,       `Yeah, I'm pretty sure I was.' ''        Joseph Cancelino, who worked as a New York City Police       Department sergeant, had deployed to Iraq in 2003 during the       first wave of Operation Iraqi Freedom.        Now, his wife has made it her mission to piece together his       exposure to burn pits.        ``Had we known earlier that this was an issue, maybe he       goes annually and gets checked,'' Gina Cancelino said.       ``Maybe we find it earlier, and we don't give it a chance to       harbor in there, and fester in there. So I'm disappointed.       I'm disappointed in the lack of communication.''        Gen. Michael Heston was one of the rare few whose claims       were approved. He served three tours in Afghanistan with the       Vermont Army National Guard, and died in 2018 after a battle       with pancreatic cancer. He was 58 years old.        Heston's wife, June, said she remembers her husband       questioning the safety of the burn pits while he was still       deployed. At one of the bases where Heston was stationed, she       said, the burn pit was initially near the airfield, but the       smoke and soot were interfering with the jet engines, so it       was moved to another area of the base, closer to where troops       lived and worked.        ``He just couldn't understand,'' she said. ``If it's doing       that to a jet engine, well, why would you think it would be       OK to be moving [it] closer to human beings that are       breathing that in?''        When Heston started complaining of back pain and rapidly       losing weight in 2016, it took doctors 10 months to deliver a       diagnosis.        By that time, the cancer had metastasized to other parts of       his body.        Abrams, the Dana-Farber oncologist, had never heard of burn       pits before treating Heston. When Heston first explained       them, Abrams said, he was shocked.        ``I was just horrified because I thought that was probably       one of the most toxic kinds of things you could possibly       have,'' Abrams, who is also a faculty member at the Harvard       Medical School, said. ``It's extremely unhealthy to be       exposed to the products of massive combustion for years on       end.''        Abrams ultimately came to the conclusion that Heston's       cancer was likely caused by his exposure to toxic substances       in Afghanistan, and wrote a letter spelling that out to       bolster his application for VA benefits.        ``Most patients are diagnosed [with pancreatic cancer] in       their mid- to late-60s or early 70s,'' Abrams said. ``He had       no risk factors, he was not a diabetic, he was in excellent       shape. And he had this long term, very significant toxic       exposure that was certainly not something that was common at       the time.''        The VA ultimately acknowledged that Heston's cancer was due       to his toxic exposures during service, due in large part,       June Heston thinks, to Abrams' letter. But a letter like that       is not easy to come by, experts say, because doctors are       tasked with treating an illness, not investigating its cause.        ``It's very difficult to definitively say that X causes       Y,'' Abrams said. ``But on some level, I think it's important       to at least acknowledge that exposure to high levels of toxic       smoke is a contributor to lots of diseases in general. And I       don't think you need to necessarily pore through the data for       years to make at least that kind of general claim.''        Andrew Myatt deployed to Iraq in 2004 as a combat engineer       with the Army National Guard, disarming improvised explosive       devices, or IEDs. He believes the acute lymphocytic leukemia       he was diagnosed with in 2019 is connected to his exposure to       burn pits in Iraq, but when he applied for health care and       benefits, the VA denied his claim.        Myatt, 53, said he'd be lost without the help of Anita       Ritchie, the senior national service officer at the nonprofit       Wounded Warrior Project, who is helping him gather evidence       for an appeal.        ``Toxic exposure is one of the few instances where there's       not a lot of people in the civilian world who know anything       about this stuff,'' Ritchie said.        Myatt said he is happy with his current private health       care, but getting the VA to accept that his cancer was       related to his service would ensure he has access to medical       care in the future.        ``If this [cancer] shows up 20 years from now, when I'm       retired and living someplace, then I can go to them for       help,'' he said.        In 2014, the VA created a burn pit registry to start       tracking the long term health effects for service members who       were exposed to burn pits and other airborne hazards. Since       then, nearly 240,000 current and former service members have       joined.        But the practice hasn't stopped. In an April 2019 memo to       Congress, the Defense Department acknowledged that it had       nine active burn pits at bases throughout the Middle East.        Legislators and advocates are hopeful that this will be the       year that burn pit reform makes its way through Congress in       part because of a unique connection to President Joe Biden.        In the past, Biden has suggested that his son Beau's       deployment to Balad Air Base in Iraq may have had something       to do with his brain cancer diagnosis.        Balad Air Base had one of the largest burn pits, spanning       more than 10 acres. ``Because of exposure to burn pits--in my       view, I can't prove it yet--he came back with stage 4       glioblastoma,'' Biden told a Service Employees International       Union convention in 2019.        But for veterans like Scott Evans, who said he was told he       had between six months and a year to live, legislation may       not come soon enough.        Evans first contacted the VA medical center closest to his       home last April after his weight began to plummet and the       whites of his eyes had turned yellow. But he said he was told       he was ineligible because there was no evidence his condition       was connected to his service and he didn't qualify for       financial need.        He was eventually able to start receiving care at the VA in       July due to a different condition. The following month, he       was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at age 32.        Evans said he tries not to dwell on how things may have       been different if he had been able to access VA care last       April.        ``Would [the tumor] have been operable? What would the       outcome have been of it?'' he said. ``For me, it's done and       over with, we can't change that. But the big thing that I       would like to see happen is that if somebody comes in and       they need help, and they're a veteran, be able to get that       help right away. And let's ask questions later.''        Still, Evans said he has no regrets over his military       service.        ``Even knowing what I know now, and knowing the       consequences, I'd still do exactly the same thing, because it       was about the guys you're with,'' he said, pausing to collect       himself. ``The thing I'm most proud of is everybody who       walked behind me has all their limbs, and came back safe. And       if the cost of it was getting cancer, that's fine.''    Mr. McGOVERN: Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, the world is watching. And I am not going  to be lectured by someone who takes their marching orders from Donald  Trump, who said that Putin's invasion of Ukraine was a genius and savvy  move. I wish the gentleman would have condemned that.   Listening to that speech, you would think that Joe Biden invaded  Ukraine. I mean, he spent all this time criticizing Joe Biden, John  Kerry, and everybody else but hardly criticized Vladimir Putin.   You know, look, I also wish, because I think it would be helpful for  this country and a signal to the world, if the gentleman who just spoke  would reprimand Members of his own party who cozy up to white  nationalists and go to pro-Putin rallies. That would send a signal to  people in this country and to people around the world on whose side we  are on.   Bottom line is, the people of Ukraine are being invaded by a brutal  dictator, Vladimir Putin. And when their standard-bearer, Donald Trump,  was in charge, he spread propaganda about Ukrainian interference in the  2016 election, which was a lie. He ousted a well-regarded U.S.  Ambassador to Ukraine because they weren't doing what he wanted to in  terms of finding dirt on his political opponents. He froze military  assistance to Ukraine; they said nothing. He withheld a White House  meeting with Zelensky, turned Ukraine policy over to Giuliani--I could  go on and on and on.   We are not going to be lectured by them. Instead, we are going to  move forward and pass a bill to help America's veterans, with or  without them.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, before I conclude, I want to thank and acknowledge Jeff  Gohringer, who has served as the communications director for the House  Committee on Rules in both the majority and minority over the last 6  years. Today is his last day with the Committee on Rules, and I speak  for Members and staff on both sides of the aisle when I say to Jeff  that we are grateful  [[Page H1198]]  for your years of service in this institution. We wish you well in your  future endeavors, and you will always have a home here.   I also thank James Fitzella, who is leaving as well. The staff are  incredible on the Committee on Rules, and James will be dearly missed.   Mr. Speaker, let me just close by saying that we heard a lot on the  other side and barely a mention about our veterans. The gentlewoman  from Washington, who came on the floor just recently and read the oil  company talking points, couldn't even bring herself to mention veterans  once.   The bill that we are talking about here today is to make sure  veterans who have been exposed to toxic chemicals, who get cancer, who  get other ailments, get the healthcare they need.   You would like to think that we could all come together on it. The  gentleman from Pennsylvania keeps on talking about this narrow bill. I  mean, they are not even serious about it because if they were, they  would have used the previous question vote, which would give them the  right to control the floor, to bring that up. But they didn't. Instead,  they are bringing up an oil company's wish list.   This really is obnoxious. I get it. They don't like President Biden,  and they will let no crisis go by without trying to make it about  President Biden.   But let me just say this: We should be together in standing with the  people of Ukraine, and we should be together in standing with our  veterans.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 950         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 6858) to strengthen United States energy security,       encourage domestic production of crude oil, petroleum       products, and natural gas, and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6858.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
