 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Fernando Valenzuela,  former pitcher and current Spanish-language broadcaster for the Los  Angeles Dodgers. He is a husband, father, grandfather, and on top of  that he is a cultural icon for Latinos worldwide.                                time  1730    Coming up on August 11, 2023, the Los Angeles Dodgers will be  retiring his number, Number 34.   This honor will cement his legacy with other Dodger greats such as  Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, and Sandy Koufax. It is certainly a  fitting tribute.   Fernando Valenzuela's name is synonymous with Los Angeles sports  culture. His nickname, ``El Toro,'' and his iconic, unorthodox pitching  windup, raising his hands above his head and glancing skyward before  tossing his deadly screwball, is just as much a staple of Los Angeles  sports history as Kobe Bryant's 81-point game or Vin Scully's legendary  calls, but his impact extends far beyond Los Angeles.   Fernando's humble origins and charisma made him an inspirational icon  for Latinos across not only just Los Angeles, but the entire Nation. He  expanded the footprint of Latino players in the sport, building on the  legacy of Latino players like Roberto Clemente transforming the  demographics of baseball's fan base and player base.   Fernando's inspirational story reflects the awesome potential that  all immigrants can achieve their dreams right here in America.   I am honored to stand before you today, Mr. Speaker, to share some of  that beautiful and amazing history.   Fernando Valenzuela was the youngest of 12 children born to an  impoverished family in the town of Etchohuaquila, Sonora, Mexico, in  1960. His parents, Avelino and Maria, were farm workers of native Mayo  descent.   While pitching in the Mexican league for the Mayos de Navojoa in  1979, Valenzuela stunned famous Dodger scout, Mike Brito, with his  talent. After falling behind 3-0 in the count, Fernando tossed three  perfect strikes to close out the game, prompting Brito and the Dodgers  to take a gamble on Fernando. It took just over 1 year for Fernando to  ascend to the majors.   After signing Valenzuela in the summer of 1979, the Dodgers assigned  him to the Lodi Dodgers of the High-A level California league, then to  the San Antonio Dodgers of the Texas league.   His stay in the minor leagues was short-lived, and in September of  1980, Valenzuela was called up to the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the last  month of the season, Valenzuela helped the Dodgers by pitching 17  scoreless relief innings.   One year later, Fernando would experience a season that can only be  characterized as a spectacular dream come true. 1981 for the city of  Los Angeles was our bicentennial, but really, only one word can  describe 1981 in L.A.: Fernandomania.   After a teammate suffered a last-minute injury, manager Tommy Lasorda  named Fernando to be the Dodgers' opening day starter.   Fernando won his first eight starts, including five shutouts. After  returning from a midseason strike, Fernando won the Cy Young Award,  Rookie of the Year, Silver Slugger, and a World Series.   Fernando kept his streak alive off the field. He married the love of  his life, Linda. The ceremony was attended by 4,000 people and drew  congratulations from then-President Ronald Reagan. Fernando and his  wife, Linda, have four children. The couple celebrated their 41st  anniversary last year.   Fernando would continue to pitch for 15 years with five additional  teams, adding to his resume a no-hitter and six consecutive All-Star  selections.   Fernando's impact on the field was phenomenal, and his greatest  impact was actually off the field.   Before Fernando, baseball largely ignored Mexico as a scouting  destination. Since Mel Almada, the first Mexico-born Major League  Baseball player, debuted in 1933, Mexican players accumulated little  name recognition and few accolades beyond Bobby Avila and his batting  title in 1954.   While Fernando was not the first Mexican-born player on the Dodgers,  he reached a new stratosphere of skill and popularity. His talent  helped catapult Mexico into a coveted destination for Major League  scouting and funding. Fernando blazed a trail for future Mexican greats  like pitchers Yovani Gallardo and Teddy Higuera.   He helped build that infrastructure that cultivated the careers of  fellow  [[Page H4130]]  Mexican Dodgers like Ismael Valdez, Esteban Loaiza, Adrian Gonzalez,  and World Series champion, Julio Urias.   Fernandomania transformed Los Angeles baseball from a sport for the  White upper-class people into a cultural staple cherished by people of  all colors, creeds, and backgrounds. He truly transformed not only the  Dodgers but Los Angeles history.   We must not forget the ugly history between the Dodgers and the  families of Chavez Ravine. We must not forget the dark horrible events  in history where hundreds of Latino families and other poor families of  color were pushed out of their homes by the city of Los Angeles to  build Dodgers Stadium. This bitterness from the Latino community has  lasted for decades, and some of it still lingers in the hearts and the  minds of many.   Fernando was able to be that bridge to unite everybody in Los Angeles  under that shade of Dodger blue. Fueled by an outpouring of Latino  fans, Fernando sold out 11 of his first 12 home starts and pushed the  Dodgers home attendance to a Major League Baseball record of 3.6  million fans in 1982.   Just like many Latinos, Fernando donned the modest demeanor of a man  of humble origins. Fernando's improbable journey from a Mexican pueblo  to the center of the baseball universe instilled a sense of optimism  for all Latinos, many of whom had recently immigrated or were  struggling with meager salaries and very, very difficult jobs and  conditions.   To the Latino community, Fernando was a peer and an inspiration and  the embodiment of the dreams that do come true.   Fernando's impact on Latino communities extends far beyond my home  city of Los Angeles. Latinos from coast to coast saw a reflection of  themselves in Fernando.   When the Dodgers packed their bags for a road trip, opposing teams  would sell 13,000 more tickets per game when Fernando took the mound  compared to other Dodger starters.    Fernando was aware of his impact. During the height of his career,  Fernando said: ``I knew I was representing Mexico to many people. I was  aware of that.''   Yet this titanic burden of embodying the face of a nation may still  have been an underestimation.   Throughout the Americas, from the United States, Mexico, the  Caribbean, and Central America to South America, people turned out in  droves to catch a glimpse of Fernando. He didn't merely represent  Mexico. He represented all of us.   Perhaps one of the most qualified persons to speak on the impact of  Fernandomania is Jaime Jarrin, the Dodger's Spanish-language  broadcaster. He broadcasted for 64 years. Jaime began announcing games  for the Dodgers in the 1950s as part of Major League Baseball's first- ever, full-time Spanish-language broadcast.   Jaime concluded his groundbreaking 64-year career when he retired  last year. He called games during Valenzuela's entire Dodgers tenure  and shared the broadcast booth with Valenzuela for over a decade and a  half.   Jaime has made no secret of the respect and admiration he holds for  his colleague, Fernando Valenzuela. Jaime has said that Valenzuela drew  more fans than any other player in baseball history because he tapped  into an entirely new demographic. According to Jaime, before  Valenzuela, the percentage of Latinos at Dodger games sat in the single  digits. After a few years, that number ballooned to 30 percent, and  today it has grown to almost 50 percent, including my family members,  my children, and my grandchildren.   In Jaime's words, Fernando created interest in baseball among people  who did not know what baseball was. His monumental impact transformed  the Dodgers and all Major League Baseball into a beacon of diversity  both on and off the field and in the stands.   Few players could be more deserving of his number being retired than  Fernando.   I congratulate Fernando Valenzuela for his number being retired.   I call on the Baseball Writers' Association of America and the  Veterans' Affairs Committee to induct Fernando Valenzuela to the  National Baseball Hall of Fame.   His career and cultural influence, including his ongoing work within  the Dodgers on their Spanish-language broadcast is a true inspiration  to everyone.   I honor the incredible career of Fernando Valenzuela as he takes his  place enshrined forever in Dodger history.   I look forward to seeing Number 34 next to the greats such as Jackie  Robinson's Number 42 and Sandy Koufax's Number 32.   As the great Dodger announcer Vin Scully said after Fernando threw  his no-hitter on June 29, 1990, against the St. Louis Cardinals: ``If  you have a sombrero, throw it to the sky.''   This is just a glimpse of the impact and the life of the legendary  pitcher Fernando Valenzuela.   I think it is important that we all understand that we do live in a  great, great country. It is amazing to see when people have an  opportunity to come to our great country, they truly are allowed to be  the best that they can be.   Fernando and many, many other people who have come to this country  have exuded that, and I truly do believe that immigrants who come to  our great country are incredibly grateful not only for their  opportunities but the love and loyalty that they show and have for the  great country of the United States of America.   I also say on behalf of my colleagues, especially my Los Angeles  colleagues who couldn't be here today and who would have loved to share  some of their stories about what Fernandomania and what Fernando  Valenzuela means to them, how proud we all are that they are retiring  his number which is a tremendous, tremendous honor that only comes to  very few in any sport.   I also want to share my own family's story and history with Fernando  Valenzuela.   My mother and father came from Mexico. My father never participated  in sports. He only went to school to the first grade. My mother went to  school to the second grade. They were too poor to engage in sports.   At the age of 5 and 6, their job was to work to help the family just  get by. My parents came to this country and certainly appreciated every  opportunity they were afforded here, especially watching their 11  American-borne citizens in Los Angeles grow to our potential.   I remember my mother would ask me: ``Esta jugando Fernando?'' ``Is  Fernando playing today?''   If I said yes, then Jaime Jarrin in Spanish on the radio got turned  on, and she listened to the whole game.   To be honest with you, Mr. Speaker, my mother, Maria, really didn't  understand baseball, but she was proud of the fact that somebody from  her country of Mexico was showing a positive impact and was competing  with the best right here in our country of America.   She didn't have to understand baseball, but she understood that this  young man, Fernando Valenzuela, was giving it his best, competing with  the best, and making her and millions of people proud because he was a  positive and shining example of what good people can do when given the  opportunity to shine.   It is my honor to say congratulations to Fernando Valenzuela and to  tell him in his native tongue: ``Te lo mereces,'' ``You deserve this.''   I am honored to be a Member of the United States Congress, and this  is a great opportunity for me to honor this great person, the wonderful  human being, who has exuded everything that every parent, every  teacher, and every person wants all of our young people to become: good  and responsible adults who take the best opportunities that they have  been given and make the best of it.                      Honoring Dr. Firouz Michael Naderi     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a man who inspired  us to reach for the stars, Dr. Firouz Michael Naderi.   Dr. Naderi was born in Shiraz, Iran. He came to the United States and  received an electrical engineering degree from the Iowa State  University and the University of Southern California.                                time  1745    He returned to his native Iran, where he worked for the state remote  sensing agency, but the turmoil of the Iranian Revolution in 1979  brought Dr. Naderi to the United States, where he served our country as  part of NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, otherwise known as JPL, in Pasadena,  California.  [[Page H4131]]    When Dr. Naderi retired, NASA awarded him the Distinguished Service  Medal and named an asteroid after him.   In his post-NASA career, Dr. Naderi was a vocal advocate for human  rights and civil rights. He demonstrated the strength, power, and  kindness of the Iranian community while speaking truth to power against  all injustices.   I stand here to celebrate and honor the incredible life of my friend,  Dr. Firouz Naderi, who was lost too soon last month.   Dr. Naderi was someone who saw no borders, no lines, no separating of  people on this blue marble spinning around the Sun that we call Earth.   Dr. Firouz Naderi was born on March 15, 1946, and left Iran in 1964.  In 1969, he earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from  Iowa State University and, in 1972, a master's degree in electrical  engineering from the University of Southern California; in 1996, a  Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Southern  California.   When he returned to Iran, as I mentioned earlier, he was forced to  leave his beloved country and came back to California, to the United  States, where he pursued the distinguished career that has made him one  of NASA and JPL's most amazing scientists.   He was JPL's associate director for project formulation and strategy  and director of solar system exploration. In 2000, he became head of  the Mars Exploration Program and, in 2005, received NASA's  Distinguished Service Medal.   From 2000 to 2012, he led six consecutive, successful American  missions to Mars--four landers and two orbiters--on January 4, 2004,  landing the Spirit rover and on January 25, 2004, landing the  Opportunity rover.   He was a recipient of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. He was a board  member of various organizations, the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian  Americans, Arasteh-Amin Foundation, Keep Children in School Foundation,  and Iranica Encyclopedia.   In February 2016, the International Astronomical Union named an  asteroid after Dr. Naderi. In 2017, he accepted the Academy Award for  Best Foreign Language Film, which was by Asghar Farhadi and called  ``The Salesman,'' with Anousheh Ansari.   I am honored to be a United States Congressman, and it gives me great  pleasure and honor to take the opportunity and privilege of honoring  people like Dr. Naderi.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
