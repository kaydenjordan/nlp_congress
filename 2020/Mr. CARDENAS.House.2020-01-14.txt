 Madam Speaker, right here in Washington, D.C., I had  the honor of speaking to families and to 15 beautiful youth, American  citizens of the United States of America who are going to be the future  doctors, researchers, and teachers of this great United States of  America.   What did they have in common? They were all Hispanic youth from this  region on the East Coast of the United States, 15 young people who are  talking about their dreams for curing cancer, their dreams of becoming  teachers to inspire the youth of America. These are the kinds of young  people who make this America great.   Another thing that they had in common: most of their parents' primary  language was Spanish. But let me tell you, people of this great Nation,  the parents whom I met last night love this country so much and  appreciate all the opportunities that their wonderful American citizen  children have the opportunity to aspire to and to achieve.   Again, we have a great, eclectic Nation, and I was so pleased to meet  those 15 young people who already are leaders in our great Nation and  will be the leaders of today and tomorrow because this country is  great.                            ____________________
