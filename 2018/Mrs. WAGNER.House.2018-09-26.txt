 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of working families  across the country who are trying to make ends meet.   As a mother, a grandmother, and someone who has employed moms and  dads, I know that raising a family is a great joy, but it can also be a  great source of anxiety. Children are a blessing, but raising a family  introduces serious challenges and costs.   In Missouri, the average annual cost of center-based infant care is  estimated to be $8,632. That is $719 a month. Infant care in Missouri  costs $634 more per year than instate tuition at a 4-year public  college, and it is unaffordable for so very many families.   According to a study published by the Economic Policy Institute, a  daycare center for two children--an infant and, say, a 4-year-old-- costs $17,940. That is 102 percent more than the average rent in  Missouri. A typical family in Missouri has to spend a shocking 30  percent of their income on daycare for their two children.   In fact, it is estimated that the cost of childcare for two children  exceeds annual median rent payments in every State. Paying for  childcare is just plain hard for every working family I have spoken  with in the State of Missouri.   In the 1970s, Congress heard America's families loud and clear and  created the dependent care flexible spending accounts. These accounts  allow parents to contribute pretax dollars to pay for qualified out-of- pocket dependent care expenses.   They are not only for children. These accounts can also be used to  pay for adult dependents who use adult daycare, eldercare or similar  services.   It is a great program, but it has not kept up with the needs of  today's families. Despite rising childcare costs, Congress has not  raised the FSA contribution cap since 1986. That is why, this week, I  am introducing the Child and Dependent Care Modernization Act.   This bill will modernize the maximum amount a family can contribute  to dependent care flexible spending accounts to track with the real  costs of dependent care today. It will also index the maximum  contribution limit so that the value of an FSA will increase in the  future as dependent care costs increase.   Another challenge that many families enrolled in an FSA experience is  the ``use-it-or-lose-it'' rule. If parents don't use the full balance  in their FSA before the year ends, they forfeit their unused money,  limiting the ability of parents to save for ongoing costs of care. My  bill will allow unused funds to roll over into the next plan year and  return a little more freedom and flexibility to America's families.   This bill is part of my legislative work to make the lives of  Missouri's families just a little easier. I look forward to introducing  this legislation and working with my colleagues to make it law.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Tipton. I rise today  to speak on behalf of the bipartisan Empowering Financial Institutions  to Fight Human Trafficking Act.   The International Labor Organization estimates that, globally, over  40 million people were victims of human trafficking in 2016. It is  obvious that in order to deter the criminals who enslave and sell human  beings, we need to hit them where it hurts: their bank accounts.   Right now, financial institutions are attempting to identify human  trafficking activity, but many suspicious activity reports are based on  false flags. Financial institutions are largely left alone to determine  what information is valid. Without good, specific, verifiable, targeted  information, financial institutions may wrongly identify people,  overrespond, and overtarget, or fail to recognize criminal activity.   Finding the traffickers who take advantage of our financial system  can be a daunting task. We need to figure out how to do it better. This  legislation is an opportunity to help financial institutions wade  through the muck and locate bad actors.   This summer, the Financial Action Task Force released a report that  identified significant challenges in detecting, investigating, and  prosecuting laundering related to human trafficking, including,  ``incomplete domestic information sharing among stakeholders.''   That is why I was proud to introduce the Empowering Financial  Institutions to Fight Human Trafficking Act with my colleague and  fellow advocate, Congresswoman Maloney, along with Congresswoman Love,  Congresswoman Tenney, and Congresswoman Sinema.   Over the past year, I have worked in the Financial Services Committee  to explore how human traffickers exploit U.S. financial markets. In  January, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which I  chaired, held a hearing to examine how financial institutions monitor  accounts and identify trafficking. We know that if traffickers can't  finance their operations, they can't profit from their crimes.   This bill creates a pathway for registered nonprofits to safely  provide valuable information on trafficking crimes to financial  institutions, without the threat of defamation suits that could end  their organizations.   Throughout the process of crafting this bill, I have found that banks  are increasingly seeking actionable information from the nonprofits  that specialize in gathering it. It is incredibly challenging for  financial institutions to pinpoint trafficking crimes that are  happening far away in mines, in fields, in factories, hotels, or boats,  obscured from analysts who are trying to practice good customer due  diligence.   Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. This legislation instructs the  Secretary of the Treasury to develop a process that will make civil  society experts more available to financial institutions and establish  transparent standards for information sharing.   The bill guides the Secretary to register only NGOs that have the  rigor and expertise to substantiate their claims and correct any  inaccurate information.   I am excited that we are finding ways to connect those who have good  intelligence with those who are seeking it without exposing nonprofits  to devastating lawsuits they can ill afford.  [[Page H9054]]  This system will target verified traffickers and reduce reliance on  nonspecific information that can target innocent people.   I look forward to casting my vote to prevent human traffickers from  using the U.S. financial system to exploit victims around the world.  Together, this Congress can disrupt the networks that make modern-day  slavery profitable and free vulnerable people around the world who have  been enslaved.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I would like to reiterate, despite what some have said  about this piece of legislation, that this legislation requires NGOs to  register with Treasury in order to create a process that protects only  rigorous, credible organizations that can offer verifiable information  to financial institutions. This process will safeguard innocent people  and entities that may currently be targeted by the broad, general  patterns that are reported to financial institutions.   At present, there is no way for financial institutions to wade  through all the tips and information they receive and use it to prevent  traffickers from using our financial systems. We need a meaningful  system that can actually identify traffickers and allow banks to verify  those IDs. That is what this bill does.   I would also like to make clear that this piece of legislation does  not amend or touch the PATRIOT Act and does not create any new  structures for banks to share information with each other.   This legislation is supported by organizations, including, Mr.  Speaker, Western Union, MoneyGram, and Liberty Asia. It also happens to  be one of the key recommendations from Polaris' groundbreaking new  report: ``A Road Map for Systems and Industries to Prevent and Disrupt  Human Trafficking.''   Mr. Speaker, I include the report in the Record.         2. Pass legislation to provide safe harbor to facilitate       information sharing between civil society and financial       institutions        NGOs that work with survivors and vulnerable populations       often have access to critical information about bad actors.       Regulations focused on the sharing of information between       financial institutions or between financial institutions and       government agencies, such as Section 314(a) and (b) of the       USA Patriot Act or the regulations for filing Suspicious       Activity Reports (SARs), provide appropriate protections for       such sharing. No such protections are currently available to       NGOs for sharing critical information that may assist in the       detection, deterrence or prevention of trafficking.        While NGO's are currently able to report tips directly to       law enforcement, the information may be too limited to       realistically spur law enforcement action--often because the       information is obtained from confidential sources who cannot       be contacted by law enforcement. However, if these leads were       provided to financial institutions, the financial       institutions may be able to assist in providing additional,       relevant, and actionable information to law enforcement.        Addressing the liability concerns of NGO's which wish to       participate in information exchanges is an important first       step in actualizing this process. Legislation is required to       provide these protections to NGOs. Once this barrier is       removed, law enforcement, NGO's, and financial institutions       can work together to develop agreed upon processes and       protocols that govern appropriate information sharing.     Mr. Speaker, Dow Jones has said that the information  provided to it from NGOs like Liberty Asia and others is relevant and  actionable in its anti-money laundering work.   This bill enables FinCEN and financial institutions to gather hard  intelligence that can be verified or disproven, rather than rely on, as  I said, general, useless, or even faulty tips from nonprofits, private  citizens, and other sources without technical experience that could  lead to false identifications and persecution of innocent actors.   It is the lack of verifiable specificity and the lack of regulated  accreditation that allows for the targeting of innocent groups.   This bill creates a process, run by Treasury, where responsible  nonprofits that professionally analyze information and create  intelligence products that help financial institutions better identify  these crimes can share information without worrying about whether  sharing this information is going to end their organizations.   I could go on and on, but Members of this body should never forget  what we are doing today is protecting the 40 million victims of  trafficking around the world.   Human trafficking is a horrific crime that represents $150 billion  per year, and it is far too often funded by the U.S. financial system.  This is preventable, and today, we are taking steps towards ending  America's financing of exploitation of our most vulnerable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
