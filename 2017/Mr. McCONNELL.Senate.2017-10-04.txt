 Mr. President, yesterday, Chairman Hatch held another  hearing on a subject that is incredibly important to the economic  future of our country: tax reform.   For too long, our economy has failed to live up to its full  potential. For too long, Americans have suffered through stagnant  paychecks, a lack of steady work, and retirement that can seem to slip  further away by the day. These are the forgotten men, women, and  families of the last decade. For many Americans living on the coasts,  working in Silicon Valley, or in finance, the recession of 2008 to 2009  may seem like just a moment in history, but for too many Americans, the  last 10 years have been a lost decade where our economy has stumbled  along and opportunities have declined for American workers and their  families.   Tax reform represents the single most important thing we can do today  to get our economy back on track and give American workers a leg up. It  is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to replace an outdated tax code  that holds us back with one that works for American families and small  businesses. We want to lower taxes and simplify rates. We want to  expand job creation and grow paychecks. Put another way, we want to  take more money out of Washington's pocket and put it in yours. That is  the essential goal of tax reform. That is our message to the American  people. It is what I believe. It is what Chairman Hatch believes. It is  what Chairman Enzi believes as well.   Chairman Enzi has an important role to play in this process, too,  because later today he will lead his committee in marking up a  comprehensive budget for fiscal year 2018 that will help our country  achieve balance by reining in Federal spending. It will also help our  economy grow, and one of the ways it will do so is by providing  legislative tools to advance tax reform. I thank the Budget Committee  for all its good work so far, and I look forward to its continued  efforts to get our fiscal house in order and our economy back on a path  to solid growth after the lost decade of disappointment I just spoke  about.                            ____________________     Mr. President, earlier this week, I filed cloture  motions on four qualified nominees for various agencies throughout the  Federal Government. I shouldn't have had to. In different times, we may  have even considered them on voice votes. But this is where we are, and  now it is time to advance and confirm them as soon as possible.   Later this morning, the Senate will consider Eric Hargan to be Deputy  Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. As the people  of Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands continue to  recover from a series of devastating hurricanes, Mr. Hargan's expertise  in disaster response and public health will help the Department respond  to these crises. I look forward to confirming Mr. Hargan soon so he can  help coordinate multiple agencies under his supervision to respond to  the hurricanes, deliver relief, and help save lives.  [[Page S6294]]    After that, this afternoon we will take up the nomination of Randal  Quarles, the President's nominee to help oversee the Federal Reserve  System. Mr. Quarles brings with him both domestic and international  financial experience from multiple administrations, and he will be a  strong guide for our Nation's monetary policy. We also intend to  confirm Mr. Quarles to the position of Vice Chair for Supervision. This  is an essential role created by Dodd-Frank, and it is critical that Mr.  Quarles begin this work over at the Fed.   Tomorrow, the Senate will confirm Lee Francis Cissna to be Director  of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Mr. Cissna has a wealth  of experience in immigration policy, serving in senior policy positions  in both the Bush and Obama administrations and then working for the  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He was voted out of  committee with bipartisan support. I look forward to his confirmation  to this important role.   Then we will consider Callista Gingrich, whom the President has  nominated to be our Nation's Ambassador to the Holy See. Ms. Gingrich's  work will continue the strong relationship between our Nation and the  Vatican, building upon shared values, goals, and global  responsibilities.   I thank each of these nominees for their willingness to serve our  Nation. They are each well qualified and suited for their role. I look  forward to the Senate confirming them very soon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  congratulate Dr. Tom Appleton of Lexington, KY, on his retirement from  the History Department at Eastern Kentucky University. One of  Kentucky's premier historians, Tom has spent his career writing about  the Commonwealth's rich heritage. He joined EKU's faculty in the fall  of 2000, and over the years, he has left a positive imprint on his  students, his field, and his State.   He has also proved to be an invaluable resource for me. A number of  years ago, I began a series of talks focused on former U.S. Senators  from Kentucky. In each speech, I have tried to convey a bit of  political history through the lives of these distinguished individuals.  Tom's counsel has been invaluable in my work to prepare these speeches  and pay tribute to some of Kentucky's prominent political leaders.   Before joining EKU's faculty nearly 20 years ago, Tom spent more than  two decades at the Kentucky Historical Society. It certainly shows.  Even the TV show ``Jeopardy'' has used him as a historical resource.  Tom has been the coeditor of six books on the history of the American  South, including a groundbreaking look into the lives of Kentucky  women, and he is currently working on a biography of Kentucky's own  A.B. ``Happy'' Chandler, who served as Governor, Senator, and  baseball's second commissioner. Tom's passion for Kentucky's rich  history is obvious.   He has been a wonderful friend and resource for me, a real champion  and advocate for our Commonwealth, and has made a lasting impact on the  next generation through his teaching. As one former student recalled,  ``Dr. Appleton's mission in teaching Kentucky history was less about  imparting facts and dates and more about ensuring that students  departed the class with an enhanced understanding of the rich cultural  tapestry of Kentucky. He admonished students to be worthy of the proud  legacy of our Commonwealth's great statesmen, military leaders,  writers, and sports legends.'' That is a legacy to be proud of.   After his final semester of teaching, Tom could be forgiven for  wanting to retire from his work as a historian altogether, but that is  not Tom. He plans to continue his research and writing about the lives  and events that shaped our home State, and I plan to continue reading  his fascinating take on our shared Kentucky heritage.   I wish Tom well, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  congratulating Dr. Tom Appleton on a truly remarkable career.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
