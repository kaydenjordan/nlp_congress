 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes to  address the Senate.    Mr. President, the Senate is finally holding long overdue  votes on nominees to the Export-Import Bank of the United States. To  me, this is about Ohio businesses; this is about American workers; and  this is about the dignity of work. All three of these nominees are  qualified.   For nearly 4 years, the Export-Import Bank has been forced to stop  most of the work supporting American jobs. A small group of opponents,  supported by special interests in this town, tried to kill this bank  altogether. Ex-Im has been paralyzed because of leadership in  [[Page S2710]]  this body and because of the President and the Vice President of the  United States. The Bank is technically open but can't approve any  transaction greater than $10 million.   The Senate's inaction, the President's inaction, and the Vice  President's inaction have hurt Ohio manufacturers. In the past, Ohio  companies exported more than $400 million a year in products using  Export-Import Bank credit assistance. That amount has been cut nearly  in half. That means jobs. It means good-paying industrial jobs. If the  President and Republicans in Congress were serious about helping  American manufacturers after years and years of obstruction, which they  have done, they would approve these nominees and work with us to  authorize the Bank this summer.   My colleagues have a choice: Do they care about these businesses; do  they care about manufacturing; do they care about workers; do they care  about the dignity of workers; or do they care more about their extreme  special interest politics?   I stand with our workers. I will vote to reopen the Export-Import  Bank.   Thank you.
