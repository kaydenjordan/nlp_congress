 Mr. President, due to a memorial service in  Michigan, I was unable to attend today's rollcall vote on the  nomination of Kenneth P.  [[Page S3394]]  Rapuano to be Assistant Secretary of Defense. Had I been able to  attend, I would have supported his nomination.                            ____________________
