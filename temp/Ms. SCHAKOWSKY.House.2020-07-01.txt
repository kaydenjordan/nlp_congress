 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the en bloc  amendment. I also rise to thank Chairman DeFazio for including the Hot  Cars Act in the base bill.   There are far too many ways that parents can lose their children that  we can't control. There are diseases that take the lives of our kids  that we are just not equipped today to stop. But we have a duty to do  everything that we can to ensure that parents don't lose a child when  we can prevent it.   Fifty-three children died of heatstroke in cars last year. In most  cases, parents--good parents--accidentally leave their children in  cars. In other cases, kids crawl into an empty car and then somehow  can't get out again.   Education alone cannot solve the problem. Even the most attentive  parents can become distracted and inadvertently leave a child in the  car.   I have talked to those parents. It is a crushing experience, as you  can imagine, one you never get over.   A simple sensor, an alert system, that would notify parents that they  have left a child in their car can save lives.   It is really past time for us to enact this crucial legislation. The  heat of the summer is really just beginning. Let's get to it.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. DeFazio again for including this  bill.
