 Mr. Chair, Ohio families are paying too much for  gasoline. They are paying too much for heat. They are paying too much  at the grocery store, partly due to rising production costs on farms.   A recent survey by ABC and The Washington Post found that roughly 40  percent of Americans are financially worse off today than they were  just 2 years ago. They are begging for relief from soaring prices, and  Republicans are answering their calls for help.   That is why I am proud to support H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act.  No more relying on dictators for oil. We are going to solve this  problem the American way, with American workers, American ingenuity,  and American energy.   H.R. 1 does this by fixing the broken permit process so that energy  producers can do their jobs faster and cheaper. We are going to unleash  American energy, which will lower costs and get our economy moving in  the right direction.   I urge my colleagues to think of the millions of Americans struggling  to make ends meet. Show them you care and vote for H.R. 1.
