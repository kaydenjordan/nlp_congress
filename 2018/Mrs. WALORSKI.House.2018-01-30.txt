 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Maple Leaf  Farms on celebrating 60 wonderful years. This family-owned operation  has been a staple in northern Indiana and the U.S. duck industry since  1958.   While 60 years of successful operations is a tremendous  accomplishment, Maple Leaf Farms' expansion, production capabilities,  and newest global ventures speak volumes to the dedication and  ingenuity of the Tucker family. I am proud to learn of the strong  business model and outstanding leadership of the Tuckers that has led  Maple Leaf Farms to handle 10 million ducks a year and supply products  worldwide.   It is truly an honor to represent such passionate and committed  Hoosier farmers as the Tuckers. I am grateful for the positive  contributions they have made to our community.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Second District Hoosiers, I want to thank  Maple Leaf Farms for strengthening Indiana's farming community, and I  wish them all the best in their next 60 years.                            ____________________
