 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Israel Security  Supplemental Appropriation Act and how Republicans continue to put  politics over people.   Financial support for Israel after a terrorist attack should be an  easy bipartisan bill to pass. Instead, Republicans are hijacking it to  prevent the richest 1 percent of Americans from paying their fair share  of taxes and preventing lifesaving aid for families caught in the  crossfire. So Republicans would rather protect their billionaire tax  cheating supporters than protect children.   No one should be surprised about it. If the richest 1 percent paid  their fair share, America could gain $3 trillion in the next 10 years  according to economists. Even a portion of that funding would allow us  to support Israel, help Palestinian families, and aid Ukraine, and it  would even reduce the national debt significantly.   Nevertheless, Republicans want to rob the poor to pay the rich, and I  hope American voters are paying attention.                            ____________________
