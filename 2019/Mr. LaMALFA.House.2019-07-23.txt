 Madam Speaker, tonight we voted on a resolution opposing  efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel and oppose the Global  Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, BDS, Movement targeting Israel.   I am a cosponsor of this resolution, but the House should also be  voting on legislation to combat these efforts to undermine one of our  strongest allies, like the Senate did when they passed a bill to  authorize State or local governments to divest assets from entities  deploying BDS against Israel.   But, unfortunately, Democrat leadership refuses to let us vote on  this bill in the House for fear of fractures within their own party.  Just last week, one of their Members actually introduced legislation  that supports this hate-fueled BDS movement, even drawing disgraceful  comparisons between boycotting Israel now and boycotting Nazi Germany  in the 1930s and 1940s.   Let's not forget that the United States and Israel have a long  history of working together to achieve stability in the Middle East,  the inventions they work on together, and they remain one of our  strongest and most loyal allies today.   Our actions in this Chamber need to unequivocally support that  relationship and the lone beacon of freely elected government that is  Israel in the Middle East.   As Golda Meir put it:         We will only have peace when they love their children more       than they hate us.                            ____________________
