 Mr. Speaker, a wall is not remotely capable of dealing  with the magnitude of our continental challenge to civil order. The  forces of commerce, greed, addiction, and lawless cartels and gangs are  too insidious. They will surmount any wall. They already have.   The President's demand for $5 billion for a wall, whether concrete or  steel, simply won't work. Why? Because most illegal narcotics are  already shipped here hidden in cross-border commercial cargoes fueled  by the flawed and underfunded NAFTA and CAFTA continental trade deals.  Millions of trucks, autos, ships, railcars, and planes carry massive  and increasing shipments of cargo traversing over our borders as  continental trade increases exponentially.   Recall that NAFTA and CAFTA sucked out millions of living-wage jobs  from our country, depositing them in Mexico and Central America to  exploit penny-wage labor south of our border. Finished goods were then  U-turned back north.   NAFTA and CAFTA negotiators promised higher wages for all. Nothing  could be further from the truth. Even laborers south of our border earn  less now than before NAFTA passed. There is more poverty here and there  as the transnationals shipped our jobs out to earn higher profits by  gutting our workforce and while exploiting workers in Mexico and  Central America. On both sides of the border, workers lose and  investors win.   This is a map of the Laredo checkpoint. There are 16 lanes of traffic  just at that one point on our border. The problem is the drugs are  often hidden in those commercial cargoes. We need more agents to check  cargo, but we also need technology to find the hidden narcotics that  are there.   In addition to that, we see China shipping fentanyl and carfentanil  into our country, including through the U.S. mails. We have no  scientific way of detecting those killer drugs.   So, if you really want to look at solving the problem, it is  important for the President to know that legal ports of entry are the  primary route through which illicit drugs arrive here in our country.  There are 48 such crossing points, plus 330 points of entry along the  U.S.-Mexico border, the most frequently crossed border in the world.  Approximately 350 million documented crossings occur there annually.   We need to regularize that entry into the United States. We need more  manpower and technology. There is no way we can solve this problem with  a wall.                            ____________________
