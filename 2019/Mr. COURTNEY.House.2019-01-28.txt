 Mr. Speaker, this morning about 800,000 Federal  employees from the 25 percent of the government that had been shut down  for the last 35 days finally were allowed to go back to work and  perform the amazing service that they do for the American people in a  whole host of different agencies.   All of us heard from such great Americans coming from our districts,  and certainly in the Second District of Connecticut, in eastern  Connecticut, was no exception.   So, for example, Clark Chapin, who is the head of the Farm Service  Agency at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, who, again, for 35 days  was unable to work on the different farm programs that are so important  to eastern Connecticut farmers, particularly in the dairy sector with  the new dairy insurance program, his frustration in terms of not being  able to get that program up and running, again, was palpable when I  talked to him about a week or so ago.   We also have the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut,  where, again, that was the one branch of the military that was shut  down because they don't reside in the Department of Defense. They are  in the Department of Homeland Security.   Even though, as Admiral Carl Schultz, who is the Commandant of the  Coast Guard, pointed out on national television, there are Coast Guard  cutters serving in Bahrain in the fifth fleet side by side with the  U.S. Navy patrolling the territorial waters of the Persian Gulf in the  Straits of Hormuz in about the most hazardous waters in the world.  Their Navy counterparts were certainly being paid, but the Coast Guard  sailors and officers were not.   In addition, we have got Coast Guard cutters over in the Indo-Pacific  region doing work in the Straits of Taiwan, again, highly contested  waters. The unique skills that coastguardsmen and -women bring to that  particular type of patrol is essential to our country's national  defense and national security policy.   They, again, are just a couple of examples.   Constituents in the State Department serving overseas in hazardous  duty areas--the FAA, the TSA, the IRS, Commerce--this morning, I heard  from one of the Commerce employees. She went to work this morning. The  payroll system was flooded with folks trying to submit their timecards,  and the system crashed. They are still trying to sort that out so that  people will get not only their paycheck on Friday, but also retroactive  payments.   Last Thursday, again, hours before the settlement finally was reached  and the announcement was made from the White House, I held a telephone  townhall meeting. We had 8,000 listeners from all across the district  and, again, a very vigorous debate, and there was definitely  disagreement about whether there should be a wall on the southern  border or no wall.   But what there was universal agreement about was that shutdowns are  wrong, that shutdowns should never be used as a tool or leverage to  force a policy provision and cripple, again, the working lives of  people who, again, are patriots for this country, but also the  taxpayers who rely on the programs and services that they provide. That  is why, again, it was astonishing to see in The Wall Street Journal,  over the weekend, that President Trump gave an interview where he said  another shutdown is ``certainly an option.''   Mr. Speaker, if we have learned anything as a nation over the last 35  days, it is what those 8,000 folks who participated in my telephone  townhall articulated over and over again: This should not be used as  leverage to force an issue through the Congress. It should go through  normal and regular order.   We have a conference committee from the House and the Senate, from  both parties, that will begin their work over the next couple of weeks  or so to resolve the dispute. There is overlap. There is agreement in  terms of boosting border security.   But no one should be putting down as markers that we are going to  again disrupt the lives of these Americans once again just as they are  starting to finally get back into the office and get  [[Page H1220]]  the work done for the American people. Instead, what we should be doing  is voting, as we are tomorrow, on H.R. 790, which is to overturn  President Trump's executive order of December 28 canceling the pay  increase for non-DOD employees.   Again, some of the very same people whose lives were turned upside  down over the last 35 days are also going to lose their pay increase  based on the President's executive order. The bill we are going to vote  on tomorrow, H.R. 790, is going to overturn that executive order and  give those folks the same pay raise as folks in the Department of  Defense: 2.6 percent. These are people who, again, provide essential  public services for the people of this country.   If nothing else, it was a learning experience over the last month  about how vital that work is in terms of air travel, national defense  and military policy, as well as agriculture and processing of tax  returns at the height of the tax season.   Let's vote on measures that are going to restore and heal this  country over the damage that was done over the last 35 days and take  shutdowns off the table. It is time for shutdown politics to come to an  end.                            ____________________
