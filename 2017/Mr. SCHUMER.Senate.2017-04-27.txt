 Mr. President, I enjoyed hearing my friend and gym  colleague talking about defense. I agree with him; we need a strong  defense. I agree with him that deficits are an enemy of getting the  defense spending that we need. I hope when we consider tax cuts, we  will hear that same view that we can't go deeply into deficit. I  appreciate my colleague's great comments.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.    Mr. President, colleagues, I am objecting because we  still have to resolve the issue of poison pill riders before Democrats  can agree to the short-term CR.   Let's make no mistake about it, we are indeed making great progress.  I thank the majority leader. He has been cooperative and extremely  helpful throughout the process. I thank Chairman Cochran and Senator  Leahy the same. But our position has been clear, and it is nothing new:  no poison pill riders. The sooner we can resolve this issue, the  quicker we can have an agreement on appropriations for 2017.   So I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The majority leader.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would only add--not to prolong the  discussion, but I don't think the failure to pass the 1-week CR  necessarily impacts in a positive way the concerns the Democratic  leader has. But that is his call to make. This 1-week CR is cleared on  our side.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.    Mr. President, there is a simple way to resolve it, and  that is, the Republican leader of the Senate and the Speaker of the  House just agree to no poison pill riders.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.    We are aware.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I  move to table the motion to reconsider.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.   The motion was agreed to.                            ____________________
