 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. Jayapal) for yielding and for her leadership on this Special  Order.   I will take just a moment of the gentlewoman's time because I think  she has captured the essence of the frustration, not that Members of  Congress have, but that the American people have. So I wanted to make  sure that I shared some of the contrasts that we have between what has  happened yesterday and the announcement of the administration of Mr.  Trump's tax proposal, which, in essence, is really a bowl of horror. It  is a continuation of an ineffective 100 days, and the fear that I have  is that it was rushed and put together to meet this really unnecessary  standard or unnecessary test of 100 days, one that was so pronounced  during Mr. Trump's campaign in contrast to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bush, and  Mr. Obama, the last three Presidents that we have as examples.   What is in the first 100 days?   The first 100 days should be working. You should be working every day  and you should have to account or you should be able to account for the  successes that you have done in the normal course of work.  Methodically, you can check off the good that you have done for the  American people; that it comes naturally, that you have been  methodical, that you have worked with Congress, that you worked with  your executives, that you have looked to see what can be improved.   All that we can see is what has been destroyed or dismantled or taxed  or ridiculed. There is nothing that advantages the American people.   Certainly, the healthcare bill was ridiculing the American people. It  was ridiculous. $880 billion was taken from Medicaid; $600 billion was  to be used for tax cuts, which they do not have at this point. We fear  that they will be rushing through such a bill in the next couple of  days.   More importantly, where was the commitment to all of the promises?   So let me just speak to two particular points.   The economic security of women, what has happened under this  administration?   Blocking expanded overtime pay, which disproportionately benefits  women workers. Failing to advance equal pay, paid family leave, and  affordable childcare legislation, talking about it but doing nothing.   Endangering retirement security by blocking a rule requiring  retirement advisers to put clients first.   Can you imagine?   Senior citizens have helped build this country, and you would deny  them adequate counsel on their retirement. That has happened.   All of these have happened under the Trump administration: proposing  severe cuts to the Department of Labor, which would hinder enforcement  of family and medical leave. Of course, cutting Meals on Wheels, as has  been indicated. Cutting the National Institutes of Health. Major  lifesaving research down the drain. Scientists looking for other  countries to go to because they have no room at the inn.   And then making student debt harder to pay off by rescinding a rule  that limits the fees that loan companies can charge its borrowers.  Remember, those borrowers are 18, 19, 20, 21 years old. They are the  next generation or the current generation of the builders of this  economy and this society.   Then to add insult to injury, if I might say, yesterday a big  pronouncement announced over the weekend the biggest, fattest tax cut  you could ever have or tax reform that you would ever have. Of course,  everyone knows in America this is not tax reform. This is a simple  bunch of tax cuts that will have a competition between debt and  deficit. This will be a spiraling downward trend digging America into  the deepest hole of debt and deficit in the history of the United  States.    Trillions of dollars spent on individuals and corporations that do  not need it.   How do I know?   I have spoken to them, and there is a whole litany of corporate  issues that are not being answered.   For example, the idea of being able to deduct interest payments is  nowhere to be found. That might help middle class working families, as  well as corporations and small businesses.   What you have is trickle-down economics. President Trump's tax plan  is built on the same trickle-down economics that withered inequality  and undermined working families.   There are massive tax breaks for Trump himself. In the course of his  days that he may have paid taxes--and let me be very clear that we  don't know what impact this tax bill would have on him because we do  not have his tax returns. But we do know, in the last time we have  records, he had to pay $39 million in taxes because of the alternative  minimum tax put in place in 1986 by President Reagan.   Can you imagine?   If there was not the AMT--alternative minimum tax--he would be paying  $5 million.                                time  1645    Well, ladies and gentlemen, my dear colleagues, they have eliminated  in this tax bill the AMT. That sounds suspicious, and it shouldn't  sound suspicious. It is suspicious, and the reality of it is it is  self-promoting and self-happening.   Then, of course, these tax cuts are moving the corporate rate from 35  to 15. Let me make a breaking news announcement. Most corporations pay  about 14, but with the 35 moved to 15, maybe they will pay zero.   Who is going to be part of the overall supporting and investment in  this Nation, to build our infrastructure, to create jobs, to build the  new level of energy, new technology, to ensure that health care is  provided for those who need it, to make sure that the Affordable Care  Act continues to cover the millions of people that need it instead of  cutting 24 million people?   Well, with the tax cuts in place, there is a rush to judgment. That  judgment is a pronouncement of a complete deficit hole for the American  people. That is what this tax cut does. There are no benefits for  working class Americans or middle class Americans. There is no  incentive to create jobs. In fact, I have no idea what the thinking or  planning was that went into the President's tax plan.   All I know is that the American people who get up every day and go to  work, or those who get up every day and get three or four buses to go  to work--and part of the time that they are going to work, they have to  drop off their children at a school that may not be in their  neighborhood because there is a need for more investment in education.  All I know is that those people whom I am so proud to be able to  represent, as well as large businesses and small businesses that, I  believe, as I have listened to corporate leaders just a few hours ago  saying, ``We are with you all. We want what is best for America. This  is not what we desire, not to give all to us or the top 1 percent. We  want to help America grow because, as America grows, our companies  thrive, our shareholders thrive,'' that is not the message of this  administration.   So I am delighted to join the Congressional Progressive Caucus to ask  the question of the Trump administration: Are you so worried about the  100  [[Page H2933]]  days that you cannot worry about the American people? Is 100 days more  important than the mother who is traveling to work 3 and 4 hours? Is  100 days more important than the traveling salesmen who need the kind  of infrastructure and roads that work? or those in southern America  that need the kind of rural electric system that helps them? or those  that need clean energy? or those that need research for the next cure  for sickle cell anemia?   Is your 100 days so important that you cannot provide resources for  law enforcement and firefighters and first responders, that you cannot  provide help for the national parks, the National Endowment for the  Arts, and you cannot provide direction to the Department of Justice,  which has turned itself into the injustice, unjust department,  exploring ideas of taking away civil rights, denying individuals their  rights as citizens in the United States in terms of discrimination and  equality, opportunity or, in actuality, creating the one thing that you  can be proud of, and that is the deportation task force that is  demonizing hardworking individuals who simply want an opportunity for  their families?   So I would only say that I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me,  and I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin), as well, for his  presence here and others that will come and ask the question: Are all  these people that we have listed less important than your 100 days? I  am saddened if the answer is yes.   Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and  who is leading tonight ``Congressional Progressive Caucus Special Order  the impact of President Trump's Tax Cut Plan.''   As a member of the House Budget Committee, I would participate in any  Committee's markup of a tax reform bill.   President Trump's much anticipated tax plan is another  disappointment; a poor work product; something he should have been  ashamed to put his name on; and it reveals yet again what many warned  about before the election.   This President is unprepared for his office, and he shows either no  capacity or interest in on the job training.   This tax plan in any school of business would get a failing grade.   A one page federal tax cut plan--really is an insult to the American  People.   This plan shows no command of the facts regarding our nation's very  complex tax system.   President Trump's tax plan, just as his healthcare reform proposal,  and immigration reform proposal would hurt working families and  disproportionately favor the wealthy and large corporations at the  expense of the nation's middle class.   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin set out a test for tax reform that,  ``there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class.''   But the president's tax plan has failed this test miserably by  providing a huge tax cut for the wealthy while middle income families  would receive very little benefit.   In fact, Trump's tax plan provides a huge tax benefit for him  personally. Using his 2005 tax return numbers, President Trump would  save about $28.6 million in taxes under his plan.   About $27 million of those savings is due to the reduction of the  pass through income rate to 15%.   President Trump's tax proposal blows a hole in the nation's deficit.   It's become painfully obvious that the deficit only matters when a  Democrat is President.   The plan is not revenue neutral. In fact, early press reports  indicate that the Trump proposal is likely to add several trillions of  dollars to our deficit.   Busting the deficit the way the Trump tax plan would do puts  immediate pressure on our other obligations--including guaranteed  Medicare benefits.   The President can't pretend to protect Medicare, then leave  beneficiaries completely exposed by draining our coffers.   For some context, these tax cuts could fund Medicare for the next 75  years or more.   You have to question the priorities of the President--is he working  to keep his promises to hardworking Americans, or is he abandoning  those promises in favor of enriching the wealthy.   President Trump's tax proposal is a return to Reagan's failed supply  side economics.   The evidence is clear: large tax cuts like this don't pay for  themselves, despite the rhetoric we hear from this Administration. Just  ask the conservative leaning Tax Foundation.   This broad outline--which lacks any kind of real detail--seems to  simply be a repeat of the mistakes we made with President George W.  Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, which cost us trillions of dollars,  did nothing to help working families, and, in part, contributed to the  Great Recession.   Democrats know that the Middle Class deserves the tax cut, not Donald  Trump and his Cabinet.   We would focus on growing our economy from the middle out, instead of  trickle-down economics from the top down.   The middle class does not need to lose their healthcare coverage  provided by the Affordable Care Act.   The middle class does not need to deal with the consequence of a  massive tax cut for the wealthy.   Any tax cut must be paid for by getting funding from somewhere else  in the federal budget.   The source of funding to pay for the tax cuts under the failed repeal  of the Affordable Care Act would have come from Medicare and Medicaid-- hurting millions of people who would have lost access to health  insurance coverage.   I am joining my colleagues this evening in strong opposition to this  Administration's attempt to diminish the quality of life of working  families by creating unfair burdens like funding ill-conceived tax cut  plans.
