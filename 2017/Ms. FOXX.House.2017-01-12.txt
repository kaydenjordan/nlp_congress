 Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, we celebrated Law  Enforcement Appreciation Day, which acknowledges the contributions that  men and women in uniform make on a daily basis to keep our communities  safe and secure.   It was heartening to see the display of support for these individuals  throughout the House Office Buildings  [[Page H401]]  on Monday. As the Sun went down, you could see blue lights in windows  across the Capitol complex honoring those brave men and women.   The dedicated individuals who serve in law enforcement help to  preserve the way of life we hold so dear. They walk the neighborhood  beats, patrol our streets, and willingly do dangerous work to protect  our families and communities.   It is one of the most honorable activities anyone can engage in, and  I want to thank them for their selflessness and bravery they  demonstrate as officers of the law. They deserve our profound  gratitude.                            ____________________
