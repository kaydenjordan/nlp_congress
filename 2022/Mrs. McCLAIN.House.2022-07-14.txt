 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  for holding this very serious and very important Special Order.   A few weeks ago, the Supreme Court delivered the greatest victory for  life this country has ever seen when it rightly held that the ability  to kill an unborn child is not a constitutional right and returned the  authority to regulate abortion back to the people and their elected  Representatives.   Sadly, we have seen some elected officials who care more about  appeasing the fringes of their base than defending our institution and  respecting the document that they swore to uphold and defend.   President Biden, for example, a former longtime supporter of letting  the States decide their abortion policies, he sees fit to ignore the  ruling. In a feeble attempt to quiet his far-left critics, he is  seeking to unilaterally expand the ability to kill an unborn child.   I am curious. Does he not know that we have rule of law in this  country with a system actually built on checks and balances? The  President has been in Washington since before Roe, so I think he should  at least have a basic understanding of our government and the rule of  law.   I would say this: Mr. President, these efforts will be in vain. You  must remember the oath that you took and the document you swore to  uphold. Mr. President, the Supreme Court and the Constitution are  clear: You and your bureaucratic underlings at HHS do not have the  authority to unilaterally make law. That is up to the people's  Representatives. Please remember that.
