 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3568 and  ask that it be reported by number.  [[Page S6234]]     Madam President, our Nation's communities and small  businesses have had it rough these past 18 months as they struggle with  the lasting effects of the pandemic. Today, they are also being  victimized amid surging violent crime rates and progressive prosecutors  who adopt nonprosecution policies. And, as a result, small businesses  are left vulnerable and unassisted as they are burglarized, defaced,  and destroyed.   It is understandable for victimized small businesses, law  enforcement, and the public to be dispirited as they are left to pick  up the pieces while rogue prosecutors ignore their constitutional duty  by refusing to prosecute violent crimes that affect the health, safety,  or economy of our communities.   Defying the rule of law and endangering the public has Mississippians  and Americans across the country saying enough is enough.   My amendment is simple and straightforward. Any city that purposely  obstructs the rule of law by refusing to prosecute--   --certain violent crimes will not be subsidized by  the American taxpayers.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
