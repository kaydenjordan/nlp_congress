 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly condemn the  terrorist acts conducted by Hamas against the State of Israel.   These horrific scenes coming out of Jerusalem depict countless  rockets being launched from Gaza with the intent to massacre innocent  civilians. What we have seen of the Iron Dome's ability to intercept  this high volume of rockets is truly remarkable. But unfortunately,  some of these rockets are getting through, and that underscores  Israel's security vulnerability. It reminds us why the United States  must continue being an ally of Israel and why our commitment to  Israel's sovereignty and independence is so crucial at a time of  heightened regional hostility.   Quite frankly, I am surprised there haven't been more Members of this  institution to extend their support for Israel. That is why, this week,  I am introducing a resolution to not only condemn Hamas for these acts  of terrorism but for Congress to signal its unwavering support to our  strategic partner Israel and to the Jewish people.   I urge my colleagues to join me in this resolution.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this week, we honor our incredible law  enforcement officers who work tirelessly to keep our communities safe.  At a moment when some Americans have lost confidence in our country's  institutions, we must come together to forge a new path of unity and  purpose by addressing every injustice while acknowledging the positive  actions of our police officers.   This week, I cosponsored the JUSTICE Act to provide needed police  reform to help ensure positive, fair policing. This legislation helps  ensure law enforcement agencies and officers are kept safe.   I know firsthand the importance of body cameras, not only for  accountability, but also for the safety of every law enforcement  officer. As mayor of Miami-Dade County, I was one of the first in the  country to implement a program putting body cameras on our police  officers. This legislation will help replicate what we did in Miami- Dade County across the country by providing $500 million for State and  local law enforcement agencies to equip officers with body cameras.   Police officers deserve to know we have their backs. Their commitment  to their communities, their willingness to put their lives on the line  to keep our children and grandchildren safe, must be commended and not  attacked. It is time to step up and give our police officers the  support they deserve.
