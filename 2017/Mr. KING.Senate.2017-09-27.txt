 Mr. President, first I want to join the Democratic leader  in his comments about the devastation of these hurricanes. This has  been truly a malign visitation on our country over the last several  weeks. Florida, Texas, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico have really  suffered and are suffering. I know that the administration is working  hard on this, and I commend them for the efforts that they have made.   I think that now much of our attention is turning to Puerto Rico and  the Virgin Islands in order to mitigate what is really a humanitarian  disaster. One difference between those islands and Florida and Texas is  the fact that they are islands. It is harder to get there. It is harder  to get aid there. I understand that just this morning the San Juan  airport was open for the first time, and it has opened in a limited  way.   So this is clearly a responsibility that we have as Senators, as  Members of Congress, and as Americans to reach out to our neighbors in  a situation such as this. When a crisis hits, it often calls forth the  best of America, and I believe that is happening right now.                               Opioid Epidemic    Mr. President, I want to talk about a different kind of hurricane, a  slow-motion hurricane. It is a slow-motion hurricane that is sweeping  our entire country, not just the Southeast. It is sweeping through our  small towns, our cities, our families, and our schools. It is taking  lives on a scale that is unprecedented and almost unthinkable.   I am talking about the hurricane epidemic of opioid abuse and  overdose deaths. Many of us this week are watching with rapt attention  Ken Burns' magnificent study of the Vietnam war. We are losing more  people per year to overdose deaths than were lost in the entire Vietnam  war. That is one way to think about the magnitude of this catastrophe  that is striking our country. The problem is that it strikes  [[Page S6162]]  here and there. It strikes a family here and a family there, a  community here and a community there, but it doesn't strike all in one  place. So it is not so apparent.   If we were losing a small city in America of 63,000 people once a  year, we would be turning ourselves inside out to solve the problem  that was causing those deaths, and 63,000 people were killed last year  through overdose deaths. It was almost 400 in my State of Maine. That  is more than one a day. All indications are that it is increasing--one  a day. Now, 63,000 is about 7 people an hour--24 hours a day, 365 days  a year--who are succumbing to this plague. That is the right term for  it. It is a medieval plague that is afflicting people all over our  country.   Lives are lost, families torn apart, and our communities compromised.  It is a huge cost. I hesitate to talk about things like dollars when  you are also talking about lives, but it is a cost in both ways. Not  only are lives being lost and families being torn apart, but the  estimates are that it costs our society something over $400 billion a  year in everything from medical costs and criminal justice costs to  lost economic and lost productivity in our society and our economy.   But I am here today because all hope is not lost. Contrary to what  some people hear--and you hear sometimes that this is hopeless and that  there isn't anything we can do about it--there is ample evidence that  treatment can work. This is not a death sentence. Opioid abuse is  terrible, and from talking to people who have suffered from it, it  literally changes your brain, and it becomes almost impossible to  escape. But it can be escaped. The reason we know that is that there is  data from across the country, but the reason I know that is because of  my friends in Maine--Andrew, Matt, and Chris.   These are people whom I know, with whom I have interacted, and with  whom I have sat down. Andrew is a guy who is at the University of  Southern Maine. He was trapped in the throes of addiction. He went  through treatment, and now he is in recovery. Indeed, there are 25  million people in this country who are in recovery, and they will tell  you that they will always be in recovery because they can never shake  this disease, whether it is alcohol or the really destructive one that  we are focusing on right now, which is opioids.   Andrew has made a new life. He is at school. He is at the University  of Southern Maine. He has helped form a student-centered community to  help people who are in recovery or who are working on getting there.   Matthew is a young man who, in 2009, again was trapped by this  horrible scourge. Now he is hoping to go to medical school.   Chris is a guy who sat in my office. He worked in the White House. He  was in it up to his neck and above. He had criminal justice problems.  He was in jail. He was convicted. But now he is a member of the Maine  State Bar Association. He got himself through school, and he got  himself through law school.   There was an important moment that I think all of us should think  about when we think about people who are in this situation. When he  went to apply to law school, the people at the law school said: Well,  we don't know if we can take you because you have this record.   His question, which was brilliant and indicates to me that he is  going to be a pretty good lawyer, was this: What was my sentence when I  was convicted? The response was 3 years. He said: You are putting me in  for life. If you don't let me move forward with my life, you are making  that a life sentence, not a 3-year sentence. He was accepted to law  school. He graduated, and this year he passed and was accepted in the  Maine State Bar Association. He is making a contribution to his  community.   Treatment can work. It doesn't always work the first time. Anybody  that has been through this, whether it is alcohol or even quitting  smoking or anything else, will tell you that it doesn't work the first  time necessarily. Sometimes it does, and sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes it will take multiple trips through the recovery and  treatment process, but it can work. We know it can work. I have 25  million reasons to tell you that it can work and 3 that I know.   I am going to be introducing a resolution later today--I hope the  Senate can take it up and pass it--designating next month as National  Recovery Month, honoring and recognizing the people who are in  recovery. So if it works, what is the problem? Why is this hurricane  still sweeping our country? Why does 2017 look like it is going to be  worse than 2016?   Well, the sad truth is that, out of all of those millions of people  who are addicted, who are stuck, who are trapped, only 1 in 10 has  access to treatment--only 1 in 10. Now, what do we have to do to deal  with this problem? Of course, it is like most other problems. There is  no single answer. It involves law enforcement. It involves  interdiction, and let me pause for a moment on interdiction. The  Presiding Officer and I are both on the Armed Services Committee, and  we have heard testimony in our committee that we only have the Coast  Guard and Navy resources to interdict one-fourth of the drug shipments  that we know of coming up from South and Central America by sea. In  other words, we have intelligence where we know of 100 boats, and we  can only stop 25. There is no excuse for that. So, yes, law  enforcement, at the source or along the way in our States, is an  absolutely essential part of this process, but it is not the whole  answer. We also have to work on prevention.    Frankly, I have been talking to groups around Maine and around the  country on this. We are all still trying to figure out how to make  prevention work. What will work? I haven't yet heard a really strong  answer to that question. I guess it varies from person to person, but  prevention has to be part of it. Treatment can work, but if only 1 in  10 people have treatment available to them or have access to treatment,  that means 9 are sentenced to life and maybe to death.   Last year, a year and a half ago, we passed CARA, the Comprehensive  Addiction Recovery Act. It is a great bill, with lots of good things in  it, but no money. That is like sending the fire department to the fire  and saying: Fight that fire, but we are not going to give you any  water. We know this costs money, and it is something we have to commit  to. It has to be part of it.   Whatever we do around here about healthcare and about budgets, we  have to realize we are losing our people, and these aren't bad people.  These aren't people over there. I sat at a roundtable in a small town  in South Paris, ME. Next to me was a deputy sheriff. He lost his  daughter. These aren't strangers. These are often middle-class people.  These are people whose kids or sometimes parents--this is not age  specific--are caught up in this scourge.   I guess I want to leave us today with two points. One is, treatment  works. The second is, we need more of it. If we know something works,  but only 1 in 10 people have access to it, shame on us for not  remedying that situation. To me, the most tragic case--and I have  talked to people in Maine about this--the saddest moment, the most  tragic case is when someone who is in the throes of opioid abuse is  ready to ask for help and they have to be put on a waiting list. That  is tragic and inexcusable. It is hard to get to that point. It is hard  to admit that you are trapped and that you are no longer in control of  your life. Once you are willing to do that and say, ``I need help,''  then it is up to us to be sure the help is there. That is what we are  talking about today.   So this is a different kind of hurricane, but it is a hurricane,  nonetheless, that is destroying our families, destroying our  communities, and wrecking the lives of our friends, but it is no act of  God. We can't stop the winds of Maria or Irma, but we can mitigate the  effects, ameliorate the effects, soften the effects. That is exactly  what we need to do for those who are victims of the hurricane of  opioids that is sweeping our country.   I hope and believe we will respond to this challenge as we have at  other times in our history, and, indeed, as we are this week to the  hurricanes of the Caribbean. I want to respond also to the hurricane  that is sweeping America that we can, indeed, ameliorate, mitigate, and  soften.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
