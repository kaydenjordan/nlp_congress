 Mr. President, I want to start by wishing our friend and  colleague Senator Lindsey Graham a speedy recovery. Yesterday, Senator  Graham shared that he had tested positive for COVID-19. We are all  relieved to hear his symptoms are mild, and we look forward to seeing  him back in the Chamber once he recovers.   I hope everyone at home follows Senator Graham's example by getting  vaccinated. In Senator Graham's words, ``[W]ithout vaccination, I am  certain I would not feel as well as I do now.''   The Delta variant is no joke. COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are  surging across America, and they are surging the most in those parts of  the country where large numbers of people are unvaccinated.   Over 90 percent of the most recent infections, hospitalizations, and  deaths are among people who were not vaccinated. The good news is,  vaccinations are starting to trend upward. Thanks to the leadership of  the President and the urging of many health professionals, as of  yesterday, it has been reported that 70 percent of adults have received  at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. That is an important milestone.  Our Nation is slowly, slowly headed in the right direction, but we need  to pick up the pace.   Experts say that more than 80 percent of the population needs to get  vaccinated before we can start anticipating herd immunity. So please  listen to my friend Senator Graham's advice and get vaccinated. It will  save your life as well as the lives of those you love.                      DC Metropolitan Police Department    Mr. President, on another matter, yesterday we received word that a  fourth police officer who responded to the January 6 insurrection here  in the Capitol has died by suicide.   Officer Gunther Hashida was a member of the DC Metropolitan Police  Department, and he was a hero. I also want to note that hours after  Officer Hashida's death was announced, the Metropolitan Police  Department confirmed that another officer, Kyle DeFreytag, died by  suicide last month.   As we all witnessed last week, many of the Capitol and Metropolitan  Police officers who defended us--defended us--and the Capitol on  January 6 are still grappling with the physical and emotional trauma of  that day. We have to do everything we can to support them, from  providing access to mental and emotional support to ensuring that  everyone who bears responsibility from the January 6 insurrection is  held accountable. It is my understanding that 600 people have already  been charged with wrongdoing for what occurred on that day, and many  more will be charged.   The supplemental funding package that the Senate passed last week was  a good starting point. To deny what January 6 was about is literally  adding insult to injury for those officers--brave officers--who  defended us. They deserve better. They deserve justice, and we deserve  the truth.   To the friends and families of Officers Hashida and DeFreytag, we are  so sorry for your loss. We grieve with you. We will honor their memory.   To all of the other police officers and National Guard members who  defended the Capitol on January 6, despite what you hear from some of  the politicians in Congress, we thank you, and we appreciate your valor  and your sacrifice.   Earlier this morning, Senators Klobuchar and Blunt introduced a  bipartisan resolution to award these heroes the Congressional Gold  Medal. I am proud to support that effort.                          Clean Water Infrastructure    Mr. President, on one more topic, ``forever chemicals.'' It is a  phrase that sounds ambiguous and ominous. Some of these pollutants-- known as PFAS chemicals--are used in cleaning supplies, stain-resistant  clothing, cosmetics, polishes, waxes, and the kind of foam that  firefighters use to fight fires.   And although they have their practical applications, these ``forever  chemicals'' present a major problem: They don't go away. They don't  break down. Once they are introduced into the environment, they stick  around forever.   A growing body of research suggests that ``forever chemicals'' are  linked to a whole host of human health complications: cancer, kidney  disease, liver damage, birth defects. Sadly, it is estimated that most  people already have trace amounts of these chemicals in their bodies.  But imagine if you or your children were forced to ingest these toxic  ``forever chemicals'' multiple times a day, every day. That is the  dangerous reality for many American families. I am sorry to report that  includes thousands of families in my home State of Illinois.   On Friday, the Chicago Sun Times published a story on the presence of  these chemicals in water systems in the Chicago area, Lake Forest,  Waukegan, and South Elgin. Water system managers in these areas have  found enough evidence of chemicals that the Illinois EPA is calling for  further testing. That additional testing is just in the preliminary  stage.   As I mentioned, these contaminants are impressively imperishable, and  they are being found everywhere. As an example, a few years ago, a  dairy farmer in Maine discovered that one of these ``forever  chemicals'' had seeped into his farmland through a fertilizer that he  used. He only found out because the chemicals were showing up in  [[Page S5702]]  the milk of his cows. He ended up having to shut down his dairy farm  that had been in the family for generations. He had to destroy his  dairy herd, and he lost his savings.   If these contaminants are too dangerous for a dairy farm, too  dangerous for cows, they are certainly too dangerous for our kids. We  must protect our communities and families from ``forever chemicals''  immediately.   Unfortunately, eliminating this public health threat is proving  challenging. For one, in Illinois, it is not clear where it came from.  According to the Sun Times article, ``among the water system managers  contacted by the [newspaper], none of them could identify the culprit  causing the contamination.''   The Environmental Working Group has identified more than 1,700  potential sources in my State, from sewage treatment facilities to  landfills. The culprit could be any one or a combination. As of now,  there is no definitive answer. In other words, the analogy is, an  arsonist is still running through the forest, and the only signs are  the trees he leaves burning.   The other difficulty in meeting this public health threat is that it  costs money. As we all learned from Flint, MI, repairing and replacing  the entire city's drinking water system is no small task. Municipal  officials throughout my State are still waiting on State officials to  provide guidance, as well as funding, to remove these ``forever  chemicals'' from their water system.   But when it comes to protecting our children's health and well-being,  solutions cannot wait, and States like Illinois cannot address this  threat on their own. Pending before the U.S. Senate at this moment is  the bipartisan infrastructure deal. This deal is good for us, good for  America, and starts to address this problem.   This historic bipartisan plan will make our Nation's largest ever  investment in clean water. That investment includes $10 billion for  addressing the ``forever chemical'' challenge and other emerging  contaminants from drinking water and wastewater systems throughout  America. That is a big deal. It is estimated that more than 200 million  Americans--nearly two-thirds of this country's population--could be  drinking ``forever chemicals'' in their tap water.   With the bipartisan infrastructure deal, lawmakers on both sides of  the aisle are coming together as we should, to help ensure every family  in America has access to clean and safe drinking water. Because the  infrastructure package will also invest billions of dollars to replace  dangerous decaying lead service lines throughout the country, it is a  game changer. It is a game changer for the city of Chicago, which I am  proud to represent in my home State of Illinois.   You see, there is no acceptable level for lead consumption--none,  zero. Much like ``forever chemicals,'' lead service lines that hookup  the water main in the street to your home, business, school, daycare  center--these lead service lines can cause lasting harm to the growing  bodies and minds of our kids. And, as lawmakers, we have an obligation  to correct the mistakes made by previous generations of Americans.   I understand that until about 35, 40 years ago, lead service lines  were mandated in construction in Illinois--in my State--in some areas.  We made a mistake. Now we know it. What are we going to do about it?  This bill addresses this.   I want to thank my colleague, Senator Tammy Duckworth. When it comes  to water infrastructure, she is just leading the pack in the U.S.  Senate. She really cares about this, as a Senator, for sure, but  equally important as a mom with two lovely little girls.   We can establish a new, healthier foundation for future generations  if we pull together. That is exactly what this bill will do. Marshaling  the resources of our Federal Government so that all of America's kids  can grow up and lead healthy, productive lives, that is what  bipartisanship is all about. And I look forward to joining my  colleagues in voting in favor of this bill in the next few days.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Kaine) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I have 12 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
