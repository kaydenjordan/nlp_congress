 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1492,  the ``Medical Controlled Substances Transportation Act of 2017.''   This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to direct the  Attorney General to register practitioners to transport controlled  substances to States in which the practitioner is not registered under  the CSA to administer these substances at locations other than  principal places of professional practice.   H.R. 1492 provides necessary guidance to the Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA) to clarify the requirements of physicians whose  jobs inherently require transporting controlled substances.   By requiring the registration of practitioners who transport and  administer controlled substances across state lines, this bill also  increases oversight to ensure physicians are appropriately  administering controlled substances to their patients.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1492 addresses a crucial element in America's  current opioid crisis regarding the mishandling of powerful  prescription drugs by licensed physicians which can result in problems  with addiction or abuse for patients.   This issue is particularly relevant in the arena of sports medicine,  where specialized physicians are often required to swiftly treat  athlete injuries while on the road.   In high-pressure environments, physicians and trainers sometimes  prioritize athletic performance over physical and mental health, a  mentality which has been shown to leave the door open for long-term,  potentially devastating consequences for the players.   Earlier this year, a group of more than 1,800 former professional  football players filed a federal lawsuit against all 32 teams of the  National Football League (NFL) for allowing teams to violate federal  laws governing the transportation, distribution, and administration of  prescription drugs.   The lawsuit revealed a slew of dangerous, illegal practices within  the NFL and individual teams, including the excessive administration  and use of powerful painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs as well as  the failure of league and team officials to acknowledge or comply with  guidance from the DEA.   In 2012, for instance, the average NFL team prescribed nearly 5,777  doses of anti-inflammatory drugs and 2,213 doses of controlled  medications to its players.   The staggering levels of opioid use in the NFL have led to a number  of chronic health problems for many former players who continue to  suffer from long-term organ and joint damage years or even decades  after they have retired.   Even more troubling, a 2011 survey of 644 retired players found that  7 percent were still actively using opioid drugs in retirement--more  than four limes the rate of opioid use in the general population.   National sports leagues like the NFL are massive, multi-billion  dollar industries that drive many local economies in the United States;  last year, the average NFL team was worth $2.3 billion and employed  3,739 people.   However, it is vital that we recognize the human cost of this highly  profitable business.   With the immense economic and cultural value of America's sports  teams and athletes in mind, the federal government should take all  necessary measures to ensure that fans and players are able to enjoy  their favorite past-times safely and fairly.   H.R. 1492 is a crucial step in improving the DEA's ability to protect  prescription drug recipients who are vulnerable to misusing or abusing  painkillers and other powerful medications.   Fixing our national opioid epidemic is a bipartisan cause, and I am  confident that this legislation has the potential to effect powerful  and positive change for large numbers of Americans.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1492.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  702, the ``Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act of 2017.''   I support this legislation because it ensures agencies effectively  implement their Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) programs and that  federal employees are never prevented from disclosing discriminatory or  wasteful actions to Congress, the Office of Special Counsel, or  Inspectors General.   Let me express my thanks to Ranking Member Cummings for introducing  this critical legislation that is essential to ensuring that our  federal workplaces are free from discrimination, and that any barriers  impeding fairness in personnel decisions are identified and eliminated.   This is not the first time we have addressed and offered legislation  regarding workplace equality.   In 2002, the ``No Fear Act'' was first introduced in Congress and set  the precedent for imposing additional duties upon Federal agency  employers that are intended to reinvigorate their longstanding  obligation to provide a work environment free of discrimination and  retaliation.   On October 2, 2000, the House Science Committee held a hearing  entitled ``Intolerance at EPA--Harming People, Harming Science?''   Dr. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, an EPA whistleblower, won a 600,000  dollar jury decision against EPA for race and sex discrimination under  title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   During that hearing, then-chairman of the Science Committee  Congressman Sensenbrenner illuminated the dangerous precedent set by  the EPA, stating, ``While EPA has a clear policy on dealing with  employees that discriminate, harass and retaliate against other EPA  employees, no one apparently involved in the Coleman-Adebayo or Nolan  cases have yet to be disciplined by EPA.''   Mr. Speaker, no employee should fear voicing their concerns in  reference to a safer more work conducive environment.   According to the 2014 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, only 60  percent of federal employees agreed that they could quote, ``disclose a  suspected violation of any law, rule or regulation without fear of  reprisal.''   We must do better and ensure employees have confidence that they can  report an act of discrimination without suffering retaliation.   Employees need to know that EEO reports will be thoroughly, fairly,  and timely investigated and adjudicated.   H.R. 702 would require that EEO programs operate independently of an  agency's human resources or general counsel offices.   This bill requires the head of the program report directly to the  head of an agency and the act would prohibit the use of non-disclosure  agreements that restrict an employee from disclosing to Congress, the  Office of Special Counsel, or instance of waste, fraud or abuse.   We often look at individuals or groups who step forward as  whistleblowers.   This term has been used with a negative connotation to describe  insubordinate employees, but history has shown us that whistleblowers  are often heroes that have shed light on employers' illegal practices  and as a result made the workplace better for future employees.   Mark Felt, the FBI agent known as deep throat during the Watergate  Scandal of the 1970s.   Frank Serpico, New York police officer who confronted his department  for the rampant corruption the leadership let take place.   Jeffrey Wigand, a tobacco executive who admitted that tobacco  companies knew they were putting addictive chemicals into their  cigarettes.   And Sherron Watkins, an executive of the Enron corporation who was  vital in exposing the financial lies and frauds of the company.   All these individuals stood up against well-established corporations  and agencies even when others doubted their claims.   We must protect these types of acts in Federal offices and  successfully implement the Equal Employment Opportunity Programs (EEO).   Mr. Speaker, in a sense every Member of Congress is a whistleblower  for the people in that uncovering and correcting problems in the  agencies that administer the laws is an essential part of our oversight  responsibilities.   As a senior member of the Committees on Homeland Security and the  Judiciary, and as Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on  Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I understand  the importance of safe and discrimination free workplaces.   By strengthening existing requirements to ensure federal EEO programs  meet high standards, we are implementing the best practices available  to combat workplace discrimination.   It is our duty as Members of Congress to be whistleblowers, bring  attention to this pressing matter, and put a stop to injustices  occurring in the workforce.    Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Committee on Natural  Resources, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1719, the ``John Muir  National Historic Site Expansion Act,'' authorizing the Department of  the Interior to acquire an additional 44 acres of land to expand the  John Muir National Historic Site, which currently stretches across 330  acres in the East Bay of San Francisco and includes the home where  legendary naturalist John Muir lived until he died in 1914.   The John Muir National Historic Site, established by Congress in  1964, is located in Martinez, California and honor one of the nation's  foremost conservationists, whom historians refer to as the ``Father of  the National Park Service.''   The historic site preserves the 14-room Italianate Victorian mansion  where the naturalist and writer John Muir lived, as well as a  [[Page H5409]]  nearby 325 acre tract of native oak woodlands and grasslands  historically owned by the Muir family.   H.R. 1719 authorizes the Department of the Interior to acquire by  donation approximately 44 acres to expand the boundary of John Muir  National Historic Site.   The acreage to be acquired is directly continuous with Mount Wanda  and will allow for better public access to trails.   In the 114th Congress, H.R. 1289, a bill identical to H.R. 1719,  passed the House by voice vote.   Additionally, a similar bill, H.R. 5699, was introduced in the 113th  Congress by former Congressman George Miller, and passed the House by a  vote of 361-39.   Companion legislation, S. 729, has been introduced in the Senate by  Senator Kamala Harris of California.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1719 is a fitting tribute to one of America's  greatest citizen activists, the co-founder of the Sierra Club, and a  central actor in the successful effort to establish Yosemite National  Park.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 1719.    Mr. Speaker, the son of Mr. Trump knew full well  that he was accepting an invitation from a chain of individuals  affiliated with the Kremlin: first, the liaison guy, the publicist, an  operative of the Kremlin; the entertainer, the operative of the  Kremlin; and then the attorney, who has affiliations through her family  with the Kremlin. And then the idea was to receive information from a  foreign, hostile nation about the opponent of his father.   With all of his outpouring of honesty now, the question has to be why  was this meeting hidden, and it has to be whether we are on the brink  of seeing a situation where those involved have acted against the  interests of the United States of America.   Having just come back from a former Soviet bloc country, I know the  distinction between the freedom in this Nation and the non-freedom that  Putin believes in. So I think it is important, as I have said over and  over again, that the House Judiciary Committee needs to open up its  investigation, take oversight over issues that are relevant to the  Constitution and, of course, those individuals who are holding the  public trust.   The public trust has been violated, but I believe seriously that  something more has been violated. There is Russian collusion: collusion  in the election, skewing the idea of a fair election. This is what we  are dealing with, and I am saddened by this situation.   The Judiciary Committee must investigate the skewing of the election  toward one candidate over another.                            ____________________
