 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in a little bit, we are going to have the  opportunity to vote to confirm Drew Wrigley as the next U.S. attorney  for the District of North Dakota. First of all, I want to thank Leader  McConnell and Leader Schumer for providing this opportunity to vote to  confirm this outstanding candidate.   A little bit about Drew. First of all, he is a good personal friend.  Drew is a sincere public servant. He has served our State as our  Lieutenant Governor and previously as U.S. attorney for North Dakota  under President George W. Bush. He has a servant's heart.   The thing I like so much about Drew is, besides being a professional  prosecutor--and prior to even being a U.S. attorney, he was a longtime  prosecutor in Philadelphia in the district attorney's office. He is  good at his job. He is smart. He is compassionate. He cares as much as  anything about the rule and the letter of the law and the victims of  crimes. But the thing I like the most about Drew is that he is a  courageous prosecutor. He doesn't just take the layups. He is willing  to push to the edge for victims, for justice. He takes the tough cases,  and he takes them on. Win or lose, he fights as hard as he can for the  cause of justice and for the victims of crimes.   So it is a great honor for me today to advocate for Drew's  confirmation, and I look forward to the opportunity in a little bit to  vote for it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
