 Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice and my  strong support for the confirmation of Colorado Supreme Court Justice  Allison Eid as the next U.S. court of appeals judge for the Tenth  Circuit Court, which, of course, is housed in Denver, CO.   There is no doubt that Justice Eid is superbly qualified for this  position. For the past decade, she has served Colorado as a justice on  the supreme court. In 2008, Justice Eid was overwhelmingly retained by  the people of Colorado. We have a system where every decade the voters  of Colorado vote to retain or dismiss a judge, and every time that has  come before the people of Colorado, she has been overwhelmingly  retained by the people of Colorado.   Prior to her appointment, Justice Eid represented the State of  Colorado before the State federal courts as our State solicitor  general. She served as a tenured member of the faculty at the  University of Colorado Law School, where she taught courses in  constitutional law, legislation, torts, and she has published scholarly  articles on topics such as constitutional federalism and tort law, in  addition to being a clerk on the Supreme Court. She also practiced  commercial and appellate litigation at the Denver office of the  national law firm Arnold and Porter.   She began her legal career as a clerk to Judge Jerry E. Smith on the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Her law experience took  her to the U.S. Supreme Court under Clarence Thomas. Prior to attending  law school, Justice Eid was a special assistant and speechwriter for  the U.S. Secretary of Education, Bill Bennett. She received her law  degree from the University of Chicago Law School, where she was the  articles editor of the Law Review. She graduated with high honors and  as a member of the Order of the Coif. She received her degree in  American studies from Stanford University, graduating with distinction  as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.   What her resume clearly shows is that whatever Justice Eid does, she  does it at the highest level, with the best results. She has  specialized knowledge of federalism, water law, and Indian law, among  other important areas of the law. Indeed, the National Native American  Bar Association has even noted that she has ``significantly more  experience with Indian law cases than any other recent Circuit Court  nominee.''   We have had some pretty doggone good circuit court nominees in the  past, including Justice Neil Gorsuch, whose seat she will be filling on  the Tenth Circuit Court. These are concepts that are critical to my  home State of Colorado, and her expertise will prove to be invaluable  to the Tenth Circuit Court, as well as to the Nation and the people of  this country.   But as impressive as her credentials are, it is her demeanor and her  approach to the law that make her ideally suited for the court. Justice  Eid has been called a ``mainstream, commonsense Westerner.'' She is  also, as her former law clerks have noted, ``fiercely independent,''  and she will decide cases ``as she believes the law requires.'' At the  same time, she seeks out different viewpoints and wants to understand  all sides of the issue she addresses.   That is the law professor I know from my days at the University of  Colorado School of Law. I can say from that experience that while  Justice Eid has her perspectives on the law, she cares very deeply  about robust debate and hearing the views of others. And I know from my  classmates who had Justice Eid as their professor--those classmates  didn't always agree with her perspectives, but Justice Eid was open to  their debate and hearing their views. She engaged them, and she was  never biased against differing perspectives but always applying the law  as the law required, not as opinions suited.   I also know that ``fiercely independent'' jurist whom her former  clerks spoke so highly of. Justice Eid will follow the law regardless  of the popular wind, regardless of personal opinion. Whether  considering the plain meaning of a statute, discerning the proper role  of the courts, the legislative branch, or the executive and its  agencies, or evaluating the relationships between the Federal  Government and the States, Justice Eid will side with what the law  says, and she will do it in that commonsense, western way that clearly  and articulately tells the American people what the law is.   I am privileged to know Justice Eid. I have known her for a number of  years now from my days as a student at the University of Colorado  School of Law and through her work in the State of Colorado at the time  that I served in the State legislature. She is an incredible human  being with a delightful demeanor that will suit the court well.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  several letters in support of Justice Eid's nomination: a letter to  Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein from former law clerks  of Justice Eid's, as well as a letter from various supporters in  Colorado and one letter from the Southern Ute Indian Tribe.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      July 13, 2017.        Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: We are       all of Justice Eid's former law clerks (except those       currently clerking for a federal judge and not permitted to       sign) since she began her tenure on the Colorado Supreme       Court in 2006, and we write to give our fullest support to       her nomination to be a judge on the United States Court of       Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. We come from a diverse set of       geographic, economic, cultural, and political backgrounds,       yet we are united in our belief that Justice Eid is a jurist       and a person of the highest caliber and character. We have       each learned so much from her.        Justice Eid was raised by a single mother in Spokane,       Washington under challenging circumstances, after her father       abandoned her family. Justice Eid began college at the       University of Idaho, but with the support and encouragement       of her mother and a professor there, Justice Eid transferred       to Stanford University where she graduated with distinction       and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. After       Stanford, she served as a speechwriter to President Ronald       Reagan's Secretary of Education, William Bennett, and then       went on to attend the University of Chicago Law School, where       she served as Articles Editor on the Law Review, graduated       with High Honors, and was elected Order of the Coif. Justice       Eid began her legal career as a law clerk for Judge Jerry       Smith on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth       Circuit. She then served as a law clerk to Justice Clarence       Thomas on the United States Supreme Court.        In private practice at Arnold and Porter following her       clerkships, Justice Eid practiced both commercial and       appellate litigation for a variety of clients. She departed       private practice and joined academia where she became a       tenured professor at the University of Colorado Law School,       teaching Legislation, Constitutional Law, and Torts, and       serving as the faculty clerkship advisor. During her time at       the University of Colorado, Justice Eid continued her service       in  [[Page S6946]]       the Colorado legal community as President of the Colorado       Association of Corporate Counsel. In 2005 she was appointed       by Colorado Attorney General John Suthers to serve as the       Solicitor General of Colorado. One year later, Governor Bill       Owens appointed Justice Eid to the Colorado Supreme Court       where she has served for 11 years and was successfully       retained by the voters of Colorado on a statewide ballot.        As law clerks we had the distinct privilege and opportunity       to learn by observing Justice Eid throughout her decision       making process. We learned that she never fails to provide       her full attention and dedication to each individual case,       mastering the relevant facts and carefully analyzing the law,       whether the text of a statute or the words of a contract. As       Justice Eid is so fond of saying, she ``goes where the law       takes her.'' In other words, she treats each case       individually without any preconceived notion of desired       outcome.        As young lawyers, we took particular note of the respect       that Justice Eid shows the parties and their attorneys both       in her written work product and during oral argument. We also       observed her belief in the importance of respect and       collegiality with her colleagues, particularly during times       of disagreement. Her chambers are always open, and she wants       to hear different viewpoints (even ours), but she remains       fiercely independent, ultimately deciding cases as she       believes the law requires. And her opinions do just that--in       clean and succinct prose, time and again, Justice Eid       resolves the dispute between the parties and announces a       clear rule of law that can be readily discerned by future       litigants. Her majority opinions in particular are a       testament to the care, dedication, and consensus-building       attitude she brings to her role as a Judge.        While serving as a Justice on the Colorado Supreme Court,       Justice Eid has continued to teach at the University of       Colorado. She also serves as the Chair of the Supreme Court       Water Court Committee, which works to identify rule and       statutory changes to achieve efficiencies in water court       cases, while maintaining quality outcomes for all. Justice       Eid was appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve on       the Federal Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules--a       prestigious appointment where she has served alongside       federal judges, law professors, and lawyers to craft       revisions to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure--and by       President George W. Bush to the Permanent Committee for the       Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise (an organization that writes the       history of the United States Supreme Court and sponsors the       Oliver Wendell Holmes Lecture).        Justice Eid is active in her community and church, and as       the mother of two children, Justice Eid has also been       involved in her children's school over the years. In addition       to her service on the Colorado Supreme Court, these other       responsibilities connect her to the Colorado community,       specifically the challenges and issues facing citizens of       this State and will allow her to bring an important       perspective and diverse set of experiences to the United       States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.        Her qualifications to serve are unparalleled and speak for       themselves. At each stage of her education and career Justice       Eid has excelled at the highest levels and has received       praise, awards, and the utmost respect of her colleagues and       those who have worked for her. This is in no small part due       to her incredible work ethic and her leadership by example.       And we as law clerks have carefully observed and learned from       her simultaneous and unfaltering commitment to both her       family and her position on the Colorado Supreme Court.        We close by reflecting on our fond memories of our       experiences as law clerks under Justice Eid, whether it was a       lunch to celebrate a birthday, officiating numerous of our       weddings, or the annual holiday and summer parties that she       hosts. We all remember the genuine interest and support       Justice Eid provided to us as people and new lawyers. We will       never forget her heartfelt appreciation for our hard work and       the care and time she has taken to guide us through our       clerkships and beyond. She has been an important and       steady mentor in each of our lives. We urge the Senate to       take swift action on her nomination and are available to       speak to any member or their staff about Justice Eid and       her qualifications to serve on the United States Court of       Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

Re Support for the Confirmation of Justice Allison Eid to the           Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.        Dear Senators Bennet and Gardner: As members of the       Colorado legal community, we are proud to support the       nomination of Justice Allison Eid to serve as a Judge on the       Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. We hold a diverse set of       political views as Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.       Our practices range from litigation, including both       plaintiffs' and defense work, to transactional work to       administrative law to child welfare advocacy and from       employment law to water rights and from government affairs to       minerals development, immigration, healthcare, law       enforcement, environmental justice, federal Indian law and       civil rights. This incredibly diverse group of attorneys       agrees on one thing: we all agree that Justice Eid is       exceptionally well qualified and should be confirmed.        We know Justice Eid to be a person of integrity,       professional competence, and judicial temperament. She has       received the highest possible `Well Qualified' rating from       the American Bar Association. Her private practice work,       scholarship, law teaching, and service as Colorado's       Solicitor General have all demonstrated her superb abilities       over many years. Her service on the Colorado Supreme Court       has earned her a reputation as an excellent jurist. Her       strong work ethic is renowned. She is a preeminent member of       the legal profession, not only in Colorado, but in the United       States more broadly, with outstanding legal ability and       exceptional breadth of experience. We also know her to be a       compassionate and caring person, deeply involved in the       broader community and called to service, not only in her day       job, but through her extensive volunteerism toward the       betterment of the profession. Throughout her tenure on the       bench, she has hired numerous diverse law clerks and       continuously sought to ensure that the diverse voices of       Coloradoans are heard, evincing a very strong commitment to       diversity and inclusion. We are excited to see her bring her       spirit and skill set to the Tenth Circuit.        We ask that Colorado's Senators join together and support       this very highly qualified nominee from Colorado. We believe       it is an exceptional moment to confirm Justice Eid as the       first Colorado woman to serve on the Tenth Circuit.            Respectfully,        Sarah J. Auchterlonie, Franklin Azar, Naomi Beer, Michael       Bender, Heath Briggs, Geraldine Brimmer, Scott Campbell,       Richard Cunningham, Stanton Dodge, Caleb Durling, Jacob       Durling, John Echohawk, David Fine, Jeremy Graves, Melissa       Hart, Ellen Herzog, Neal Katyal, Martin Katz, Robert Kaufman,       Kenzo Kawanabe, Kevin Kuhn.

Re Support for Confirmation of Colorado Supreme Court Justice           Allison Eid to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.        Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: The       Southern Ute Indian Tribe is writing in support of the       confirmation of Colorado Supreme Court Justice Allison Eid to       the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.       Justice Eid's considerable qualifications for this       prestigious appointment are not in question. As a Colorado       Supreme Court Justice, Justice Eid has demonstrated expertise       in a broad spectrum of legal matters including the field of       federal Indian law. Justice Eid's judicial record evidences       her understanding of tribal sovereignty and other matters       that are acutely important to the Tribe. Because these       matters are often resolved in the Supreme Court following a       decision in a federal appellate circuit in the West, it is       critical that the judges on those circuit courts possess a       working understanding of Indian law issues. Because she is       well-versed in the established principles of federal Indian       law, as well as many other areas of the law, the Tribe       supports the nomination of Justice Eid.            Sincerely,                                                  Clement J. Frost,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. President, I wish to spend some time talking about a  letter dated July 27, 2017. This letter was sent to me and my  colleague, Senator Bennet from Colorado. This letter was titled  ``Support for the Confirmation of Justice Allison Eid to the Tenth  Circuit Court of Appeals,'' which I have  [[Page S6947]]  submitted for the Record, but I want to highlight some of the people  who have signed this letter because when it comes to the courts and  nominations, I think it is very important that we listen to the voices  of those people who are closest to the court over which the nominee may  be presiding. It is also important that those who are closest to a  practicing lawyer provide their opinions of a lawyer who has been  nominated for the bench who is not already on the bench.   In the case of Justice Eid's supporters, there is an incredible list  of people from across the political spectrum--both sides of the aisle-- supporting Justice Eid. Let me talk about a few of Justice Eid's  supporters, because we will hear a lot of debate about groups who  support or oppose Justice Eid, but the people who know her the best,  the people who have practiced before her court, the people who have  worked with her over the many years of public service that she has  provided don't just fall on the Republican side of the aisle or the  Democratic side of the aisle, the support she has gathered is from  across the political spectrum.   There is Michael Bender, former Colorado Supreme Court justice;  Justice Rebecca Love Kourlis, one of the most respected jurists in  Colorado, who served on the State supreme court and is one of the most  highly regarded justices not only in Colorado but across the country,  quite frankly; Justice Mary Mullarkey. Justice Mullarkey is no longer  on the Colorado Supreme Court, but she served as the chief justice of  the Colorado Supreme Court. She was appointed by a Democratic Governor.  She is someone who believes Justice Eid would be an incredible addition  to the court. There is Neal Katyal, a former Department of Justice  civil servant for the Obama administration--a U.S. Solicitor General,  in fact. If we look at the other supporters she has, we see that  Melissa Hart, who has run for office as a Democratic candidate,  supports the nomination and confirmation of Justice Allison Eid.   As you can see, the Tenth Circuit has an incredible nominee before it  whom I hope this body will soon confirm. I urge my colleagues to move  quickly during this cloture time so that we can actually approve  somebody who I know will do an outstanding job. I urge their support. I  hope we will do our duty under our Constitution to select those people  who will be guarding the Constitution and do it in a way that we can  all be proud of. That is why I support Allison Eid.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 8 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
