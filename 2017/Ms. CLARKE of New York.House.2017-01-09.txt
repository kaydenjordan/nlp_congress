 I thank Mr. Veasey for his leadership this  evening. I thank our chairman, Cedric Richmond, for his vision and his  timeliness in bringing this to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of the Ninth  Congressional District of New York in opposition to Donald Trump's  nominee for the position of Attorney General of the United States,  Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. I stand with my colleagues in the  Congressional Black Caucus as we raise our voices on behalf of the  millions of Americans who depend on this caucus to speak as the  conscience of the Congress--speaking truth to power.   Mr. Speaker, I struggle to understand how Senator Sessions can even  be considered to lead the Department of Justice when time and time  again throughout his political career he has actively opposed the  mission and purpose for which the Department of Justice was created.  For the better part of my life--at least a half a century--the  Department of Justice has assumed a position of leadership in the fight  for the civil rights of African Americans who seek the uninhibited  right to vote, for young women who seek protection against sexual  assault on college campuses, for disabled individuals who fight for  equitable access to basic services, and for immigrants who aspire to  pursue their visions of the American Dream.   The nomination of Senator Sessions does not support the legacy of  progress that has been made under the auspices of the modern-day  Department of Justice. As a young prosecutor, he directed racial slurs  at his African American colleagues. Senator Sessions spoke highly of  the Ku Klux Klan. He actively targeted and persecuted activists like  Mr. Albert Turner--one of Dr. Martin Luther King's advisers--for simply  trying to register disenfranchised voters.                                time  2000    When he became Attorney General of Alabama, Senator Sessions, a  product of segregated education, worked tirelessly to prevent  predominantly African American public schools from accessing an equal  share of resources that had been long denied to Black students.   As a Member of the Senate, Senator Sessions has been an outspoken  opponent of criminal justice reforms that many of his Republican  colleagues support. He is a leader in the effort to define undocumented  Americans as ``the other'' and forcibly separating families in the  United States.   The women and men who lead the Department of Justice are called upon  to pursue justice; but with such a documented history of hostility  toward the most vulnerable populations--people of color, women,  disabled individuals, and immigrant families--we cannot expect Senator  Sessions to pursue justice on their behalf.   I absolutely and unequivocally oppose the nomination of Senator  Sessions. He has demonstrated his disdain for the most basic of human  principles: equality, justice, and fairness. These principles represent  the promise of our Constitution. The Senate considering and confirming  Mr. Sessions would break that very promise.   Mr. Speaker, I stand with the CBC today asking the Senate of the  United States to uphold the virtues of the Constitution and reject this  divisive nomination.
