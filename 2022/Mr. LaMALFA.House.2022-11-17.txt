 Madam Speaker, as I watch my home State of California go  down in flames, literally, as we watch how we are running out of  electricity, we are running out of water, our store shelves are having  less and less food varieties available, our farmers being pushed out of  business, our farmworkers being pushed out of business, as we see all  of these things happen with mandates coming down the pike, requiring  more and more electricity has to be renewable, what is the answer in  California?  [[Page H8556]]    Let's tear down some hydroelectric dams in my district and Mr. Bentz'  district; let's tear them down.   We are going to lose green power. We are doing it over the objections  of the people who live there, who have objected by over 70 percent to  removal of these dams, all for an unproven environmental benefit.   So enjoy even less electricity. Enjoy even less food grown in my  district and Mr. Bentz' district. Enjoy even more of the crisis that is  facing us in rural California, rural America, and on our store shelves  and in our electrical wires due to even more unfounded environmental  rules being forced upon us to tear down perfectly good hydroelectric  dams. Thanks one hell of a lot.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, S. 3092, the FIRE Act, makes changes to increase  congressional oversight, garner further insight into FEMA's process for  wildfire disasters, and enacts reforms related to disaster assistance.   Specifically, this bill directs FEMA to report to Congress on cost- effective housing solutions and challenges or inconsistencies in the  application of assistance in the wake of wildfires.   The FIRE Act also takes the first steps to improve the use of  forecasts and weather alerts, such as red flag warnings, within the  disaster declaration process so FEMA can be better prepared earlier to  provide wildfire assistance.   Lastly, this bill engages the GAO to investigate gaps in FEMA's  current wildfire policies and recommend ways to streamline the  distribution of assistance to our constituents and the State and local  governments facing these fires head-on.   I am glad to be able to work with Senator Padilla and my colleague,  Zoe Lofgren, on this as California has suffered so much, as has the  West, with wildfire, including a million-acre fire in my own district  last year and repeated wildfires that have affected so many and  displaced so many.   I will add that working with FEMA has worked well, but we do need to  continue to improve the process as FEMA has primarily, up until the  advent of such large fires, dealt mostly with hurricanes and floods of  that nature. We have all had to adapt until we can actually get better  forest management and other tools that will help us prevent fire, and  so, engaging FEMA, we appreciate them, and we want to work to have an  even better process.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   The FIRE Act does increase oversight related to wildfire assistance  and requires FEMA to report information to Congress so we can continue  working--in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, on the  floor, and across the aisle--to improve and streamline the disaster  assistance process.   Again, we appreciate FEMA's efforts on all disasters around the  country. We are just looking for a way to streamline and become even  more efficient with that.   Madam Speaker, I urge support. I appreciate my colleagues--Ms.  Lofgren, my colleague from Louisiana, and Senator Padilla--for the  effort here today in building up to this.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 8416, Disaster Survivors Fairness Act, makes a  series of changes to FEMA's Individuals and Households Programs.   Federal disaster assistance programs will be accessed through a new,  universal application that cuts through the bureaucracy and red tape  survivors face when seeking disaster assistance.   In my own district, we have had so much suffering from wildfire. The  Camp fire destroyed the town of Paradise and displaced so many, as well  as the Dixie fire last year. We just lost folks in a community called  Klamath River, as well as Beckwourth and Happy Camp. I could name many  others.   But, Madam Speaker, when a disaster hits you and when it hits a  family, they need solutions, and they need them soon because they are  going to live in a hotel or a motel. They are going to live with  friends. They are going to live on someone's couch. They are going to  have to leave the State. So when we can more immediately get them the  assistance they need, it is more humane. It certainly allays a lot of  suffering for folks who have already suffered too much already.   So with a streamlined application process we will update an existing  website to view that application through disasterAssistance.gov, an  interagency information-sharing system between FEMA and other Federal  agencies involved in disaster recovery. This will serve a dual purpose  of increased coordination and reduce waste, fraud and abuse.   The Disaster Survivors Fairness Act also opens up and clarifies  FEMA's authority related to home rebuilding and repairs allowing  commonsense solutions that prioritize the survivors' needs in returning  home and mitigating for future disasters, as my constituents are  dealing with in the town of Greenville in northern California. We would  like to expedite that process and not have red tape slow down their  ability to rebuild and come back home.   So, Madam Speaker, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who is the lead Republican sponsor of this  bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, whether you have, as a victim, endured a wildfire,  flood, hurricane, earthquake, or any other calamity, and the different  forms of government are there to assist, in earnest, in good faith,  let's get them an easier process to do so.   One-stop shopping is much preferable to folks that have suffered  disaster and are displaced, their families spread out, and they are  struggling. Via this legislation, I appreciate my colleague from Nevada  pushing this forward and recognizing that.   We struggle in my own district with the Camp fire and the Dixie fire  and so much devastation there. Two entire towns disappeared with  Paradise and Greenville, and another small town, Canyondam. These folks  are displaced, and they are looking for answers.   With the programmatic changes that are available in H.R. 8416, it  will indeed streamline the application process, via disasters, through  the several Federal agencies to help them navigate what we are calling  today the alphabet soup of agencies to get a faster recovery. That is  what we all want.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bill, and I appreciate the  efforts my colleagues have been able to bring forward. I yield back the  balance of my time.
