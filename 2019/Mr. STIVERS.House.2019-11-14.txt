 Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   I don't want to fall into revisionist history. I was one of the  Republicans who signed the discharge petition against my own chairman  and against my own leadership in 2014 and supported the Ex-Im Bank.   I would love to be here this afternoon to be supporting a bipartisan  bill on reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank. We had a bipartisan bill in June,  and it wasn't the Republicans who walked away from it. It was the  Democratic majority that walked away from it. The bill was marked up on  a party-line vote in the Financial Services Committee.   I think it is really important to note that we will reauthorize the  Export-Import Bank in the appropriations process, and many of us  support that. We do not want a lapse. But this bill is going to the  Senate where it goes nowhere. And the administration has said they  would veto it.   Let's not pursue a partisan vehicle here. The Rules Committee had an  opportunity to allow for some amendments that would have addressed some  very important issues, including one from my colleague from Arkansas  (Mr. Hill) that would have stopped China from stealing intellectual  property. They chose to block consideration of those amendments.   Ex-Im reauthorization is now, unfortunately, tied to the  appropriations process, and I think we all know that.   I want to reiterate that my fear is that we are needlessly moving  forward with a party-line vote, or a mostly party-line vote, on  something that has and should be bipartisan.                                time  1515    Finally, I want to address some comments made earlier by one of my  colleagues expressing skepticism about the ranking member, Mr.  McHenry's willingness to back the reauthorization effort.   We all know that the ranking member reached a deal with the  chairwoman in June on reauthorization, and, again, it was the  Democratic majority that walked away from it, not the ranking member. I  just want to make sure everybody understood that that was what  happened.   Furthermore, the deal actually increased Ex-Im's lending cap up to  $175 billion, something that I know our former chairman would have  never done. So I think our ranking member has dealt in good faith  through this whole process. I also think it is completely inaccurate  that they didn't deal in good faith.   Regardless of what happens today, I am hopeful that we will find a  way to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, and I now know it is  definitely tied to the appropriations process.
