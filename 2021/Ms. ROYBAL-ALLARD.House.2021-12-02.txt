 Madam Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Madam Speaker, each year, the first and most  important responsibility Congress has is to determine how taxpayer  dollars will be spent on behalf of our constituents. The continuing  resolution before the House will prevent a government shutdown and give  us sufficient time to complete the full-year funding bills if the  minority will finally come to the negotiating table.   Some friends on the other side of the aisle have suggested simply  enacting a yearlong CR, which would effectively wash our hands of our  constitutional duty. My subcommittee is responsible for drafting the  funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. If, as my  Republican colleagues have suggested, we were to pass a full-year CR,  DHS would lose critical increases in the House bill that are imperative  to the security of the United States. This includes a historic 20  percent increase for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency; funding to increase FEMA's capacity to respond to the growing  frequency of disasters linked to climate change; a quadrupling of  funding for trade facilitation and security at our ports of entry; a 6  percent increase for Homeland Security Investigations; and an 8 percent  increase for critical Coast Guard operations.   Let's quickly approve this short-term CR and then roll up our sleeves  and work together to fulfill our constitutional duty by negotiating  full-year bills.
