That is right. We will be voting  this week on a bill we haven't seen. I think it is a first. I am going  to do a little research to see if this has ever happened before in the  Senate, where Members of the Senate were brought together to vote on a  bill that has not been made public or printed for us to review.   This isn't an inconsequential bill. This is a bill about the  healthcare system of the United States of America. There is not a  single American living in our Nation today who will not be affected by  our vote this week because we are in the process of deciding whether we  will change healthcare in America, health insurance in America, and  there is not a single one of us who doesn't have a health insurance  plan, either private or public, or not affected by the health insurance  industry in healthcare across the United States. In fact, healthcare  itself represents one-sixth of the American economy.   So we are being asked to vote on a bill this week which has not been  printed and given to us and which will change healthcare for every  single American and affect one-sixth of the American economy.   We do know that some of the previous provisions that have been  brought before us on the Republican side have an impact--a negative  impact--and in my State of Illinois, a very personal negative impact.   We know that their effort to repeal ObamaCare, which has been a  political slogan that has been used for 6 or 7 years, ran into a wall  when the American people said: Well, if you repeal it, what is left?  What will be there? What will replace it?   At that point, the Republican effort disassembled. They didn't have  an alternative. They spent the last 6 years  [[Page S4140]]  under ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--saying ``No, repeal it''  without spending the time to think about what would follow, what is  next.   The Congressional Budget Office--this is an interesting thing--the  Congressional Budget Office is a nonpartisan agency that we turn to  that evaluates our work. They take a look at the bills we write, and  they take a look at the laws that will pass, and they say: Well, this  is the impact it will have on the deficit, on future generations, on  entitlement programs.   Sometimes the Congressional Budget Office is maddening. They take  forever. I don't know what is going on over there, but what you think  is a simple question can take weeks and sometimes longer to result in  an analysis, and there are times when I just flat out disagree with  their analysis.   Let me give an example. When we debated the Affordable Care Act, we  said that one of the things we need to do is make sure there is plenty  of preventive medicine. For example, we make sure under the Affordable  Care Act that every senior gets a free annual physical. Our belief is,  if you detect a problem a person has early enough, you might be able to  lessen its impact or actually cure it. We said that to the  Congressional Budget Office, and they replied to us: You cannot put a  dollar value on preventive medicine.    Well, it is common sense; isn't it? If you find something early, it  is more likely to be cured. It is cheaper. No, you can't put a dollar  on it.   So the Congressional Budget Office sometimes can frustrate us, but we  rely on them, and I would say, for the most part, they do give us good  advice. I don't agree completely with them, but they give us good  advice.   Do you know what they say about the Republican repeal plans that have  been passed in the House of Representatives and the various versions  that have been suggested? They believe those repeal efforts will take  health insurance away from 22 million to 32 million Americans.   Think about that. We passed the Affordable Care Act because so many  people in America had no health insurance, and we wanted to make sure  they had it--for their own peace of mind, for their own good health, to  make sure there was fairness in our system so sick people without  health insurance who are cared for don't have their bills passed on to  everybody else. Well, the Congressional Budget Office took a look at  the Republican plan, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives by  four votes--all Republican votes--four votes, and they looked at the  plans proposed by Senator McConnell and the Republicans, and they said:  At the end of the day, 22 to 32 million Americans will lose their  health insurance. They said, in my State of Illinois, 1 million out of  12\1/2\ million will lose their health insurance.   I cannot understand how any Senator of either political party could,  in good conscience, come here and say: Boy, we had a great week. We  just passed a healthcare reform bill, and 1 million people in Illinois  will lose their health insurance. Really? That is why you ran for the  U.S. Senate, to take health insurance coverage away from people? I  would have thought common decency, common sense would suggest we want  to do just the opposite. We want more and more people to fall under the  protection of health insurance.   We also know some of the reforms we built into the Affordable Care  Act are going to be changed by at least the early versions of the  Republican repeal bill. Like what? One out of three Americans has a  preexisting medical condition. A few weeks ago, I went through a heart  procedure that worked out just fine--thank you--but now I have a  preexisting condition. I am in pretty big company: one out of three  people across the United States.   Remember the day before we passed the Affordable Care Act? Before we  passed the Affordable Care Act, if you had a preexisting condition, if  you could get health insurance, it was darned expensive.   A good friend of mine had a trucking company. He had some problems  with his ankle. He went to the doctor. The next year, when they wrote  the health insurance plan for his trucking company, they excluded  anything on the health insurance policy affecting his legs and his  feet. Each year, he said, I was afraid to turn in any claim because the  next year they wouldn't cover him. It is a preexisting condition.   We changed that. We changed the law. We said, in America, when you  sell health insurance, you cannot discriminate because of preexisting  conditions. You can't discriminate with higher premiums because you  have a child with diabetes. You can't discriminate with higher premiums  if your wife has survived breast cancer. Now, to me, that is common  sense, and it is humane.   The Republican approach allows the States to waive that--back to the  bad old days, when preexisting conditions could run your premiums  through the roof, where you have haves and have-nots when it comes to  health insurance, and Republicans said the other protections we put in  the Affordable Care Act are also on the chopping block.   For example, my wife and I raised three kids, put them through  college. They had their health insurance when they were students. They  came out of college looking for jobs--thank you--and it took a little  while to find the right job, and we worried: Now that they are not in  school, whose health insurance is going to protect them while they are  looking for a job with benefits?   We put in the Affordable Care Act that your kids--young adults--can  stay under your family health insurance plan until they reach the age  of 26. It is just common sense. Keep them under the family plan until  they have a chance to get that job with benefits.   We put other provisions in there--lifetime limits. It used to be, you  would buy health insurance in this country and to keep the costs down,  they would say: We have you covered. Up to $150,000, you are covered.  Now, $150,000 sounds like a huge amount of money to people of modest  means and working families, but we all know you are one accident or one  diagnosis away from having medical bills that go through the roof. So  $150,000? Get real. That could be 2 days in a hospital with a doctor  and a surgery or radiation. That is the reality.   So we took lifetime limits off the policies. They can't do that to  you in America anymore. When you buy health insurance, you have health  insurance, and if, God forbid, your condition takes your bills to sky  heaven, they are going to be covered. Now the Republicans say: Well,  that is another thing we will take out. We will make that optional.   Can I tell you one other one that really gets me because it was a big  debate here for years. Back where my friend Senator Sheldon Whitehouse  is standing used to be the desk of Paul Wellstone, a liberal Senator  from the State of Minnesota. What a good guy--terrific guy--short,  feisty. Boy, when he got into a fight, you wanted to be on his side.    Paul Wellstone teamed up with a man who sat right there named Pete  Domenici. Pete Domenici was exactly the opposite politically: from New  Mexico, conservative, Republican, disagreed with Wellstone on virtually  everything, except for one thing. Each of them had in their families  someone suffering from mental illness. They decided they were going to  do something about the fact that most health insurance plans did not  cover mental illness. It was a battle that went on for years to require  health insurance to include mental illness and they won the battle and  we put it in the Affordable Care Act. Now, the Republicans say: Let's  make that optional. This is something you can buy if you want to buy  it.   At the end of the day, I think we all know we need a health insurance  plan which is there when we need it, that covers things we can't even  imagine when we buy the health insurance, and it makes sure people  don't end up broke and bankrupt because of healthcare bills.   That was the driving cause, the driving reason for people filing  bankruptcy in America--medical bills. They couldn't pay them. Since we  passed the Affordable Care Act, the number of bankruptcies filed  because of medical bills has been cut in half. So good health insurance  that covers you when you need it and covers a member of your family  when you need it is essential. That is why this debate and this vote  tomorrow are so essential.   One thing I forgot to mention. Wellstone and Domenici didn't just  [[Page S4141]]  cover mental illness. They put another provision in there, and most of  us paid no attention to it: substance abuse treatment. That has to be  covered in health insurance too. Is that important? Have you heard of  the opioid epidemic, the heroin epidemic?   I recently asked one of the best providers in Chicago about this, and  they said: Luckily, people who have a child who ends up being addicted  and needs treatment, if they have private health insurance, there is  some coverage. Now, there is a battle about how many bills will be paid  and how much is paid, but it is covered under the health insurance  plan. Republicans want to make that optional. They call it freedom of  choice.   The junior Senator from Texas, Ted Cruz, talks about policies you  could buy that are really cheap policies. We call it junk insurance.  You are insured in name only. If you need it, it isn't going to be  there. That has been in the Republican plans that have come before us.  We don't know whether that will be in the plan we have to vote on  tomorrow. We don't know. It is a mystery.   How many hearings have been held on the bill we will vote for  tomorrow on proceeding to change healthcare in America? None. Not one.  How many amendments have been offered? Of course, none. We haven't seen  it. We don't know.   We also know something else. The Republican plan on healthcare will  slash the Medicaid Program. Most people--myself included--a few years  ago, would have been stumped to describe the Medicaid Program and what  it covered. Now, I will tell you what it covers, and think about  cutting what I am about to describe by 25 to 35 percent.   No. 1, half of the children born in the State of Illinois are paid  for by Medicaid. Their mother's prenatal care, the birth of the child,  and postnatal care of mom and the kid is covered by Medicaid--one-half.   In addition to that, every school district in my State--probably in  Rhode Island, probably in Oklahoma--receives Medicaid payments--school  districts. Why? For the kids with special education needs. Medicaid  helps pay for counselors so these kids can be mainstreamed in  education. Medicaid in my State even pays for feeding tubes for those  severely disabled children who are in school--but a 25- to 35-percent  cut in the Republicans' proposals for Medicaid.   The most expensive thing in Medicaid, the thing that costs the most  money, I haven't mentioned. Is your mother in a nursing home? Is your  father? Your grandfather? Sixty percent of the people in nursing homes  rely on Medicaid to stay in that nursing home and get the basic care  they need. So when you cut that by 25 to 35 percent, what happens to  Mom? What happens to your grandfather? Does that mean the family now  has a bill to pick up? Does that mean they have to leave the nursing  home and go somewhere else? Where will that be? Yet that is one of the  proposals.   The disabled community, they stepped up as well. Medicaid is health  insurance for disabled people in America. A woman in Champagne came to  me and said: I have a 23-year-old son with autism. He is pretty good.  He is kind of on his own. He is doing some things. Senator, if he  didn't have Medicaid health insurance, I would have to put him in an  institution. I don't want to do that.   How important is Medicaid? How important is it that the Republicans  will slash this Medicaid? It gets to the heart of healthcare for tens  of millions of people in the United States of America.   Why do Republicans want to cut Medicaid? It is simple. It is linear.  It is direct. They have to cut $700 billion out of Medicaid to provide  a tax cut for the wealthiest people in America.   Oh, Durbin, you are making that up. This must be a press release from  the Democratic National Committee. No, that is exactly what it is all  about. In order to pay for the tax cuts to the highest income  individuals, to pharmaceutical companies, and to health insurance  companies, they cut Medicaid payments to the States. They think that is  simple justice, a tax cut. They are always for tax cuts, but look who  pays for that tax cut.   So who lines up for and against the Republican approach we are going  to get to vote on tomorrow? That is easy. There is not a single medical  advocacy group in America today supporting the Republican position.  That is a pretty broad statement. You had better be ready to back it  up, Senator. I am ready. Hospitals, doctors, nurses, pediatricians,  every medical advocacy group, and community clinics all oppose what the  Republicans are setting out to do--and they are not alone. Remember the  preexisting conditions? I mentioned diabetes and cancer. The American  Diabetes Association, the American Cancer Association, the American  Heart, Lung, you name it, all of those groups oppose what the  Republicans are setting out to do. They realize it is a dramatic step  backward in terms of healthcare in America.   Every healthcare repeal bill Congressional Republicans have devised  to date has represented a massive step backward for healthcare. None of  the bills proposed by Senate or House Republicans would increase the  number of Americans with health insurance coverage. It does just the  opposite. None of them reduce costs or improve care.   You say: Well, if you tell me you don't know what the bill is going  to be, how are you describing it? I am giving the composite of all the  bills that have been offered by the Republicans in the House and  Senate. So far, we think--one in the House for sure--four different  bills in the Senate, which I have just described, you will find this in  all the bills. They don't get better, they get worse. None of them will  strengthen our healthcare system or improve people's lives.   One of my Republican colleagues really put it in a few words very  directly and said recently: I didn't come to Washington to hurt people.   I trust that none of us--not a single Republican or Democrat--came  for that purpose. We want to help people, don't we? Isn't that why we  are here? That is why we need to reject this approach. It is why we  need to sit down together and make our healthcare system better.   I voted for the Affordable Care Act. I believe in it. It cut the  number of uninsured people in my State in half, and I think that is a  worthy goal. It made many other changes which I have described here  this evening.   Is it perfect? By no means. I used this example before: The only  perfect law that I know of was carried down the side of a mountain on  clay tablets by Senator Moses. Everybody else does their best, and  sometimes we need a little help. Our current healthcare system needs  some help.   Let me tell you where I think we ought to change it. No. 1, we know  that the one market where the premiums are going through the roof is  the individual marketplace, where small business people and others are  facing skyrocketing premiums. What percentage of America fits into that  group? Six percent. They are not being treated fairly under the current  system. We have to change it. We have to make healthcare premiums  affordable. Every Republican plan brought before us raises those  premium costs.   No. 2, we don't address the costs of prescription drugs in the  Affordable Care Act. Health insurance companies tell us that is driving  premium costs more than any single item. Blue Cross Blue Shield in  Illinois pays more for pharmaceuticals--prescription drugs--each year  than they pay for inpatient hospital care. There is nothing that is  controlling these costs. We should; shouldn't we?   Shouldn't we agree that, if you happen to live in some part of the  country where you don't have health insurance available in the  marketplace, at a very minimum you will have a public option? What do I  mean by that? A plan that looks like Medicare, a plan that isn't driven  by profit, but a plan that provides the basic services. We can do that.  We have Medicare Advantage programs. We have other options. We want to  make sure that is available to every American. You choose it, if you  wish.   Those three things right off the top I would include as part of what  we can do on a bipartisan basis--Democrats and Republicans. Take the  tax cut off the table. Take slashing Medicaid off the table. Take  rewards to health insurance companies off the table. Focus on helping  the families, businesses, and individuals in America who need this  basic protection.   We are going to go into this mystery vote tomorrow. We have been  elected  [[Page S4142]]  to the U.S. Senate. There aren't many people in history who have had  this honor. What we are doing tomorrow does not bring honor to the  Senate.   Considering a bill that has not been written, published, and  disclosed to the American people is just wrong. Considering a bill that  has never had a committee hearing is unfair. Considering a bill that I  am sure will have many flaws and weaknesses is reckless.   That is what we face this week. How important is it? It may be the  most important vote we cast this year as far as I am concerned. There  is nothing more important in life than the peace of mind in knowing you  have health insurance at that critical moment when you or somebody in  your family desperately needs help.   There is not going to be a minor amendment offered on the floor that  will straighten out the situation.   I know my colleagues are here to speak. I will close by saying this.  If you come to watch this bill, whatever it is, brought before the  Senate in the next few days, it will not be a moment when you think  better of this place. It is a process called vote-arama. Here is what  it means. You put an amendment on the floor and file it with the clerk.  They read the amendment. Then you have 2 minutes--1 minute for and 1  minute against--and you vote.   Really? We are going to take the healthcare system of America and put  it through that kind of a process, where we don't even have time to sit  and measure the impact of one amendment over the other? The  Congressional Budget Office will not have its analysis. So it is really  going to be a free skate. We will be up here trying our best to vote  yes or no on these amendments if we proceed to the bill.   Here is the good news. If 3 Republicans--3 out of 52--will step up  and say: Stop, we can do better as a Senate, that will be the end of  this terrible endeavor. We will send the measure back to committee. We  will have Democrats and Republicans sit down. They will go through the  regular process. They will produce a bill. The public will get to read  it. They will go through expert testimony. Then we will have an  amendment process. Then they will bring it to the floor, and we will do  the same. We will consider it carefully. We will use our best judgment  and try to come up with something on a bipartisan basis that is a  credit to America.   Instead, what we are going to face, if the majority leader has his  way tomorrow, is a process that does not serve this country well and  does not bring honor to the Senate.   I urge my Republican colleagues, three of them at least, to step up.  They aren't just saving a lot of people across America from the worry  of whether they have good health insurance when they desperately need  it. They are saving the reputation of the Senate.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The Senator from Pennsylvania.
