 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5  minutes.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add my  amendment No. 2352 to the list of amendments to be voted on under the  previous agreement.    Mr. President, 3 weeks ago, my colleagues across the  aisle tried to pull a fast one on the American people. Behind closed  doors, with no public hearings and no public debate, they decided that  some of the names of our Nation's military bases must be removed,  stripped, replaced, erased, and they decided that war memorials of  fallen soldiers should come down. I objected to that effort then, and I  object to it now.   The national defense legislation that we are considering, the  legislation that funds our military and protects our citizens, should  not be turned into a vehicle for the cancel culture. The cancel culture  that I think you know what I mean--the cancel culture that is tearing  down statues of George Washington, Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln,  and Theodore Roosevelt now, for heaven's sake--this cancel movement  seeks to divide us, not unite; to erase our history, rather than to  reckon with it; to turn away from our long and shared struggle to forge  a more perfect Union, and, instead, to build an entirely different  America of a kind of woke fundamentalism.   I am here to advocate for a better way. All I ask for is a vote on an  amendment to have this discussion in  [[Page S4198]]  public, to have the discussion about renaming our military bases and  about the future of these war memorials in public, to conduct open  hearings where military families and veterans and the local community  can be heard and where we can seek and find common ground together.  That is all I am asking for. And all I am asking for is a vote on this.   Yet, here today, on the floor of the U.S. Senate, I have been told  that we cannot even have a vote. We can't even call the roll on this.  No, we just have to swallow it and move on as the woke cancel culture  moves on, steamrolling our history and our traditions, and, yes, our  best traditions as Americans.   You know, our military bases are more than walls and fences. They are  more than lines on a piece of paper in a 1,000-page bill. Our bases are  full of life and history. They are hallowed ground for the soldiers and  veterans who have trained and served at them. They enrich local  communities with their legacy. They form fond memories, and they help  relationships endure. They have meaning that transcends any one person  or even a place, and that history belongs to all of us. So all of us  should debate this together and move forward together. I am sorry that  we have been denied an opportunity to do so today.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
