 Mr. President, I, along with 70 of my  Republican colleagues, object to the counting of the electoral votes  for the State of Michigan on the grounds that the error rate exceeds  the FEC rate allowed at 0.0008 percent, and that the people who signed  affidavits at risk of perjury, their voices have not been heard in a  court of law.                                time  0000    The VICE PRESIDENT. Sections 15 and 17 of title 3 of the U.S. Code,  require that any objection be presented in writing and signed by a  Member of the House of Representatives and a Senator.   Is the objection in writing and signed by a Member and a Senator?    The objection is in writing, not signed by a  Senator.   The VICE PRESIDENT. In that case, the objection cannot be  entertained.   Are there any further objections to counting the certificate of the  vote from the State of Michigan that the teller has verified appears to  be regular in form and authentic?   There was no objection.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Hearing no further objections, this certificate  from Minnesota, the Parliamentarians have advised me, is the only  certificate of vote from that State that purports to be a return from  the State and that has annexed to it a certificate of an authority of  the State purporting to appoint or ascertain electors.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 6, 2021, on page H96, third column and second paragraph,  the following appeared: The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, the certificate of the electoral  vote of the State of Minnesota seems to be regular in form and  authentic, and it appears therefrom that Joseph R. Biden, Jr., of the  State of Delaware received 10 votes for President and Kamala D. Harris  of the State of California received 10 votes for Vice President.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there any objections to counting the  certificate of the vote from the State of Minnesota that the teller has  verified appears to be regular in form and authentic?   There was no objection.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Hearing none, this certificate from Mississippi,  the Parliamentarians have advised, is the only certificate of vote from  that State that purports to be a return from the State and that has  annexed to it a certificate of an authority of the State purporting to  appoint or ascertain electors.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 6, 2021, on page H96, third column and fifth paragraph,  the following appeared: The VICE PRESIDENT.

I would like to point out that all the cases  that have been thrown out have been thrown out on standing, not the  evidence of voter fraud. I would also like to point out the same people  who, for 4 years, have failed to find a shred of evidence to convict  President Trump of Russian collusion are the same people trying to  discredit hardworking American poll watchers who are risking perjury by  signing affidavits confirming massive voter fraud in multiple States.   The same fake news who took the word of Christine Blasey Ford against  Justice Kavanaugh, who her own friends denied happened, also dismissed  the sworn under penalty of perjury accounts from people who witnessed  the election fraud.   The same fact-checkers who told you that Dominion machines weren't  connected to the internet and couldn't be hacked are the same people  telling you that there has been no voter fraud and no violations of  election law. But it has been proven that these machines are connected  and that they can be hacked.   We have heard repeatedly argued that objecting to these ballots is  unconstitutional and violates the rights of State legislatures. They  would rather us affirm fraud and pass the buck back to States rather  than following the process Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson, and the  Framers of the Constitution designed.   When States fail to do their job, we are the last line of defense.  Congress is here for this exact situation. We are here to be the fail- safe when States refuse to protect the people's votes.   By objecting today, we are telling the thousands of witnesses who  signed affidavits that we have their back, and we will not allow local  officials who violate their own election laws to steal this election  from those who lawfully voted.    I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman).
