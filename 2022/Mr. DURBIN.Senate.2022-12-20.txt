 Mr. President, I come to the floor very briefly to make a  note of an article that appeared this morning in the Chicago Sun-Times.  The article relates to an opportunity that Terrence Duffy, who is  currently the chairman of the Chicago-based CME Group, the Chicago  Mercantile Exchange--Mr. Duffy, in his testimony before Congress and  the Senate, has commented on the situation with the cryptocurrency  exchange known as FTX and its former head, Sam Bankman-Fried.   We are all aware of what happened here. This is a situation wherein  an individual capitalized on the cryptocurrency craze and became a  billionaire. He was a young man who struck a different pose than most  financiers. He spent his time wearing T-shirts and playing video games  when he wasn't making millions of dollars with his crypto investment.   Many people were unfortunately drawn into his portrayal of what  cryptocurrency could result in and lost their shirts. Mr. Bankman-Fried  went from billionaire to bankrupt in a matter of 72 hours.   The question is, Should America have seen this coming? Should we have  done more? That raises serious questions.   The purpose of entering this article into the Record is to make note  of the fact that Terrence Duffy, with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  forewarned us of this possibility.   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is a major part of the economy of  Chicago, of Illinois, and of the Midwest. It is an industry that has  been established over decades, and it is a regulated industry. One  might get the impression that regulation and success in business are  antithetical, but in this circumstance, the Federal regulation of the  Chicago Mercantile Exchange not only gives assurance of its integrity,  it also enhances its reputation around the world--a lesson that the  cryptocurrency world might learn.   If we are going to lead the world when it comes to financial  investment, we have to assure the world that it is on the square, and  the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, for one, which has the  regulatory authority over the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, has set out  on that mission successfully for decades.   I wanted to note the fact that when he appeared before the U.S. House  Agriculture Committee in May, Mr. Duffy warned us about the dangers  that were inherent to the FTX enterprise. He said at one point that he  believed the proposal that Mr. Bankman-Fried was making to create his  business model was fraught with dangers. Mr. Duffy called it at the  time in May a ``risk management light'' that could destabilize  financial markets involved in cryptocurrency.   I am a member of the Agriculture Committee, and we may have some  element of jurisdiction over this cryptocurrency industry as it relates  to commodities. We have had one hearing wherein the chairman of the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission came before us and made a  presentation as to why he believed we had an opportunity and an  obligation to regulate. I agree with him. If this cryptocurrency world  is to continue with any credibility, it needs adequate authorization  and regulation to make sure that the people who are investing in it are  protected.   I have written two separate letters to Fidelity--a major financial  house in Massachusetts--and raised questions as to their assertions  that people should be allowed to include cryptocurrency in their  retirement accounts. I am skeptical of an account, when you should be  making conservative investments for your future, that enters into this  high-flying cryptocurrency world, which, as we see from the experience  of FTX, is fraught with danger.   There is a great effort underway by the cryptocurrency world to  become major players in American politics. I discovered, much to my  surprise, weeks after I had raised questions about the future of  cryptocurrency, that FTX and Mr. Bankman-Fried had, in fact,  contributed to me.   I was asked by a reporter: Have you received any contributions from  this enterprise or industry?   I said: Of course not.   Then I looked to find I had. They had sent money unsolicited by me  and unknown to me until 2 weeks ago. That money, of course, is going to  be redirected to charitable enterprises and not to a political purpose  for me or any of my staff.   It is an indication, though, that they have more money than friends  in the cryptocurrency world and that they are trying to make sure they  have plenty of friends in Congress and on Capitol Hill. It is the  nature of our political campaigns that a massive amount of money is  invested and spent. Oftentimes, candidates can't keep up with the blur  of contributions and expenditures. Well, that happened to me when it  came to FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried, and I think it might have happened  to others.   So let's take care. If we are going to do our duty for the American  people, we have to regulate this industry in a way to protect them from  the disastrous results which we recently saw with FTX.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chicago Sun-Times  article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                        [From the Chicago Sun-Times]   CME Group's Boss Spotted Early Trouble at Crypto Exchange FTX Run by                             Sam Bankman-Fried                             (By David Roeder)         Sam Bankman-Fried, who sold himself as a T-shirt-wearing,       video-gaming whiz kid disrupting all things financial, has       been arrested in the collapse of his FTX cryptocurrency       exchange.        It's shaping up as the biggest scandal roaring through the       markets since Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme and, irrespective       of Bankman-Fried's guilt or innocence, it's making a lot of       supposed sharpies look very bad.        They include funders such as Chicago-based private equity       firm Thoma Bravo, the Ontario Teachers Pension Fund and       Sequoia Capital. Sequoia published a glowing profile of       Bankman-Fried weeks before it wrote off the value of its       investment with him. It described how he Played League of       Legends while on a call with the firm, taking that as a good       thing. By some accounts, federal regulators were quite late       on the case.        Many FTX backers issued statements after its Nov. 11       bankruptcy about the rigor of their vetting processes. It's       puzzling how so many people with advanced degrees and       powerful computer programs missed what John Ray III, the       executive brought in to clean up the mess, called ``just old-      fashioned embezzlement. This is just taking money from       customers and using it for your own purpose.'' Ray told       Congress customers may have lost $8 billion.        Clearly, none of the backers listened to early warnings       from a Chicago business executive who knows something about       risk management.        Terrence Duffy is the chairman of CME Group, the largest       futures exchange in the U.S. It's the amalgam of the Chicago       Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, the New York       Mercantile Exchange and other assets. He sounded alarms about       possible problems with FTX early on and said in March he       called Bankman Fried a fraud to his face.        A week after the FTX implosion, Duffy went on the On the       Tape podcast to elaborate on the conversation. It started       with talk of a business deal but quickly turned sour when       Duffy said it was clear FTX had no plan to isolate risk in       crypto trading. ``I said, `Your model is crap. Why would I       deploy a model that's going to introduce risk to the system?'       '' Duffy said on the podcast.        At the time, Bankman-Fried was said to be worth $26       billion. As Duffy recounted it, ``I said, `My net worth       doesn't start with any b's. I'll give you a 3 to 1 that I       have more money than you.' I said, `I'll tell you what, I'll       give you a 4 to 1 I got more money in my right pocket than       your net worth.' I said, `You're a fraud, and I'm going to       make sure that we get this out there.' And that was it. So we       went to Congress.''        It sounds like a South Side guy talking. Duffy is among the       longest-serving chairmen in Chicago business, having gotten       there without a wealthy background or an MBA. He grew up in       Mount Greenwood, where his parents had a floral shop. He       tended bar, including at She-nannigan's on Division Street,       thinking of becoming a cop or firefighter.        His parents mortgaged their house so he could lease his       first membership at the old Merc in 1981. He once said he       paid them back in two years. On the trading floor, he made       connections and earned people's trust. After serving on the       exchange's board, he was named Merc chairman in 2002 and has       led it through its absorption of the Board of Trade and       transformative growth.  [[Page S7791]]         He testified before the U.S. House Agriculture Committee in       May about FTX's dangers with Bankman-Fried sitting next to       him. Both were clearly uncomfortable.        Duffy's written testimony was jargony but carefully laid       out what he saw as deficiencies in FTX's operation compared       with futures markets, which has several levels of protections       against trading defaults. CME Group calls the protections its       ``default waterfall'' on its website.        Duffy said futures trading firms hold $173 billion to cover       trading risks. FTX was proposing an algorithm that would in       stages liquidate accounts depending on how prices fluctuated.       ``The proposal as put forth is fraught with dangers,'' Duffy       said. He called it ``risk management light'' that would       destabilize financial markets beyond crypto.        Since that hearing, the FTX story has gotten worse. Federal       prosecutors have charged Bankman-Fried with running a brazen       scheme to apply customer funds toward real estate purchases       and political contributions and to cover losses at Alameda       Research, a crypto hedge fund he founded. Bankman-Fried has       admitted his operations lacked basic financial controls but       denied an intent to defraud.        Ray, who worked on the Enron case, described the alleged       fraud as years in the making.        Why do people fall for this stuff? Chalk it up to ego, lazy       due diligence and that bane of money managers, the fear of       missing out.        Investors and regulators should have taken to heart Duffy's       clear-eyed Chicago view. Tending bar and making your mark on       the old trading floors can qualify you to spot trouble ahead.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     I yield the floor.    Mr. President, we are witnessing the end of an era. After  nearly five decades of principled service to his beloved State of  Vermont, to our Nation, and to the cause of peace and justice  throughout the world, Patrick J. Leahy is leaving the U.S. Senate. His  departure feels like a bit of a personal loss for me. As long as I have  served on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy has been there.  He joined that committee in January 1979. And for more than two decades  of his tenure on the committee, he served as the chair or ranking  member.   He has been a champion of the right to vote, of civil liberties, of  freedom of information, of intellectual property, and of upholding and  defending the Constitution. He chaired the historic confirmation  hearings of the first Black Attorney General, Eric Holder, as well as  the confirmation hearings of Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor,  the first Latina Justice. He also presided over the historic markup of  bipartisan comprehensive immigration legislation in 2013, and I want to  assure Senator Leahy that I will continue pushing to reform our broken  immigration system. During his service on the Judiciary Committee,  Senator Leahy has been a voice of calm and reason when tempers have  flared. And he has been a mentor to Members, including me, and to the  many staffers who have served him over the years. Just as you can never  know a person's life until you walk a mile in their shoes, you can't  know the patience and skills it takes to chair an important Senate  committee like the Judiciary Committee until you bang that gavel. Thank  goodness, I had Senator Leahy as a teacher and example.   He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1974--part of that big new class  of Senators known as the ``Watergate Babies.'' They came to Washington  to try to restore people's faith in government and in America itself.  Today, Pat Leahy is the last ``Watergate Baby'' still serving in  Congress. It seems fitting that his very first vote in this Senate was  to authorize the Church Committee, the precursor to today's Senate  Select Committee on Intelligence. The Church Committee was created to  investigate possible abuses of power and illegalities by the CIA, the  FBI, and the National Security Agency--and it resulted in major  reforms. In the decades since, Patrick Leahy has never shied away from  the hard votes. He has voted time and again to uphold the values of our  Constitution, even when doing so contained political risk. I have the  greatest respect for his fidelity to the rule of law and his determined  efforts to safeguard the independence and integrity of America's  Federal judiciary. I was informed recently that Senator Leahy has been  in the Senate for the confirmation of every single article III judge  serving in active status across the Nation. That is an incredible  statistic. He is a statesman and a humanitarian whose commitment to  human rights--at home and abroad--is revered throughout the world.   I am particularly grateful for his longstanding commitment to funding  the Paul Simon Water for the Poor and Water for the World Acts, the  latter of which I authored and named for my closest friend in politics,  the man whose seat I now hold. These two bills and the ensuing critical  funding have spurred a historic American effort to bring greater  health, dignity, economic opportunity, and access to school--especially  for girls--by providing approximately 57 million of the world's poor  with either improved or first time access to clean water and more than  38 million with sanitation services over the last 11 years.   Pat Leahy has gone from ``Watergate Baby,'' to senior statesman, to  President pro tempore of the Senate--third in line to the Presidency.  He has helped shape some of our Nation's most important laws for two  generations. He is a champion of human rights and the rule of law, at  home and abroad. And yet, somehow, he has never lost his sense of awe  about our democracy. You can see that in the way he still carries his  old, 35-millimeter camera to record historic moments.   The great photographer Annie Leibovitz said that if her photos have a  hallmark, it is ``that I was not afraid to fall in love with these  people.'' The hallmark of Pat Leahy's service to America is also love-- love for our Constitution, love for fairness and decency, and love of  people, especially those who are so often overlooked.   Last but not least, Patrick's life has been shaped and enriched by  his love for his wife Marcelle and their family. My wife Loretta and I  wish Patrick and Marcelle may more years of happiness together. May  they be filled with good health and good purpose. And don't forget to  send us a few photos every once in a while.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper) and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Casey)  and the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Hickenlooper) are necessarily  absent.    Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues, Senator  Sinema and Senator Tillis, for their statements earlier on the floor on  the issue of immigration. A number of us are coming to the floor to  discuss it today.   It is a sad day--sad because there are many people who are counting  on this Congress to do something, who understood that we have an  immigration system that is terribly broken and we are paying a heavy  price for it, and there are many who are watching this proceeding today  who are paying an even heavier price.   If we do nothing to help those who are protected by DACA, if we do  nothing to help the Dreamers, court decisions may preempt us and may  force some of these people to face the reality that they can no longer  legally work in America and they are subject to deportation.   Many of these young people--and I will tell the story of one in just  a moment--have spent their whole lives here in the United States. They  have gone to our schools. They go to our churches. We see them at the  high school football games. They work in the Dairy Queens. They are all  over America because they are part of America--at least they think they  are, but they are not. They are undocumented. Their parents brought  them to this country when they were infants and toddlers and little  kids. They grew up in this Nation thinking they were part of it, and  then there was a day of awakening when the parents sat down and said:  We have to tell you the truth. You are not here legally.   These are the Dreamers, people I have been trying to help for over 20  years. It is over 20 years since I first introduced the DREAM Act. I  wanted to help them. I thought perhaps we could get something done. We  haven't been able to. Unfortunately, today, it looks very, very  unlikely that we will.   I hear in the comments from the Senator from Arizona and the Senator  from North Carolina the bottom-line truth: Any reasonable, factual  discussion or debate on immigration has to not only deal with the  Dreamers and those who are here on undocumented status but also has to  deal with what is going on at our southern border. The Senator from  Arizona is correct. It is a humanitarian and security nightmare that is  only getting worse. We are being flooded at the border by people who  want to be safely in the United States.   I had an opportunity to meet some of those migrants who were bused to  Chicago a few weeks ago and sit down across the table from them and  hear their stories. I tell you, I recommend that to all who are  interested in this issue. Hear the real stories of desperation and  danger they faced in the countries they came from, and realize that  their sentiments to be part of America, protected in America, have an  opportunity in America, are the same sentiments that brought my  grandmother to this country with my 2-year-old mother and her sister  and brother.   I recall the stories. These are not people setting out to cheat some  political system; these are people fighting for survival--Carlos, with  his 4-year-  [[Page S7809]]  old daughter and his nursing infant and his wife, who spent 4 months in  a journey from Venezuela to our border. In addition to that, there is  an individual named Maria who is a college-educated individual in  Caracas who left because of fear for her life. She came to the United  States. During her trek to this country, she went through violent  personal assault in Mexico. She broke down in front of us when she told  us the story. These are real people, real human beings.   One of the bottom-line principles that should guide us--I think there  are at least three, maybe more, but the ones that come to my mind are  these:   We have to have an orderly process at our border. There has to be  some system that monitors the number of people coming in and the  circumstances that bring them here. That is No. 1.   No. 2, we should never knowingly allow anyone dangerous to come into  this country. That is unequivocal. I hope everyone agrees on that.   Third, and this is the hardest part, we cannot accept at any given  moment all of the people who want to come to America at that moment. We  have to have an orderly, timely process that makes sense for America,  that makes sense for our reputation as a humane nation and moves us  forward along the right track.   I think of these Dreamers because I come to this floor so many  times--five different times I have called up the DREAM Act for passage.  Five different times I got a majority vote on the floor, but in the  Senate, as most people know, it takes 60 out of 100, and I couldn't get  the 60-vote margin five different times.   Years ago, 10 years ago, we had a Saturday morning vote. This Gallery  was filled with these young people. They were wearing caps and gowns to  tell the story that they want to be graduates of schools--high schools  and colleges--and be part of America's future. When we lost that vote  and didn't get our 60 votes, I joined with them at a church nearby, a  Lutheran church, and there were a lot of tears being shed at that  moment from me and from all the others.   I said to them at the time: I am not going to give up on you. Don't  give up on me. We can do this.   That has driven me ever since. I reached out in every direction that  I can think of to try to find allies in this conversation who will sit  down on a bipartisan basis and fix this broken immigration system.   I want to thank the Senator from Arizona for taking the initiative on  this issue along with Senator Tillis. I believe that their proposal,  while I don't agree with it all, is the right starting point for the  conversation and debate on a bipartisan basis. The real starting point  has to be the true stories of the people who are going to be affected  by this.   Let me tell you one, as I have before. This is the 132nd time I have  taken to the floor of the Senate to tell the story of a Dreamer.   This young man's name is Jose Flores Valor. Jose arrived in this  country from Mexico when he was only 11 months old. He grew up in my  home State of Illinois, in DeKalb, IL.   At a young age, he served as the interpreter for his family at their  medical appointments. It was through these experiences, watching the  doctors care for and provide support for his family, that his passion  for healthcare bloomed. In high school, Jose enrolled in a certified  nursing assistant course, and his goal was to eventually become a  doctor.   It was not until he was 16 and his classmates were getting driver's  licenses and making their decisions about colleges that Jose realized  he was undocumented. Even though he was accepted into the University of  Illinois in Chicago, his legal status meant he did not qualify for any  Federal Government assistance or scholarships, and he could not afford  to stay beyond the first semester. He didn't let that obstacle stop  him. Jose sought other avenues for pursuing a career in healthcare and  recently earned an associate of science degree from Kishwaukee College  in Illinois.   On top of a busy academic schedule, Jose worked with a travel nursing  agency as a certified nursing assistant. In this role, he traveled to  six different States, working in rehab centers, nursing homes, and  hospitals and provided care to our most vulnerable citizens.   When the pandemic hit, Jose was deployed across the country to meet  urgent healthcare needs. His work took him far from home, which meant  he was unable to be by his grandfather's side when his grandfather  passed away from COVID. It was one of the many sacrifices Jose made to  pursue his passion serving our Nation.   Today, Jose has earned a full scholarship at Loyola University in  Chicago to complete his premedical studies and obtain a bachelor's  degree.   Let me take a moment to say a kind word about Loyola University in  Chicago. There are many great higher education institutions in my State  and in our Nation, but they have gone out of their way to really show  that they care for people like Jose. It was their Stritch College of  Medicine which opened competition for the first time to DACA students  all over the United States. They didn't give them a quota or say there  was a certain number to be accepted but said: You can compete with  everybody else for admission.   For many of these DACA students in Illinois and outside, it was the  first chance they ever had to apply to a medical school. As a result,  more than 25 students were accepted by Loyola Stritch College of  Medicine, and here, they have accepted, with full scholarship, Jose  Valor to complete his premed studies on the way to a bachelor's degree.   He wants to attend medical school and begin his journey towards being  a doctor. He plans one day to open a clinic to help the uninsured and  low-income people. He considered DACA his ``opportunity to become a  contributing member of society.''   A simple question: Is America better or worse for having Jose living  among us? Would we be better off if we just deported him back to  Mexico? He came here before he was 1 year old. He didn't know a thing  about the journey or where his parents were taking him. He has done  everything right since--volunteering to help with healthcare, risking  his own life during the COVID-19 crisis to help other people, doing the  hard work that many people would turn away from, and now trying to  finish college with a premed degree so that he can become a medical  professional in America.   Do we need him? I need him in Chicago. I can think of places around  our State where we are waiting for people with nursing backgrounds and  medical backgrounds to step up and to treat American people.   One of the hospitals in Chicago came to see me last week. It  struggles. It is in a tough neighborhood. The administrator of the  hospital said to me: We almost closed down one of our departments, but  luckily--luckily--we were able to bring in 30 Filipino nurses to  augment our staff to keep that department open. Thirty immigrant  Filipino nurses are keeping a department open in a major hospital in  the city of Chicago. That story is repeated everywhere.   For people saying that we need no more immigrants, that we just don't  need them, they are wrong. We need Jose. We need those nurses. We need  people who will make this a better nation.   We have to do our work here. We have to deal not only with their  situation, the undocumented situation, but also with border security.  The Senator from Arizona was correct. It is a humanitarian and security  challenge, and now it may have to wait for another day. We can't finish  it this week. But when we do return to it, let's do it with an open  mind and an open heart. Let's understand that we can make this a better  and safer nation, a nation of immigrants who make us a better place,  and we can have order at the border as well. That is the only thing  that gives us any chance to thrive as an American nation into the  future.   I look forward to working with the Senators. I thank them for their  initiative and will do all I can to help them.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper) is necessarily absent.    Madam President, last March, the Department of Homeland  Security's Office of Inspector General released a report which revealed  that the Department's intelligence division had identified ``specific''  threats related to January 6 before the deadly assault on the U.S.  Capitol. But the report said that the Trump-era DHS did not share the  intelligence about those threats with other key law enforcement  partners until 2 days after the mob stormed the Capitol. By then, no  one needed a warning.   In an article in the Washington Post a few days after the 2020  election, a person identified only as ``an anonymous senior Republican  official'' shrugged off Mr. Trump's unprecedented denial of President  Biden's victory. He asked: ``What is the downside for humoring him for  this little bit of time?''   Now, we know. And now, we also know the catastrophic harm that can  occur when people ignore the growing threats to our democracy and  normalize the dangerous rise in threats of political violence and  actual violence in our Nation.   Two weeks ago, hundreds of officers from the Capitol Police and the  Washington Metropolitan Police Department filled the Capitol Rotunda.  They were here to receive the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest  honor that Congress can bestow. There were also officers who weren't  there, who fought the mob and died in the days and weeks after. In his  remarks in the Rotunda, Leader Schumer praised the officers for  ``holding the line'' and saving the Capitol. And truly, we can never  thank them enough. They are the heroes of January 6.   But what about the man who summoned the mob--whipped them into a fury  with his Big Lie and turned them toward the Capitol, ordering them to  ``fight like hell'' and ``take back our country''? When will our  Republican colleagues accept their responsibility to ``hold the line''  against Trump's increasingly unhinged agitation for political violence  and authoritarianism?   Donald Trump's handle on his social media website is  ``realDonaldTrump.'' Earlier this month, he showed the world again  exactly who the ``realDonaldTrump'' is. After repeating his Big Lie  about a stolen election, he demanded ``the termination of all rules,  regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.'' If  given the chance again, can anyone doubt that Donald Trump would  undermine or even suspend our constitutional order if it meant he could  entrench himself in power and avoid accountability for his actions?   Fortunately, for democracy, the truth seems to be closing in on  Donald Trump. Yesterday, at their final public meeting, the members of  the bipartisan House Select Committee investigating January 6 voted to  refer the former President to the Justice Department on four criminal  charges. The proposed charges are historic and devastating: inciting or  assisting an insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding,  conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Government, and conspiracy to make a  false statement.   Ultimately, it will be up to Attorney General Garland and Jack Smith,  the independent special counsel he has appointed to oversee the  portions of the DOJ's investigation relating to Trump himself, to  decide whether to bring such charges. As the Select Committee finishes  its work, however, I want to once again thank the committee members for  their meticulous work and their courageous pursuit of the truth.   The work of the House Select Committee on January 6th confirmed a key  fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee learned in our own  investigation: that Trump was told repeatedly--by his own Justice  Department appointees--that fraud did not affect the outcome of the  2020 election. Trump knew the Big Lie was a lie, and he repeated it  anyway. He knowingly, deliberately poisoned the well of American  democracy to try to hold on, illegitimately, to power.   Thankfully, the recent midterm elections have shown that the American  people increasingly reject the Big Lie and those who continue to peddle  it. The cynics who said that democracy wasn't on the ballot last month  were wrong. In key swing States, voters rejected every election denier  running for statewide office that Trump backed.   And yet the threat to American democracy is not over. Here in the  Senate, we have a few Republican Senators who have spoken out bravely  against Trump's lawlessness and demagoguery. But we have others who  refuse to say a word against him. And a significant number of the  members of the new Republican majority in the House are election  deniers. MAGA Republicans at the local, State, and Federal levels talk  a lot about patriotism and individual liberties and freedom.   But the truth is far different. What many MAGA Republicans really  want is to eliminate rights they don't agree with, including the right  to marry the person you love, the right to determine whether and when  to have a child and even to use contraception, and the right to retire  in dignity with the Social Security and Medicare payments you have  earned over a lifetime of work.   If they are serious about protecting America, Republicans need to  denounce the Big Lie and defend the legitimacy of our elections--the  pillar of our democracy. We need to insist that everyone who was  involved in January 6 is held accountable. We need to come together to  reject the tools used to weaken democracy, especially voter suppression  and political gerrymandering meant to disenfranchise our fellow  citizens. We also need to limit the growing cancer of dark money on  politics.   And if we are serious about reducing the growing threat posed by  domestic violent extremist groups and individuals fueled by White  supremacy and other far right extremist ideologies, we ought to pass my  bill to create offices dedicated to combatting domestic terrorism at  DHS, DOJ, and the FBI. You can't give a thumb's up to the January 6  mob--and pretend to care about democracy.   One of the most searing images from January 6 was the young,  Washington  [[Page S9600]]  Metropolitan police officer being nearly crushed in a doorway. Members  of the mob ripped off his mask and tried to gouge out his eyes. He  ended up hospitalized. A week later, that officer, Daniel Hodges, told  a reporter: ``It was absolutely my pleasure to crush a white  nationalist insurrection. I'm glad I was in a position to be able to  help. We'll do it as many times as it takes.'' He also said, ``If it  wasn't my job, I would have done that for free.''   Defending the basic freedoms of democracy for all Americans and  confronting the growing threats of political violence and domestic  terrorism is our job. And it ought to be at the top of the agenda when  we return to work next month.    Mr. President, chairing the recent Supreme Court  confirmation hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was a highlight of  my Senate career. I was impressed by Judge Jackson's dignity and grace,  her intellect and courage, and her dedication to the Constitution. I  was also happy that  [[Page S9619]]  every Senator was able to invite guests to attend the hearing. It was  the first time the Senate welcomed visitors since the pandemic closed  the Capitol building 2 years earlier. Among my guests were two women  who drove 11 hours from Chicago, with four other people in the car,  just to be in the room for the historic occasion.   One of the women was in her 70s and had worked for civil rights  causes for 50 years. She said that as she watched Judge Jackson make  history, she thought of all the strong Black women who came before and  helped make that moment possible. Leaders like Sojourner Truth, Harriet  Tubman, Ida B. Wells, my old friend, the Rev. Willie Barrow, a Black  woman minister from Chicago who worked alongside Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr.   Another name she could have added to that list of history-shaping  women is Billie Jean Paige. Billie was a legend and an inspiration in  politics in Chicago and Springfield. And my wife Loretta and I were  fortunate to be able to count her as a good friend of many years. She  passed away earlier this year.   Her last name was spelled P-A-I-G-E. If that sounds familiar, it  could be because it is the same spelling as the legendary baseball  player Satchel Paige. And that is no coincidence. Satchel Paige was the  stepfather of Billie's husband of 65 years, George Paige.   Billie was a patriot and a force for progress. She came to lobbying  almost by accident. As her husband George recalls it, Billie was  working for State Representative Gerald Shea in his Chicago office as a  100-word-per-minute typist, back when Jerry Shea was the first Mayor  Daley's go-to man in Springfield. One day, Jerry Shea needed someone to  drive to Springfield and file an amendment. But the office was short- handed so he asked Billie to do it. She protested that she wasn't a  lawyer. Jerry replied, ``You don't have to be a lawyer to do this. You  just have to be smart''--and was she ever.   Billie graduated from an all-girls Catholic high school at 15, and  she graduated from Roosevelt University at 19. But her intellect alone  is not what made her such a powerful advocate for her clients and the  causes she cared about. Billie had a rare ability to make people feel  heard, seen, and respected. She understood that the best way to make  lasting progress was to allow people to speak their minds--and discover  common interests. She was always concise, constructive, and  respectful--even if she disagreed with you. Our democracy would be  healthier today if more people believed, as Billie did, that none of us  have a monopoly on political wisdom, and there can be more than one way  to achieve one's goals.   Twenty years ago, Billie, my wife Loretta, Dawn Clarke Netsch, and a  group of other strong, like-minded women set out to pass along their  knowledge about how to make political change. They created a project  called IWIL, the Illinois Women's Institute for Leadership Training  Academy. Billie was a founding member and an indispensable part of  IWIL. Over the years, IWIL has trained nearly 250 women to be leaders  in politics, law, government, business, and civil society.   A true trailblazer, Billie was the first Black woman lobbyist in  Springfield and the first Black woman in America to head a State  unemployment program. And well into her 80s, Billie was still lobbying  to shape laws and make her mark on history in Springfield.   Loretta and I are grateful to have had the benefit of Billie's  friendship and wisdom for so many years. We offer our sincere  condolences to all those who loved and admired her--especially her  husband George and their son Gary, Billie's daughter-in-law, Apryl and  Jacinta, and her granddaughter Daria.                            ____________________
