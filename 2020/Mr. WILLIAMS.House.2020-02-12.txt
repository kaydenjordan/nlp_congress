 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  the 2019 Grandview High School fighting Zebras football team on back- to-back State championship titles.   For Texans, high school football isn't just a sport; it is a way of  life. Each week in the fall, we gather under Friday night lights and  cheer our team on to victory.   The young men and women and coaches on our teams spend countless  hours running drills, watching film, and getting ready for their moment  in history.   During the 2019 season, Grandview's dedication paid off, as they  defeated the Pottsboro Cardinals 42-35 at AT&T Stadium for their second  straight title.   On behalf of the 25th Congressional District, I congratulate the  fighting Zebras on their victory, and I wish them the very best in the  future.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
