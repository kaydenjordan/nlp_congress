 Mr. President, we will be losing several members to  retirement at the end of this year, including my friend Roy Blunt.   Roy and I have served together for the majority of my time in the  Senate, and I also served with him for several years in the House of  Representatives.   We started in the House at the same time, and we became friends right  away. Our wives have become friends as well through the years, and it  has been a joy over the years to host Roy and Abby in South Dakota,  along with their son Charlie, and to visit them in Missouri. On a  personal level, I am going to miss Roy a lot, and the Senate  [[Page S6974]]  as an institution is going to miss Roy as well.   Roy is someone who aspires to be involved in doing the hard things.  And throughout his congressional career, he has put himself forward for  positions where he can make a difference.   He became chief deputy whip just 2 years after becoming a member of  the House, and he was elected majority whip just 4 years later, winning  the position earlier in his career than any member in Congress in eight  decades.   It has been a similar story in the Senate where Roy was elected vice  chairman of the Republican Conference in his first year. In 2019, he  became chairman of the Republican policy committee which plays an  important role in providing members and staff with the resources they  need on the issues. And he has done that while serving as the top  Republican on the Senate Rules Committee.    Roy has always been committed to doing the big things, but he is also  very solutions-oriented and very clear-eyed and practical about what is  achievable in a place where it is hard to get things done.   He has a saying: Never announce publicly what you won't vote for.  What he means by that is that you shouldn't back yourself into a  position where you can't support a good compromise. While it is not  always possible to get everything you want, you shouldn't let that stop  you from doing as much good as you can.   Roy has done a lot of good during his time in Congress, and one of  his lasting legacies will be the bipartisan achievements in the  healthcare space, including his efforts to help create and expand the  certified community behavioral health clinics program to improve access  to mental health care and championing medical research. The facility  housing the NIH's Center for Alzheimer's and Related Dementias is  actually named after Roy in honor of his longtime work to support  dementia research. And, of course, no mention of Roy's legacy would be  complete without mentioning his stalwart advocacy for the people of  Missouri.   I am going to miss Roy, and the Senate will miss Roy, but I am  grateful to have had the opportunity to serve together, and I am happy  he will have more time to spend with Abby and his children and  grandchildren.   Roy has made a lasting impact here in the Senate, and I look forward  to seeing his next chapter.    Would the Senator from Delaware yield for just a minute?    I just want to thank you for what you have said about  Senator Inhofe and about our Bible study.   I would say to all of our colleagues that of all the time we spend  here each and every week, that particular hour is arguably the most  impactful, and I always encourage other of our colleagues to join us.  We have been meeting, as Senator Tom Carper mentioned, in Senator  Inhofe's office now for many, many years and have been very blessed by  his leadership not only here in the Senate but his witness with regard  to his faith.
