 Mr. Speaker, as we work through this year's  appropriations package, I want to thank my colleagues for passing my  amendment to fix our broken broadband mapping system.   Access to broadband is a timely and urgent need in my district, and  if we don't address how we map and evaluate who has high-speed  Internet, small business owners, students, and farmers will be left  behind.   The FCC's recent Broadband Deployment Report states that more than 21  million Americans lack access to high-speed internet, but everyone in  this body and back home knows there are many more out there.   The issue is that we evaluate broadband coverage based on census- block mapping. In other words, if one house on one block can purchase  coverage, the whole block is deemed ``served.''   We will never close the digital divide relying on bad data. My  amendment prevents the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration from relying solely on census-block data for broadband  availability maps.   Bad data yields bad maps, and this critical amendment will put an end  to it. I thank my colleagues for joining me in support of this crucial  amendment.                            ____________________
