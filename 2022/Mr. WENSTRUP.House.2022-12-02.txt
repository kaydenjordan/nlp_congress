 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank Chairman Davis. I appreciate his work in bringing H.R. 8876,  the Jackie Walorski Maternal and Child Home Visiting Reauthorization  Act of 2022, through our committee, and I am proud to support this  effective legislation named in honor of our dear friend, Representative  Jackie Walorski. Jackie had a servant's heart, and we shared not only a  strong friendship but a passion for creating opportunities to help  others beyond just one day, with life-changing measures and positive  outcomes.   In this case, those that are served are mothers and their new  children, those that otherwise have many obstacles that can often lead  to costly and negative health outcomes. Jackie worked tirelessly and  passionately on this program with Dr. Davis. The Maternal, Infant, and  Early Childhood Home Visiting program is a program that is successful,  and the data supports that.   What does success look like? A healthy mother with a caring support  system delivering and raising a healthy new child that is ready to  grow, learn, and thrive.   Earlier this year, I visited Every Child Succeeds, a Cincinnati  nonprofit that helps support mothers and young children. During the  roundtable discussion with local moms and home visitors, I heard  firsthand how the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting  program, MIECHV, as we call it, we heard how it is working. I also  heard kids being loud and laughing, and I thought to myself, that is  the sound of happy, healthy children.   Our bipartisan legislation reauthorizes MIECHV for 5 years and will  serve more moms and babies by growing the capacity of the program in  partnership with the States. MIECHV is a successful program, first of  all, by phasing in a State match to vulnerable populations. We will  expand the research of evidence-based home visiting programs across the  country by adding $174 million in new State funding.   Second, we target funds to families in poverty by directing three- quarters of additional MIECHV funding based on the number of children  under 5 in poverty in each State.   Third, the bill improves outcomes reporting so more people will have  visibility and access to the good work being done by home visitors.   HHS will also be required to implement a State outcome dashboard, so  we have more transparency on program performance measures and clinical  indicators to show actual impact on families.   Lastly, we apply lessons learned from the pandemic and allow virtual  visits to continue on a limited basis while maintaining MIECHV's  commitment to in-person visits and high evidence standards.   As a physician, I am very familiar with the evidence-based benefits  of in-home support for both new parents and children, and I am glad we  are able to find common ground to provide stability for the program and  the vulnerable families that the program serves. This program helps  maternal and child health, family safety and stability, and readiness  for school.   People said to me on my visit, ``I don't think my child would be  healthy without this program, but home visiting made all the difference  for us.'' That is proof that this program really works.   I also want to take a moment to celebrate and honor my good friend  and battle buddy, Jackie Walorski. I am honored to continue her work  here today. I can't think of a better way to honor her than seeing this  bill through. She was a devoted public servant who cared deeply about  this issue.   Today, this morning, another dear friend of mine is unexpectedly  being laid to rest, another physician that believed in this program.  Dr. O'dell Owens, a well-known and loved healthcare hero in Cincinnati,  Ohio, a man for others, a true public servant, my hero and mentor.    Dr. Owens, as an OB/GYN, brought the gift of life to so many,  specializing in caring for expecting mothers that face many challenges,  always concerned about the health and well-being of the mothers that he  cared for as well as the babies he would bring into the world.   Dr. Owens' services to the community extended well beyond the  delivery room and into education, public health, and even served as  coroner. Dr. Owens loved the MIECHV program and the long-term,  evidence-based positive effects that the program has had on so many  lives and families.   I can say with confidence that Dr. Owens and Jackie Walorski would  strongly urge the reauthorization of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Chairman Davis and the late ranking  Member and dear friend Congresswoman Walorski for spearheading this  issue and their work on this subcommittee. I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. LaHood).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Brady), the ranking member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Ferguson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  West Virginia (Mrs. Miller), my neighbor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Yakym).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone involved with this really wonderful  moment that we are experiencing here on the floor, not only in memory  of Jackie Walorski but in the work that she put in and how much was  accomplished here, especially in a bipartisan fashion on behalf of so  many people across America that are going to benefit from this great  program--the mothers and the children, especially.   I take a moment to thank Jackie's husband, Dean, who shared Jackie  with us here in the House of Representatives, where she was able to do  so much good work, and this being one of the very highlights of her  career. It spoke so much about who she was and who she is.   This is a special moment for me, as I know my friend Dr. Owens in  Cincinnati--who took care of so many mothers that benefit from this  program--is being laid to rest today, and he was so proud of what we  were doing with this program. Well, he is with Jackie now. But we are  all blessed to have had so much hard work put into this across the  aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Davis, who worked tirelessly on this,  as well. This was definitely a dual effort, and I am grateful for all  those who have participated, to the entire community, the Committee on  Ways and Means, the subcommittee, and to all those involved.  [[Page H8720]]    I am very proud that we are moving this bill forward today. I urge  its reauthorization and encourage all of our Members to support this  wonderful program.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
