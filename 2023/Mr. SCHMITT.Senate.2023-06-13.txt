 Mr. President, it is an honor to be here with all of you  to give this maiden speech, and I want to thank the senior Senator from  Missouri. We may be the youngest combo. He is younger than I, but he is  the senior Senator. He reminds me of that quite often as we speak to  groups. But I want to thank him for his leadership. Senator Blunt is  also here, whom I followed in the Senate.   When Benjamin Franklin exited the Constitutional Convention, he was  asked what type of government the delegates had come up with. He  famously replied:         A republic, if you can keep it.    Those words are as significant today as they were a couple hundred  years ago, especially as two major threats loom over our Republic: a  supercharged administrative State and the unprecedented stifling of  free speech.   If you want to understand some of the frustration that is out there,  a lot of it comes from the fact that people believe there is a  narrowing of the bandwidth of acceptable speech--what they can say,  what they can hear. As it relates to the administrative state, a lot of  people are frustrated that no matter whom they send here, they feel  like sometimes things never really change, and we must fix that.   But first, let's back up.   Years before Franklin's famous remark, ordinary folks--farmers,  blacksmiths, laborers, leatherworkers--who made up the Continental  militias achieved something extraordinary. Fed up with an increasingly  tyrannical rule of an unaccountable despot thousands of miles away,  these ordinary men fought and won our independence at a time that seems  very far away but set the stage for the freedoms that we enjoy to this  very minute.   That is our origin story. The electrical cord of freedom that has  been strung across the centuries is our national identity. We boldly  declared to the world that freedom isn't granted to us by a King or a  Queen or any government.   We believe in individual rights, a very new concept at the time, and  those rights were granted to us by God. Chief among those were life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If those words are a mission  statement--and they are--the Constitution provides the structure to  protect and safeguard those freedoms that we enjoy that have made us  the envy of the world. That structure has allowed ordinary men and  women to achieve incredible things, to pursue their dreams, to pursue  happiness, which is a very uniquely American concept.   I grew up in Bridgeton, MO. Bridgeton sits in North St. Louis County  in the shadow of the airport. Bridgeton is a working-class, blue-collar  neighborhood, and I grew up in a working-class, blue-collar family.   My grandfather was an infantryman in World War II and returned from  the war with little more than an eighth grade education and some money  he won playing craps on the Queen Elizabeth on the way home. He started  a butcher shop and raised a family. My dad and his brothers and sister  all worked there growing up. When I was growing up, I saw my dad  working 7 days a week on the midnight shift to provide for his family  to give me and my sisters every opportunity to succeed.    Speaking of family, my wife Jaime and my two beautiful daughters are  here today, and I am very grateful that they are here to share this  moment of this inaugural speech, this maiden speech today.   From an early age, I understood the value of hard work. I saw the  value of a society where hard work was rewarded, and I appreciated at a  young age how the law provided guardrails for individuals to pursue  their dreams. So I decided that I wanted to be a lawyer. I didn't know  any lawyers growing up, and certainly nobody in my family had any power  or prestige, but we believed in this country, and I wanted to fight for  people who needed a voice, like the people I grew up around, hard- working people who just wanted to be treated fairly, who did the right  things, and worked really hard for everything that they had.   Some of those folks are looked down upon in this town because maybe  they didn't go to the right schools or they don't wear the fanciest  suits. A lot of journalists will interview these people after elections  and wonder what happened. These are my people.   I thought that I could do some good and advocate for them and for  protecting those God-given rights that are guaranteed and protected in  our Constitution. So I went to law school. I went to college and later  earned my law degree.   When my son Stephen was born a few years later, in the mid-2000s, I  was working at a law firm, made partner. Life was great. Then one day  everything changed in my life forever. My wife Jaime and I noticed that  Stephen  [[Page S2060]]  had a birthmark on his leg. It looked like an angel's wing. We thought  so little of this that Jaime actually allowed me to take Stephen to the  doctor.   But when I got there, the doctor had some pretty terrible news. He  said Stephen probably had something--which he did--something called  tuberous sclerosis, which causes tumors in different organs, including  Stephen's brain. Stephen has epilepsy. He is on the autism spectrum and  nonverbal. Going through that experience with my son, including a 4- hour seizure, you start to evaluate things. What is important? What do  you want to do? Through that process of discernment, I decided that I  wanted to do more than what I was doing, and Stephen was my  inspiration.   So I ran for office. I ran for the State senate twice and won, was  elected and served as State treasurer, was elected and served as  Missouri's attorney general, and I am blessed for all the work that I  have been able to do on behalf of the people I represented to be a  voice for those who needed a voice.   And so I decided to run for Senate, again, to be a voice for people,  for all 6 million Missourians but especially the forgotten men and  women whom I referenced earlier who work hard every day and just want a  fair shake.   So I appear before you today in the U.S. Senate, the most important  and deliberative body civilization has ever known. And I believe that.  It is an unbelievable story, and, quite frankly, I sometimes find it  hard to believe it is my own.   But only in America can a boy from Bridgeton make it here, all the  way to the U.S. Senate. And yet each one of us has a uniquely American  story to tell. I take this responsibility with great humility. I  understand that I have very big shoes to fill--for God's sake, this is  Harry Truman's desk. Senator Tom Eagleton, another Missouri attorney  general--in addition to the senior Senator and myself who served  Missouri in that capacity--also had this desk. When I graduated from  the university named after Harry Truman, Truman State University, Tom  Eagleton, in 1997, gave the commencement address.   In addition to Truman, I stand on the shoulders of other innovators  and leaders and pioneers from my State, the ``Show-Me'' State, from  cities named Liberty and Independence and towns called Freedom and  Defiance. Missourians have always blazed their own trail.   Whether it was Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery headed west  to see what was on the other side of the mountains or Mark Twain  changing the world with his words or Edwin Hubble, who mapped the  heavens, Missourians and Missouri proudly represent the best of  America. Is Missouri a northern State? Is Missouri a Southern State? Is  Missouri a Midwestern State? Is Missouri a Western State? The answer to  all those questions is yes. We are all of them. We sit uniquely at the  cultural and geographic crossroads of America. Missourians are tough  and they are honest and have always been skeptical of the Federal  Government, 1,000 miles away, telling them how to live their lives. And  although we are skeptical of government, we love America.   America was and is a bold experiment in self-government. Before  America declared its independence from Great Britain or had a  Constitution, the world believed that rights came from a King. The  King, in turn, was handed down power simply by being born into a  monarchy, certainly not by any achievement or merit. The King was  sovereign and free; the rest of us, not so much. We were subjects.    The Founders flipped the script on this concept that had been  accepted for literally thousands of years. They challenged the King and  boldly proclaimed to the world that everybody else had it wrong. Rights  come from God, not Kings or government. This was truly revolutionary  and a war was fought over it against the No. 1 superpower on the planet  and we won.   We won, which, of course, was a big deal, but the Founders also  understood that unless we created something different, a government  focused on protecting those rights and our national identity of  freedom, we would end up being just like everybody else.   So they brilliantly devised a system of separation of powers and  federalism that would spread power out both vertically and  horizontally, meant to protect individual liberty. In arguing for the  adoption of the Constitution, Madison wrote in Federalist 48:         The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and       judiciary in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many,       and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may       justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.    He also notes in Federalist 47:         [T]he preservation of liberty requires that the three great       departments of power should be separate and distinct.    In Federalist 51, Madison famously notes:         Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.    The Founders also created a republican--small ``r''--form of  government never tried before on this scale and made it accountable to  the people. And the virtues of this form of government were certainly  extolled in Madison Federalist 10.   The Founders understood human nature. They knew what tyranny looked  like and understood that having a government where power is properly  spread out and having elected representatives accountable to the people  safeguarded liberty and freedom.   They understood that freedom of speech and, more broadly, principles  of pluralism were crucial to the survival of the Republic. They also  understood that a Republic spread across a continent needed a pressure  release valve to resolve political disputes, not through violence, as  we see even in the world today, but through elections and free  expression.   It is in this vein that I want to return to the two grave threats to  the Founders' vision, the principles of separation of powers, our  republican form of government, and individual liberty: the  administrative state and attacks on free speech.   First, the vast expansion of Federal administrative power that we  have seen in recent history is destroying representative government by  placing immense power in the hands of the unelected. The article I  branch, the people's branch, is being diluted of its rightful role-- willingly, I might add--and the power exerted by this class of experts  is doing great damage to a government based on accountability. These  unelected bureaucrats can issue rules, regulations, or guidance letters  that can destroy people's lives and their liberty and nobody ever  elected these folks to anything.   This massive aggregation of Federal regulatory power is eating away  at our freedoms and liberties, deepening political division, and  cheapening discourse, and it is completely antithetical to the vision  the Founders had. It is called the administrative state. And it falls  on each one of us here in the article I branch, in this time and place,  to fundamentally dismantle it.   When I say ``administrative state,'' I mean the mess of alphabet  Agencies that have slowly yet aggressively aggregated and amassed power  over the years, promulgating rules and regulations with reckless  abandon. See, you can send your elected representative home. You can  send them there, send them back, send them home. But these so-called  experts are not really accountable to anybody ever. It is out of  control. In short, it is a runaway train with an invisible conductor.   If left unchecked, they will continue to amass power bit by bit until  our core principles and our liberties that make our country unique are  a mere prologue to history. We need deep structural reform, and we need  to return power back to where it belongs--in the hands of the Article I  branch, the people's branch.    A second major threat to the Republic is the unprecedented stifling  of First Amendment rights in new, innovative, and modern ways. The  freedom to speak your mind in the public square or in the virtual town  square is vital to the health of the Republic. Far too many Americans  are being told what they can say, what they can hear, and what they can  see. Censorship--censorship--is on the rise. The desire of governments  and powerful elites to control speech is hardly new, but America has  always stood as the exception.   Long before the Revolutionary War, Americans witnessed the oppression  of speech. More than 1,200 times before 1700, the British prosecuted  and punished Americans for what they called seditious speech. Sedition  laws prohibited criticism of the government based  [[Page S2061]]  on the idea that that criticism could inflame the public against the  government. But as the Revolutionary War approached, colonists began  standing up for free speech. Colonial juries began refusing British  requests to issue indictments for criticizing the government. They  acquitted individuals accused of criticizing the government. They  tossed tea into the harbor to protest taxes, and we printed  publications denouncing the King. We were on our way.   We, the American people, wanted to protect the free expression of  ideas, and we did so in the very first amendment to the Constitution.  We protected it not just for peaceful times but especially in times of  crisis or so-called emergencies. It is easy to forget how fortunate we  are here in America to have the First Amendment and how terrifying it  is to see how frequently now it is being violated.   Recently, government actors colluded with big tech companies--some of  the biggest companies and the most powerful companies in the history of  the world--to censor and deplatform individuals for not buying in to  the approved narrative. Whether you agree with that narrative or not is  hardly the point. The point is it is incredibly dangerous. Suppression  of speech and censorship is justified now as it has always been but  with a new lexicon, calling it misinformation or disinformation; but  the goal is still the same: power and control.   We saw the Department of Homeland Security recently attempt to set up  an Orwellian disinformation governance board. We saw individuals  silenced and suspended from platforms at the government's behest for  challenging the validity of mask mandates and lockdowns or for  questioning the official narrative of the origins of COVID-19--for  simply speaking their minds. It is not the government's job to tell us  what we can hear or what we are supposed to believe. Each one of us can  make those decisions ourselves--period.   This vast censorship enterprise was at the behest of some of the  highest ranking government officials in the country. For example, the  Surgeon General of the United States was messaging with senior Facebook  executives, demanding that they censor speech more stringently.  Whatever your political persuasion is, this ought to scare the bejesus  out of every American. Our government is supposed to be protecting our  rights and liberties, not infringing upon them. And we have to ensure  that this never happens again.   As Justice Hugo Black wrote:         The freedoms [of the] First Amendment must be accorded to       the ideas we hate or, sooner or later, they will be denied to       the ideas [that] we cherish.    In short, we have to be willing to defend somebody's ability to say  something we vehemently oppose. We must be willing to protect the  rights of citizens to speak their minds free from censorship and  fundamentally dismantle the administrative state.   I mentioned that Missouri is at the crossroads of America; but in  many ways, America itself is at a crossroads. It is up to us in this  Chamber--the most important legislative body in the history of the  world--to address these big issues that directly impact the people we  serve. We need to fight back against this censorship industrial complex  from controlling what we can say and what we can hear, and we need to  ensure that the great wall of the administrative state that separates  the people from their elected Representatives comes crumbling down.   When I asked Missourians for their vote last fall, I promised them  that I would fight for them. I believe that this is the fight, and the  goal is to save our Republic and this grand experiment of self- government.   May God bless each one of you. May God bless the great State of  Missouri. May God bless the United States of America.   I yield the floor.   (Applause.)                            ____________________
