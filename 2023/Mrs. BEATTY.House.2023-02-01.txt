 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, the first day of Black  History Month to honor Black history as American history.   Black history is about the sung and unsung Black heroes and sheroes  who have contributed to our Nation's progress--from the Revolutionary  War to the fight against COVID and everything in between.   Therefore, we say thank you to the Black Americans who stand for  justice, for voting rights, for women's rights, for saving Black lives,  for better healthcare, climate reform, and education. I believe whether  it is teaching AP Black history courses or standing on this House  floor--that when we acknowledge the unique struggle of Black Americans  through history--we grow closer to our Nation's highest ideals.   Mr. Speaker, I hope everyone will take time this month to learn and  truly understand Black history is American history.                            ____________________
