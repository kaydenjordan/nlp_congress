 Mr. President, it is no secret this U.S. Senator loves  history. I like to learn about history, talk about history, and  preserve history. I am Iowa proud today to share a community's efforts  to preserve history in my home State.   Next month, a small farming town located 13 miles west of the  Mississippi River will welcome a poignant relic from World War II to  its local museum. An authentic rail cattle car used in the Holocaust  has been meticulously refurbished in Duisberg, Germany, and is being  shipped to Danville, IA.   This story begins in 1939 when a local teacher named Miss Birdie  Mathews organized an international pen pal exchange for her class. She  gave her students a list of names from which to write a letter. Two of  her students chose another pair of sisters who lived across the world  in Amsterdam: Anne and Margot Frank. Juanita and Betty Wagner wrote to  the Frank sisters about life on an Iowa farm. Anne Frank's letter to  Juanita is dated April 29, 1940, and she also enclosed a picture card  of the Amsterdam canals. Margot's letter to Betty is dated April 27,  1940. She wrote ``having a frontier with Germany and being a small  country we never feel safe.''   Less than 2 weeks after these letters were written, Germany invaded  the Netherlands. The Wagner sisters later recalled fearing they would  never hear from their new pen pals again. Of course, history tells us  the Frank sisters perished in a concentration camp in Bergen-Belsen.   When the war ended in May 1945, Betty wrote to the Frank's Amsterdam  address. Their father Otto Frank survived his imprisonment in Auschwitz  and responded to her letter. He explained what happened during the war  and about the family's time in hiding in the attic in Amsterdam. That  is when the Wagner sisters learned their pen pals were Jewish.   The Frank letters were donated to the Simon Wiesenthal Center which  gave permission to the museum in Danville to display digital images of  the letters. Danville Station also includes a replica of the attic  where the Frank family lived in hiding and other artifacts that  memorialize the historic connection between the Frank and Wagner  sisters.   The museum's curator is Janet Hesler, a lifelong resident of  Danville. Her father served in World War II and was awarded a Bronze  Star for his service in the Battle of the Bulge. He was among the  American forces who liberated the concentration camp in Dachau on April  29, 1945.   People from around the world have visited Danville Station. Here they  bear witness to this Iowa community's commitment to never forget and to  keep shining a light on history. From my years in public office  representing the people of Iowa, I certainly appreciate the can-do  spirit at the grassroots. The museum curator, Janet Hesler, was the  driving force behind efforts to expand the museum's exhibit to include  a rail car used to transport Jewish people during the Holocaust.   Janet worked with Dr. Ruthie Eitan, Claudia Korenke, and Bernhard  Mertens to fulfill her mission to find one. The restoration of the rail  car was managed by Martin Kaufmann at Die Schmiede in Duisberg.   The people of Danville have worked to raise funds $1 at a time to  help pay for the restoration and shipping of the rail car. They also  are working to collect 1.5 million postcards from around the world to  honor the number of children who perished in the Holocaust.   I applaud the tenacious efforts and support of local civic and  religious leaders to help make this happen, including Allan Ross, who  leads the Jewish Federation of the Quad Cities. Anyone who visits or  donates are helping to preserve history, build community, and  strengthen civic engagement, cornerstones of a strong society.   Without a doubt, this restored, authentic rail car will serve as a  profound reminder about the atrocities of the Holocaust. We must learn  from history to avert the mistakes of the past. Never again can society  ignore religious intolerance. The community of Danville is heeding the  advice of Simon Wiesenthal, who survived the Holocaust and brought  1,100 Nazi war criminals to justice. In his words, ``Antisemitism did  not die with Hitler in his Berlin bunker in 1945.''   By bringing this rail car across the world to Danville, this Iowa  community is bringing a piece of history to life so that our children  and grandchildren can learn from history for a more peaceful, just  future.                            ____________________
