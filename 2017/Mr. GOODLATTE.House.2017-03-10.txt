 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 720.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 180 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 720.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  0915                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 720) to amend Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to  improve attorney accountability, and for other purposes, with Mr.  Jenkins of West Virginia in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Conyers) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 720, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, would restore mandatory  sanctions for frivolous lawsuits filed in Federal court.   Many Americans may not realize it, but today, under what is called  rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there is no  requirement that those who file frivolous lawsuits pay for the  unjustified legal costs they impose on their victims, even when those  victims prove to a judge the lawsuit was without any basis in law or  fact.   As a result, the current rule 11 goes largely unenforced because the  victims of frivolous lawsuits have little incentive to pursue  additional litigation to have the case declared frivolous when there is  no guarantee of compensation at the end of the day.   H.R. 720 would finally provide light at the end of the tunnel for the  victims of frivolous lawsuits by requiring sanctions against the filers  of frivolous lawsuits, sanctions which include paying back victims for  the full cost of their reasonable expenses incurred as a direct result  of the rule 11 violation, including attorneys' fees.   The bill also strikes the current provisions in rule 11 that allow  lawyers to avoid sanctions for making frivolous claims and demands by  simply withdrawing them within 21 days. This change eliminates the  ``free pass'' lawyers now have to file frivolous lawsuits in Federal  court.   The current lack of mandatory sanctions leads to the regular filing  of lawsuits that are baseless. So many frivolous pleadings currently go  under the radar because the lack of mandatory sanctions for frivolous  filings forces victims of frivolous lawsuits to roll over and settle  the case, because doing that is less expensive than litigating the case  to a victory in court.   Correspondence written by someone filing a frivolous lawsuit, which  became public, concisely illustrates how the current lack of mandatory  sanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits leads to legal extortion. That  correspondence to the victim of a frivolous lawsuit states: ``I really  don't care what the law allows you to do. It's a more practical issue.  Do you want to send your attorney a check every month indefinitely as I  continue to pursue this?''   Under the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, those who file frivolous  lawsuits would no longer be able to get off scot-free and, therefore,  they couldn't get away with those sorts of extortionary threats any  longer.   The victims of lawsuit abuse are not just those who are actually  sued. Rather, we all suffer under a system in which innocent Americans  everywhere live under the constant fear of a potentially bankrupting  frivolous lawsuit.   As the former chairman of The Home Depot company has written: ``An  unpredictable legal system casts a shadow over every plan and  investment. It is devastating for startups. The cost of even one ill- timed abusive lawsuit can bankrupt a growing company and cost hundreds  of thousands of jobs.''   The prevalence of frivolous lawsuits in America is reflected in the  absurd warning labels companies must place on their products to limit  their exposure to frivolous claims. A 5-inch brass fishing lure with  three hooks is labeled ``Harmful if swallowed.'' A household iron  contains the warning ``Never iron clothes while they are being worn.''  A piece of ovenware warns, ``Ovenware will get hot when used in oven.''   And here are just a couple of examples of frivolous lawsuits brought  in Federal court, where judges failed to award compensation to the  victims:  [[Page H2026]]    A man sued a television network for $2.5 million because he said a  show it aired raised his blood pressure. When the network publicized  his frivolous lawsuit, he demanded the court make them stop. Although  the court found the case frivolous, not only did it not compensate the  victim, it granted the man who filed the frivolous lawsuit an exemption  from even paying the ordinary court filing fees.   In another case, lawyers filed a case against a parent, claiming the  parent's discipline of their child violated the Eighth Amendment of the  Constitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment by the  government, not private citizens. One of the lawyers even admitted  signing the complaint without reading it.   The court found the case frivolous, but awarded the victim only about  a quarter of its legal costs because rule 11 currently doesn't require  that a victim's legal costs be paid in full. The Lawsuit Abuse  Reduction Act would change that.    I thank the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Lamar Smith,  for introducing this simple, commonsense legislation that would do so  much to prevent lawsuit abuse and restore Americans' confidence in the  legal system. I urge my colleagues to support it today.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized  for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I will be brief.   Proponents of the motion to recommit want to allow lawsuits with no  basis in law or fact to proceed without penalty in the area covered by  their motion. Let that sink in for a moment--and just a brief moment.   The proponents of the motion to recommit support certain lawsuits  that apparently have no basis in law or fact. Otherwise, they have no  relevance to this bill. If they are relevant motions, they won't have  to worry about it. They want those frivolous lawsuits to proceed  without penalty.   Every time a judge decides a company made a defective product that  ended up hurting people, damages are awarded. When a lawyer makes up a  lawsuit that has no basis in law or fact, that lawsuit is a defective  product. The victims harmed by that defective product should be  compensated just like everyone else.   Oppose this motion to recommit, pass the base bill, and let's show  America where we stand on frivolous lawsuits and on the compensation  rightfully owed to the victims of frivolous lawsuits.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.
