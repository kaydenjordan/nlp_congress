 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 2030) to deem the compliance date for amended energy conservation  standards for ceiling fan light kits to be January 21, 2020, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2030         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ceiling Fan Energy       Conservation Harmonization Act''.       SEC. 2. COMPLIANCE DATE FOR AMENDED ENERGY CONSERVATION                     STANDARDS FOR CEILING FAN LIGHT KITS.         (a) In General.--The compliance date for the amended energy       conservation standards established for ceiling fan light kits       in the final rule entitled ``Energy Conservation Program:       Energy Conservation Standards for Ceiling Fan Light Kits''       (81 Fed. Reg. 580 (January 6, 2016)) is deemed to be January       21, 2020.        (b) Conforming Changes.--Not later than 60 days after the       date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall       make such technical and conforming changes to any regulation,       guidance document, or procedure as may be necessary to       implement subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5  [[Page H1660]]  legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, energy efficiency can provide benefits for consumers,  for job-creating businesses, for energy security, and for the  environment, but we have got to make sure that it is done right; and  that is why I support S. 2030, Ceiling Fan Energy Conservation  Harmonization Act, which was sponsored by my good friend from North  Carolina, Richard Hudson, and certainly has strong bipartisan  cosponsorship, including Mr. Carter, Mr. Rush, Mr. Peters, and Mr.  Butterfield.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.   As most of you know, ceiling fans often come with lights attached,  thus, they serve two purposes for consumers. The Department of Energy  regulates the energy efficiency of both the ceiling fans and the  ceiling fan lights, and stringent new standards are scheduled to take  effect in the next 2 years; but for some reason, DOE set the deadline  for the ceiling fan light kits in 2019, while the ceiling fan standard  deadline is in 2020.   This bill, S. 2030, would take the logical step of aligning the  compliance deadlines for ceiling fans and ceiling fan light kits so  that they both occur in 2020. This should ease the compliance burden  for some manufacturers, make things easier for retailers, and may help  lower the costs, in fact, for all consumers.   Although ceiling fan regulations may not be a front-burner issue, we  ought to make sure that we take every opportunity to streamline Federal  regs and help keep compliance costs down. That is why I would urge all  of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this, what I would consider,  noncontroversial bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is correct. That is correct.  That is the purpose.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is correct. I would note that  in the gentleman's earlier statement, he said: ``whose lamps use more  than 180 watts of electricity,'' but, in fact, it is 190 watts or less,  but the gentleman, again, is correct.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is correct.   I, too, have heard from lighting manufacturers, and I sympathize with  the concerns asserted by them regarding potential unintended  consequences.   The intent of this bill, and, for that matter, my intent, is to keep  the compliance deadline for changes to the 190-watt limiter requirement  at January 7, 2019.   We now know that the limiter requirement adds to the cost to  consumers, it can compromise ceiling fan reliability, and is no longer  needed to meet efficiency standards. The final rule that included the  ceiling fan light kit standards also provided that the 190-watt limiter  requirement is deemed to be met by any product that complies with the  new efficiency standards.   The bottom line is that the 190-watt limiter should no longer be  required beginning on January 7, 2019. This bill, S. 2030, seeks to  delay the ceiling fan light kit compliance deadline only, but not to  delay the change to the 190-watt limiter requirement.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Yes, I do share that view. This bill directs the Secretary of Energy  to make technical and conforming changes to any implementing regulation  so as to carry out the provisions in this bill.   In carrying out this requirement, DOE should make clear to the  regulated community that the specific inclusion of a watt-limiting  device is no longer needed for a kit to be deemed to meet the 190-watt- or-less consumption requirement.   I further want to associate myself with the gentleman's comments  regarding enforcement. The Secretary should take whatever steps are  necessary to ensure that no enforcement action is taken against any  manufacturer solely because a kit fails to include the 190-watt  limiting device.   To the extent he can, the Secretary should make clear in a public  manner that DOE will not enforce against these manufacturers with  regard to this particular matter so that no producer holds back their  product for the market out of fear of violation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
