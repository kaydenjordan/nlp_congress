 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support for the Financial CHOICE  Act, and I urge a vote for it.   America's workers, farmers, businesses, households, savers, and  investors all deserve the flexibility and access to credit that the  Financial CHOICE Act puts in place for our financial system.  [[Page H4726]]    As a former mayor, I know that families, cities, and counties need  access to credit. Whether it is a city that wants to build a library or  a community park, or a family that wants to buy a house, or the farmer  that needs a new tractor to plow her field, we need a financial system  that is strong, innovative, but, most of all, accessible.   Right now, under Dodd-Frank, that isn't the case. For example, one of  my constituents in Utah owns a catering business that is very  successful, but the growth of her company has been stunted because she  ran into red tape and delays after applying for a small business loan.   That is not how things should work. Community banks, which provide  the majority of small bank loans, are closing at the rate of one per  day. Middle- to low-income Americans are getting higher fees, less  consumer service, and less access to credit than ever before.   Everyone deserves a chance to realize their version of the American  Dream, and the Financial CHOICE Act is a bold step toward achieving  that dream.    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Crist), a new member of the Financial  Services Committee.
