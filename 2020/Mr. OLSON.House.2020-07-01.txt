 Mr. Speaker, Sunday is a weekly day of Christian Sabbath.  I must confess that last Sunday my Sabbath was not very pious. I toyed  with one of the seven deadly sins; the sin of gluttony.   After I went to church, I drove down Interstate 69 to Beasley, Texas,  and that is where I cracked. But it wasn't my fault. It was purely the  fault of Tim Sabrsula, who is the chief of the Beasley Volunteer Fire  Department.   At 11 a.m. they started selling huge chicken fried chicken plates at  $10 a plate. The temptation of gluttony was overwhelming; I had to buy  five plates.   But Chief Sabrsula was not alone, Beasley Mayor Kenneth Reid joined  this sinful attack. But I succumbed for a great cause, new equipment  for the heroes at the Beasley Volunteer Fire Department. Chief Sabrsula  asked me to close by saying, ``Y'all come next year, you'll be glad you  did.''
