 Mr. Chair, I am voting ``no'' on the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act.  All of us are. Just like healthcare, this legislation takes the  approach that the best way to proceed is with the most extreme bill  possible, a bill that attracts no Democrats and even makes moderate  Republicans deeply uncomfortable.   One reason, the Dodd-Frank Act set up an office at CFPB to protect  servicemembers. That office, initially led by Holly Petraeus, has done  great work  [[Page H4725]]  in educating and fighting for servicemember families. I have worked  with Republicans for years to support and enhance it.   This bill makes that office optional. And it specifically strips the  funding for its financial counseling project. That is appalling. It  hurts my constituents, and, again, it makes my Republican friends  deeply uncomfortable. It is one of scores of provisions that make clear  this isn't a bill designed to help Americans. It is an ideological  document. It hurts men and women in uniform. And oh, by the way,  millions of others. It is a terrible approach.   Please vote ``no'' on the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act.
