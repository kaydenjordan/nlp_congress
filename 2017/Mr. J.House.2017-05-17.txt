TITLE VI--NANSEMOND INDIAN TRIBE       SEC. 601. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) from 1607 until 1646, Nansemond Indians--        (A) lived approximately 30 miles from Jamestown; and        (B) were significantly involved in English-Indian affairs;        (2) after 1646, there were 2 sections of Nansemonds in       communication with each other, the Christianized Nansemonds       in Norfolk County, who lived as citizens, and the       traditionalist Nansemonds, who lived further west;        (3) in 1638, according to an entry in a 17th century sermon       book still owned by the Chief's family, a Norfolk County       Englishman married a Nansemond woman;        (4) that man and woman are lineal ancestors of all of       members of the Nansemond Indian tribe alive as of the date of       enactment of this Act, as are some of the traditionalist       Nansemonds;        (5) in 1669, the 2 Nansemond sections appeared in Virginia       Colony's census of Indian bowmen;        (6) in 1677, Nansemond Indians were signatories to the       Treaty of 1677 with the King of England;        (7) in 1700 and 1704, the Nansemonds and other Virginia       Indian tribes were prevented by Virginia Colony from making a       separate peace with the Iroquois;        (8) Virginia represented those Indian tribes in the final       Treaty of Albany, 1722;        (9) in 1711, a Nansemond boy attended the Indian School at       the College of William and Mary;        (10) in 1727, Norfolk County granted William Bass and his       kinsmen the ``Indian privileges'' of clearing swamp land and       bearing arms (which privileges were forbidden to other non-      Whites) because of their Nansemond ancestry, which meant that       Bass and his kinsmen were original inhabitants of that land;        (11) in 1742, Norfolk County issued a certificate of       Nansemond descent to William Bass;        (12) from the 1740s to the 1790s, the traditionalist       section of the Nansemond tribe, 40 miles west of the       Christianized Nansemonds, was dealing with reservation land;        (13) the last surviving members of that section sold out in       1792 with the permission of the Commonwealth of Virginia;        (14) in 1797, Norfolk County issued a certificate stating       that William Bass was of Indian and English descent, and that       his Indian line of ancestry ran directly back to the early       18th century elder in a traditionalist section of Nansemonds       on the reservation;        (15) in 1833, Virginia enacted a law enabling people of       European and Indian descent to obtain a special certificate       of ancestry;        (16) the law originated from the county in which Nansemonds       lived, and mostly Nansemonds, with a few people from other       counties, took advantage of the new law;        (17) a Methodist mission established around 1850 for       Nansemonds is currently a standard Methodist congregation       with Nansemond members;        (18) in 1901, Smithsonian anthropologist James Mooney--        (A) visited the Nansemonds; and        (B) completed a tribal census that counted 61 households       and was later published;        (19) in 1922, Nansemonds were given a special Indian school       in the segregated school system of Norfolk County;        (20) the school survived only a few years;        (21) in 1928, University of Pennsylvania anthropologist       Frank Speck published a book on modern Virginia Indians that       included a section on the Nansemonds; and        (22) the Nansemonds were organized formally, with elected       officers, in 1984, and later applied for and received State       recognition.
