 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an  important anniversary in Montana's history: the city of Colstrip is  celebrating its 20th anniversary this month.   For decades, Colstrip has been the engine that powers Montana and the  Pacific Northwest, carrying on a long and proud tradition of energy  production in our State and employing thousands of Montanans.   Colstrip represents the very best of our State. The hard-working  folks here are unafraid to get their hands dirty, working each day to  provide power--and the economic opportunity that comes with it--to  people in Montana and across the region.   In this transition, Colstrip has boldly looked to the future, working  to strengthen the local economy so its citizens' children and  grandchildren can have the same opportunities afforded to the older  generations. The city motto, ``Tomorrow's Town, Today,'' befits a  community working once again to define itself for the decades to come.   I am proud of Colstrip and its citizens, led by Mayor John Williams.  Their civic passion, their dedication to each other, and their  resilience in the face of change will ensure this community remains  strong for years to come.                            ____________________
