 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Torres), my good friend and not only fellow member of the Rules  Committee, but fellow appropriator, for yielding me the customary 30  minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today's rule covers one item, a continuing resolution to  fund the government and keep it open and operating through February 18,  2022.   While I am grateful that we are taking steps to avoid a government  shutdown, I am disappointed by the solution before us, yet another  short-term funding bill with full-year funding negotiations no closer  than they were a few months ago or a few weeks ago.   Mr. Speaker, today's resolution is the second continuing resolution  we have had to pass to cover fiscal year 2022. Sadly, I expect it will  not be the last. This state of affairs was absolutely avoidable and  reflects poorly on the Democratic leadership.   I have often said that government funding is the most fundamental  responsibility of Congress. Unfortunately, we are nowhere close to a  full-year appropriation funding deal. We are no closer to an agreement  today than the last time we passed a continuing resolution in  September. The reality is that the reason we are having to consider  another continuing resolution today is because of the majority's  insistence on focusing on partisan priorities rather than on the  critical business of governing the nation.                                time  1245    For months, the majority's focus has not been anywhere near where it  should have been. Instead of reaching a full-year deal on government  funding or even a top-line agreement on funding levels, the majority  has insisted on working on other partisan matters.   Since the passage of the last stop-gap funding measure, House  Democrats have focused solely on their massive reconciliation bill,  month after month, focused on enshrining partisan policies into law.  These efforts may satisfy their progressive base, but they fail the  American people as a whole.   The majority currently controls the House, the Senate, and the  Presidency, and if they can swing the votes, they can pass whatever  they want into law. But with that ability also comes a grave  responsibility, a responsibility to govern the country. Unfortunately,  the majority has been abandoning that responsibility.   Mr. Speaker, October 1 marked the beginning of fiscal year 2022. By  rights, the House and the Senate should have both passed our standard  12 appropriations bills through both Chambers of Congress and into law  by that date. But since we did not, a continuing resolution was  necessary.   Now we are on the second continuing resolution of this fiscal year,  and in all likelihood, a probable third one is coming in February,  unless my friends on the other side actually start negotiating in  earnest. At this point, we are unfortunately no closer to passing these  12 bills or an omnibus spending bill than we were back on October 1.   This is truly a failure to govern. While the majority focuses on a  push to make the government bigger and bigger, they are failing to fund  the government which already exists today.   What happens as a result? We move from continuing resolution to  continuing resolution, getting no closer to a final spending deal. Not  involving Republicans until the very last minute and just expecting us  to indefinitely support CR after CR is no way to govern, and frankly,  the failure to have any conversations about how to come to an agreement  on a full-year appropriations bill is indefensible.   While I am sure former President Trump will be pleased to know his  last budget continues on almost a year after he left office, there is  real work that can and should be done.   But what is perhaps the most frustrating has been the way in which  the majority has bungled reaching a relatively simple deal on this  particular continuing resolution. Knowing full well that this Friday's  deadline was coming up, the majority instead dithered for months on  their reconciliation package.   This week, finally acknowledging that real discussions needed to be  had with Republicans, the majority instead continued to twiddle their  thumbs. Indeed, Republicans in the House were completely shut out of  this process, leaving us all in the dark about the nature of today's  bill until this morning. Once again, the majority has chosen to go it  alone rather than choosing to work across the aisle.   The majority is well aware that their current stance on a larger deal  is dead on arrival in the Senate. As long as they continue to insist on  omitting the historically bipartisan pro-life protections which have  existed in law for more than 45 years, Republicans cannot and will not  support bills that end these protections, and the Senate will not pass  them.   But that is not the only point of disagreement. The majority has been  unwilling to fund our Nation's defense at the levels agreed to by the  authorizers and appropriators in the House and currently being debated  in the Senate. These increased levels are necessary to ensure continued  defense readiness worldwide, especially given the ongoing tensions in  places like Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Afghanistan, and the  Taiwan Strait.   But instead of governing and seeking to address these challenges, the  majority is pandering to the most extreme elements of their Caucus,  trying desperately to pass bills that lower defense spending levels and  omitting key bipartisan pro-life protections from appropriations bills.  And instead of governing, the majority holds the American people  hostage under the threat of a government shutdown, dragging the country  from one self-inflicted crisis to another.   Mr. Speaker, the sooner the majority gets serious about reaching a  full-year deal, the better for the country. There are real, damaging  consequences to the failure to pass full-year appropriations bills,  both at home and abroad, and the sooner the majority brings its  attention back to the critical business of governing the country, the  better off we all will be.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment on the  rule to immediately bring up H.R. 6056, the Parents Bill of Rights Act.  [[Page H6867]]    Mr. Speaker, education is one of the most important issues that we  face today. Determining how our children will be educated determines  the future fate of our Nation.   Unfortunately, many school districts have been ignoring the wishes of  parents or, worse, telling parents they cannot play a role in their  child's education.    Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe made Democrats'  position on education clear when he said: ``I don't think parents  should be telling schools what they should teach.'' I couldn't disagree  with him more, and thankfully, neither could Virginia voters.   Instead, H.R. 6056, developed by Education and Labor Committee  Republicans, would enshrine a list of rights into law to make clear to  parents what their rights are and clear to schools what their duties to  parents are.   These rights include the right to know what their children are being  taught, the right of parents to be heard, and the right to protect  their child's privacy.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Louisiana (Ms. Letlow), the sponsor of H.R. 6056 and a member of the  Education and Labor Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Owens), my good friend and ranking member of the Early Childhood,  Elementary, and Secondary Education Subcommittee, for further  explanation of the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), my very good friend and the ranking member  of the Committee on Education and Labor, for further explanation on the  previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the bill in front of us, in some ways, is a simple bill.  It is a continuing resolution. It goes for a certain amount of time.  Sadly, it reflects the basic failure of this institution to focus on  its job.   We have had more than a year to deal with what we should be dealing  with, the passage of the budget. We extended--I actually voted for the  extension--the last continuing resolution to provide time.   Now, my friends knew at the beginning of this process the number of  things that they had to do. They knew if they took out the Hyde  language and those protections that they would never get a deal. Yet,  they did that anyway.   They did that without consultation. They did it in committee. They  had the votes. They had every right to do it. They also knew at the end  of the day they were going to have to have bipartisanship on  appropriations bills. They will not pass in the Senate because of the  filibuster. There is sufficient support on both sides of the aisle.   Every single Republican in this Chamber actually supported the  reinsertion of the Hyde amendment in the legislative process, telling  our friends: If you take this out, we are not going to be working with  you until it is restored.   So far, we have not seen any effort to do that.   Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side also put in lots of poison  pills--again, lots of things that they knew Republicans would not  accept. That is fine in a reconciliation package. They really don't  need our votes. That is not true in an appropriations bill.   It is my understanding that both ranking members in both Chambers on  the Committee on Appropriations said: Look, we are not sitting down to  negotiate until the Hyde protections are back in.   They are historically bipartisan. They have been there 45 years. Most  of my friends on the other side of the aisle have voted for them over  and over and over again, whether they liked them or not.   Frankly, if you are going to have to get a bipartisan deal, when you  put partisan pills in, you know you are going to have to take them out  at some point. You might as well do it at the beginning of the session.   We also have had no engagement from either the administration or our  friends on the other side about any spending limits whatsoever. What is  our top-line number? Nobody has been willing to sit down and talk about  that. Quite frankly, that is a problem.   Mr. Speaker, we probably ought to be looking at that, as we have done  in previous years over multiple years going forward. We could also make  adjustments if we are in a crisis. We have done that before. But we had  a framework that we could operate under, and it has actually  facilitated the appropriations. I would recommend to my friends that  might be something they want to talk about with both sides.    But in the end, the deal here is not hard to see. The deal involves  three simple things. There are lots of details, lots of other things to  be negotiated.   First, defense spending is going to have to come up. That is not just  Republicans telling you that. The Democratic-controlled House Committee  on Armed Services and the Democratic-controlled Senate Committee on  Armed Services both put in $25 billion more than in the President's  base budget or in the bill that our friends passed out of committee but  never brought to this floor because they don't have the votes to pass  it. So that is one.   Number two, my friends, in the 12 bills that they have passed through  the Committee on Appropriations--and I commend them for that--raised  domestic spending by 17 or 18 percent. That number is going to have to  come down. We can talk about how much, and we can talk about where, but  it is way too much, and it is way out of balance.   And number three--and my friends were told this over and over and  over again--if you take out the Hyde protections on life, there will be  no Republican votes for your bill. Now, we can pass continuing  resolution after continuing resolution. After all, that is Donald  Trump's last negotiated budget, the budget you got when you had a  Republican President, Republican Senate, and a Democratic House.   Mr. Speaker, quite frankly, many of my friends on my side of the  aisle would prefer that. I would prefer a deal. I would prefer a more  robust defense budget. I am willing to talk about some of my friends'  domestic priorities--quite frankly, some of which I share and would  support and have in the past. I am also, though, not prepared to yield  on the Hyde amendment, and my friends know that.   Mr. Speaker, we know what a deal is: more defense; less domestic  spending; removal of poison pills; restoration of historic, bipartisan  protections on life. Do those things and we can have a deal, I think,  pretty quickly. Stay where you are at and we will not have a deal, and  we will be right back here in February, doing another continuing  resolution.   The most basic responsibility of Congress is to fund the government.  Unfortunately, we are no closer to a full-  [[Page H6869]]  year spending deal that we truly need. My colleagues in the majority  have wasted months focusing on other matters--notably, a wildly  expensive and unrealistic reconciliation spending package--rather than  doing the hard and essential work of governing the Nation. I urge my  friends in the majority to rethink that course.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question and ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
