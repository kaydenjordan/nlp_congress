 Madam President, yesterday, Tennesseans were really  filled with a bittersweet pride as President Trump awarded posthumously  the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor to a heroic Tennessean,  Sergeant Verdell Smith.   His watch with the Memphis Police Department ended on June 4, 2016.  On that day, an armed gunman stole a car and led Memphis police on a  chase into the downtown area. Officer Smith responded to the call and  worked quickly to clear the pedestrians from an intersection directly  in the path of a speeding car. Then the unthinkable happened. Before  the police were able to apprehend him, the gunman crashed through a  barrier and fatally struck Officer Smith.   Valor is a word that is defined as ``great personal bravery.'' Valor,  you don't hear it a lot, but valor is that great personal bravery in  the face of danger, and I think there is no better way to describe the  actions of Officer Smith.   I honor him on behalf of all Tennesseans for his service in the U.S.  Navy, for his 18 years with the Memphis Police Department, and for his  final act of heroism.                            ____________________     Madam President, as I reflected on Sergeant Smith's  story, I began to think about Memorial Day and the ways we honor the  valor of every soldier who has made that ultimate sacrifice. One of the  first official Memorial Day observances was in 1868, and it was just  over the Potomac River in Arlington National Cemetery. If you have not  been there to honor those who have given the ultimate sacrifice, I  encourage you to do that.   In 1868, individuals gathered to honor those who had lost their life  in the Civil War, and they gathered to decorate the graves of the  fallen, both the Union and Confederate soldiers. This set a precedent  for what would become a national day of unity. Think about that, a  national day of unity, of mourning, and of remembrance. As the years  went by, Americans took greater steps to memorialize the fallen and  those who have exercised valor and have chosen to make that ultimate  sacrifice.   After World War I, observances were expanded to honor those who fell  in all American wars. Finally, it was in 1971 that Congress declared  Memorial Day to be a national holiday. Since then, each year, at the  end of May, cities across the Nation have lowered their flags to half- staff as a silent reminder of the cost of the freedom.   Just like Sergeant Smith, the fallen warriors we honor this Memorial  Day made a choice to serve this Nation. They knew it wouldn't be easy.  They knew it would be dangerous or even deadly, but they knew that it  would be worth it because it would be a step in preserving freedom and  freedom's cause. It is this choice--and the choice to serve bravely and  selflessly on behalf of a grateful nation--that we remember, as we  debated crucial legislation supporting our Armed Forces.   Memorial Day marks the conclusion of Military Appreciation Month,  which has provided each of us an opportunity to unite and reflect upon  the heroic courage of all the members of our Armed Forces. We thank  them continually for the service they provided and the sacrifices that  they and their families make on behalf of this Nation and freedom.   Yesterday, members of the Armed Services Committee--of which Madam  President and I are each a member of this committee--completed our  first steps in ensuring that this year's National Defense Authorization  Act fully funds the resources our military needs to defend against the  threats that we face on land, by sea, in air, and of course in the  cyber realm. Our proposed $750 billion national defense budget will  more than support this goal and includes a much-needed and well- deserved pay increase for our military men and women.   The NDAA, as it is called in an acronym that we hear around here so  regularly, is just one piece of our greater promise to care for  soldiers on and off the battlefield. As Members of Congress, we have a  duty to keep the promise to those who bravely defend the safety and the  security of the American people. Also, we have a responsibility to  those whose brokenhearted vigil we join this Memorial Day weekend.   Just as valor lived in the hearts of the fallen, so does their  sacrifice endure in the life of every person blessed to call this great  country home.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
