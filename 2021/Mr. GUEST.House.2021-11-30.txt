 Madam Speaker, former President Ronald Reagan once said,  ``Within the covers of the Bible are the answers for all the problems  men face.''   The answers in the Bible have provided our Nation with valuable  wisdom over the course of history. In times of fear, God's Word has  provided encouragement; in times of joy, it has supplied words of  praise; and in times of uncertainty, it has offered peace.   My hope is that all Americans will continue to live by the truth and  the wisdom of the Word of God.   As we face the future, we must never forget that our Nation was  divinely inspired on biblical principles. We must recognize that we are  blessed to live in a country where we can worship freely, and we must  work to see that we always remain one nation under God.  [[Page H6705]]    But perhaps most important to our challenges today is to heed the  greatest commandment, love the Lord your God with all your heart, with  all your soul, and with all your might, and love your neighbor as  yourself.    May God continue to bless the United States of America.
