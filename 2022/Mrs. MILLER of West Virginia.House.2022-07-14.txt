 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  World War II Medal of Honor recipient, West Virginia native Woody  Williams, my dear friend.   Woody was West Virginia's hero, and he was America's hero. He truly  embodied what it meant to be part of the Greatest Generation.   Today, he will lie in honor in the United States Capitol. I can think  of no better way to honor Woody's life and legacy, as well as the  memory of all of the World War II veterans, than allowing him this  privilege.   Woody will be sorely missed, but his legacy of service, dedication,  and patriotism will live on in countless lives that he touched.                            ____________________
