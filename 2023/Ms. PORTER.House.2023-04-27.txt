 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the University  High School's Science Bowl team.   Recently, University High School competed in the National Science  Bowl's regional competition, hosted annually at the NASA Jet Propulsion  Lab. Over 100 students from southern California took part in this  intense, ``Jeopardy!''-style tournament. It is a marathon, not a  sprint, but these students were ready to run it.   The team spent months mastering the curriculum, which included  everything from natural sciences to advanced mathematics, and their  hard work paid off. Against 19 of the brightest teams, University High  School prevailed.   This is now the school's fifth victory at the regional Science Bowl  in the past 6 years. I am honored to celebrate these students'  achievement and cheer them on as they head to nationals.   Keep making Orange County proud.                            ____________________
