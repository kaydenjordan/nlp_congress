 Mr. Speaker, I rise today for constituents with whom I  recently met whose family is one among millions of Uighurs, the ethnic  Muslim community from Xinjiang in northwest China being persecuted by  the Chinese Government.   My constituents' parents are among the estimated 1 million Uighurs  and other Muslims who are currently being held in camps because of  their faith and ethnicity. The reports of what is happening to this  community--mass targeting, detention, and torture based on faith and  origin--echo the darkest chapters in human history.   I am heartened to see that there is bipartisan support for doing  something about it. That is why I say to leadership: Move the  bipartisan UIGHUR Act and the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act through  committee and to the floor so that we can pass these bills in the  House, push the Senate to take them up, and get them signed into law.   Only by acting in moments like this can we truly live up to the  pledge ``never again.'' Let's stand together and say no to ethnic  cleansing on our watch.                            ____________________
