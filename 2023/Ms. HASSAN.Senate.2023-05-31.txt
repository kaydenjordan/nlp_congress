 Mr. President, as we mark Mental Health Awareness  Month, I am honored to recognize Loreley Godfrey of Portsmouth as May's  Granite Stater of the Month. At age 18, Loreley has become a powerful  force advocating for youth mental health education in New Hampshire.  [[Page S1839]]    Loreley was driving when her best friend had a panic attack next to  her in the passenger's seat. Pulling to the side of the road, Loreley  felt ill-equipped to handle the situation, and she did not know what to  do besides hold her friend's hand and urgently search online for  resources. The experience made Loreley wonder why many teens such as  herself are not prepared to respond to a mental health crisis, where  seconds can make a difference. Since she was a member of the Governor's  Youth Advisory Council on Substance Misuse and Prevention, she  interviewed the 17 other students on the panel and found that her  experience was not unique--few had had any mental health education at  school.   Loreley teamed up with a New Hampshire State senator to craft a  bipartisan bill to provide schools with lesson plans on mental health.  Although the bill did not pass the house in April, Loreley is committed  to continuing her advocacy for mental health education in New  Hampshire, even as she goes off to college this fall. Loreley's efforts  are a testament to how young people can make a tremendous difference in  New Hampshire. And her leadership extends beyond mental health  advocacy, having led multiple rallies for sustainability in Portsmouth  and being one of New Hampshire's first female Eagle Scouts. Loreley  exemplifies the Granite State spirit of engaged, citizen-led public  service, and I look forward to seeing all that she will do in the  future to make New Hampshire and our country an even better  place.                            ____________________
