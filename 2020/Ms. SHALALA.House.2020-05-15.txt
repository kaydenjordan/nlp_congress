 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and  the underlying bills.   Madam Speaker, my office in Miami is not getting calls; we are  getting cries for help. My neighbors are scared of both a virus that  could kill them or their loved ones and worried about how they will  make their next rent or mortgage payment or buy groceries or when their  children will go back to school.   Today we vote on two bills. The first will allow Members of Congress  to do our jobs, as described by our chair, Mr. McGovern. The second  will provide desperately needed relief.   We have already passed four pieces of legislation to respond to the  pandemic which has killed more than 83,000 Americans. My friends and  neighbors in south Florida are suffering. The HEROES Act gives money to  my State, cities, and county that are shouldering both the economic and  health burdens of COVID-19.   Unless we do this, my county and cities and school board will not be  able to pay teachers or firefighters or police officers or transit  workers or even hire contact tracers to help get this virus under  control. This bill provides that and includes more money for SNAP and  additional economic impact payments of up to $6,000 per family.   The HEROES Act also provides needed funds for the Postal Service. The  Postal Service was founded in 1792. It is more critical than ever in  helping people safely access medications and food and cleaning supplies  and vote-by-mail ballots and more.   While the Senate may be here in D.C. whistling past the graveyard as  they confirm judicial nominees, we are working to get the American  people the help they desperately need. I urge all of my colleagues to  support these bills.
