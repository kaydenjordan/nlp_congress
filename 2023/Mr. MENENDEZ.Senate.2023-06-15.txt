 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   [[Page S2120]]                                                     Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                        Spain--Excalibur Projectiles         The Government of Spain has requested to buy an additional       one hundred fifty-three (153) M982A1 Excalibur tactical       projectiles that will be added to a previously implemented       case whose value was under the congressional notification       threshold. The original FMS case, valued at $21.87 million,       included one hundred eighteen (118) M982A1 Excalibur tactical       projectiles. This notification is for a combined total of two       hundred seventy-one (271) M982A1 Excalibur tactical       projectiles. Also included is a portable electronic Fire       Control System (FCS); Improved Platform Integration Kit;       Propelling Charge Modular Artillery Charge System; Simple Key       Loaders (SKL); crypto cable; training aids; technical data;       U.S. Government technical assistance; transportation;       Excalibur spare parts; artillery cleaning sections; new       equipment training; repair and return support equipment;       support related to collateral damage estimation tables; and       other related elements of logistics and program support. The       total estimated cost is $48.2 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by improving the       security of a NATO ally which is an important force for       political stability and economic progress in Europe.        The proposed sale will improve Spain's capability to meet       current and future threats and will enhance interoperability       with U.S. forces and other allied forces. The enhanced       capability will also strengthen its homeland defense. Spain       will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Raytheon Company Missile       Systems, McAlester, OK. There are no known offset agreements       proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this sale will not require the assignment       of any U.S. Government or contractor representatives to       Spain.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       because of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-36       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The M982A1 Excalibur 155 mm, High Explosive Projectile       is an all up projectile with Global Positioning System (GPS)-      aided precision guidance capability. The Excalibur provides       the ability to accurately engage targets at distances up to       25 miles. Excalibur is commonly fired from U.S. Army and       Marine Corps towed and self-propelled howitzer systems,       including the M777 and M109.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Spain can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Spain.                            ____________________
