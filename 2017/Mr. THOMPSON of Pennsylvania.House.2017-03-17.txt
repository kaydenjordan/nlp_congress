 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, last week, with  Representative Suzan DelBene, I introduced the Timber Innovation Act to  help find new and innovative uses for wood as a building material.   Proudly, the Allegheny National Forest is a part of the Fifth  Congressional District of Pennsylvania. Communities in my district  depend on the revenue from high-value timbering and forest products  that are generated by the forest as well as privately held lands  throughout the Commonwealth.   This bipartisan legislation encourages the advancement of tall wood  building construction along with research and development.   Mr. Speaker, since our earliest days, we have used wood as a building  material. New technology will help expand and develop the use of wood  in larger construction projects. Currently, most wood buildings do not  exceed three to four stories in height, but we hope to change that.   There is so much potential for mass timber, and this bill truly  encourages new advancements of wood construction. This bill is good for  both consumers and the industry, and I encourage my colleagues to  support this bipartisan bill and advance the sustainable forest  management and opportunities in our rural communities.                            ____________________
