 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in strong support of this amendment, the Beyer-Eshoo-Esty  amendment, which restores funding to make it equal to the fiscal year  2018 level agreed to by Congress earlier this year for ARPA-E, which is  the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy.   ARPA-E is housed within the Department of Energy and invests in  emerging clean energy technologies to make our country more energy- secure, reduce costs, and increase energy efficiency. So it is smart.  It is smart. That is what America has been known for, and we want to  retain that reputation.   The Agency specializes in high-risk, high-reward technologies that  are, in many instances, too risky for the private sector but have  enormous potential to change how we produce and consume energy.   ARPA-E is doing for energy development what the NIH does for medical  research. It provides early-stage support for new moonshot ideas that  have the potential to transform the everyday lives of Americans and our  economy.   ARPA-E is a product of the 2006 Innovation Agenda and was modeled  after the highly acclaimed DARPA, created 60 years ago in the  Department of Defense. It is credited with launching some of the most  successful technologies of our time, including GPS and the internet.   ARPA-E was created by Congress in 2007 with bipartisan support, it  was signed into law by a Republican President, and it has been a  resounding success.   In its 10-year history, the agency has funded over 660 projects that  have helped create 71 new companies; attracted over $2.6 billion in  private sector funding; led to the creation of 245 new patents; and  fostered over 1,700 peer-reviewed articles to further our understanding  of the energy ecosystem.   Mr. Chairman, the United States, I think, is really at an important  crossroads in our history. We will decide whether our country is going  to continue to lead the world in innovation.   Foreign competitors, such as China, are surging investments in new  R&D and threaten to overtake our country in that area. We must continue  our basic investments to ensure we remain the most innovative and  successful economy in the world, and this amendment helps to advance  this.   This has been bipartisan and overwhelmingly successful for our  country. Why would we turn the pages back?   So, for all these reasons and more, I urge my colleagues to support  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, first, I want the House to know that this is  a bipartisan amendment.   This amendment provides a $1 million increase for the Office of  Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to fund the development and  deployment of high-efficiency linear generator technology.   Linear generators convert fuel and air into electricity with the same  efficiency and near zero emissions as the highest performing fuel cells  on the market, and they are superior to many legacy fuel cells. But  instead of using an electrochemical process like fuel cells, linear  generators use an electromechanical process that relies on only two  moving parts and no oil, which reduces capital and maintenance costs  and results in a life span of three to four times greater than a  traditional fuel cell.   Equally as important, linear generators are dispatchable and can  provide electricity even when the electricity grid is down. This is  especially valuable in areas recently hit by hurricanes like Puerto  Rico and Houston, Texas, and other extreme weather events like last  year's wildfires in northern California.   Linear generators also provide resilient baseload power, which  eliminates the need for expensive, unreliable, and dirty diesel back-up  generators.   At its heart, this amendment is about investing in the future of  energy production, and it is about laying the groundwork for the  innovators in our country to do what they do best: outperform the  status quo and outcompete the rest of the world.   The United States has been a global leader in the development of  energy efficiency technology, reducing energy costs and increasing  reliability for consumers. But we are in danger of falling behind our  foreign competitors.   Mr. Chairman, linear generator technology was born in my Silicon  Valley district by some of the best and the brightest minds from  Stanford University. And although this technology is substantially  similar to fuel cells, it faces an uphill battle and an uneven playing  field in bringing these products to market, despite the many benefits  of the technology itself.                                time  2200    This amendment will ensure that the Fuel Cell Technologies Office at  the DOE invests in the next generation of fuel cell technologies and  maintains U.S. leadership in this critical field.   Mr. Chair, it is nice not to have any opposition, so I urge my  colleagues to support the next generation of fuel cell technologies and  vote ``yes'' on this bipartisan amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
