 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight legislation that  I recently introduced, the Longshore and Harbor Workers COVID-19  Compensation Act.   I am extremely proud that this is my first piece of legislation and  that it serves to protect the health, safety, and livelihoods of our  Nation's maritime workers.   The current health pandemic has created serious challenges for these  essential workers, including unpaid, mandatory quarantine requirements  resulting from COVID-19 contraction or exposure.   In the First Congressional District of Indiana, the Burns Waterway  Harbor generates more than $15 billion in business revenue and supports  over 80,000 workers, including union jobs with the International  Longshoremen's Association.   I appreciate the support of my chairman on the House Education and  Labor Committee,  Bobby Scott, and I look forward to working with all  of my colleagues to support this invaluable workforce and to move this  legislation forward as soon as possible.                            ____________________
