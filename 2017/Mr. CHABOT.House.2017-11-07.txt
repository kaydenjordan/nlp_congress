 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3441,  and I want to commend our colleague, Mr. Byrne, for sponsoring this  legislation. I also want to commend Chairwoman Foxx for her leadership  on this very important issue. I am proud to be an original cosponsor  myself.   As chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I have had the  opportunity to see firsthand how the National Labor Relations Board's  new joint employer standard threatens the ability of small-business  owners to remain independent and responsible for their own employees.   At a Small Business Committee hearing last year, an Army combat  veteran and small-business owner testified that: ``Local business  owners may effectively be demoted from entrepreneur to middle manager,  as they are gradually forced to forfeit operational control of the  stores, clubs, inns, or restaurants that they built.''   At the same hearing, another small-business owner testified that: ``I  would cease to be an independent small-business owner . . . ultimately,  I would become a de facto employee of the corporate brand.''   These are merely two examples of the consequences real American  small-business owners face because of the decisions of Washington  bureaucrats and activist judges. The Obama-era joint employer scheme  threatens small businesses, the engines of American economic growth.   Small businesses, after all, create the majority of the new jobs in  this Nation; they spur innovation.   Enacting this legislation would help ensure continued freedom for  America's best job creators.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3441. Passage of  this legislation is necessary to restore certainty to America's small- business owners and their employees so that they can continue to  operate their businesses locally and independently.
