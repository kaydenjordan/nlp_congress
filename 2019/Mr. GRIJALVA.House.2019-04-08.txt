 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2030) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to execute and  carry out agreements concerning Colorado River Drought Contingency  Management and Operations, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2030         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Colorado River Drought       Contingency Plan Authorization Act''.       SEC. 2. COLORADO RIVER BASIN DROUGHT CONTINGENCY PLANS.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law       expressly addressing the operation of the applicable Colorado       River System reservoirs, immediately upon execution of the       March 19, 2019, versions of the Agreement Concerning Colorado       River Drought Contingency Management and Operations and the       agreements attached thereto as Attachments A1, A2, and B, by       all of the non-Federal parties thereto, the Secretary of the       Interior shall, without delay, execute such agreements, and       is directed and authorized to carry out the provisions of       such agreements and operate applicable Colorado River System       reservoirs accordingly.        (b) Effect.--Nothing in this section shall--        (1) be construed or interpreted as precedent for the       litigation of, or as altering, affecting, or being deemed as       a congressional determination regarding, the water rights of       the United States, any Indian Tribe, band, or community, any       State or political subdivision or district of a State, or any       person; or        (2) exempt the implementation of such agreements and the       operation of applicable Colorado River System reservoirs from       any requirements of applicable Federal environmental laws.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2030 will direct the Secretary of the Interior to  immediately execute the drought contingency plan agreements.   The drought contingency plan agreements will allow us to immediately  respond to the historic drought conditions in the Colorado River Basin.  These conditions pose a threat to the water supply of 40 million  people, and 5.5 million acres of farmland.   This legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to immediately  execute the drought contingency plan agreements since the actions to be  undertaken are within the analyses and range of effects reviewed in  existing environmental documents.   These environmental documents include: Number 1, a 2007 final EIS on  Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and  Coordinated Operations for Lakes Powell and Mead.   Number 2, existing ESA documents for the Colorado River Storage  Project Act initial storage unit reservoirs.   Additional environmental compliance is only applicable should further  Federal actions be undertaken that are outside the range of effects  analyzed in the previously mentioned environmental documents.   Mr. Speaker, that essentially means that the drought contingency plan  agreements fit within the framework of existing environmental  compliance. This compliance allows the Secretary of the Interior to  immediately sign the drought contingency plan agreements.   This immediate action is essential to preserving the water supply for  millions of people in the American Southwest.   Before closing, I would also like to thank the many people who worked  for years to develop and finalize the DCP. In particular, I want to  highlight the contributions of the Colorado River Indian Tribes, and  Gila River Indian Community. Without their contributions, DCP simply  would not be possible.   I also want to thank the seven basin States and others who worked  with me and my staff to finalize DCP and enable the legislation over  the past several weeks. I am glad that we were able to work together to  develop legislation that has earned broad, bipartisan support here in  Congress, and with affected stakeholders.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me also thank the ranking member, Mr.  Bishop, and his staff for helping expedite the process, and for their  input throughout this process.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Napolitano) for her comments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Stanton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. McAdams).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as another one from Arizona, let me close  by thanking the ranking member and also noting that 2026 is around the  corner. The work that was being done today with this drought  contingency plan is a very important door into what needs to be done in  the future, the cooperation, the collaboration, and the urgency going  forward.   As Mr. Schweikert said, the job is not complete yet. There is much  still to do.   I hope that the stakeholders and everyone involved in getting the  plan to this point continue, with earnestness and with purpose, to  address the issue of water availability in the Southwest. As our areas  become more and more arid, understand that this is not an infinite  resource we have in water. It is a finite resource, and we need to  treat it that way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
