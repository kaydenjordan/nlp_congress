 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor the  life of Robert ``Bobby'' Silverstein, who was a champion for people who  experience disabilities and who made an incredible impact throughout  his career.   During his time working for both the U.S. House of Representatives  and the U.S. Senate, Bobby held a number of leadership roles where he  helped develop legislation to improve the lives of individuals with  disabilities. This includes serving as staff director and chief counsel  for the Subcommittee on Disability Policy on what is now known as the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. During his tenure,  Bobby worked to build bipartisan consensus and helped negotiate  critical pieces of bipartisan legislation, including the Americans with  Disabilities Act--ADA.   Bobby made a profound impact on countless families across the  country, including my own. My son Ben experiences physical disabilities  and because advocates like Bobby worked to pass critical legislation  like the ADA, Ben had the opportunity to go to school, to learn, and  make friends in our community.   But my family's story is not unique. Across the country, in the more  than three decades since the ADA was signed into law, people who  experience disabilities have been more fully included in their  communities and have received the support that they need to thrive at  home, in school, at work, and in all aspects of their lives.   As we mark Bobby's legacy, we also recognize that we have more work  to do to build on his incredible efforts. And we must follow his  example of working to build consensus and make a difference for the  American people.   While Bobby passed away in November, the impact that he has made in  the lives of millions of people will live on in our democracy. I am  profoundly grateful for the work he has done and will continue working  to honor his legacy and ensure that Americans who experience  disabilities are fully included in every aspect of our society.                            ____________________
