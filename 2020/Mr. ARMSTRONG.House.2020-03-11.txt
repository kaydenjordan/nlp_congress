 Madam Speaker, to my colleagues on both sides who  think that this bill doesn't go far enough, I can tell you that,  probably 3 days ago, I was 100 percent in your camp. If you would have  told me today I was going to stand up and speak in favor of this bill,  I would have told you that is not true, yet here I am.   The reason is because I think we are dealing with some issues that  are important to discuss:   One, there is no legislation that we can write that will make bad  actors not be bad actors. There is no amicus provision or any provision  that is going to allow for somebody who is going to lie to their own  superiors to not lie to somebody else.   Two, the provisions of lone wolf and roving wiretaps are incredibly  important to national security. There is not a lot of debate amongst  those things.   Three, FISA and title 1 were originally designed because of abuses to  civil rights. We know that title 1 has been abused, and that is why we  are here.   But are we better off without title 1? I don't think so. We weren't  before. We are better off with it.   So what does this bill actually do that is important, that is why a  guy like me who believes in the Fourth Amendment, believes in the First  Amendment, and believes in the privacy of our citizens, why would I  stand here? Because it increases transparency; it moves it through the  process faster; it puts real compliance checks in place; and it holds  people accountable both through a contempt proceeding and enhanced  criminal penalties.   When we are dealing with something as important as civil liberties, I  think we have to ask the question: Are we better off tomorrow than we  are today? This bill puts us in a better position tomorrow than it did  yesterday.
