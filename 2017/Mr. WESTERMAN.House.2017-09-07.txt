 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title) insert       the following:                          limitation on use of funds         Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to enforce the final rule entitled ``Onshore Oil and       Gas Operations; Federal and Indian Oil and Gas Leases;       Measurement of Oil'' and published by the Bureau of Land       Management on November 17, 2016 (81 Fed. Reg. 81462).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Calvert and Chairman  Frelinghuysen for their hard work on this bill.   On November 17, 2016, the Bureau of Land Management released a final  rule titled: ``Onshore Oil and Gas Operations; Federal and Indian Oil  and Gas Leases; Measurement of Oil.''   Though the BLM claims that this rule would incorporate proven  industry standards developed by oil measurement experts from industry  and the BLM, it seems like the BLM ignored industry expert standards  and set their standards, regardless of industry input.   In comments filed on December 14, 2015, the Independent Petroleum  Association of America, the American Petroleum Institution, the Western  Energy Alliance, and many citizens involved in oil production detailed  serious concerns. Many of the comments centered on BLM's reluctance to  recognize its obligation to adopt properly established industry  standards.   Mr. Chairman, I believe that it is vital that agencies such as the  BLM listen to and take into account industry concerns and input when  promulgating these new rules.   My amendment would restrict funding for this rule in its current  form, and I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this new rule updates outdated  regulations and establishes minimum standards for the measurement of  oil production from Federal and Indian leases to ensure that  productivity is accurately measured and properly accounted for.   The administration has aggressively sought to abolish rules that were  developed over many years, and adhere to the process outlined in the  Administrative Procedure Act, which includes consideration of Tribal  and public comments.   Updating this regulation avoids regulatory uncertainty and reflects  the considerable changes in technology and industry practices that have  occurred over 25 years since the previous oil and gas order No. 4--25  years since the previous onshore oil and gas order No. 1. Changes in  technology. We should be embracing changes in technology and industry  practices. We should not be using technology and practices formed 25  years ago.   The new rule also responds to comments made by the GAO, the  Department of Interior's IG, and the Royal Policy Committee regarding  BLM's production and verification efforts.   The objective of this rule is to ensure that the oil volume reported  by the industry is sufficiently accurate to ensure that the royalties  due are paid correctly, the royalties due to the U.S. taxpayer. The  rulemaking process has been comprehensive and it has been transparent.  If there are to be changes to those rules, those changes need to be  done in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Administrative  Procedure Act. There is a way to do that. So, once again, there would  be an opportunity for Tribal and public comment.   This amendment does not provide for an open and transparent process.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment and to  protect the American taxpayer to make sure that the royalties are  accurately recorded.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, another way the BLM has ignored their  obligations under the rulemaking process is by discounting the  practical difficulties for both industry and the agency associated  compliance.   Mr. Chairman, the BLM ignored their rulemaking responsibilities by  both disregarding industry input and snubbing practical timelines for  compliance.   I believe the BLM should go back, reexamine this rule, and this time  listen and get it right.   Mr. Chairman, I ask support for my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition for two reasons.   One, this, once again, is a substantial piece of policy work being  done on an appropriations bills on the floor of the House. We have  committees which can take things up, government oversight, and we have  the Natural Resources Committee. There are many venues in which the  gentleman could ask for a hearing and bring people to testify, if there  are things that need to be done. Or just work through the  Administrative Procedure Act, which has opportunities before it, if  people feel that they are not being treated justly.   But the other reason why I rise against this is, 25 years since the  previous update has happened, technology has changed since then and  industry practices have changed. Part of our responsibility--and I  truly believe this in my heart--is to make sure that when we do leases,  when we are to receive royalty payments, we need to be looking out for  the U.S. taxpayer to make sure that they are fairly compensated for  these leases.   Mr. Chairman, I object to the amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 46 will  not be offered.                  Amendment No. 50 Offered by Mr. Goodlatte    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 50  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pearce for his leadership on  this issue.   Mr. Chairman, this rule by the BLM is a classic example of agency  overregulation at its finest. Should the new regulations take effect,  lessees and operators will be forced to maintain original gas charts,  measurement tickets, calibrations, verifications, prover  [[Page H7175]]  and configuration reports, pumper and gauger field logs, volume  statements, event logs, seal records, and gas analysis.   Most of these documents have nothing to do with determining the  amount of production at a lease and will force businesses to hire more  staff just to keep records.   This will also likely result in more Federal employees to oversee the  bureaucracy. This makes zero sense and is simply creating work and  overregulation for no reason. I urge a ``yes'' vote.
