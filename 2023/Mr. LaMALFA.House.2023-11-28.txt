 Madam Speaker, I have introduced the bipartisan Indian  Buffalo Management Act to create a permanent buffalo program at the  U.S. Department of Interior and help promote and develop Tribal  capacity to manage buffalo.   The act provides secure, consistent funding for Tribes, and Tribal  organizations to have an established buffalo herd and management  program, as well as provide resources for Tribes that would like to  establish new herds of buffalo.   This bill passed out of the House last Congress and was led by my  dear friend, our late Congressman from Alaska, Mr. Don Young.   This bill will help bolster our Tribal sovereignty, create economic  opportunities, and ensure a stable supply of nutritious, locally  sourced protein.   Additionally, the American buffalo has a deep historical and cultural  connection to many Tribes and has always held great meaning for Indian  peoples.   Buffalo has provided the Tribes with everything from clothing, to  food, to shelter, to utensils, to pouches, to headdresses, to  containers, and much more.   It is impossible to overstate their importance to Native Americans  historically and to this day, culturally, as well as all Americans as a  symbol of the rugged West.   This program will greatly help with Intertribal Buffalo Council's  goal of restoring buffalo herds on Indian reservation lands.   Madam Speaker, I hope we can get the support for that and get it out  of the House, out of the Senate, and in front of the President.                            ____________________
