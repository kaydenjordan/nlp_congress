 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor the  loss of public servant, first responder, and beloved member of my  western Pennsylvania community, Anthony ``Tony'' Cuda.   Chief of Foxwall Emergency Medical Services since 2020, Chief Cuda  was a titan in the EMS scene.   He joined the Swissvale Fire Department at 16, became a paramedic by  18, and worked as a first responder for Seneca area EMS in Wilkinsburg,  Monroeville, Penn Hills, and other parts of western Pennsylvania.   Through the dark days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chief Cuda led his  crew with generosity, honesty, and courageous conviction. Chief Cuda  saved lives, comforted frightened community members, and taught the  next generation of first responders.   He was a witty straight shooter who off the job enjoyed playing  Dungeons and Dragons and spending time with family whether at home, at  Kennywood, the Renaissance Festival, or Comic Con.   To the Cuda family, especially his wife, Michele, and his five  children, Zachary, Morgan, Shannon, Caitlyn, and Kirsten, know this:  Our corner of western Pennsylvania is better off thanks to Chief Cuda  and mourns his passing, as does this body and this country.                            ____________________
