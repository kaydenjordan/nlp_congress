 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Massachusetts  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I just say to my friend from Alabama, he wraps himself  in the uniform of our brave men and women who serve this country  overseas and here at home as if there is a zero-sum game here. He  either chooses them or he chooses to address the threat from Russia,  but he can't do both. And I say to my friend: You go to those men and  women and explain to them how our President of the United States could  sit next to an adversary--a thug, a killer, someone who interfered in  our election--and explain to them, out fighting for their country, the  Commander in Chief wouldn't do it. You explain to them how that same  Commander in Chief actually opined that maybe Crimea should be given  up.   What are we fighting for? What are our values?   This is relevant. We need to defeat the previous question so that we  can consider a debate about the role of Russia in interfering with the  most sacred thing Americans do: vote.   Our bill would sanction any foreign individual or entity found to  have unlawfully meddled with a Federal election and would bar entry to  this country and freeze U.S.-based assets of anyone involved in such  interference.                                time  0945    President Trump's performance at the Helsinki Summit with Vladimir  Putin underscores the need for this legislation, the very opposite of  what my friend from Alabama is asserting.   Time and again, the President refuses to acknowledge the unanimous  conclusion of all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies that that happened;  that Russia was a threat and directly interfered with our 2016  elections.   Mr. Trump's own Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats,  recently said: ``The warning lights are blinking red again. Today, the  digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under  attack.''   That is not some liberal Democrat. That is a former Republican  Senator and the Republican appointee of a Republican President warning  us this is a clear and imminent threat. So this is directly relevant.   Defeating the previous question will allow us to have that discussion  on the floor, because we love our country and we want to have a good  answer to the men and women in uniform, my friend from Alabama keeps on  invoking; that America hasn't given up. We are not going to roll over  and play dead to our adversaries.   We are going to candidly, on a bipartisan basis, acknowledge the  threat to this country. And we are going to resist it, because we  recognize their service and their willingness to put themselves on the  line. Are we, is the question.   I urge the defeat of the previous question and support for the bill  Mr. Engel and I have introduced to try to address this very grave  subject.
