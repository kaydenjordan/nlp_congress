Faith has a special bond with her students who struggle with math.  That is because she struggled with the subject when she was in school.  She understands those who hate the subject at the beginning of the year  and finds it deeply fulfilling to help grow each student's problem- solving skills by the time they leave her class with greater confidence  and appreciation for the subject.   Faith's colleagues note that she works hard to make learning fun and  engaging for her students each year. She is committed to tailoring her  lesson plans to suit the individual needs of every student. In turn,  Faith is inspired by her colleagues and believes that their work  together is the key to an educator's best work.

Josie teaches fifth grade and has taught in Volusia County for nearly  20 years. She credits her success to Daytona Beach mayor Derrick Henry,  who was her 11th grade teacher. She says Mayor Henry changed the course  of her life, as it was not until she was in his class, where music and  energy were incorporated into his lessons, that she realized learning  could be fun. This motivated her to inspire others in the same way that  he inspired her.   Josie strives to keep learning fun. An example of her creative  teaching includes transforming her classroom to mimic a campground, a  cafe, and many other different environments to better engage her  students in the learning process.   Josie's colleagues admire her seemingly natural ability to relate to  students, which has inspired them to follow her lead. Josie's  enthusiasm for education extends beyond her own classroom, where she  has been known to develop curriculum modules for language arts and  regularly helps other teachers.   I extend my best wishes and gratitude to Josie for her dedication to  students for nearly two decades, and I look forward to hearing of her  continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________
