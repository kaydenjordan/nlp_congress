 Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of this amendment.  I know that accountability is a foreign concept in Washington, but  accountability builds trust. It is very important, considering the  track record of this administration, considering the track record of  the Department of Defense that hasn't been audited, and considering the  track record of the Ukrainian Government, that the American people do  have proper accountability.   Accountability will be the key to success for the very brave  Ukrainian people fighting the fight against evil and winning that  fight. I will strongly urge support for this amendment. It is a very,  very serious war, and we don't want to have another pull-out like  Afghanistan.
