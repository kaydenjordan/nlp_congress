 Mr. President, thank you for the recognition.   Mr. President, I reserve my right to object.   As a former assistant U.S. attorney and New Mexico attorney general,  I worked hard to prosecute violent crimes, including those committed  against law enforcement.   The recent shootings of two law enforcement officers in California  were heinous. My deepest condolences and prayers go out to the officers  and their families. The perpetrator must be brought to justice. All  such violence is appalling.   However, this bill is both unnecessary and, potentially, a  problematic expansion of Federal criminal law. It is already a Federal  crime to kill or attempt to kill an officer or employee of the United  States.   Most, if not all, States already make killing a police officer a  specific crime, and, of course, murder and assault are crimes in all 50  States and Territories   So it is unclear that this bill will increase deterrence, and the  bill is very broad, covering not only murder and attempted murder but  also any assault against hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions of  people.   One new crime created by the bill is death eligible, raising historic  concerns about executing the innocent and the death penalty being  arbitrarily applied.   This bill has not gone through the regular order, with no hearings on  such a sweeping change in the balance of State and Federal criminal  law.   For many years, the Heritage Foundation, the Hoover Institution, the  Federalist Society, and congressional Republicans have all spoken out  against the expansion of Federal criminal law. It is not just  conservatives. There is bipartisan support for that view and broad  consensus among criminal law experts and the Federal judiciary itself.   The Judicial Conference of the U.S. courts has testified to Congress  against the over-criminalization of Federal law, citing the burdens  they already face.  [[Page S5694]]    And former Reagan Attorney General Ed Meese wrote for the Hoover  Institution over 20 years ago, in 1999, highlighting the following  problems with over-criminalization of Federal law. He warned about  these:         An unwise allocation of scarce resources needed to meet the       genuine issues of crime;        An unhealthy concentration of policing power at the       national level;        An adverse impact on the federal judicial system;        Inappropriately disparate results for similarly situated       defendants, depending on whether essentially similar conduct       is selected for federal or state prosecution;        A diversion of congressional attention from criminal       activity that only federal investigation and prosecution can       address;        The potential for duplicative prosecutions at the state and       federal levels for the same course of conduct, in violation       of the spirit of the Constitution's double jeopardy       protection.    I think the Senate should consider those warnings and should not rush  to approve such a measure without hearing testimony and a long and  careful study.   Therefore, I object.    Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to  call attention to key legislation that addresses violence, and this  piece of legislation should come to the floor. That is the Violence  Against Women Reauthorization Act.   VAWA reauthorization expired over a year and a half ago, on February  15, 2019. Funding continues, but key improvements are being delayed by  the lack of reauthorization.   The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 is supported  by all 47 Democratic Senators. The House passed the bill 236 to 158.  Thirty-three House Republicans voted yes on that bill.   The bill would extend VAWA for 5 years, through 2024, while making  key improvements.   As the vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I  know how critical VAWA reauthorization is to Indian Country.   Data from the U.S. Department of Justice indicates that Native women  face murder rates that are more than 10 times the national average  murder rate. There are more than 5,000 cases of missing American Indian  and Alaska Native women, and 55 percent of Native women have  experienced domestic violence. More than four in five American Indian  and Alaska Native women experience violence in their lifetime.   Without the enactment of a VAWA reauthorization, these Tribes will  lack the jurisdictional tools they need to keep their communities safe.   The House-passed bill strengthens Tribal sovereignty, provides  important protections for LGBT people, and bars dating partners  convicted of domestic violence from having handguns.   The bill would make a real difference in preventing violent crimes  against women and making Native communities safer, and I ask that the  Senate take up its consideration immediately.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S.  2843, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, and the Senate  proceed to its immediate consideration; further, that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.
