 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 612) to establish a grant program at the Department of  Homeland Security to promote cooperative research and development  between the United States and Israel on cybersecurity.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 612, the United States- Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2017.   I was grateful for the opportunity to work closely with my colleague,  Mr. Langevin from Rhode Island, on this vitally important legislation  that will build upon the existing collaboration between the United  States and the State of Israel on critical cybersecurity issues.   Following our successful congressional delegation to Israel in May of  last year to discuss homeland security and cybersecurity issues, Mr.  Langevin and I worked closely to champion two important pieces of  legislation.   Last year, I introduced H.R. 5877, the United States-Israeli Advanced  Partnership Act of 2016, which was signed into law on December 16 with  Mr. Langevin's help and support. That legislation expanded a current  cooperative research program between the two countries by adding  cybersecurity to a program that had previously focused only on border  security, explosives detection, and emergency services.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have H.R. 612, the United States- Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2017 come before  the House. This bill would expand the memorandum of agreement already  in place between our Department of Homeland Security and the State of  Israel by authorizing the Secretary to carry out a grant program at DHS  to support cybersecurity research and development as well as the  demonstration and commercialization of cybersecurity technologies.   During our congressional delegation, Mr. Langevin and I were able to  meet with top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu, to discuss how the United States and Israel can better  cooperate in these vital areas. We also had the opportunity to meet  with many of Israel's cybersecurity companies and technology startups.   Over the past several years, Israel has become a leader in  cybersecurity and has developed a deep and talented cyber workforce,  something we need greater focus on here in the United States. To that  end, much of our discussion with Israeli officials and private  companies revolved around how the United States and Israel can work  more closely together and learn from each other as we combat growing  cybersecurity threats. This legislation is a product of those  successful discussions.   Mr. Speaker, the United States and Israel are both under constant  threat from nation-state and other actors that wish to do our countries  harm, so it is vitally important that the United States and Israel work  hand-in-hand to build our cyber defenses to combat these cyber threats  together.   Mr. Speaker, it is also vital that in the House both parties work  hand-in-hand on America's national security vulnerabilities. Given the  current political environment, I would like to commend and thank my  colleague, Mr. Langevin, for his willingness to do just that, as  demonstrated by his partnership on this issue. I very much look forward  to continuing to work with him on more cybersecurity issues during the  115th Congress.   I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island  for his kind words. I also thank him and commend him for his leadership  on cybersecurity issues for many years in this House. I look forward to  working with him for many years, hopefully, to come. I thank him for  his friendship and collaboration in helping to make America safer.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 612.   I yield back the balance of my time.
