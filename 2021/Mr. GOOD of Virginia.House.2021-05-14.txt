 Mr. Speaker, it amazes me that House Democrats  are claiming to champion the cause of pregnant worker fairness when  they are so radically anti-life.   How can Democrats claim to support fairness or champion pregnancy  when they support taxpayer-funded abortion for any reason at any time  on demand?   How can they claim this with a straight face when they minimize the  sanctity of life and the family?   Democrats say they are pro-choice. So you would think they must at  least be okay with the choice of some religious employers to object to  helping their employees get an abortion and would provide an  accommodation for religious reasons under this bill.   It would seem reasonable for someone who says they are pro-choice to  support the notion that if someone gets an abortion, they can't force  their employer to be part of this choice.   But Democrats refuse to allow language to protect religious freedom  in this bill. The fact is, Democrats are only pro-choice when the  choice is abortion, the taking of innocent human life.   Protections already exist for pregnant workers through the Pregnancy  Discrimination Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.   I oppose these additional heavy-handed regulations. I trust America's  small business owners to treat their employees fairly. I honor the  constitutional mandate that States should make their own healthcare  policy.
