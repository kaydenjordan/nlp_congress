 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we are facing a deadline of March 5, 2018.  It was a deadline created by President Trump on September 5. That was  the day he announced, through the Attorney General, that he was ending  the DACA Program.   The DACA Program was created by President Obama to give young people  who were brought to this country as infants and toddlers and young  children and who grew up in America and are currently undocumented a  chance to earn their way to legalization and citizenship. That was the  original Dream Act. When President Obama passed his Executive order, he  protected them from deportation until Congress responded with a law. I  asked for that designation and was thankful President Obama did it.   As a result of his Executive order, 780,000 young people came  forward, paid a filing fee of over $500, went through an extensive  criminal background check, and were cleared to be given temporary  protection from deportation and temporary opportunities to work in  America, renewable every 2 years.   President Trump came into office and ended it. He challenged Congress  and said: Now pass a law to take care of this issue. It is a legitimate  challenge for the President to issue. I wish he had done it  differently, but it is certainly worthy of him to call on us to do our  job.   Well, here we are 3 months after that challenge from President Trump  and what has the Republican majority done in the Senate or the House to  respond to that challenge? Absolutely nothing--nothing, not one thing-- to provide these 780,000, as well as others who are eligible for this  protection, an opportunity under law, not one thing.   Is it because we have been overwhelmed with business? Well, I defy  those who have followed the business of the U.S. Senate over the course  of the last year to say that. It is seldom that we have ever come to  the floor and debated anything of substance. Most of the time we are an  empty Chamber lurching from one cloture vote to another cloture vote,  to a motion to proceed to this nomination and that nomination. The  exceptions, of course, were on healthcare and the Trump tax reform  bill, and those were done by reconciliation; in other words, strictly  partisan efforts.   So we have not done much this year. We certainly haven't done much  since September 5 of this year, and now what we hear from the other  side of the aisle, from the senior Senator from Texas is, What is the  hurry? We have plenty of time here. We will take care of these young  people perhaps in January, perhaps in February. The deadline is March  5.   It is pretty easy for any Member of the U.S. Senate to say: What is  the hurry, let's go slow, until they sit down and talk to the young  people who are affected. I have done that many times, and I did it over  this weekend.   I went to Benito Juarez High School in the city of Chicago. A group  of about 20 young people came forward, all of them protected by DACA.  These young people started telling their stories of being brought to  the United States at the age of 1 or 2, watching as some of their  relatives have been deported, trying to grow up in America, uncertain  of their future--really uncertain today as to what they are going to be  doing--and many of them are extraordinarily talented young people. It  is not uncommon for them to break down in tears as they tell their  story.   One was a 24-year-old graduate of college who received no Federal  assistance because she is one of the Dreamers and undocumented. She  finished college. She is now teaching in the Chicago Public School  System. If she loses DACA protection, she loses her job as a teacher.  There are tens of thousands just like her across America.   The senior Senator from Texas asks: What is the hurry? Why do we need  to address this issue?   I wish that Senator could have been there and watched her and spoken  to  [[Page S7826]]  her, as I did, and realized she is living in fear, in terror; that her  life as she knows it could end tomorrow--and it could--because of the  decision by President Trump to end this protection.   All we have asked for--and many of us on a bipartisan basis--is to  call up the Dream Act for a vote in the U.S. Senate, to give these  young people a chance of the protection of law so they can continue in  this country.   Some Republicans have said we need to sit down and talk about border  security. I said I would be happy to do that. When I was part of the  Gang of 8, we came up with comprehensive immigration reform, and we had  an extensive border security plan. Some of the Republican Senators who  offered it told me later: We went overboard and you accepted it. We  did. We are serious about border security. That is not an issue, but  for the senior Senator from Texas, that is not good enough.   I handed him a sheet of paper last week, and I have a copy of it  right here, showing him the proposals we are making on border security.  I pointed out to him that 12 of the proposals I handed to him were  proposals from his own bill for border security. We are serious about  this. This is a genuine effort to give border security provisions the  enactment of law along with the Dream Act.   So what we hear is that the senior Senator from Texas came to the  floor and said: Well, they are just not negotiating in good faith.  Well, I have handed him this provision, this proposal. It was a good- faith gesture and a good-faith effort to move us forward, and the only  response we had yesterday from the senior Senator from Texas is: What  is the hurry? Why should we get it done this year? Why don't we wait  until next year?   Well, next year, as we know, means waiting 2 months when it comes to  this issue, and that, to me, is the real fear I have--that we will put  this off. The uncertainty, the worry, the stress for these young people  will continue while we do nothing--nothing.   We don't enact laws here. We do nothing. We give speeches to an empty  Chamber and say: Gosh, I wish we had a little more time here to really  do some substantive work. We have all the time we need.   I would commend to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, for  goodness' sake, when 76 percent of the American people agree with the  Dream Act, when 61 percent of Trump voters agree with the Dream Act,  there is no excuse. We need to make it the law of the land.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it was 20 years ago when I was first  elected to the Senate. I was asked to consider a bill called the Red  Rocks Wilderness Act. I didn't know anything about it. It was a bill  that had been offered by Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. He was  retiring. I was asked to consider sponsoring this wilderness proposal  in the State of Utah. Of course, I said, I am from Illinois, not Utah,  and I have never seen this. Well, they asked me to come out and take a  look, and I did.   My wife and I went out to take a look at what was known as the Red  Rocks Wilderness Area. It is in the southeastern corner of Utah. I had  never been there, nor had I ever heard of it before I visited. What an  eye-opener, to go there and see this magnificent vista, this incredible  landscape that was being proposed for wilderness protection and status.   So over the years, I have reintroduced the bill, the conversation  continued, and it wasn't until President Obama took a major share of  this area, which is in San Juan County in the southeastern corner of  Utah, and designated it in the name of the Bears Ears Monument that we  finally achieved protection for this beautiful piece of real estate.   I have been there. It is breathtaking. There are incredible cultural  sites there by Native Americans, and it is a great place to visit, to  hike, and to enjoy a special piece of America. It is filled with  magnificent red rock formations, deep, carved canyons, long mesas, and  rock arches. Some of the photos just don't do it justice. We can take a  look at some of these, and we can get an idea of the vastness of the  area that is affected here.   Then you might take a look at some of the others and realize it  includes a lot of cultural and prehistoric settings that were utilized  by the Native American people when they called these caves their homes.  It has special meaning to the Native American Tribes that are there.  Many of them trace their origins to the very people who dwelled in  these caves and the structures they built with the loose rocks that we  can still see today.   We look at it and think, Well, if you didn't use this, if you didn't  preserve it, if you didn't protect it, what would you do with it?   I have spoken with some of the Senators from Utah, and they have  readily conceded there is no oil or gas there to be drilled. There may  be some uranium processing but very little. I asked them: Why wouldn't  you want this area protected? It doesn't have economic value other than  the fact that people will come, tourists will come to Utah to see this  beautiful place.   I was troubled when President Trump announced he was going to follow  Secretary Zinke's recommendation and shrink the proposed Bears Ears  Monument as well as another nearby called the Grand Staircase- Escalante. They would reduce the size of the Bears Ears Monument by 85  percent and Grand Staircase-Escalante by 50 percent.   In April, President Trump issued an Executive order requiring the  Department of the Interior to preview and review the previous national  monument designations of President Obama. Although Bears Ears and Grand  Staircase are the first two targets to be hit by President Trump, this  attack on what is known as the Antiquities Act and our national  monuments goes far beyond these two sites.   As part of the review, the President and Secretary of the Interior  Zinke considered changing every national monument that had been created  since 1996, which is more than 50 nationwide. These are areas that have  been protected by Presidents of both political parties. It goes back,  in fact, to a Republican President, Teddy Roosevelt, who realized it  was worth fighting off some of the parochial and economic interests to  preserve pieces of America for future generations.   The list that was subject to the Trump order spans the country. It  includes the Cascade-Siskiyou in Oregon, Gold Butte in Nevada, Katahdin  Woods and Waters in Maine, Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks and Rio Grande  in New Mexico, and several marine monuments.   The administration's decisions to shrink Bears Ears and Grand  Staircase-Escalante goes against continued support for these sites. The  Bears Ears Monument was the first monument to be proposed and advocated  by the five sovereign Tribal nations: The Hopi, Navajo Nation, Ute  Mountain Ute, Pueblo of Zuni, and Ute Indians.   The Tribes sought protection because of the important place Bears  Ears has in their cultures. The artifacts within Bears Ears range from  700 to 12,000 years old, providing Tribes with an incredible insight  into the sacred history of their ancestral homeland and bolstering  their deep spiritual connection to the landscape itself. In total, 30  Native-American Tribes with ancestral, historical, and contemporary  ties to the Bears Ears region supported the designation--30.   I might recall, for those who are not students of history--and I am  learning--treatment of Native Americans in this region has again raised  some serious questions about America's past. It wasn't until 1920 that  Native Americans were recognized as citizens of the United States in  many of these areas. It wasn't until 1957 that Native Americans were  given the right to vote in the State of Utah even though Native  Americans had served our country in World War II, such as the Code  Talkers, who were honored by President Trump last week. It wasn't until  the 1970s that the State of Utah built its first public school on a  Tribal area reservation--and only did that after being ordered by the  Federal court. The history of our relationship with these Native- American Tribes is one that raises questions about our respect for what  they meant to the earliest founding of America and what they mean to us  today.   Mr. President, I see the majority leader has taken the floor. I know  that under the rules he has priority when it  [[Page S7827]]  comes to speaking. I wish to finish my remarks, but if I can have the  permission of the Chair by unanimous consent and allow the majority  leader to speak and then resume my statement after he is finished.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Illinois.                            ____________________     Mr. President, resuming my earlier remarks, the Native- American Tribes almost unanimously opposed the action that was  announced yesterday by President Trump and Secretary Zinke to shrink  the Bears Ears Monument. They have passed resolutions in support of  that monument.   Navajo Nation's president said that the President's efforts to shrink  the monument ``demonstrates their failure to listen to the concerns of  our people who have lobbied and fought for over 80 years for this  designation.'' Even worse, the Navajo Nation made several requests to  meet with President Trump on the issue, to no avail. Those requests  fell on deaf ears, and the administration never met with the leadership  of the Navajo Nation or any of the other Tribes who worked to protect  this area.   The administration took these actions under the guise of protecting  this area for future generations. During President Trump's speech in  Utah, he said:         I don't think it is controversial, actually. I think it's       so sensible.    From the folks he was speaking to, it must have seemed that his  comment was correct, but the group the President was speaking to was a  closed-door group of selected supporters of his administration who do  not reflect the feelings of local residents when it comes to the future  of this monument. It reflected the same closed-door process this  administration had used to shrink these monuments.   The administration ignored that more than 2.8 million Americans  weighed in when there was an open public comment period at the  Department of the Interior. Ninety-eight percent of them asked the  President to protect the monuments and to maintain their borders--98  percent. So to say that shrinking these monuments dramatically is not  controversial is to ignore 2.8 million Americans and the Tribes with  whom the President never took the time to meet.   With these reductions, it is clear that Secretary Zinke and President  Trump are choosing politics over science and choosing economic and  political local concerns over the reality of what this particular  monument means to the future of America. They are ignoring Utah's State  Historic Preservation Office and the Interior Department's own staff,  both confirming that there are artifacts throughout Bears Ears that  will now lose their protection because of the decision by President  Trump yesterday. The administration's proposed cuts closely follow the  desires of Utah politicians to shrink the monument.   I had the opportunity to meet with Secretary Zinke and some of my  colleagues a few weeks ago to discuss this reduction in the size of the  monuments. In that meeting, he assured me that any potential cuts to  Bears Ears would continue to protect the actual site's antiquities,  including archeological sites, but according to the internal documents  from the Department of the Interior, there are more than 8,400  archeological sites in the monument, 70 percent of which are  prehistoric. Even more interesting, according to the Department of the  Interior staff, less than 10 percent of the monument has truly been  surveyed. That means we have only scratched the surface of the  antiquities that could be present there.   What value is it to the people of Utah, what value is it to San Juan  County, UT, what value is it to the United States to allow spectators  and tourists to roam over these areas without acknowledging their  sacred status and historic importance? We only get one chance to  preserve our history, and now the President is walking away from that  chance for the largest part of the Bears Ears Monument. Taking away  protections from these precious places is something that could lead to  permanent damage.   During the time that I visited Bears Ears, I stopped near Fry Canyon  for a little lunch. I hiked around and saw some amazing artifacts,  which I showed in the earlier photograph. These amazing artifacts are  outside the new boundaries President Trump decided to draw yesterday.  These impressive artifacts are worth preserving, but  [[Page S7828]]  President Trump and Secretary Zinke don't agree. They have left Fry  Canyon unprotected.   I went to some of the areas where, centuries ago, Native Americans  drew artwork on the sides of these canyons, in the walls. It is still  very visible, and it should be protected. Some of it has been  desecrated and obliterated by graffiti. How can we possibly justify  that? How can we say to future generations: We just didn't care enough  to keep this intact so that you and your children and grandchildren  could appreciate it.   I know there are many more areas like Fry Canyon throughout the  original Bears Ears Monument that are no longer protected because  President Trump and Secretary Zinke decided to draw new boundary lines.   While I was visiting in Moab, UT, in one of the tourist shops there,  I heard a group of about 12 speaking on the other side of the shop, and  I drew a little closer just to hear what they might be saying. They  were speaking in French. They had traveled all the way from Europe to  see this unique area, so critically important to them, so unimportant  to this administration. These tourists' willingness to travel halfway  around the world tells us that we have something special here. I really  wish the President could have met with them and so many others who  create a bustling tourist economy in this area, people who come halfway  around the world to see it. They believe it is something worth seeing.  We should believe it is something worth preserving.   The residents of Moab, just outside the monument, must recognize  this. Once a mining town with a dubious future, Moab saw its economy  decline as the industry left during the 1980s. But the town has  experienced a new rebirth, an economic growth of tourism that now  provides up to 40 percent of the jobs in the area.   Last year, National Geographic named Moab, UT, one of the best  outdoor towns in the world. Ely, MN, is the other U.S. town to receive  that honor. The people of Moab will tell you that the protection of  public lands has been good for their economy, creating good-paying  jobs, new hotels, and new opportunities, and that they support the  Bears Ears Monument. But President Trump didn't pay attention to them,  and neither did Secretary Zinke.   According to the Department of the Interior, the number of visitors  to Utah increased 20 percent between 2011 and 2015 and is projected to  continue increasing. But that didn't impress the Secretary of the  Interior when it came to literally obliterating 80 percent of the  original Bears Ears Monument that President Obama designated.   It was the University of Utah that found that tourists spent more  than $8 billion in their State in 2015, resulting in more than $1  billion in State and local tax revenue and more than 142,000 jobs.   When the State is benefiting so much from tourism, why would they  give away the protection of an area that attracts so many people and  creates so many businesses and jobs in their own State? With public  lands providing such a boon for tourism and economic growth, it is hard  to believe that the Utah congressional delegation has ignored this and  pushed so hard to destroy these monuments.   The dispute has roots in debate over federally controlled land and  Utah's Enabling Act, which was signed more than 100 years ago. When it  became a State, Utahns passed a bill to ``agree and declare that they  forever disclaimed all right and title to the unappropriated public  lands . . . and to all lands lying within said limits owned or held by  any Indian or Indian tribes.'' This provision gave all lands not  specifically claimed by the State of Utah to the Federal Government.  Utah signed up for that. That is how they became a State.   As a result, Utah now has the second most Federal land of any State,  with Federal lands making up about 65 percent of their State, including  five national parks and eight national monuments. These lands are a  source of pride and economic opportunity for so many people. Yet the  politicians of Utah don't appreciate that.   Last year, 15 million people visited national parks and monuments in  Utah, hiking, camping, and learning the traditions and history of the  Native people in that State. Let me say that again. Fifteen million  people from around the world visited public lands in Utah in 2016--an  82 percent increase in visitors over the past decade. This is not only  the right thing to do; it is the economically sensible thing to do to  protect these monuments and these areas. Despite this growth, there is  a push by some of Utah's politicians to force the Federal Government to  give up these lands and remove the protections for the cultural and  archeological resources they contain.   When I met with Secretary Zinke to discuss his recommendations, he  confirmed to me that this decision was not based on protecting some of  the most extraordinary natural resources in our Nation but, rather, on  protecting political alliances.   Every monument designation has had some opposition. Even Roosevelt  faced opposition when he worked to protect many of America's iconic  places, but despite the opposition, President Theodore Roosevelt, a  Republican, protected the Grand Canyon--a controversial decision in his  time--and other special places. Thank goodness he did. Thank goodness  he had the vision to look forward to future generations instead of  looking backward to political promises and political buddies.   Teddy Roosevelt is remembered for his conservation record, preserving  many of the places that make America a great nation, but what this  administration is doing is just the opposite of Teddy Roosevelt's  courage and vision. Repealing protections for Bears Ears and Grand  Staircase-Escalante will not make America great again. It will give up  America's greatness for selfish interest.   I urge President Trump and Secretary Zinke to reconsider their  decision that rescinds our national monument protection. It will be  challenged in court, and it may take a long time to resolve, but I hope  ultimately the courts of this land stand up for the right of a  President of either political party to make these designations, as they  have so many times before. We owe it to America, but we owe it  especially to the Native American Tribes and people who have forever  called this land home to preserve the sites that are so sacred to them,  and we owe it to those in the scientific community and to future  generations.   I am hopeful that future generations will be able to visit Bears  Ears--as my wife and I have--and learn about the people and culture  that made America long before we arrived. It is worth the respect of  this generation and future generations, and it is certainly worth it  for us to step forward and to say with vision and with courage that we  stand behind preserving these sites.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware. He and  I came to the House of Representatives together a few years back, and  we have had the pleasure and honor of serving together in the Senate.  When he is on my team, I feel much stronger because I know Tom Carper  is a person of values, principles, and hard work, and he really takes  this job seriously. His State is lucky to have him, and I am lucky to  count him as a friend. I thank him for joining me on this important  issue.   Sixteen years ago, I introduced a bill addressing young people  brought to America by their parents who, frankly, were young, didn't  really know much about the immigration experience, grew up in the  United States thinking they were just like all the other kids in the  classroom, and then realized one day they weren't.   You see, they are not legal. Their parents didn't do it properly,  didn't file the right papers. I am not holding it against their  parents. Let me add that quickly. Their parents were doing the very  best for the family they could. They were taking risks that many of us  would take any day for a son or daughter to have a chance to live a  good life.   Here were these young people in the United States undocumented. What  were they to do? They didn't know that old country where their parents  came from. They may not even be able to speak the language of that  country, and here they were in the United States. They thought things  would work out, some way or another. Time passed, and it didn't.   We have a broken immigration system. We have a lot of gaps in the  system, and they were caught up in one of  [[Page S7853]]  them. Sixteen years ago, I introduced a bill, and here is what it said.  If you came to the United States as a child, if you grew up in this  country, you didn't have any serious problems with the law, and you  graduated from school, we were going to give you a chance, a chance to  earn your way into legal status. You could do it by furthering your  education, volunteering for the military. There were a lot of ways to  do it. We said to these young people: This will be your chance.   That bill was introduced a long time ago, and it has never become the  law. At one point when President Obama was in the Office of the  Presidency, I wrote him a letter with 20 of my colleagues in the Senate  and asked him to find a way, if he could, to protect these young people  from being deported out of America, and he did. They called it DACA.  The DACA Program said, if you are one of the people who, by definition  under the DREAM Act, would be eligible, you can stay in the United  States if you step up and pay about $500 in a filing fee, go through a  serious criminal background check, and then we will give you a  temporary 2-year protection from deportation--2 years that you can work  legally in the United States and come back and see us if you want to  renew it.   At the end of the day, about 800,000 young people in America did  that. They paid their fee. They went through the background check, they  submitted all their information to our government, and they were  protected.   Just 3 months ago, President Donald Trump abolished DACA and said, as  of March 5 next year, it is gone. What does that mean for these young  people? It means that as of March 5 of next year, many of them will be  subject to deportation and subject to losing the jobs they have or  being unable to finish school because they can't work.   I have met a lot of those young people. I am sure Senator Hassan has  met some. I know Senator Carper has. He just read one of their stories.  They are heartbroken, and they are scared. They worry about what is  going to happen to them and their families when March 5 rolls around.   For weeks, months since President Trump's announcement, I have come  to the floor and asked: For goodness' sake, can't we agree--Democrats  and Republicans--to fix this problem? President Trump challenged us: Do  your job, Congress. Pass a law.   That is what we are supposed to do. Here we are, 3 months later, and  it hasn't been done. What I hear from the other side of the aisle is,  give us a little more time; we will try to get to it next year.   March 5, 2018, DACA is over and finished. Waiting several weeks is  bad enough. Waiting several months is unacceptable. I will tell you why  it is. We know this needs to be done now. Today, 34 Republicans in the  House of Representatives sent a letter to the Speaker of the House,  Paul Ryan, calling for Congress to pass legislation to protect Dreamers  this year--34 Republicans. They said: ``It is imperative that  Republicans and Democrats come together to solve this problem now and  not wait until next year''--34 Republicans in the House. How many  bipartisan things go on around here anymore? Not many. Here is one. I  salute these Members of the House. I salute the four Republican  Senators who joined me in cosponsoring the Dream Act. They, I think,  have stuck their necks out, and I respect them so much for it. I will  stand up for them because of it. I thank them for that. I know why they  are doing it. They are not doing it for me. They shouldn't, and I am  sure they are not. They are doing it for these young people. I will  tell you without fail, when you meet them, they convert you in a  minute.   For the last several years, I have come to the floor to tell their  stories. I am told the one I am going to tell right now is the 99th  time I have told a story like this. Each time I tell one of these  stories, it makes the case for why we need to do something to help  these young people and do it quickly.   Let me show you this wonderful young lady here. Her name is Blanca  Morales. Blanca Morales was brought to the United States by her parents  from Mexico when she was 5 years old. She grew up in Santa Ana, CA.  Growing up, she took care of her two younger siblings while her parents  worked in factories and in the agriculture fields of California.   She was quite a student. In high school, she was named one of the top  100 students in the county. She was active in community service,  mentoring students who couldn't complete high school without help. She  attended a community college, Santa Ana College. I might add, because  she is undocumented, she didn't qualify for any Federal Government  assistance. Going to college in that circumstance means working,  scraping by, putting things off, sacrificing to get through. She did  it. She majored in chemistry and biology. She was part of Phi Beta  Kappa, an international honors society. She won first academic team in  the All-USA Academic Competition. She was her class's valedictorian,  with a perfect 4.0 GPA.   Blanca, after graduation, attended the University of California,  Irvine. She majored in neurobiology. At UC Irvine, she graduated with  honors magna cum laude. After obtaining this premed degree, she  couldn't land a job in the medical field because she is undocumented in  America.   Then, in 2012, everything changed. President Obama established the  DACA Program I mentioned earlier, which allowed Blanca, for the first  time in her life, to get a permit to legally work in America. Last  year, Blanca Morales was accepted to the Harvard School of Medicine.  She has remained involved in community service, mentoring students,  teaching health classes at a community health center, and volunteering  as a translator at clinics for Spanish-speaking patients.   Close to 70 Dreamers are enrolled in medical schools around the  country just like she is. Without DACA, these Dreamers will never  become doctors. Why? They are going to be deported back to their  countries if they are not lucky. If they happen to be able to stay,  they cannot legally work in America without DACA status. You cannot  finish medical school and go on to a residency without a work permit,  without being able to legally work in America. They cannot legally work  without DACA protection, and President Trump has ended it.   Are we going to be a stronger nation if we deport her, tell her to  leave, go back to Mexico, which she left when she was 5 years of age,  give up on all the education she has put on the board--at the community  college where she was leading her class, on to get her degrees, on to  be accepted to Harvard Medical School. The answer is clear. America  would be less if she left.   The Association of American Medical Colleges reports the Nation faces  a doctor shortage, which is only going to get worse. Both the AMA and  the Association of American Medical Colleges have warned that ending  DACA will make this problem worse. They have urged Congress to do  something.   Blanca wrote me a letter, and here is what she said.         It took me eight years from graduating from the university       to enter medical school. Without DACA or better yet, a formal       way to become a full member of society, I am left to live in       the shadows. I don't know if I will be able to finish my       medical training without a permanent solution to my       immigration status. Please help me keep my dream of becoming       a physician alive.    When my colleagues come to the floor and say we are just too busy  here to take up this issue, I wish they would have a chance to meet  this spectacular young woman. I wish they would consider what she is  asking us to do. She is asking us to do our job. We are supposed to  solve problems.   When you read the numbers, 70, 80 percent of Americans approve of the  Dream Act, even an overwhelming majority of those who voted for  President Trump believe these young people deserve a chance to be legal  in America. Why can't we get our job done? We need to do it and do it  now. We have 3 weeks before we are likely to end the session this year.  I want to see us get this finished this year. I want to see a  bipartisan agreement.   I came to the floor earlier and listened to the speeches of many of  my colleagues--one from North Carolina and another from Oklahoma, one  from the State of Texas and another from the State of Arkansas--and  each one of them said there are lots of things we need to do to fix our  immigration system. I couldn't agree more.   I was on the task force--the Gang of 8 they called it--that came up  with a comprehensive immigration reform. It  [[Page S7854]]  took us months to do it, but we did it. We did everything we could  think of within the four corners of immigration reform. We passed it on  the floor of the Senate with a strong bipartisan rollcall, and the  House of Representatives refused to even consider it. That doesn't mean  the problems have gone away. They are still here. What I am saying to  my colleagues is, don't try to fix every immigration problem you can  think of on the backs of these Dreamers like Blanca Morales. I am  willing to talk to you honestly, forthrightly about border security.  Count me in. I voted for it as part of comprehensive immigration  reform, but every notion, every idea, every theory you have about  immigration shouldn't be placed on the shoulders and backs of these  young people.   Let's fix this, and then let's go on to the next phase of dealing  with immigration reform in its totality. That makes sense to me. I am  ready to bargain, work, compromise in good faith with any Member on the  Republican side and the Democratic side who wants to make sure a young  woman like this deserves a fighting chance in America. I believe that.  I think most Americans believe it too. Now let's roll up our sleeves  and go to work. There are plenty of things we can do the remainder of  this year that will make a big difference in her life and in the future  of America.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio).
