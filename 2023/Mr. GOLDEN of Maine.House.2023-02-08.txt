 Mr. Chair, as the designee of Ms. Perez, I have  an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf of Ms. Gluesenkamp  Perez of Washington to ensure that  [[Page H755]]  the underlying bill does not risk the public health and safety of the  American people in the future.   Like many of my colleagues across the aisle, I support ending the  COVID-19 vaccine requirement for international travelers at this time  but doing so in the interest of our constituents' safety in mind, first  and foremost.   Today, this COVID-19 vaccine requirement for international travelers  is no longer necessary. In fact, it has become an unnecessary barrier  for visitors who would boost local economies and who want to visit with  friends and family and reunite with loved ones. However, we should  remember that at the beginning of the pandemic, this requirement served  as an important protection for our constituents. It would be  shortsighted to move to hamstring similar future actions, if necessary.   That is why Ms. Gluesenkamp Perez and I support this amendment, which  strikes the prohibition on successor or subsequent requirements for air  travelers so that future administrations, whether they be Democrat or  Republican, have the tools that they need to protect the American  people.   We are not here to subject the health and safety of our constituents  to political whims here in Washington.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to work with my colleague on  this amendment, and I urge all of our colleagues to support it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
