Madam President, I have been on the floor quite a few  times about an industry which is controversial: for-profit schools. If  you want to know about for-profit colleges and universities, you have  to remember two numbers, and the numbers are these: 8 and 33. Eight  percent of the graduates of high schools go to for-profit colleges and  universities; 33 percent of all the student loan defaults are students  who started out at for-profit colleges and universities.   They are students who didn't finish or ended up with a worthless  degree, couldn't make enough money, and defaulted on their student  loans. That is an industry that deserves close scrutiny, because, you  see, they operate almost exclusively with Federal taxpayers' dollars.   I believe that they have really posed an unscrupulous threat to  unsuspecting students, to taxpayers, and to the solvency of Federal  student aid programs.   Corinthian Colleges, sounds great, doesn't it? That was one of them,  one of the largest for-profit college companies, and one of the worst.   It operated more than a hundred campuses, including six in my home  State of Illinois, under names like Everest Colleges, WyoTech, and  Heald Colleges.   At its peak, Corinthian enrolled more than 110,000 students, raking  in a $1.4 billion sum from the Federal Treasury every year, 1.4 billion  for Corinthian. How did Corinthian attract its students? It lied. It  invested heavily in marketing and advertising. It created a business  model that relied heavily on predatory sales practices. It deliberately  misled students into taking on more debt than they could ever, ever  repay.   They lied to potential students about the school's job placement  rates. They lied about the students' future salary prospects. They lied  about whether Corinthian credits could be transferred to another  college. Most appallingly, Corinthian recruiters were sent out to look  for the most vulnerable targets: high school students whose families  had no experience with higher education--minority students.   An internal company document described Corinthian's target  demographic as ``isolated people'' with ``low self-esteem.'' People who  have ``few people in their lives who care about them'' and people who  are ``stuck, unable to see and plan for the future.'' They preyed on  these people.   Single moms living close to poverty were the best targets. In 2013,  Vice President Kamala Harris, who was then California's attorney  general, sued this company for predatory and deceptive business  practices. That lawsuit was followed by investigations by four  different Federal agencies and more than 20 State attorneys general for  consumer fraud on all of their campuses.   Corinthian's enrollment numbers and stock prices tumbled with these  investigations, and on April 26, 2015, the whole Corinthian College  house of cards collapsed. The company announced abruptly it would close  all of its schools the following day.   The announcement left 16,000 students stunned and worried about how  they were ever going to pay off the debts they had incurred and about  the degrees that they wouldn't be able to finish.   Back in 2015, I called for widespread relief for borrowers defrauded  by Corinthian. And last week, these borrowers finally received some  long overdue relief. Seven years after they closed Corinthian, they  finally got relief from the student loans they incurred because of the  fraud of Corinthian Colleges.   In its largest student loan forgiveness action ever, the Education  Department recognized the rot that was at the core of Corinthian  Colleges and announced it was going to wipe out $5.8  [[Page S2806]]  billion in student loan debt owed by 560,000 borrowers who attended the  company's for-profit schools.   You see, the Federal Government was saying to the students: These  schools are OK. You can borrow Federal money going to these schools.   These students said, well, I couldn't get a Federal loan unless it  was a real college or university, and, in fact, they were wrong.   For former Corinthian students, this loan forgiveness means finally  their credit scores will start to get above sinking, fewer garnished  paychecks, and calls from collection agencies may just slow down. I  applaud Education Secretary Cardona and President Biden for their  leadership on this simple issue of justice.   This is the latest step the Biden administration has taken to ease  the crush of student loan debt.   The administration has used relief programs aimed at a variety of  borrowers, including public service workers and people with  disabilities. It also paused loan repayment during the pandemic.   President Biden reportedly is considering a broader student loan  forgiveness program that would benefit more borrowers, such a program-- if it is responsibly crafted--would be a boon not only to individual  borrowers and their families, but also to our economy. It would make it  possible for young people to finally restart their lives, buy a car,  maybe even a home, start a business, maybe even a family--the kinds of  investments that make America grow the right way.   I also believe we need to rethink the provisions in our Federal  bankruptcy laws that make student loan debt one of the few debts that  cannot be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings. If you declare  bankruptcy, you can basically be discharged from any obligation to pay  back your mortgage, even your mortgage on a second home, your car loan,  or even money that you borrowed for a boat. You can discharge all those  in bankruptcies, but you cannot discharge your student loan, in all  practical purposes.   Bankruptcy should be allowed to be used as a last resort for  borrowers who have no other place to turn. I expect to have more to say  about that in the near future.   America needs more trained nurses, doctors, teachers, engineers,  mechanics, and skilled professionals and trade workers than ever  before. It is in America's national and economic interest to make sure  that student loans are a prudent investment and to protect unsuspecting  students from unscrupulous organizations like these for-profit colleges  and universities.   We should have learned our lesson as a Nation.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley) is  necessarily absent.
