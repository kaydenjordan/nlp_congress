 Mr. Speaker, yesterday Congressman Brian Higgins and I  introduced H. Res. 441, legislation that would require a Congressional  Budget Office score before a floor vote. This resolution clearly  enshrines in House rules a fundamental and very simple principle of  good governance: namely, we should know the budgetary and practical  impact of legislation before we vote on it.   Frankly, Mr. Speaker, it should not be necessary for us to introduce  this legislation. For years, the CBO has been an important nonpartisan  player in crafting legislation and giving an independent assessment of  what a bill costs and whom it will benefit or whom it will hurt.   Unfortunately, we have seen House leadership rush major legislation  to the floor without a CBO score, preventing Members from knowing the  impact on their constituents and the budget before voting.   The most egregious example, of course, was the May 4 vote on the  TrumpCare bill that barely passed this Chamber and would strip 23  million Americans of healthcare. That bill was rushed to the House  floor before it had a CBO score, and Members voted blindly on it  without knowing the impact on their constituents.   Our resolution simply says transparency, accountability, and know  what is in the bill. No score, no floor; it's that simple.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  dangerous and divisive amendment that is the latest attempt to  criminalize the religious beliefs of Muslims in this country.   Let me remind my colleague from Arizona that our country was founded  on the principle of religious liberty, and the First Amendment  guarantees that right.   In calling for a strategic assessment, this amendment tramples on our  Constitution's separation of religion and State, singles out the Muslim  religion, its practices and leaders, and it does nothing to keep our  Nation safe. In fact, fear-mongering undermines trust and national  security, and pits neighbor against neighbor, community against  community, and is an insult to our American Muslim communities.   This amendment doesn't even apply its arbitrary surveillance equally,  because if it did, it would include assessments of White supremacist  terrorism or terrorism committed against abortion clinics and doctors.   Mr. Chairman, our fight against terrorism is not against any  religion. It is against the acts that are committed and those who  commit the acts. It violates our Constitution and runs counter to who  we are as a nation.   Frankly, it is horrifying, and I urge my colleagues to resoundingly  oppose it.
