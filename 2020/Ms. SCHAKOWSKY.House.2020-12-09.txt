 Mr. Speaker, I am Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. I  represent the Ninth Congressional District of Illinois, and I am here  on this auspicious day to stand up for the people of the Ninth  Congressional District who are suffering right now under this pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, we know that already we have seen the deaths of 286,000  people, rivaling the total number of people who have died in World War  II. We are at war with this virus. Fifteen-plus million Americans have  contracted this virus. But it is not only the suffering of people and  the families of people who have died and the people who have this  terrible disease, but it is also an issue for the rest of Americans who  are suffering right now.   Mr. Speaker, like every other Member of Congress, I am sure that you  are getting the calls that I am getting; people--adults--who are  weeping into the telephone and telling us about their fears, the  suffering that their families are facing, the loss of jobs.   A man called crying, saying, ``I can't pay my rent. I have lost my  job. I am so afraid that, along with my family, we are going to be out  on the street.''   A woman called somewhat embarrassed to tell us that she cannot put  food on the table for her children. We directed her to a food bank.  Think of that; in the richest country in the world, that she had to  rely on a food bank to be able to feed her family.   Mr. Speaker, in this country today, 1 out of 4 of our children is  considered--what we say--food insecure.   What does that mean?   It means that they don't know where their next meal is going to come  from. This is shameful.   People who are facing--the day after Christmas--losing their  unemployment benefits. In Illinois, that is half a million people.  Around the country, that is 16.4 million people who may be without any  source of sustenance.   Mr. Speaker, this is America. We need to save our people. So we need  to come to an agreement, and we need to come to it soon because people  are desperate right now.   Mr. Speaker, the things that we need to do:   Number one, I believe that we need to send a check to every family.  They need money in their pockets.   And where is that money going to go?   It is going to go right out into the community, helping all the small  businesses that we are so concerned about. That $1,200 check that  people got earlier in the year was a lifesaver, and we should do  something similar right now.   Mr. Speaker, we need to extend those unemployment insurance benefits.  Our economy actually was somewhat thriving when they were getting $600  a week to keep their families going. I am not necessarily asking for  that amount of money, but we should continue the unemployment insurance  benefits. Again, that money goes right out into the economy.   And then we have to end the idea of some sort of a liability shield.  In many ways, it is really a get-out-of-jail-free card for companies  that don't have to take care of their employees when they get sick.   Mr. Speaker, 48 million workers put their own lives in danger every  day and suit up and go out into the world taking care of our elderly,  working in hospitals, working in grocery stores, loading our shelves,  and taking our money when we leave. These people deserve help, and the  employer should not be freed from any kind of liability.   Mr. Speaker, we need the State and local money, and we need help for  small businesses. We can do that. We must do that.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I also thank Representative Guthrie, who  cosponsored this legislation with me, and also Chairman Pallone and  Chairman   Bobby Rush for their help in moving this bill forward.   This is a bipartisan bill that provides an important fix to an energy  conservation rule for ceiling fans that the Department of Energy  finalized in January 2017.   However, minor technical changes to the rule were needed in order to  prevent a major unintended consequence. Without this bill, some of the  most energy-efficient, large-diameter ceiling fans would have to be  taken off the market in the United States. So we fixed that.   The bill will also provide consistent labeling requirements for  residential ceiling fans and simplify the ENERGY STAR program. Both of  these changes will make it easier for Americans to choose the right  products for their homes. Representative Guthrie and I worked together  with ceiling fan manufacturers, the energy efficiency community, and  other stakeholders to clarify the standard. The Department of Energy  was consulted throughout the drafting process.   What pleases me really the most about this legislation is that it  highlights how we need legislation, big and small, to tackle the  climate crisis.   This bill also highlights how we can work together across the aisle  to enact commonsense policies that directly impact energy usage in  homes and save American families money on their energy bill at the same  time.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work together with my  Republican colleagues in the next Congress.
