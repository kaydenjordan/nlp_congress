 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the lives of Palm Springs  Police Officers Jose ``Gil'' Vega and Lesley Zerebny, who were  tragically shot and killed 1 year ago in the line of duty.   Officer Vega lived by the mantra of ``To Serve and Protect.'' He  served our community for nearly 35 years and was just 2 months away  from retirement when he was taken from his family and our community.   Officer Lesley Zerebny had recently returned to work following the  birth of her daughter, Cora. Now a year old, Cora will never hold her  mother. Lesley's community will always remember her as a fighter and a  protector.   This weekend, the entire Coachella Valley community will honor their  memory by dedicating a 4-mile stretch of Highway 111 in their honor. I  am proud of our community for supporting the Vega and Zerebny families.  Let's come together to ensure they have what they need to mourn,  recover, and prosper.   Officers Vega, Zerebny, and family: We honor you for your sacrifice,  and we are grateful for your service. Officer Vega and Officer Zerebny,  end of watch, October 8, 2016.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, like every physician, I took an oath to do no  harm and make every decision in the best interest of my patients in the  emergency department.   That oath drives every choice a doctor makes, whether it is  prescribing medications, treating chronic illnesses, and even choosing  how best to triage and treat a trauma patient. H.R. 36 would stand in  the way of a doctor's ability to best care for their patients. This  bill would force doctors to ignore the symptoms that they have learned  through years of training and practice that show a patient's condition  could become a more serious medical condition.   Can you imagine going into your doctor's office as a pregnant woman  and being told your twins would not live and that giving birth could  rupture your uterus, causing severe bleeding? That is what happened to  Phil and his wife from Missouri. They learned at week 21 that she was  at risk of a ruptured uterus and that the twins would die because of  twin-twin transfusion syndrome.   Phil said: ``Decisions about abortion need to be made with families  and the best medical information available.'' I couldn't agree more. A  physician's sole focus should be the health of their patient, not the  consequences of an arbitrary law that has no basis in medical evidence,  and no basis that this bill is even necessary or that it will improve  health outcomes.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The time of the gentleman  has expired.    Mr. Speaker, that is why, as a physician and a father, I  oppose this legislation. We need less bureaucratic obstacles that get  in the way of a doctor caring for their patients. We cannot interfere  with a provider's ability to deliver the best care for their patients.
