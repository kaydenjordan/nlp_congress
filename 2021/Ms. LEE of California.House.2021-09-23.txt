 Mr. Speaker, today, we will vote on my  amendment, Lee 41, to the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act to  reduce from this year's bill egregious Pentagon budget increases that  were added during the committee markup. Our amendment will reduce no  less than $25.5 billion  [[Page H5097]]  from the bill, trimming back the total level of FY22 NDAA to no more  than the amount requested by the President.   I want to thank my cosponsors, starting with Congresswoman Jacobs,  who was so kind to manage this amendment on the floor yesterday, for  her tremendous leadership. I also thank my co-chair of the Defense  Spending Reduction Caucus, Mr. Pocan, as well as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez for  working together to bring this amendment to the floor. I also thank  Chairman Smith and Mr. McGovern for their support in helping to make  this very important amendment in order.   The President's budget request is one of the largest in American  history. For years now, the United States has been peerless in its  military spending, exceeding the total spending of the next 11  countries combined. We have numerous glaring examples of waste, fraud,  and abuse within our defense establishment. Our 20-year experience in  Afghanistan is a stark example where the Special Inspector General for  Afghan Reconstruction identified billions of dollars--mind you,  billions of dollars--wasted or outright stolen over our time there. The  taxpayers deserve better.   Yet, Congress insists on piling more money into the Pentagon than our  military leaders even ask for, despite DOD routinely returning unspent  balances to the Treasury.   Enough is enough. Americans are demanding that Congress rebalance our  priorities and invest in the biggest challenges America faces. We face  imminent threats from the COVID pandemic, climate change, domestic  terrorism, growing economic inequality, and systemic racial and ethnic  inequities.   While I personally support a much larger reduction in Pentagon  spending, we need to draw the line somewhere. This amendment is a good  place to start. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, to send  the message that Congress won't endorse constant inflation of the  Pentagon budget.   Also, let me just cite amendment No. 40, offered again this year by  Mr. Pocan and myself, for a 10 percent cut. I thank our colleague, Ms.  Ocasio-Cortez, for her bold leadership and for managing this amendment  during the floor debate.   Mr. Speaker, the House stands again poised to pour three-quarters of  a trillion dollars into a defense establishment that is unauditable,  unaccountable, and does little to answer the biggest threats to the  safety and welfare of our people.   The Pentagon is the only Federal department that has never passed an  audit. I worked to get a requirement that DOD passes an audit written  into permanent law a couple of years ago, with the help of Chairman  Smith and my colleague, Dr. Burgess. Yet, still, the Pentagon says it  won't be able to pass an audit for almost another decade.   It is not hard to find places to cut at the Pentagon. Earlier this  year, a bipartisan group of organizations identified $80 billion in  savings that could be achieved just by implementing some efficiencies  and eliminating obsolete weapons, weapons like Cold War-era bombs and  missiles designed and built in the last century that are totally  unsuited for the challenges of this century.   We see tremendous costs of this runaway spending, not only in the  missing priorities, like public health, that are left unfunded, but in  a way of thinking that militarizes every single problem in our society  and turns peaceful protesters into targets for weapons of war.   Let me just say, this modest reduction that we are proposing, it  won't compromise our national security, and it won't take a dollar from  our troops. In fact, it will put more resources into enhancing the  quality of life for our troops. It will also allow us to reinvest in  healthcare, schools, and infrastructure.   This amendment will be a first step in rebalancing our priorities to  build a safe, peaceful, prosperous world at home and abroad. I urge my  colleagues to join me and to vote ``yes'' on this amendment. Let's  start shifting our budget back to things that matter for most of our  people.                            ____________________
