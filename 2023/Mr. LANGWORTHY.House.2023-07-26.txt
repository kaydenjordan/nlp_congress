 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4368, the  Agricultural Appropriations bill which stands as a beacon of hope for  our farmers, ranchers, and rural communities.   This bill represents a balanced approach to funding necessary  agencies and programs, and it also reclaims fiscal responsibility and  reins in the wasteful spending that has plagued our government for far  too long.   We, as stewards of the American people's resources, owe it to them to  utilize taxpayer dollars wisely and efficiently. One of the key aspects  of this bill is the redirection of billions from partisan bills that  contained Democrats' priorities, such as the Inflation Reduction Act.   By channeling these funds toward supporting America's producers and  rural communities, we demonstrate our commitment to the heart of our  Nation's economy: agriculture. Additionally, we recognize the need to  address the changing circumstances brought on by the pandemic.   The bill seeks to restrict the USDA Secretary's discretionary  spending authority on unauthorized, nonemergency programs. We must put  an end to wasteful Washington spending and hold our government  accountable for every dollar spent. It also seeks to kneecap the  bureaucracy in D.C. by empowering State and county offices.   By directing USDA hiring efforts to assist producers and rural  communities at the grassroots level, we acknowledge the importance of  local knowledge and understanding in addressing the unique challenges  that they face.   Moreover, the bill includes essential clawbacks of prior  appropriations, rescinding funds that were allocated for radical Green  New Deal initiatives and other programs that have been deemed  unconstitutional.   Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleagues that the fiscal year 2024  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies bill is not just about funding, but it is about our  values, our commitment to the American people, and our dedication to a  prosperous future for this great Nation.                                time  1045                           Supporting Our Veterans     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4366, the  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act, 2024.   This legislation reaffirms our commitment to serving those who have  served us so bravely, our military veterans.   I recently had the privilege of visiting the Bath, New York, VA  hospital in my district, in Steuben County, where I witnessed firsthand  the incredible dedication of the VA staff and the challenges they face  daily in providing the best possible care for our Nation's heroes.   There are clinics across my district that act as lifelines for our  veterans, offering crucial services that range from mental health care  to cancer  [[Page H3961]]  treatment and beyond. These facilities are responsible for serving  thousands of veterans and empowering them to heal, recover, and rebuild  their lives. They deserve our unwavering support, especially in their  darkest hours.   Mr. Speaker, we can agree that caring for our veterans is not a  partisan issue, and I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation and  secure the funds needed to uphold and strengthen our VA healthcare  programs. By investing in these programs, we invest in the well-being  of our veterans and their families and ensure they receive the highest  standard of care that they rightfully deserve.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, both fiscal year 2024 appropriations  bills we are considering this week will ensure that the Federal  Government fulfills one of its main duties outlined in the  Constitution, providing for the common defense of our Nation.   Until our Republican majority took over, this body neglected this  duty and failed to prepare our Nation for the threats posed by China  and Russia. Our Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies appropriations bill will provide our military with the  resources they need to succeed.   This funding will be focused on investments in the Pacific theater,  barracks, and other quality-of-life projects so that our men and women  in uniform will be ready to meet any challenge that they face.   Additionally, our agricultural appropriations bill will invest in  strengthening our supply chain, so we don't have to rely on foreign  adversaries for necessities like food and medications.   In passing both of these critical bills, we provide for the safety  and the prosperity of our great Nation for generations to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  for yielding me time to address the House today.   I rise today in support of keeping the promises made to our Nation's  veterans. Millions of men and women served this Nation in uniform  bravely, and they have been failed by the Department of Veterans  Affairs.   Too often, the VA has left veterans and their loved ones with long  delays, substandard service, and neglect. Now, rather than continue the  Trump administration's work to hold the VA accountable, the Biden  administration is instead focused on promoting divisive ideologies and  radical leftist priorities.   Mr. Speaker, the VA should be focused on the needs of our Nation's  veterans, not promoting a political agenda. The legislation before us  today puts the VA back on the task at hand, caring for the men and  women who gave their all for this country, like finally pushing the VA  to fix its electronic health record system, where patient safety issues  have been so dire that they have even resulted in several deaths.   Let me say that again. The inability of the VA to do its job has  resulted in injury and death to veterans. Sadly, this isn't the first  time we have heard of such negligence. We need to do better. We owe  better, and this bill will help accomplish this today.   I think I speak today for all the veterans in my district when I say  that they are sick and tired of indignities and substandard care due to  electronic records.   I strongly support the underlying legislation before us today, and I  hope my colleagues can overcome partisan outrage to stand with our  Nation's veterans.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Johnson for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as we consider H.R. 4368, the agriculture appropriations  bill, I will shed light on a critical issue that impacts the lives of  millions of Americans and has the potential to transform our rural  communities for the better, and that is expansion of rural broadband.   In an era defined by information and technology, access to reliable,  high-speed internet has become a fundamental necessity. It empowers  individuals, educates our youth, grows businesses, and connects us to  the world at large.   While urban areas have experienced the benefit of a connected world,  our rural communities have been left behind in the digital divide. Due  to the lack of adequate broadband infrastructure, these communities  face countless barriers to accessing the same opportunities and  resources as their urban counterparts.   By investing in rural broadband, we can bridge this divide and  unleash the full potential to our rural communities. It provides  economic empowerment by opening doors to new markets and allowing small  businesses in rural areas to thrive and compete globally. It encourages  innovation, creates new job opportunities, and revives local economies.   It also provides our children in rural areas who are often left  behind with new opportunities for education, and it enables lifelong  learning for adults, offering access to online courses and vocational  training.   As we saw during the pandemic, reliable internet will allow rural  residents to access essential telemedicine opportunities with their  doctors.   This is just a small picture of the life-changing effects of rural  broadband. It is not just a matter of convenience. It is an investment  in our collective future. It is a commitment to empowering all  Americans equally, regardless of where they live, with the tools that  they need to succeed in an increasingly interconnected world.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the fiscal year 24 agriculture  appropriations bill that includes these critical investments to take  rural development and rural broadband to the next level.
