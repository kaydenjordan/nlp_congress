 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  two students in my district, Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional  District, who have gone out of their way to better their communities  recently. After reading about their work, I felt that they deserved  this recognition.   Richard Clark is a student at Mount Aloysius College in Cresson,  Pennsylvania. Richard is an MBA student and decided to use a class  project opportunity, assignment, as an opportunity to help the Keystone  Regional Fire and Rescue Department. He helped the president of the  fire department write an application, a grant application, that  resulted in a $10,000 grant to benefit that organization and,  certainly, the citizens, families, and communities that that emergency  service organization serves.   Before serving in Congress, I spent nearly 30 years as a State- certified volunteer firefighter. It was an honor to serve my community,  and I know firsthand how big of a deal, how big of a difference those  funds can make in a small-town company in a rural area. Dave Fulton,  president of the fire company, said that the funds would be combined  with support from the county to purchase a new radio system.   Richard's professor, Dr. Leah Spangler offered high praise, saying:  ``I'm just so happy to have a student who is so invested in an  organization to really do this kind of work for them. It's so much more  than a grade for a class that you can do something so positive for the  community.''   I would like to thank Richard for his hard work, his dedication, and  his commitment to serving his community.   In Indiana, Pennsylvania, a 17-year-old named Lily Palfrey recently  reached the highest service level possible in 4-H by completing her  Diamond Clover project.   Lily's father, Sergeant Frank Palfrey, has spent more than 30 years  with the Army National Guard, serving as the inspiration for her  service project. She collected more than $9,000 in donations and sent  more than 150 boxes filled with personal care items to our National  Guard troops, our citizen warriors who are deployed overseas.   Accompanying her service project is a video called ``We Serve Too,''  a presentation that Lily developed through her church to share the  stories of military families.   Though she has fulfilled her service project obligation, Lily  continues to collect morale-boosting donations like board games,  snacks, and coffee.   I am encouraged by the kindness and the generosity of both Richard  and Lily. Thank you to these two for their spirit of service.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate National FFA Week.   FFA is a national leader in agricultural education, inspiring our  Nation's young people to pursue careers that help support a robust  rural economy.   Agriculture is rooted in American heritage, and our Nation's  producers provide the food, the fiber, and the energy that we all  depend on.   Agriculture is science. It is technology. It is innovation. And the  young men and women of the FFA are helping to shape the industry's  future.   Every time I see a distinctive blue FFA jacket, I am reminded of the  strong character and impressive leadership abilities that come along  with it. FFA leaders have gone on to become Ivy League graduates,  Federal court judges, innovative farmers, famous performance artists,  and even U.S. Presidents.   This week, we celebrate the important success of FFA, and we look  forward to what FFA leaders have in store for the future of rural  America.                            ____________________
