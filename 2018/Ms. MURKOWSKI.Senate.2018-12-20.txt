 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to recognize  a truly exceptional individual who has been a member of my staff for  many years. It is bittersweet to stand before you today to recognize  the well-deserved retirement of Connie McKenzie, of my Juneau, AK,  office.   Connie isn't originally from Alaska, but you would never know it. She  moved to our great State in the summer of 1987 to take a seasonal job  in Skagway with a cruise ship tour company, but those few weeks in the  Alaskan summer soon turned into a home. She has been in Alaska ever  since, and that summer job quickly turned into a successful career in  the tourism industry in southeast Alaska, giving Connie the opportunity  to work closely with community members, interact with local businesses  and to help grow the regional economy. She is a people person to her  core and someone we all quickly relate to, a valuable trait for any  career.  [[Page S7985]]    Connie soon gained a reputation as someone to go to when you needed  something done. She is a problem-solver who doesn't know the word no.  From the beginning, her ability to find solutions, showcase her region,  and quickly develop professional contacts made her a well-respected  member of the community. For more than 20 years, she has been a  dedicated volunteer and officer of local and statewide political  groups, including the Capital City Republican Women, district cochair,  and the Republican State Central Committee. She has been active in Beta  Sigma Phi and a variety of community service projects.   Connie's local involvement eventually opened doors for a new career,  one in public service. In 2001, Connie began working for the Alaska  Congressional Delegation. She first started working for Congressman  Young, now the Dean of the House. She was a natural fit and soon was  running a joint office for the entire congressional delegation. It was  my good fortune to join the U.S. Senate with a seasoned staff member  like Connie. Her regional knowledge and work experience have, no doubt,  helped me represent the unique needs of Alaskans, particularly those in  southeast.   After serving in this role for many years, Connie left the office in  2013 to work for the State administration under then-Governor Sean  Parnell, but she just couldn't stay away, nor could we last too long  without her. Thankfully, in 2015, she came back to us and has served  our Juneau office in service to Senator Sullivan and me. She has been a  dedicated public servant, and I know I speak on behalf of so many  Alaskans when I say we will be sad to see her go.   Congressman Young said of Connie that she ``is one of the rare gems  that comes along rarely in a Congressional career. From the moment I  hired her she has been the embodiment of a perfect staff. She is the  person who the people of Southeast Alaska have come to rely upon for  sound policy advice, every kind of constituent service and has gone  above the call of duty to serve as a counselor for the mentally ill and  homeless population. She faced any challenge with a positive demeanor,  rock solid ethics and made it all look easy. Her guidance to me has  been a godsend and a large part of my own success in not only Southeast  Alaska but statewide. Whether employed directly by me, the  Congressional delegation or any other entity, Connie has always been a  stalwart supporter, volunteer and overall great person. Connie, we will  sorely miss you!'' I couldn't agree more with Don's words.   Connie has done a great job representing the Alaska Congressional  Delegation. She brings new meaning to the term professional. Regardless  of what side of the political spectrum you are on, you know you will  get a straight and fair answer from Connie. Constituents appreciate her  work, other elected officials are comfortable working with her, and the  office staff is always asking for and depending on her expertise. In my  office, she is our informal office trainer. If you want to know how to  do something, Connie is the one to ask. She has provided hundreds of  Alaskans with casework assistance on nearly the same amount of issues,  from taxes to immigration to forest management, you name it. Connie has  handled it.   People that work with Connie will always find a brilliant, caring  person that demonstrates a good sense of comradery and teamwork. This  is what her colleagues and friends say about her, and I couldn't say it  better myself.   Connie's departure will certainly create a loss for me and my team,  but I know Connie won't be at a loss for things to do. She is an avid  outdoors woman, enjoying skiing, hiking, and biking with her husband  Mitch and dog Brodie whenever possible. No hill is too steep, no trail  is too long, she tackles each adventure with enthusiasm and a deep love  for the outdoors.   Often when I would travel to her region, Connie somehow found time in  my otherwise packed schedule to fit constituent meetings into a hike  through the Tongass or some other outdoor adventure, giving us a chance  to fill our lungs with fresh air while we worked. I will miss those  hikes together, but now, I will just have to schedule them with her  rather than the other way around.   Connie may be retiring from her career of public service, but I have  no doubt she will continue to remain engaged in her community. It is in  her blood. Connie leaves behind a legacy of hard work, humor, and  commitment to Alaska that will forever be remembered. I wish her all  the best in the next chapter of her life. Connie; I'll see you on the  trails.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on December 2, 2018, Bettye  Davis, a former Alaska legislator and community leader, passed away at  the age of 80. The passing of Bettye Davis attracted national media  attention, which is unusual, when an Alaska legislator passes. Bettye  Davis was not only a historic figure in the State of Alaska, but also  in the broader African-American community. She was the first African- American to be elected to the Alaska State Senate.   Bettye Davis was born in Homer, LA, and graduated from high school in  Bernice, LA. She earned her bachelor's degree in social work in 1972  from Grambling, one of America's great Historically Black Colleges and  Universities. She also held a certificate in nursing from St. Anthony's  College.   Bettye's husband, Troy, was transferred to Alaska by the Air Force.  Bettye came along. She recalled no way did she ever intend to live in  Alaska, but when she arrived, she discovered that she loved the land,  she loved the people, and the people of Alaska welcomed her. That was  45 years ago, and it led Bettye to conclude that Alaska was her home.  She often analogized her story to that of Ruth in the Bible--arriving  in a foreign land, accepting the people, finding acceptance, and  committing her life to serve the people of her new homeland.   Bettye began a brilliant career in her adopted home State as a State  civil servant. It began as a nurse at the Alaska Psychiatric Institute  and subsequently as a social worker for the Alaska Department of Health  and Social Services, retiring in 1986.   She served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1990-1996 and  then in the Alaska Senate from 2001-2013. Bettye served as both  majority whip and minority whip during her time in the Alaska House.  She was the first African-American woman to serve in the Alaska House  of Representatives.   In between her periods of State legislative service, Bettye served on  the Alaska State Board of Education, which she chaired from 1998-1999.   Although she was defeated in a reelection bid to the Alaska Senate,  her public service career continued on. Bettye joined the Anchorage  School Board where she served from 2013 until 2018, when she resigned  to attend to health issues. This was her third stint on the Anchorage  School Board. Altogether, she served 11 years on the school board.   Her community engagements were many and varied. She was a proud and  active member of the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church, the NAACP, the  Alaska Black Leadership Conference, Common Ground, the League of Women  Voters, Delta Sigma Theta, and the Zonta Club of Anchorage. She was  inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame.   In her induction speech, Bettye said she wanted to be remembered as  someone who fought a good fight, did good work, and won the battle.  Every day, she got up with a mission of doing something for somebody,  somebody who couldn't speak for themselves, somebody who couldn't  express themselves, somebody who just needed a kind word.   Bettye Davis was all of that and more to the people of Alaska.  Friends described her as a fortress, a champion for Alaska's children  and the poor, a shining example of the best of politics, and the  conscience of the legislature.   It is with great sadness that we acknowledge the loss of this  exceptional Alaska public servant on the floor of the U.S. Senate.  While her voice will be sorely missed, her legacy of leadership sets an  example for generations of Alaska leaders to come. On behalf of my  Senate colleagues, I extend my condolences to Bettye's surviving family  and all of her friends and colleagues who hold Bettye's memory  dear.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the  50th anniversary of the Community Health Aides in the State of Alaska.   All across rural Alaska, there are women and men who devote their  time and energy to ensure their communities remain healthy, have  sufficient care, and provide basic health education. These are our  Community Health Aides, working each and every day with all ages.   As a result of lack of access to healthcare in rural Alaska, the  Community Health Aide Program, CHAP, was developed. Since 1968, CHAP  has received congressional funding and recognition for the tremendous  work they do. This program has allowed for a greater relationship  between the State and Federal Government, as they coordinate with many  of our Tribal health organizations, such as the Alaska Native Tribal  Health Consortium.   Alaska has seen outbreaks of tuberculosis, high incidence of infant  mortality, and high rates of serious injuries that simply could have  been prevented had there been specific community leaders whose role was  to educate and provide for the community's health needs.   Currently, there are approximately 550 Community Health Aides and  Practitioners, CHA/Ps, in more than 170 rural communities across  Alaska. CHA/Ps are truly the people on the frontlines providing  firsthand treatment and serving as the link to primary care providers,  regional hospitals, and specifically the Alaska Native Medical Center  in Anchorage. For those times that the patients cannot travel, the CHA/ Ps will coordinate specialized nurses and practitioners to visit their  village quickly and efficiently.   CHA/Ps receive ongoing training and education, following their  initial 3 to 4-week training period. There are four training centers in  Alaska--Anchorage, Bethel, Nome, and Sitka--and it is at these centers  where they receive the skills necessary to ensure the highest quality  care is administered in rural regions of Alaska. This is a critical  role in our communities. I am grateful for the CHAP program and for the  men and women who are changing the outcomes of many Alaskans' lives  each and every day.   In this 50th year, Alaskans in communities across the State, from  Nuiqsut, Ester, Klawock, Illiamna, to Dutch Harbor, have taken time to  celebrate their valued community health providers, giving them the  honor they surely deserve.   Thank you.                            ____________________
