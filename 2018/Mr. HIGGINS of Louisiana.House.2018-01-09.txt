 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 4564) to require a threat assessment on current  foreign terrorist fighter activities, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4564         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Post-Caliphate Threat       Assessment Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. THREAT ASSESSMENT.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security, in       coordination with the Secretary of State and Director of       National Intelligence, shall conduct a threat assessment of       current foreign terrorist fighter activities. Such assessment       shall include the following:        (1) A detailed summary of current foreign terrorist fighter       travel and trends, including countries of origin, travel       destinations, and means of travel.        (2) An analysis of any country or region with a significant       increase in foreign terrorist fighter activity.        (3) An analysis of foreign terrorist fighter travel trends       in and out of Iraq and Syria.        (b) Congressional Communication.--Not later than 180 days       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of       Homeland Security shall report to the Committee on Homeland       Security, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Relations, and       the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate on the       threat assessment required under subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to offer for consideration H.R. 4564, the  Post-Caliphate Threat Assessment Act of 2017, for House consideration.   The Homeland Security Committee's Task Force on Denying Terrorist  Entry into the United States, which I am a member of, spent the last  year taking a deeper look at how terrorist organizations and lone-wolf  attackers are entering the nations they are targeting. One of the most  concerning issues that the task force learned is that an estimated  40,000 foreign fighters traveled to ISIS-occupied territories to join a  force of over 100,000 radical Islamic terrorists.   Through major victories by anti-ISIS forces, the Islamic State's  self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria has been mostly defeated as a  whole, driving these terrorists into hiding. Many thousands of these  battle-trained jihadists are now unidentified and their location is  unknown. The United States is a primary target.   Of particular concern for the United States are those fighters  seeking to return to Europe or the U.S. These fighters may seek to  exploit direct flights to the United States as well as the Visa Waiver  Program.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is about ensuring that we have the best  possible data to defeat this threat. Specifically, my bill would direct  the Secretary of DHS, in coordination with the Secretary of State and  Director of National Intelligence, to conduct a threat assessment of  current foreign terrorist fighter activity and report their findings to  Congress. It would also ensure that Congress and the Executive gain  better clarity on foreign terrorist travel and trends post-caliphate,  which will strengthen our defenses as the diaspora unfolds.   Before closing, I would like to thank task force Chairman Gallagher,  Representative Katko, committee Chairman McCaul, bipartisan members of  the Homeland Security Committee, and other members of the task force  and their staffs for the hard work put in over the last year to make  the report we issued this past December a reality.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of  this commonsense legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
