 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Charles William Steger,  Jr., along with Rob Wittman, who is an alumnus of Virginia Tech.  Unfortunately, Virginia Tech President Emeritus Charles William Steger,  Jr., passed away last night at the age of 70. He was a Hokie through  and through, and he guided the university to great achievements.   He earned three degrees himself from Virginia Tech, and before  becoming president, he taught and held numerous posts. As president of  Virginia Tech from 2000 to 2014, Dr. Steger led the university to new  heights. He presided over growth and enrollment. Forty major new  buildings were constructed. Research expenditures grew from $192  million to $450 million. He established the school of biomedical  engineering and helped bring together the Virginia Tech Carilion School  of Medicine and Research Institute.   He also had the burden of leading Virginia Tech through the shooting  on that horrific April day in 2007. In the aftermath, he led with  remarkable dignity. He received many honors during his lifetime, and I,  along with many in Virginia and across this Nation, held Dr. Charles  William Steger, Jr., in the highest esteem.   He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Janet; his son, Christopher  Steger, and wife, Elizabeth Schumann; and his son, David Steger, and  fiance, Alison Nemeth.   Mr. Speaker, if we could all pray a prayer tonight for the family of  Charles Steger.                            ____________________
