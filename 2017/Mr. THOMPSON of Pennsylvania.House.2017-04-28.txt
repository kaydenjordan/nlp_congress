 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  acknowledge the good work of the State College Area Food Bank in Centre  County, Pennsylvania. In 1982, the food bank opened in the basement of  the St. Andrew's Episcopal Church as a temporary solution to a  temporary need. As the need continued, so did the food bank. Today, it  has a permanent home in a large facility on South Atherton Street.   The need is great, and the statistics are alarming. Nearly 15 percent  of Centre County's population lived in food-insecure homes in 2015--the  highest in the Commonwealth. It means that more than 22,000 individuals  lack regular access to adequate food. Thankfully, the food bank is  filling a void in the community. In 2016, it distributed more than  400,000 pounds of food and fed nearly 1,700 individuals.   I rise today as the chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on  Nutrition but also as a proud citizen of Centre County. The food bank  hopes that one day no one will go hungry in Centre County. Thankfully,  it is working every day to realize that goal.                            ____________________
