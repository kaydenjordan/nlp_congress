 Madam Speaker, the Women's Health Protection Act (H.R.  3755)--otherwise known as the Abortion on Demand Act--is an extreme  measure that would impose abortion on demand nationwide, at any stage  of pregnancy, through federal statute. This would result in the  elimination of every state's pro-life laws and protections. Overriding  state pro-life laws and prohibiting states from enacting legislation  protecting unborn children would make protections for babies with Down  syndrome and other disabilities illegal. Plain and simple, this  legislation is extreme.   This legislation is radically out of step with the American public,  who do not support abortions with no limits. According to the  Associated Press, 80 percent of Americans say abortion should be  illegal in the third trimester.   This bill would create a national standard to allow for abortions of  unborn children for any reason and at any stage of pregnancy up until  birth. A better and more accurate name for this bill would be the  Abortion on Demand until Birth Act--because it is clear the focus of  this bill is not protecting women's health like the current name  suggests.   Abortion ends the life of a whole, separate, unique, living human  being. Tragically, abortion continues to put women in danger, takes the  life of innocent children, and fails to recognize the dignity of all  lives, regardless of how small. I adamantly oppose this legislation and  any legislation that fails to protect the unborn.
