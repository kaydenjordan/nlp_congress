 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the JOBS  and Investor Confidence Act of 2018, which is comprised of 32 pieces of  legislation that have passed the committee or the House this Congress  with wide bipartisan support.   As a small business owner, I know how suffocating Big Government can  be for the little guy. The fact is small businesses makes up 90 percent  of American companies and employ almost half of our workforce. We need  to fight for them.   In order for the United States to compete with the global market, we  must continue to sustain long-term economic growth, and that starts  with the passage of the JOBS and Investors Confidence Act of 2018.   I am proud to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in  support of this bipartisan legislation, and I am looking forward to the  Senate passing this package quickly. Quite simply, business is good.   In God we trust.
