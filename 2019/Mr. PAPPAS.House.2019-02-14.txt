 Mr. Speaker, recently I spent the day in the Mount  Washington Valley, with local businesses, hearing from small business  owners about the challenges that they face.   I met with the owners of White Mountain Puzzles, a second-generation  family business that produces 1.6 million made-in-the-U.S. puzzles a  year and sells them all over the world.   Later in the day, I stopped by Lupine Pet, another terrific locally  owned business that sells durable pet collars and harnesses.   Mr. Speaker, in keeping with our proud Live Free or Die tradition in  the Granite State, we pay no sales taxes on goods and services.   White Mountain Puzzles and Lupine Pet are just two of the many small  businesses that have thrived under the rules of the road of our State's  economy. Unfortunately, a recent Supreme Court decision is casting a  dark shadow over these entrepreneurs. It is threatening those who have  brick-and-mortar operations in our State and make a living from online  sales to customers across the street and around the world.   Mr. Speaker, in June of 2018, the Supreme Court upended decades of  precedent. In its decision in the Wayfair case, the Court ruled that a  jurisdiction may legally impose sales taxes on customers of sellers  that don't have a physical presence within that jurisdiction's borders.   Unfortunately, States across the country are now rushing to  capitalize on this new taxing power, to the detriment of businesses in  New Hampshire that don't impose sales taxes on consumers and aren't  prepared to collect them.   Ultimately, the Wayfair decision could force untold numbers of small  retailers in my State to stop doing business altogether over the  internet. That is a possibility that should alarm every American.   We should be empowering entrepreneurs and innovators, the true  driving force of the American economy, not stifling them with  burdensome tax collection requirements.   Here is the bottom line, Mr. Speaker: Businesses in my district  should not be punished simply for using the internet to reach their  customer base.   Clearly, the time has come for Congress to act, and there are  commonsense steps that Members of both parties should embrace,  regardless of the tax laws in the States that we represent.    First and foremost, we should prevent sales taxes from being imposed  retroactively, and we should give businesses enough time to understand  this Court decision. As a business owner myself, I can tell you how  unreasonable it is to expect companies to somehow meet this new tax  collection obligation at the drop of a hat, a financial burden that  they couldn't possibly have anticipated.   Second, given the high cost and complexity of complying with  different sales tax laws in nearly 11,000 jurisdictions, we should  create an exception to collection requirements for these small  businesses.   The great folks at White Mountain Puzzles have a special talent for  creating incredible jigsaw puzzles, not for navigating complex unique  sales tax rules from every State and municipality in America.   Dave and Scott at Lupine Pet don't have a legal department or a big  team of accountants to assist them in collecting and remitting the  right amounts. And they say the cost of compliance, including the  software solution for their small business, adds up to at least $25,000  a year.   Let's give them and millions of other small business owners a well- deserved break. Let's give them the protections that they deserve.                                time  1015    Mr. Speaker, e-commerce is an American success story. Online sales  have created millions of jobs and connect Americans from coast to  coast.   Internet retailers give rural America the opportunity to participate  more fully in our country's economic success.   Let's give these online sellers, including hundreds of small  businesses in the Granite State, the support and certainty they deserve  to continue to grow and prosper.
