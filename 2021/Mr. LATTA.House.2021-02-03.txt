 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding,  and I want to thank the gentleman for his decades of support for life  and the unborn in this country and for everything he has done. Thank  you very much.   Since 1973, more than 62 million innocent unborn babies' lives have  been taken by abortion in this country. Tragically, abortion continues  to put women in danger, takes the life of an innocent child, and fails  to recognize the dignity of all lives, regardless of how small.   In 2017 alone, there were roughly 860,000 abortions in the United  States. That number is far greater than the population of the district  I represent, Ohio's Fifth Congressional District.   While the overall abortion rate is decreasing, the rate of using  chemical abortion is going up, accounting for roughly 39 percent of  procedures that year.   I am proud that my legislation, the SAVE Moms and Babies Act, would  recognize chemical abortions for what it is: dangerous.   Thankfully, there is still reason for hope. Three-quarters of  Americans, including a majority of whom identify as pro-choice, want  significant restrictions on abortion. This is most certainly thanks to  the growing pro-life movement advocating for the protection of the  unborn children who deserve the dignity of life. Without the right to  life, we truly have no other right.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and, again, for all  of his work.
