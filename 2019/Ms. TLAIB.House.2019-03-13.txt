 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the subject of the Special Order  today.    Madam Speaker, I am honored to co-chair this Special Order  for the Congressional Progressive Caucus with my amazing colleague from  California, Katie Porter.   This is a privilege for me to be able to work with so many of my  colleagues on the issues that they are very passionate about, from  healthcare to environmental justice to LGBTQ rights. It has been an  honor to lead this and to be part of this.   Today, we are talking about an important, important issue to one of  my colleagues whom I have known for over 15 years as a community  organizer and, later, as an immigration rights attorney working on  civil rights issues. It is an honor to introduce my colleague from the  State of Washington, the leader on healthcare for all, our wonderful,  great colleague, Representative Pramila Jayapal.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, that was incredible. And obviously, many of  us in the Congressional Progressive Caucus have fully supported so much  of what Medicare for All stands for. I thank the gentlewoman from  Washington for her leadership and courage for taking on such a bold  move.   Madam Speaker, I am very honored to be here representing the  community that raised me. I was raised in Southwest Detroit, in the  13th Congressional District. Growing up in Southwest Detroit, I  actually thought that smell was normal, all the pollution that I kind  of grew up in, all the truck traffic. As I got older, I realized it  wasn't normal. It wasn't normal that so many of my neighbors were  getting cancer or had respiratory issues. It wasn't normal that one of  five children have asthma.   We have one of the highest--one of the worst air qualities in the  State of Michigan in the 13th Congressional District; and it is the  third poorest Congressional District in the country.   So the deadly consequences of being uninsured is real for my  constituents at home; through no fault of their own, but for the fact  that they live in communities that are polluted and communities that  lack so much opportunity to be able to thrive.   So this is an important issue, not only to millions of Americans  today, but to my residents; this need for universal healthcare. It is a  topic that most, if not all of us in this Chamber were sent here to  work on. It is a topic that is always on the minds of our residents  every single day. It is a topic that is literally a life or death  situation, and an issue that has bankrupted many of our families; an  issue that we should not be worried about in this country.   We are the richest country on the planet, but the United States is  the only industrialized country without universal healthcare.   Fifty thousand residents in my district are uninsured. This is why I  am thrilled and excited that over 100 of my colleagues have signed on  to sponsor the Medicare for All Act.   More than 30 million Americans are without access to healthcare right  now without insurance, with an additional 40 million who cannot afford  co-pays and the deductible.   Pharmaceutical companies make billions, Madam Speaker, in profits,  while working Americans are forced to go through extraordinary measures  to pay for care.   Just the other day, I heard a mother talk about losing her 6-year-old  child, her little girl, because she couldn't afford insulin. This is  why we need something bold, courageous, transformational, and that is  supporting Medicare for All.   We spend the highest amount per capita in the world on healthcare. We  need a better system for our constituents. We need Medicare for All.   This system is one that many more of my colleagues should get behind.  It provides a system where our constituents will know that they are  secure and getting healthcare that they need today. This is a system  that will take away the worry of our constituents who have constant,  day-in, day-out thinking about the cost of healthcare, and whether or  not their current insurance even covers it.   It is really important to be clear about Medicare for All. One, it  includes comprehensive coverage for primary care, for hospital,  outpatient services, prescription drugs, reproductive health services,  newborn care, long-term care services. This is so critical for my  residents.   Constantly do I hear, day-in, day-out of families that are taking  care of their parents and not having access to long-term care coverage.   It supports mental health and substance abuse treatment, laboratory  and diagnostic services, and so much more.   Patients will have complete freedom to choose their doctors. I am  going to say this again. Patients will have complete freedom, under the  Medicare for All Act, to choose their doctors, hospitals, and other  providers that they wish to see.   Long-term care, again, in support for our older Americans, our  neighbors, and those with disabilities, will be covered.   Medicare for All will decrease the costs by reducing inefficiency;  preventing healthcare corporations from overcharging; and increasing  transparency in our system.   Medicare for All will also decrease prescription drug costs by  allowing Medicare to finally negotiate our prices.    The legislation also preserves healthcare programs for our veterans  and our Native Americans.   Healthcare is a right, Madam Speaker, not a privilege for the  wealthy.   And not only is this the most incredible class, and not because I am  part of it, but it really is, it is the largest incoming class since  Watergate but, more importantly, it is the most diverse.   We not only ran because we wanted to be first, or we wanted to be  diverse, we ran because we speak differently; we serve differently; and  we are much more courageous than, I think, previous classes ever have  been.   So, I am asking our colleagues to please stand up and support  Medicare for All. Give it a chance. See the possibility of finally  being able to provide for our constituents' universal healthcare.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
