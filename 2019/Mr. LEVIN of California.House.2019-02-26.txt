 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark a  monumental occasion for this Chamber. For the first time in decades,  this body will take up major legislation to address the epidemic of gun  violence in this country. I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 8, bipartisan  legislation to require a background check on every gun sale or  transfer.   I know the vast majority of my constituents support this step,  including Renae Greg, a woman from Carlsbad, who was simply trying to  enjoy a country concert when she was forced to dodge bullets at a Las  Vegas shooting.   I know that Lonna Leghart, a constituent from Vista, supports this  commonsense legislation. Her sister Kimberly, tragically, lost her life  as a result of gun violence in my district.   It is on their behalf and on behalf of all Americans who are impacted  by daily gun violence in this country that I will support H.R. 8, and I  hope all of my colleagues will stand with us.   There is so much more that we need to do to fully address the  epidemic of gun violence, but today it is a huge step for Renae, Lonna,  and families across this country.                            ____________________
