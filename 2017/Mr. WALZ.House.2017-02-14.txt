 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from El Paso.   I very much appreciate, always, the story and the passion that you  have for that great community and look at the leadership that comes out  of there. I certainly know in your work for veterans your name will be  added to that list. The passion, the willingness to solve problems, the  willingness to find and make the tough choices to fulfill this Nation's  commitment to our veterans is something I am just proud to serve  alongside you.   I would echo the gentleman's comments, having the opportunity today  to witness the swearing in of Dr. David Shulkin as our next VA  Secretary, being there with Vice President Pence along with Senators  Isakson and Tester on the Senate side and Dr. Roe, of whom you spoke  very accurately, Mr. O'Rourke--a true gentleman, an impassioned  advocate for veterans, and a no-nonsense legislator, exactly what we  need.                                time  1930    You just have to watch the sense of can-do spirit up there and see  Dr. Shulkin and his family--with young children--and the sacrifice that  goes into public service. This is a gentleman who could make far more  money and probably have a lot less headaches if he would continue to  serve in the private sector. He chose not to do that for all the right  reasons.   I think it probably brings us to the message that Mr. O'Rourke is  delivering. This is something that unites this country more than  anything else: the care and service to our veterans.   It doesn't matter your political persuasion, it doesn't matter where  you fall on the spectrum, it doesn't matter what you necessarily think  of the wars or the conflicts that we are engaged in, but the care for  those veterans is something that my folks in Mankato, Minnesota, your  folks in El Paso, folks in Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Seattle, and  every small town in between want us to get right. They want us to use  the data to deliver the benefits that were earned. They want us to get  it right to show that this Nation's commitment is not something that is  fleeting or comes and goes. I think most people understand this is a  complex issue.   Again, I was reading recently--to put this into perspective--when  they make this promise, when they raise their hand to serve this  Nation, they are in it for the long haul. The Veterans Benefits  Administration is still paying out $73 a month to the daughter of a  Civil War veteran. 152 two years after the end of that conflict, this  Nation still needs to keep its commitment.   So, when you go to war, it comes with a long tail attached to it.  That long tail attached is doing what President Lincoln asked us to do:  care for those who bore the battle, their widow, and their orphan.   I think it is within that spirit that I would encourage our  constituents, Mr. Speaker, to take an eye and look at what is happening  with veterans' issues. When they don't believe anything can work, and  they believe everything up here is a fight and that we couldn't agree  it is Tuesday today, that is simply not the case. We have good, smart  people working for solutions to difficult problems who are in the best  interest of this Nation, the best interest of our veterans, and the  best interest of taxpayers.   I would encourage people not to make rash generalizations. When  people say, Oh, nothing works in the VA, that is not true. Many things  work in the VA, and many things work very well. But when they don't,  that is an abject failure. When one veteran is left behind or a  situation like Phoenix arises, no, that is not good enough, and we can  do better.   But we have an attitude that we don't need to keep this commitment to  the VA, that we don't need to do that, or somehow that we are not  already using our resources in the private sector. The gentleman, I am  sure, will talk about it, but last year, 31 percent of all healthcare  needs were delivered in the private sector in fee-for-service.   When that makes sense, when it is most efficient, when it is most  convenient for the veteran, we should deliver that, but with an  understanding the VA has a core mission to do research into extremity  injuries or things that would not happen, outside of industrial  accidents or war. The VA needs to be there. The VA needs to be there to  train physicians. The VA needs to be there to make sure we keep that  accountability, instead of telling a veteran: You are just on your on.  Good luck getting your care.   It is in that spirit that I, too, am hopeful. I think it needs to be  said to our constituents, Mr. Speaker, and it goes through  administration after administration, whether you like the  administration or not, the commitment to veterans has to be there.   They have got some of it right; they have got some of it wrong. I  think there is a responsibility that, in the first choice of this  administration in dealing with veterans, I believe they might have  picked the one person in this country best suited to do the job for  veterans. That says a lot.   I think it is important to stress that point, understanding that that  Secretary can't do it alone. Congress writes the laws. This House  authorizes the money to make that happen. We have oversight  responsibility, and we have partners in our veterans service  organizations who are there to help, whether it be the American Legion,  whether it be the VFW, the DAV, the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.  These are all folks out there who want to keep that commitment to want  to help.   The gentleman spoke true, and he spoke true from the heart that, at  that one time, people may not have seen service on the VA Committee as  something as a prize position. The folks who have found themselves  there are committed to this, above everything. They are committed to it  above party. They are committed above their own personal advancement.  On both sides of the aisle, there is a camaraderie that is rarely seen  in the press, that is rarely seen by the general public about getting  this right.   I think there is much that can be restored. If anything, I oftentimes  say how we conduct ourselves in this people's House of Representatives  must be a direct reflection on the sacrifice that gives us the right to  self govern.   Those who paid the ultimate sacrifice were doing it so that citizens  could elect their Representatives to debate the issues of the day in a  free and open democracy. So just the exercise tonight of having the  opportunity and the privilege to share a little of the floor was given  to us at great sacrifice. We need to conduct ourselves in a bipartisan,  results-oriented manner that honors that commitment.   I thank the gentleman from El Paso and look forward to his leadership  as our ranking member on subcommittees that are coming up on issues  that will affect employees at the VA and delivery of care. I know they  are in good hands. As I say it again, I love the stories of El Paso  from such an impassioned son of El Paso. I think your constituents  should be proud you are there.
