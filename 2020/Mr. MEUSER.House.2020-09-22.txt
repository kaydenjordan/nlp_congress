 Madam Speaker, those who are placed in positions of  leadership, particularly those elected by the people, have a  responsibility to put their short-term interests aside for the greater  collective good.   We have a problem in America with violence in our streets,  destruction of property, and hateful rhetoric toward police and  innocent bystanders every day. As a result, people are fleeing our  cities in droves, yet many so-called leaders have tacitly condoned the  destruction with phrases like: ``People will do what they do,'' and,  ``There needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there is  unrest in our lives.'' ``No justice, no peace.'' We have all heard it.   If such indirect encouragement is not bad enough, continued silence  from certain leaders may be even worse.   The idea that, after an assassination attempt of two sheriffs in  California, the former attorney general, the top cop, and current  Senator of the State remaining silent on this issue is outrageous.   Just this week, as a response to the President's constitutional duty  to nominate a Supreme Court Justice, the far left immediately stated:  ``Let this moment radicalize you.'' They later stated: ``Nothing is off  the table.'' Just now, it was stated: ``Do so at your peril.'' That is  a threat. This incites lawlessness and has nothing to do with national  unity.   We can disagree on policy, but now, more than ever, we need new  leaders who aspire to follow in the heroic footsteps of Martin Luther  King and call out those who fail to do so.                            ____________________
