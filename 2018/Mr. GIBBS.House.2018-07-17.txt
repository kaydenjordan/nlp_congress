 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation that provides funding for programs vital to the  environmental and economic health of my home State of Ohio and the  entire Great Lakes region. This appropriations bill includes full  funding, $300 million, for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.                                time  1245    The GLRI is an important program focusing on critical environmental  restoration projects, such as improving water quality, fighting  invasive species, and repairing native habitats for wildlife.   The Great Lakes region supports over $200 billion in economic  activity and is the world's largest source of fresh water. Restoring  and preserving the Great Lakes is good for our environment and good for  the thousands of Ohioans whose livelihoods depend on a clean Lake Erie.   Additionally, the bill repeals the burdensome Obama-era waters of the  United States rule, a bureaucratic overreach that expands EPA  jurisdiction beyond congressional intent and in contradiction of court  rulings.   When the Obama administration announced this rule, I heard from  farmers, ranchers, local and State governments, homeowners, and private  property rights advocates. All agreed the Obama administration went too  far, creating confusion and uncertainty about what would and would not  fall under EPA jurisdiction. By repealing the flawed 2015 WOTUS rule,  we are committing to work with State environmental agencies as partners  in protecting our Nation's natural resources, rather than as  adversaries.   Finally, this appropriations bill maintains funding for the Clean  Water State Revolving Fund, a valuable tool for State and local  agencies to finance projects to ensure our municipalities have access  to clean and affordable water.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the rule and  passage of the legislation to keep the Great Lakes healthy and continue  to improve our Nation's water quality.
