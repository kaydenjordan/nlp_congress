 Mr. Speaker, the Chinese Communist Party's aggression and  malign conduct grows more severe each day. The CCP's malfeasance  allowed the COVID-19 outbreak to become a global pandemic, causing  untold economic destruction. They conduct militarized territorial  aggression against most countries that border China. The CCP is  pioneering a new form of colonialism, degrading the sovereignty of  developing nations through debt and corruption, extracting resources  and military outposts. They have orchestrated the largest transfer of  wealth in human history  [[Page H3804]]  through state-directed economic espionage against the United States and  other advanced economies. And the CCP is responsible for the gravest  human rights atrocities occurring in the 21st century. The evidence is  manifest that the malign influence of the CCP is the greatest United  States foreign policy challenge of this generation. It affects every  one of our states and districts, a fact that was underscored this week  by the closure of China's Houston consulate in response to multiple  instances of economic espionage. We must sustain U.S. resources to  counter this threat, so I am grateful that my amendment has been  included in a bipartisan en bloc package for H.R. 7608, the Fiscal Year  2021 State, Foreign Operations, Agriculture, Rural Development,  Interior, Environment, Military Construction, and Veterans Affairs  Appropriations Act. My amendment will partially restore the prior  fiscal year's funding levels for the Countering Chinese Influence Fund,  helping to ensure that appropriate resources are available to address  this generational challenge. I'm glad that the House will address our  leading foreign policy priority on a bipartisan basis, and thank my  colleagues for supporting this measure to sustain U.S. resources to  counter the malign influence of the CCP.
