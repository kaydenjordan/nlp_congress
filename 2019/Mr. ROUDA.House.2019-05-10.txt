 Madam Speaker, I rise today because I am frustrated. I  came to Washington, D.C., because I was tired of politics as usual.  That is why the voters of Orange County sent me here. I also came here  to honor my constitutional obligation and the oath of office I took.   Yet, today, we see a President and an administration that continues  to sabotage the efforts of Members of Congress to do their job, while  painting a false narrative that all we want to do is investigate,  investigate, and investigate. And that is not the case.   This House, the House of the people, has passed 115 measures, 115  bills, the overwhelming majority of them bipartisan. Yet, only 12 have  gone to the floor of the Senate to be voted on. That is right--only 12.   It is time for the Republican leadership in the Senate and for Mitch  McConnell to start allowing these bills that have passed the House of  Representatives with bipartisan support, that address disaster relief  across our great country, to finally be voted on to help working  families and Americans across our great country.                            ____________________
