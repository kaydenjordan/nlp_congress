 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3364.  In particular, I am proud of the bipartisan language in the bill which  would create a national strategy for combating terrorism and illicit  finance. The financing of terrorism and related forms of illicit  finance present a direct threat to our national security and financial  system.   It is critical for the government to create and maintain a unified  strategy to fight financial crime, both to accommodate new and  developing threats and to help Congress develop legislative and funding  priorities now and in the future.   Additionally, a national strategy should seek to enhance  intergovernmental cooperation, to identify illicit financing trends,  and to encourage Federal agencies to work with the private financial  sector to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, this bill does these things and will go a long way in  making sure we are keeping pace with the ever-changing terror finance  landscape.   I would like to thank Chairman Hensarling for his extraordinary  conservative leadership on the Financial Services Committee and for  helping to include this language in the overall bill.   Additionally, I want to thank the chairman of the Terrorism and  Illicit Finance Subcommittee, Mr. Pearce, and for his support, and for  my colleague, Ms. Sinema, for her work on this as well.
