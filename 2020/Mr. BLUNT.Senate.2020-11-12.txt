 Madam President, I am pleased to be here today to talk  about the 2021 appropriations bill that we filed this week for Labor,  for Health and Human Services, and for Education.   Obviously, with what we have gone through this year, those three  agencies have all experienced dramatic challenges--labor challenges,  health challenges, education challenges. And while this bill would not  specifically be a COVID relief bill, it is a bill that funds these  agencies so they can move forward with their normal work rather than  have to, in some piecemeal way, try to deal with their normal work  while they are trying to work with us on the extraordinary  circumstances of the COVID bill.   This is the largest bill--Labor, Health, and Education is the largest  nondefense bill on the discretionary side of the agenda. It is about 30  percent of all the money left when the Defense appropriations is taken  off the table.   There are 11 bills left at that point, but this bill has about 30  percent of all the money. It has a lot of competing priorities, from  apprenticeships to biomedical research, to public health and  preparedness programs, to childcare and special education. National  service and community service are all in this bill.   We received 8,352 requests from Senators of things they would like to  see in the bill. They are not all in there, but we did all we could to  take the money we had and move forward with priorities that make sense.   I am disappointed at this point that our Democratic colleagues on the  Appropriations Committee were unable to support the bill right now, but  we have worked together in the past. I hope we can continue to work  together to find a way forward. And, frankly, my view is if  appropriations bills appear to have a path to the President's desk,  that is the thing that brings us together most quickly.   This bill continues in our sixth year of commitment to robustly and  consistently funding medical research at the National Institutes of  Health. We provided a $2 billion increase on that research. We target  funding toward Alzheimer's, toward precision medicine, premature birth  research, the BRAIN Initiative. In my time as chairman, we have  actually increased NIH funding by 45 percent in budgets that often had  virtually no increase at all. We truly had to work together to  prioritize. We have done that.   My time as chairman is about 6 years, if you are wondering how long  it took us to get that 45-percent increase. Six years ago, we hadn't  had any increase for 12 years. NIH was about 22 percent behind in  buying power where they had been a decade earlier. We made up that 22  percent. And actually, now, we are putting real money on the table in  an environment that has never been better and never been more promising  in the NIH research area.   We continue our focus of combating opioids. Between 1999 and 2018,  nearly 450,000 people in the United States died from opioid overdose.  These drug overdose deaths in 2018 were four times higher than in 1999.  The bill provides money to deal with this. With the effort we made in  this area over the last several years, we saw a consistent decrease in  opioid overdoses until 2020.   Of course, the increase in 2020, in many ways, related to the  pandemic and the isolation. The support structure that appeared to be  working to move you from dependency was no longer there, and suddenly  you are back where you were.   The bill provides a $20 million increase for apprenticeship programs.  This week, I joined the Missouri Chamber of Commerce in highlighting  the importance of apprenticeships. Last year, Missouri was the second  in the Nation in the number of new apprenticeships. First in the Nation  is California. We are not a small State, but we are not nearly as big  as California, so I think the leadership in our State--the business  community, the employers, the Governor, and others--has made a real  difference there. We fund both registered apprenticeship programs, and  it allows for industry-recognized programs as well.   Fourth, the bill invests in education, from early childhood through  college and career. It increases funding for high-quality early  childcare and education by more than $150 million. It increases funding  for elementary and secondary education programs that provide the most  flexibility to school districts to decide how to best use those limited  resources. This also includes increased investments in title I; in  IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; the title IV  student support and academic enrichment grants; charter schools; and  Impact Aid. It increases the maximum Pell grant award by another $150,  or a 2.4-percent increase, at a time when the mandatory money is gone.  To find that 2.4-percent increase, we have to find it in other  programs, and some programs are just not able to fund it. If they are  not working, we shouldn't fund them, and we have seen several years of  growth in areas in which we have a priority like Pell grants. To do  that, we had to look carefully at programs that just, frankly, were not  working.   Fifth, we continue our focus on closing the care gap between mental  health and physical health. Approximately one in five adults in America  has a diagnosable and almost always treatable mental health problem.  This bill provides an increase of almost $200 million in the mental  health area.   I would mention again the excellence of the mental health pilot. We  have increased that pilot to eight States from two. We are seeing what  happens in a positive way in people's other health issues when you deal  with their mental health issues like it was any health issue, and it is  making a difference. This year, it was reinforced again by  understanding the need to address disparities in foster care, a greater  diversity in healthcare, education, and the workforce.   Many populations across the country, whether defined by race,  ethnicity, geography, experience higher rates of certain diseases and  often lack the access to health services. This bill tries to look at  that in a way that analyzes where those gaps are, and it has programs  that encourage filling those gaps. Furthermore, the bill continues our  efforts to ensure that these disparities are addressed through a number  of programs, including workforce development programs, diverse medical  community efforts, research initiatives that focus on underserved  communities, programs that target health disparities, and education- workforce programs that create opportunity.   This bill prioritizes programs that provide the most benefit and  greatest return for all Americans. The bill continues key program  integrity activities that are aimed at reducing the waste, fraud, and  abuse of taxpayer dollars. These initiatives have proven to be a  worthwhile investment in their returning billions of dollars to the  Treasury and allowing us to look in other places as to how we could  fund that money in programs that work better and work more  transparently.   This bill eliminates eight programs equaling nearly $115 million in  spending reductions by focusing on programs that are the most efficient  and cost-effective and with proven outcomes. We all know that budgets  are tight, but making careful choices about health spending can be one  of the most valuable investments we make in Congress.   You don't have to look any further than the recent announcements  about the record progress we have made in finding a vaccine for COVID- 19. Through the CARES Act and other legislation, Congress provided $18  billion for research into therapeutics and vaccines, and $12.5 billion  went to vaccines. It did it in a way that is going to allow us to set a  record in having a safe vaccine available that meets the highest  standards. The vaccine that appears to be the first in line for  approval is 90 percent effective.  [[Page S6662]]    Now, I am not an expert in vaccines, so my first thought would be,  well, I want a vaccine that is 100 percent effective. As it turns out,  no vaccine is 100 percent effective. The measles vaccine that  schoolkids took for years and that most still take is 90 percent  effective. It was 9 months ago that healthcare experts said, if we  could have a vaccine that was 50 percent effective, we should approve  that vaccine and every other one that was at least 50 percent  effective.   We are looking at vaccines that are going to help us move beyond this  as we look at tests that help us move beyond this, but the fundamental  foundation of all of that is in the healthcare framework that we  maintain. You can't look at a pandemic and say that now it is time to  think about how we do important health research. You can't look at a  pandemic and say that now it is time to think about having care  providers in underserved areas. You can't look at a pandemic and say  that now it is time to begin to think about how you connect childcare  and work and school altogether. This bill does as much of that as we  could figure out how to do in the best way we could figure out how to  do it.   I hope Congress can pass it. It would be a great gift to the next  Congress and administration after January 20 to be able to start next  year with next year's work rather than having to start next year with  this year's work. Let's get this year's work done. Let's get it done  now. Let's send the bill to the President that the House and Senate  have agreed on, and let's get back to looking at these bills in the  right way at the right time.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.
