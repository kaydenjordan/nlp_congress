 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address what I call the  tale of two Kings, one a Member of this body who wondered out loud to  The New York Times why the terms ``white nationalism'' and ``white  supremacy'' are offensive.   I would say to my colleague that the terms are offensive because the  concepts are evil. And we have been counseled by Edmund Burke that all  that is required for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.   I have just introduced a resolution to express this august body's  disapproval of Mr. King's comments and condemnation of white  nationalism and white supremacy in all forms.   Today, I denounce the words of Representative   Steve King, and I do  so invoking the words of another King, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,  who, if he had been allowed to live, would be celebrating his 90th  birthday tomorrow.   Dr. King counseled that: ``We are going to be made to repent, not  just for the hateful words and deeds of bad people, but for the  appalling silence of good people.''   Madam Speaker, I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  join me in breaking the deafening silence and letting our resounding  condemnation be heard.                            ____________________
