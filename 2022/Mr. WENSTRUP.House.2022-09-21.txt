 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my teammates to  recognize the accomplishments of the Congressional Basketball Team.   The Congressional Basketball Team won Monday's 22nd Annual  Congressional Basketball game against a team of lobbyists.   We ended a drought for the Members' team going back to 2014. So we  were due. We won 46-36 but most importantly, this event was sponsored  by the Hoops for Youth Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that  supports at-risk kids in our communities.   The Hoops for Youth Foundation was founded with the mission of  creating opportunities for at-risk kids through basketball. They work  to teach kids that the skills they use on the basketball court can be  used every day in life to help them succeed.   It is a fun game. We come together. We won in a nice bipartisan  fashion. Blake Moore was the MVP. He played an outstanding game, and we  congratulate him for that. It was a great team effort.   Madam Speaker, we say thank you to the non-profit that put this  together for us and the success we had with raising money and having  fun at the same time.   Go team House of Representatives!                            ____________________
