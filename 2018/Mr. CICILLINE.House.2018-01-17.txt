 Mr. Speaker, this Friday, the Federal Government runs  out of money. We owe the American people a long-term solution to keep  the government open.   Democrats insist that this solution address the urgent issues facing  the American people, those we represent. That means long-term funding  for the Children's Health Insurance Program; funding for communities  fighting the deadly opioid epidemic; funding for the VA Choice Program  so that our heroic veterans get the care they need and deserve; passing  the Dream Act; and providing additional disaster recovery funds for  Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Texas, Florida, and Colorado.   I urge my Republican colleagues to be sure that these issues are  addressed in the continuing resolution. Work with the Democrats. Let's  get this done for the American people.                            ____________________
