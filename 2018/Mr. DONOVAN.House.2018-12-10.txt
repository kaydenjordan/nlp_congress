 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Homeland Security and the Committee on Energy and Commerce be  discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 7213) to amend  the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish the Countering Weapons  of Mass Destruction Office, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the  Record an exchange of letters between the chairman of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce and the chairman of the Committee on Homeland  Security on the bill, H.R. 7213.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the exchange of  letters.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                  Washington, DC, December 10, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On December 3, 2018, the H.R. 7213--      Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 2018 was       introduced. This bill was additionally referred to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce.        Since similar language passed the House of Representatives       by voice vote earlier this year, I ask that you allow the       Committee on Energy and Commerce to be discharged from       further consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled       by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your       jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will       not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition,       should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support       your request to have the Committee on Energy and Commerce       represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be       pleased to include this letter and your response in the       Congressional Record.        Thank you for consideration of my request, and I look       forward to further opportunities to work with you the       remainder of this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                  Washington, DC, December 10, 2018.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: Thank you for your letter concerning       H.R. 7213, Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of       2018.        I agree to allow the Committee on Energy and Commerce to be       discharged from further consideration of H.R. 7213 so that it       may be scheduled by the Majority Leader, and I thank you for       your assurance that this discharge in no way affects the       Committee's jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill,       and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In       addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I       appreciate your support for the Committee to be represented       on the conference.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,      Chairman.                            ____________________
