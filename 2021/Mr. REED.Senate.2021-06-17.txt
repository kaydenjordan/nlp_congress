 Mr. President, once again, I object to the request from the  Senator from New York for the reasons I previously stated. I will  repeat again: I support removing prosecution of sexual assault and  related crimes from the chain of command, but we must take care that we  do it thoughtfully, in a manner that does not stress the military  justice system or distort it in a way that would affect the efficiency  and operation of the military. The best way to do that, in my view, is  to consider these matters in the context of the annual Defense bill,  which we will be marking up in a month.   Mr. President, I would also point out that this week, Jeh Johnson,  who served under President Obama as the Department of Defense general  counsel, and then Secretary of Homeland Security, wrote an article  addressing the scope of Senator Gillibrand's bill, urging caution that  we focus on legislative solutions tailored to address the problem we  are trying to solve. And to remind my colleagues, as the DOD general  counsel, Secretary Johnson oversaw all legal services performed within  the Department of Defense. He advised the Secretary and all government  officials on military justice matters and oversaw the annual review of  the Manual for Courts-Martial. He is an informed and expert voice on  these matters.   During his tenure as DOD general counsel, he was no stranger to  momentous change, leading the implementation of the repeal of don't  ask, don't tell. As he states in his article, he has long supported  moving charging decisions over sex offenses out of the chain of  command.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  this article   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                       [From LAWFARE, June 16, 2021]  The Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act: Are the                  Solutions Commensurate With the Problem?                              (By Jeh Johnson)         The Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention       Act of 2021 is legislation pending in Congress to reshape the       manner in which the U.S. military prosecutes sexual assault       within its ranks. This is reform that is much needed and long       overdue. Notably, however, the bill in its current form       reshapes military justice far beyond the context of sexual       assault. Congress should take care to fashion a solution       commensurate with the problem at hand, and not go too far.        Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), the principal sponsor of       the bill, S. 1520, deserves credit for her heroic and       persistent campaign over the years to highlight the problem       of sexual assault in the military. Few others in Congress       today could have assembled such a broad bipartisan coalition       of 64 co-sponsors behind such an important, substantive piece       of legislation, while moving (or, to put it more       appropriately, dragging) the top brass at the Pentagon to the       same place. From my experience 10 years ago preparing the       military for the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, I know how       resistant to change that community can be.        I support Senator Gillibrand's effort to move charging       decisions for sex offenses in the military to an independent,       trained group of military lawyers. I said as much publicly in       2013. Likewise, almost all retired general and flag officers       I speak with today agree that the male-dominated chain of       command has failed the victims of sexual assault in the       military. They accept the need for change.        But, in its current form, the changes contemplated by S.       1520 are not limited to sex-related offenses. The bill would       create an independent body of lawyers, outside the chain of       command, to make charging decisions for a broad range of       offenses punishable by more than a year's confinement. These       include murder, manslaughter, child endangerment, larceny,       robbery, fraudulent use of a credit card, kidnapping, arson,       housebreaking, extortion, bribery, perjury, subornation of       perjury and obstruction of justice. (Notably, other offenses       such as receipt of stolen property, forgery and conduct       unbecoming an officer are excluded from the bill's reach, but       the logic for the distinction is unclear.) In all, if       enacted, the legislation would constitute the largest change       to military justice since the enactment of the Uniform Code       of Military Justice in 1950.        Why are offenses ranging from murder, arson to perjury       included in the bill's reach? What is the justification for       so large an overhaul? Where is the congressional finding       that, when it comes to the broader range of offenses, the       chain of command in the U.S. military has failed in its duty       to carry out military justice?        Supporters of the bill argue that, once Congress goes down       the road of creating an independent body to make charging       decisions for sex crimes, it cannot stop; that to limit the       creation of an independent body for sex crimes would also       create the stigma of ``pink courts'' that appear to exist for       the benefit of women. In my view, the exception is warranted,       perceptions can be addressed, and the exception should not       swallow the rule. In both civilian and military life, the       reality is the sex offenses are different, in the manner in       which they are reported, investigated, and prosecuted. It       should also be noted that victims of sexual assault are both       men and women.        Here are several other considerations:        First, as written the bill appears to require a whole new       bureaucracy to implement and execute the changes       contemplated. No one should be under the illusion that the       broad mission contemplated by the bill can be carried by a       small band of elite JAGs in a suite someplace in northern       Virginia. The bill would require that an independent group of       lawyers make charging decisions for a vast range    I think given the wise comments of not only Mr. Johnson but  also the pending recommendations by the Department of Defense  concerning this issue, again, the best place to have a thorough, lively  debate and amendments, by the way, which are precluded in this  unanimous consent, would be in the Armed Services Committee in the  [[Page S4610]]  context of the annual defense authorization bill. That is where we have  confronted and decided these issues historically.   And with that, I would reiterate my objection to the Senator from New  York's request.
