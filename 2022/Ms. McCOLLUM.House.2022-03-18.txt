 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember Shar Knutson,  former president of the Minnesota AFL-CIO, who passed away last month.  Shar was a bridge-builder, trailblazer, and mentor.   Shar was a lifelong advocate for workers in St. Paul and across  Minnesota. A trailblazer herself, the first woman to lead the Minnesota  AFL-CIO, she mentored women in the labor movement and urged them to run  for leadership.   She was a strong booster for pro-women labor supporters seeking  public office. Her early and steadfast support and encouragement was  instrumental to me in helping to run for Congress and advance our  common values together.   Hosting Shar as my guest for President Obama's first official State  of the Union address in Washington, D.C., was a privilege.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a February 22, 2022, article  from the Union Advocate newspaper in St. Paul paying tribute to Shar  Knutson's life and work.                              [Feb. 22, 2022]  Remembering Shar Knutson: `Her Presence Will Be Missed, but Her Legacy                                 Lives On'                            (by Union Advocate)         Shar Knutson ascended the ranks of Minnesota's labor       movement, starting as a member of AFSCME Local 1842 in St.       Paul and retiring after six years in the state's highest       union office. Remembered by colleagues and friends as a       bridge-builder, trailblazer and mentor, Knutson died Feb. 2       at the age of 72.        A native of Fridley who made St. Paul her home, Knutson       made history in 2009 as the first woman elected president of       the Minnesota AFL-CIO, the federation of over 1,000 affiliate       unions representing 300,000 working people statewide.        Knutson held the office until 2015, during a tumultuous       time for American unions. Efforts to weaken workers'       bargaining power and roll back labor standards succeeded in       other states, but not in Minnesota. Under Knutson's       leadership, Minnesota unions not only kept ``right to work''       and other anti-union measures at bay, but they lobbied to       expand collective bargaining rights and pass the first       statewide minimum-wage increase in a decade.        ``Shar played an active role in the successful campaign to       increase labor's voice in national, state and local issues,       including raising awareness and promoting community debate       about social and economic justice,''  [[Page H3843]]       U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum said. ``This shift laid the       groundwork for important progress being made today that       benefits all Minnesotans.''        Labor leaders who worked with Knutson recalled her       attention to detail, quiet resolve and ambition.        ``She got her facts, and she moved forward,'' said Ray       Waldron, Knutson's predecessor as president of the state AFL-      CIO. ``She was very decisive.''        It showed, Waldron remembered, when he approached Knutson       in 2009 with the news that he planned to retire. Knutson had       been serving as president of the St. Paul Regional Labor       Federation and, previously, the St. Paul Trades and Labor       Assembly for more than a decade. ``I walked into her office       and said, `How would you like to run for president of the       Minnesota AFL-CIO?' '' Waldron said. ``Shar didn't hesitate.       She just said yes, reached across her desk, shook my hand,       and I walked out.''        Though self-assured, Knutson ``was never a bully,'' said       Harry Melander, former head of the St. Paul and statewide       Building Trades councils. Rather, she built her career on a       knack for bringing people into the decision-making process       and working in coalition.        ``We all love each other, we're family,'' Melander said.       ``But families have fights. Shar made a point to make sure       everyone, whether you got along within the labor family or       not, was at the table when we had a big item to discuss, so       we could figure this out together.''        Knutson grew up in a union household, but her ties to the       labor and political communities deepened after leaving a       public-health job with the City of St. Paul in 1990 to work       for Mayor Jim Scheibel. At City Hall, she shared an office       and a budding friendship with Molly O'Rourke, who said the       two ``bonded over that experience of working in a very fast-      paced and energized office.''        Knutson was the mayor's liaison to organized labor and       other constituent groups, including the emerging immigrant       and refugee communities. It was a good fit, O'Rourke said,       given Knutson's ``belief that everyone, no matter their       station in life, needed to be treated with dignity and       respect.''        Scheibel declined to run for re-election in 1993, and       Knutson went to work for the Trades and Labor Assembly.       Delegates elected her president in 1998, and within weeks of       taking office, St. Paul's new mayor, Norm Coleman, stunned       the city's unions with a proposal to privatize a swath of       city services, from golf courses to the water department.        Coleman's ``Compete St. Paul'' plan threatened hundreds of       city jobs, and union leaders looked to the Assembly to fight       back, said Barb Kucera, then editor of The Union Advocate       newspaper. Knutson worked quickly to convene the St. Paul       Works Alliance, a coalition of groups that would oppose the       privatization scheme.        ``Right away, Shar brought in as many stakeholders as       possible to be part of the discussion, leading with the       unions but inviting other organizations too,'' Kucera said.       ``She really decided to mount a public campaign, and that's       what eventually stopped the whole idea in the fall of 1999.       ``Shar really pushed the organization to focus and get a       clear message across, and she did a lot of media appearances       and events and public speaking. They talked about jobs, but       they didn't make it about jobs only. They very wisely chose       to make it clear this was going to be a real threat to public       services in the city, particularly the water service.''        Defeating Coleman's plan drew national attention, and       Knutson was among a handful of local labor council presidents       invited to serve on an advisory committee to the AFL-CIO       Executive Board. ``She was willing to try to do some things       differently, and she projected a different image, being the       first woman and first public employee in that job,'' Kucera       said.        ``She surprised a lot of people in Washington, D.C.,''       Waldron added. ``She was courageous.'' Knutson's profile       continued to grow after another successful, coalition-based       campaign in 2006, this time to save 500 jobs at a paper       recycling plant in the Midway. The plant, then owned by Rock-      Tenn, needed a new power source after Xcel Energy stopped       burning coal at its High Bridge plant. But opposition from       neighborhood groups put Rock-Tenn's future--and the jobs of       Steelworkers like Bob Ryan--in doubt.        Ryan, who now works as the rapid response coordinator for       his union, called Knutson ``instrumental'' in keeping USW       Local 264 members working in St. Paul.        ``It was a lot of public meetings, and Shar was at a lot of       them with us, speaking on our behalf,'' he said. Both Knutson       and her father had worked at the facility, he said, ``so Shar       could talk to people with true emotion about how long the       plant had been there and its connection to the city. She just       delivered.''        By then, the Assembly had merged with surrounding labor       councils to form the Regional Labor Federation, with Knutson       as president. She won a three-way race for president of the       state AFL-CIO in August 2009, and guided the union campaign       to elect Minnesota's first labor-endorsed governor in 20       years, Mark Dayton, a year later.        As her list of accomplishments grew, Knutson continued to       prioritize her work to mentor women and young workers       pursuing leadership roles in the labor movement and in       politics.        Those fields were even more male-dominated 22 years ago,       when McCollum became just the second Minnesota woman elected       to federal office, than they are today. The 4th District       congresswoman remembered Knutson and longtime friend Robin       Madsen, an AFSCME leader who died in 2017, teaming up to host       a ``Working Women for Betty'' campaign-kickoff event after       McCollum announced her first run for Congress.        Knutson and McCollum remained friends as their careers       progressed. Knutson attended President Barack Obama's first       State of the Union address as McCollum's guest, and the       congresswoman presented her friend with a flag flown over the       U.S. Capitol upon her retirement from the Minnesota AFL-CIO.        ``I am thankful I had the opportunity to know and work with       Shar Knutson,'' McCollum said. ``Her presence will be missed,       but her legacy lives on.''        Jennifer Guertin, president of AFSCME Local 2508, called       Knutson a source of ``quiet support'' going back to the days       when delegates to the Trades and Labor Assembly were ``75 to       80 percent men.''        ``There were times when I was so frustrated by the guys       that I was like, `I'm done, I can't do this anymore,' '' said       Guertin, now the federation's sergeant at arms. ``Shar would       take me aside and say, `You have to learn how to deal with       people that don't know what you're capable of. You can't let       them win.' ''        Current Regional Labor Federation President Kera Peterson       counts herself among the countless other union members       Knutson took time to mentor.        ``President Knutson helped us grow as people, advocates and       leaders, and she fostered connections among us,'' Peterson       said. ``I don't know that many of us realized it at the time,       but Shar was building a network of union and community       activists with an eye towards our future. ``I'm grateful that       she took a long view on what our labor movement can       accomplish together, and for the investments she made in all       of us.''        Knutson was also quick to remind young activists about the       importance of work-life balance. ``A lot of times during       campaigns, when I was pretty much living at the Labor Centre       because that's what we did, she was the one to tell me that I       needed to go home sometimes, too,'' Guertin said. Knutson,       who raised two daughters as a single working mother, ``was       really dedicated to her family,'' O'Rourke said. ``I think       they gave her a lot of strength.''        Although Knutson spent more time with family and friends       after retiring in 2015, Alzheimer's disease progressively       limited her independence.        ``It was hard to see such a strong and powerful and       articulate woman not really know the amazing impact she had       on people around her,'' O'Rourke said.        ``She was a friend of mine, a good friend to me and to a       lot of people,'' Melander added. ``It's hard because she       didn't have enough time to enjoy the fruits of her labor.''        Knutson's family has published an obituary at       BradshawFuneral.com. They plan to hold her memorial service       later this spring.     Madam Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to  work with Shar Knutson and to call her a friend. Her presence will be  missed, but her legacy lives on.                            ____________________
