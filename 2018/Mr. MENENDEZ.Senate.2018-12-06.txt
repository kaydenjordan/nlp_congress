 Would the Senator from Tennessee, the chairman of the  Foreign Relations Committee, yield for a question? As the sponsor of  this legislation, would you explain how our bill relates to  international exchange programs run by the Department of State that  collect program fees to fund program operations?    I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I appreciate your  explanation, which also reflects my understanding, about the difference  between international exchange program fees and placement and  recruitment fees covered by the bill. Let me conclude by saying that I  agree with you about the importance of our International Exchange  Programs administered by the Department of State, and I know that  Congress has long supported these programs.
