 Madam President, today I wish to honor the long and  distinguished career of Chi Wang, Ph.D. The year 2018 marked the 90th  anniversary of the creation of the Chinese Section at the U.S. Library  of Congress in 1928. Dr. Wang spent nearly 50 years working at the  Library of Congress, ultimately serving as the head of the Chinese and  Korean section until his retirement in 2004.   Dr. Chi Wang came to the United States from China as a high school  student in 1949. He completed his undergraduate and graduate degrees in  the Washington, DC, area, ultimately earning a Ph.D. in American  diplomatic history from Georgetown University in  [[Page S215]]  1969. He also began pursuing his own American dream by becoming a U.S.  citizen, getting married, starting a family and starting a career at  the Library of Congress.   Dr. Wang worked for 3 years at the State Department's Foreign Service  Institute before starting at the U.S. Library of Congress. He served in  several positions during his 47-year career at the Library and reached  the position of head of the Chinese and Korean section in 1975, which  he held until he retired. During his tenure, he expanded the library's  Chinese collection from 300,000 volumes to more than 1 million. Under  his guidance, the Library of Congress became a top resource for the  study of China in the United States. Dr. Wang met with countless U.S.  Representatives, Senators, officials, and academics to help them  effectively use the Library resources.   After President Nixon traveled to China in 1972, Dr. Wang embarked on  a trip to China in his role at the Library of Congress to promote  library and educational exchanges. The trip was a great success,  leading to future exchanges, large book acquisitions, and an increase  in mutual understanding between the U.S. and China during a very  delicate time when the two countries were only just beginning to  establish ties.   Although the Library of Congress Chinese section was abolished and  its collection integrated into the larger Asian division, the legacy of  the Chinese collection and the contributions Dr. Wang made to develop  this important resource still remains. His efforts over the years have  helped deepen the U.S. understanding of China, something that is  especially necessary today. Professor Wang continues to dedicate his  time to improving U.S.-China mutual understanding as the cofounder and  president of the Washington, DC-based nonprofit, the U.S.-China Policy  Foundation. He also contributes his own scholarship in the field,  having published multiple books and articles on U.S.-China relations.   Dr. Wang still remembers fondly his decades working at the Library of  Congress. What started simply as a job turned into a career and  lifelong passion. He especially enjoyed the times he met with various  Members of Congress.   As we, again, face a challenging time in U.S.-China relations, the  resources and information available in the Library of Congress can help  in providing increasingly useful information in understanding the  complex and ever-changing U.S.-China relationship.                            ____________________
