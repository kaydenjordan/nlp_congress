 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much, and I  thank Mr. Cicilline.   Let me refute the suggestion that this is a bill that was rushed to  the floor. This is a work that has been germinating for 5 years plus,  and many of us have watched and been engaged in meetings and  collaboration to ensure that the bill would reflect all of what America  is about.   I want to speak to my religious friends--that is, all of us claim a  religion of some form--and I want to say to them that religious liberty  is not dead, but it is alive.   This bill focuses on saving lives; it focuses on understanding what  it means to be transgender and denied the right to serve in the United  States military. It stands up for African American transgender women  who have been killed in the South, in the region that I live in; and it  stands up for the person who knocked on the door and could not get  housing because of their status.   And so I would ask my friends who are Mormon, Seventh Day Adventists,  Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, and other religions: How would you feel if  you knocked on a door and you could not get in, if they had no place  for you at the inn?   So I am well-aware of the Restorative Act, dealing with religion,  passed in 1993, but I am also aware of the Supreme Court case, the  Hodges case in 2015, which said: ``They ask for equal dignity in the  eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.''   That is what this bill is doing, and the Constitution will protect  those who are involved in the religious practices. As it has indicated:  ``We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect  Union.''   And then you go to the Bill of Rights, and it has as Amendment Number  I: ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of  religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''   The Constitution will be alongside of the Equality Act, and we will  be able to have fair housing and civil rights, and we will be able to  deal with this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for the  time.   It will allow, with this Constitution alongside of the Equality Act,  the idea that the Civil Rights Act stands for those in the LGBTQ  community, the Civil Rights Act in title VI and title II and title VII;  and they will stand alongside of the ACLU and the NAACP and the Urban  League and LULAC and all of the civil rights groups.   They will stand alongside those of us who have been fighting for fair  housing time after time so that, when we knock on the door, no matter  who you are in this country, you will have the Constitution and the  Equality Act.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my friends and others in the religious community  to support the Equality Act.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary and  an original cosponsor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the  ``Equality Act of 2019.''   Let me thank my colleague on the Judiciary Committee, Congressman  David Cicilline of Rhode Island, for introducing this landmark  legislation and his tireless efforts in making this day a reality.   Mr. Speaker, our nation's long but inexorable march towards equality  reaches another milestone today.   For as long as our national charters have been in existence, we have  endeavored to ask ourselves: what do we mean when we say ``We the  People?''   How expansive do we hold our pledge that all are entitled to the  blessings of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   To be certain our nation has come a long way, but as we debate this  critical bill, I am reminded of the Supreme Court's decision in  Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. __ 135 S.Ct. 2584 (2015), and its  powerful conclusion explaining the profound power of love and marriage,  and the desire to be seen as equal in the eyes of the law:         No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies       the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice,       and family. In forming a marital union, two people become       something greater than once they were. As some of the       petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a       love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand       these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of       marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it       so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for       themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in       loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest       institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the       law. The Constitution grants them that right.    Despite significant legal advances over the past several years,  including marriage equality, LGBTQ Americans remain vulnerable to  discrimination on a daily basis and too often have little recourse.   The Equality Act has the bipartisan support of Members of Congress,  with nearly 240 co-sponsors, as well as the strong support of the  business community, and most important, the overwhelming support of the  American people.   More than 70 percent of Americans support the Equality Act.   This has been a long journey; the first Equality Act was introduced  nearly 45 years ago.   It is long past time to secure the civil rights of LGBTQ people  across the country and accord them full membership in the American  family.   With the Trump Administration rolling back protections at the federal  level and anti-equality opponents continuing to push discriminatory  bills at the state level, LGBTQ people cannot wait another year for  affirmation that they are worthy of the dignity of their peers and  deserving of equal protection of the laws.   Today, too many LGTBQ Americans in too many places remain too  vulnerable to discrimination on a daily basis with too little legal  recourse.   Fifty percent of the national LGBTQ community live in states where,  though they may have the right to marry, they have no explicit non- discrimination protections in other areas of daily life.   The Equality Act extends the full anti-discrimination protections of  the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other key pillars of fairness  and justice in our country to LGBTQ Americans.   Sexual orientation and gender identity deserve full civil rights  protections, not just in the workplace, but in every place: in  education, housing, credit, jury service, public facilities, and public  accommodations.   Today, there are only 21 states that have explicit laws barring  discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, housing, and  public accommodations, and only 20 states have such protections for  gender identity.   In most states, a same-sex couple can get married on Saturday, then  be legally denied service at a restaurant on Sunday, and be fired from  their jobs on Monday, and evicted from their apartment on Tuesday.   Mr. Speaker, let me take a moment to discuss in more detail several  of the important elements of the Equality Act.   The Equality Act amends existing federal civil rights laws to  explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation  and gender identity in education, employment, housing, credit, Federal  jury service, public accommodations, and the use of Federal funds.   It does so by adding sex in some places where it had not previously  been protected, and clarifying that sex includes sexual orientation and  gender identity.   Specifically, the H.R. 5, the ``Equality Act of 2019'' amends:   1. Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide basic  protections against discrimination in public accommodations by adding  sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity;   2. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide basic  protections against discrimination by recipients of federal financial  assistance by adding sex, including sexual orientation, and gender  identity;   3. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Service  Reform Act of 1978, the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991, and the  Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to make explicit protections  against workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or  gender identity;   4. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 to make protections against housing  discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity explicit;   5. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act to make protections against  credit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity  explicit; and  [[Page H3940]]    6. The Jury Selections and Services Act to make protections against  discrimination in federal jury service based on sexual orientation or  gender identity explicit.                             RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS    The march towards equality has been long and has awoken passions  passion from many quarters for various reasons.   Well-intentioned people from all walks of life have had difficulty as  progress washes over the debate surrounding protections for same sex  individuals.   At times, the debate has seen input from members of the faith  community, who strive to reconcile their love for all of God's sons and  daughters, with the script of their sacred text.   I understand this tension, but I have carefully studied the text and  am confident that passage of the Equality Act will not adversely affect  any person's freedom of worship of the free exercise of their faith.   The Equality Act adds sexual orientation and gender identity to  federal civil rights law and sex where it is missing.   But the same statutory exemptions that are already in place in the  Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act will remain in place after  enactment and the guarantees of the United States Constitution remain  untouched.   The U.S. Constitution provides ample protections for religious  freedom and nothing in this bill would, or could, infringe upon the  protections afforded by the Constitution, as the principal sponsor of  the bill, Congressman Cicilline, confirmed during a colloquy we held  during the markup of the bill in the Judiciary Committee.   Specifically, the provisions relating to Title VI of the Civil Rights  Act (federal funding) include the original exemptions for  discrimination based on religion.   Religious organizations (not just houses of worship) are free to  limit participation in a wide array of activities and services to only  members of their faith.   This same exemption applies to public accommodations.   Houses of worship could be considered a place of public accommodation  only if they offer their space or services for commercial public use.   This does not include religious services.   Nothing in this bill alters the ability of houses of worship or  religious leaders to practice or carry out their faith.   No member of the clergy will ever be compelled to perform a religious  ceremony that conflicts with their beliefs, including marrying same-sex  couples.   The DOJ Title VI Manual and relevant and relevant case law clearly  provide that a religious organization that is not ``principally  engaged'' in providing social services is only bound by  nondiscrimination requirements related to the program for which they  receive funding if that funding is targeted in order to provide a  specific program or service, i.e. disaster relief, rather than to the  entity ``as a whole.''   Nothing in the Equality Act changes that rule.   There is a longstanding ministerial exemption in federal civil rights  law that exempts religious organizations from complying with employment  nondiscrimination provisions for ministers, rabbis and any other person  who is ``carrying out the faith''.   The Equality Act does not alter that exemption in any way.   The Equality Act does not repeal the Religious Freedom Restoration  Act (RFRA).   The Equality Act clarifies that RFRA cannot be used to defend  discrimination in public settings or with federal funds.   The Equality Act does not alter or amend the RFRA standard for any  other kinds of claims.   Federal civil rights laws and the United States Constitution provide  many exemptions for religious organizations.   It bears stating again that the statutory exemptions that are already  in place in the Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act will remain  in place and the United States Constitution remains untouched.   Courts have long-rejected religious claims as a reason to deny civil  rights protections, including those based on race and sex, and the same  analysis applies to all other protected characteristics.   Specifically, religious belief did not exempt restaurants or hotels  from complying with the civil rights laws passed in the 1960s and  cannot do so today.   RFRA explicitly contemplates that Congress would exempt certain laws  from its application.   The clarifying language in the Equality Act is necessary to ensure  that courts do not misinterpret the intended interaction between RFRA  and our civil rights laws.   RFRA will still be available to address burdens on religious beliefs  and practices in other contexts.   And any individual or organization that is concerned that their  religious beliefs or practices are being unjustly burdened retains the  ability to bring a claim under the First Amendment.   The time has come to extend the full blessings of equality and the  majesty of the law's protection to all of our brothers and sisters,  including those in the LGBTQ community.   Mr. Speaker, it been said that ``the moral arc of the universe is  long but bends toward justice.''   Today, with passage by this House of H.R. 5, the Equality Act, we  bend that arc even more in the direction of justice.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this life-changing and  life-affirming legislation and urge all members to stand on the right  of history and vote for its passage.
