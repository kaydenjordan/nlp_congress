 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the passing of a  truly great American, the mayor of Aurora, Colorado, Stephen D. Hogan.   Mayor Hogan passed away on May 13. Throughout his nearly 8-year  tenure as a mayor of my hometown, Steve Hogan oversaw a remarkable and  exciting renaissance of the city. Aurora has become Colorado's third- largest city and the driving force behind innovation, development, and  economic opportunity. Aurora has also become an even greater place to  live, work, and raise a family.   I met Steve Hogan 35 years ago when I returned home to Aurora after  having served in the Marine Corps. I have had the distinct pleasure to  call him a friend ever since.   Mayor Hogan's career in public service has taken him from serving in  the Colorado House of Representatives in the 1970s to serving six terms  as an Aurora City Council member and, finally, two terms as the mayor  of the city, a city I know he loved so dearly.   Mayor Hogan exemplified the spirit of public service, and my hometown  of Aurora would not be the wonderful place it is today without his  vision and his leadership. We all are better off because of his decades  of hard work.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have been able to call Mayor Steve Hogan a  friend, and his family will remain in my thoughts and prayers.                            ____________________
