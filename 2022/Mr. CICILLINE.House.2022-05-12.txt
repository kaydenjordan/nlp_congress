 Madam Speaker, our economy is still recovering from 2  years of a once-in-a-generation pandemic that basically shut down our  economy.   As Americans stopped going out and spending money, companies slowed  production not only to meet this change in demand but also to allow for  social distancing and COVID safety protocols for workers.   Now, as Americans have started to resume their normal lives,  companies are struggling to keep up with the increased demand for  goods. These supply chain issues and a worker shortage has resulted in  higher prices across the economy.   These issues do not fully explain some of the skyrocketing prices  that we are seeing. The pandemic, and the ensuing recovery, have laid  bare systemic problems in our economy, including market consolidation  and price gouging.   As our economy works to recover from the pandemic and the shocks to  our supply chain, and as the world responds to Putin's reckless  invasion of Ukraine, food and energy costs have skyrocketed for people  around the world, including here in America and including in my  district in Rhode Island.   While President Biden has taken a number of steps to tackle costs for  Americans, including releasing millions of barrels of petroleum from  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, expanding access to gasoline with 15  percent ethanol, and additional investments in the Low Income Home  Energy Assistance Program to help those most in need, systemic  imbalances in our economy are enabling companies to further drive up  costs.   Put simply, they are taking advantage of hardworking Americans and  raising prices just because they can, all for the sake of extraordinary  profits.   As Americans are working to recover from 2 years of an unprecedented  health crisis and the economic downturn it caused, companies are  reporting record profits as worker pay remains stagnant and families  feel the squeeze on their pocketbooks.   This is especially true in the case of gas prices. Exxon, for  example, is reporting that in the first quarter of 2022, its net  profits have more than doubled, to $5.5 billion, compared to last year.  Chevron has reported its highest quarterly profit in nearly a decade.   These record profits are a direct result of record gas prices. If  these prices were solely based on inflation or supply chain issues,  these companies wouldn't be seeing these obscene increases in profits.   To make matters worse, these record profits aren't being invested in  new drilling sites to help us deal with energy shortages brought on by  Putin's invasion of Ukraine but, instead, are going to massive company  stock buybacks, shareholder dividends, and salary bonuses. This is  pandemic war profiteering.   In grocery stores across America, the cost of food continues to rise  as prices for goods like pork, chicken, and beef have spiked  dramatically. While some may point solely to inflation for these  increased prices, there is, once again, a larger systemic problem.   In the meatpacking industry, for example, the top four companies are  estimated to control up to 85 percent of the industry. In industries  all across the economy, the story is the same.   Three firms control 93 percent of the soft drink industry. Three  firms control 85 percent of the baby formula industry. Three firms  control 93 percent of the baby food industry. Four firms control 79  percent of the beer industry. Three firms control 79 percent of the dry  pasta industry. And three firms control 73 percent of the cereal  industry.   If history has taught us anything, this kind of market consolidation  hurts product quality, market competition, and worker safety, all the  things we need to have an equitable economy.   As simply put by President Biden: ``Capitalism without competition is  exploitation.''   So, as we look to recover from this pandemic, and in a way that  creates an  [[Page H4864]]  economy that works for everyone, for the people of this country, we  need to hold these monopolistic giants accountable.   To start, Congress must pass the Big Oil windfall profits tax.  Companies that have taken advantage of this moment and taken advantage  of the American people in a time of crisis shouldn't be raking in  record profits. Those profits should be returned to the consumers that  they gouged.   We also should pass H.R. 7688 to be sure that we are taking on, in a  serious way, price gouging in the energy sector. I am working with  Congresswoman Schakowsky on an economywide anti-price gouging bill.   We need to be sure that we are funding the FTC to do this work so it  can conduct rigorous investigations and look carefully at this kind of  market consolidation.    But look, this is about corporate greed, about people taking  advantage of this moment. As the American people are recovering from a  very difficult couple of years, we should not, in addition to that,  allow them to be victims of this kind of price gouging. We have the  ability to do something about it.   We have bills that I hope we will bring to the floor. Return what was  improperly taken from consumers at the gas pump. Return it back to  them.   I also thank President Biden for the work that he is doing to bring  down gas prices, to focus relentlessly on inflation, both for food and  gas. This is the number one concern of my constituents in Rhode Island,  and it will remain the number one concern in the weeks ahead as we do  something to be sure that we are taking on these profiteers, the  pandemic profiteers and war profiteers.                            ____________________
