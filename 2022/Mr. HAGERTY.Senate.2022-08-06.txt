 Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. President, I ask to dispense with the reading.    Mr. President, in fiscal year 2021, Immigration and  Customs Enforcement arrested more than 12,000 illegal aliens with  aggravated felony convictions. An alltime record number of illegal  border crossers entered our country last year. This is an unprecedented  national security crisis.   Before we spend billions of dollars on Green New Deal programs, the  Department should first do its core job of securing the homeland.   This same policy was adopted 53 to 46 during the budget resolution  process last August, with four of my Democratic colleagues joining me.  Now, 1 year later, we have a worse crisis and an opportunity to provide  real funding to protect our citizens from individuals who endanger our  communities.   I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will maintain  their previous support for this commonsense approach to fund law  enforcement and put public safety and national security over partisan  politics. We have a chance to address this in a real manner right now.  Solving a major crisis like this is worth taking a little more time.   I urge my colleagues to support this motion.    Mr. President, do I have more time left?    I ask for the yeas and nays.
