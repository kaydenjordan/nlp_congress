 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 1396 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1396         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3843) to       promote antitrust enforcement and protect competition through       adjusting premerger filing fees, and increasing antitrust       enforcement resources. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. In lieu of the       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on the Judiciary now printed in the bill, an       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 117-66 shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived.

Sec. 2.  At any time after adoption of this resolution the       Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       7780) to support the behavioral needs of students and youth,       invest in the school-based behavioral health workforce, and       ensure access to mental health and substance use disorder       benefits.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1396, providing for consideration of  three measures.   First, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 7780 under a  structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking minority member of  the Committee on Education and Labor, and makes in order two  amendments, and provides one motion to recommit.   Second, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3843 under a  closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on the Judiciary and a motion to recommit.   Third, the rule provides for consideration of S. 3969 under a closed  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and the ranking minority member of the  Committee on House Administration and a motion to commit.   The rule provides the majority leader or his designee the ability to  en bloc requested roll call votes on suspension bills considered on  September 28 to September 30. This authority lasts through September  30, 2022.   Lastly, the rule provides standard recess instructions from October 3  to November 11.   Mr. Speaker, an average of 18 young Americans took their own lives  every  [[Page H8171]]  day in 2020. When children take their own lives, families and  communities are left broken. This includes the community of Moorhead,  Minnesota, which faced the devastating loss of 13-year old Horizon  Middle School student Jacoby Blake to suicide just last year.   These sad stories happen all over this country in all of our  districts. Mental health disorders, as a whole, are a common cause of  death. It is estimated by CDC that 8 million deaths worldwide, which  represents about 14.3 of total annual deaths, are attributable to  mental disorders.   Even before the pandemic, the unmet mental and behavioral health  needs of young people, students, and teachers, were a serious problem.   In talking with teachers in the district I represent in the East Bay  of the San Francisco Bay area, it is clear that this problem has become  a crisis. Teachers, administrators, and parents, often tell me that  dealing with their students and their children's and their own mental  and behavioral health challenges is among the most difficult things  they deal with every day.   The data, unfortunately, backs up these stories. Teachers are saying,  just last year, almost half of the students experienced persistent  sadness or hopelessness, and nearly 20 percent seriously considered  suicide.   Think of that, Mr. Speaker. Almost one in four American children have  considered suicide in the last 2 years.   At the same time, 27 percent of teachers reported symptoms of  depression, which is significantly higher than average adults, and  those numbers have been growing.   Despite these warning signs, over 60 percent of children experiencing  major depression do not receive any form of mental health treatment,  and only 22 percent of teachers reported receiving emotional support  from their school, their school district, or professional staff.   This is at a time when investments in the National Institute of  Mental Health is discovering exponential information about how our  brains work, how they cognitively develop, and the danger to trauma.   We are not getting this information out to the people who need it the  most. We know that when people get treatment, they succeed. They  overcome their difficulties.   As a Nation, we are underinvesting in the resources our students  need, and our communities, our parents, our teachers, our  administrators, to stay healthy, to succeed in school, and retain  talented teachers and professionals and make sure that future Americans  grow and are ready to carry on the legacy that we have inherited from  former generations.   While the School Social Work Association of America recommends a  ratio of 250 students per social worker, not one single State meets  this recommended ratio. The national average is 2,106 of students per  social worker; 2,106, as opposed to the recommended average of 250.   I am proud this week that the House is advancing my legislation, the  Mental Health Matters Act, to confront this crisis head on, to give  communities and parents and teachers the resources they need.   This bill was drafted with the needs of students, parents, and  teachers in mind and is the product of months of careful consideration  about how Congress can best respond to our Nation's mental health  crisis.   This legislation before us would expand the school-based mental and  behavioral health workforce, promote accessibility for students with  disabilities, provide resources to address trauma in young children,  and strengthen the ability of Americans with employer-sponsored  insurance to access mental health and substance use disorder treatments  they are statutorily entitled to.   From my discussions with mental health professionals over the years  and research that has informed this legislation, it is clear that  failure to address these challenges at a young age can harm performance  at school and work and lead to ever worsening mental and behavioral  health outcomes later in life for individuals and for our country.                                time  1800    Anxiety and reading disorders co-occur in approximately 25 percent of  students. For individuals whose reading challenges persist into  adulthood, there is a greater likelihood of depression, low self- esteem, and difficulty in social functioning.   To break this cycle, a provision I authored would help Head Start  agencies implement evidence-based interventions to improve the health  of children and staff.   While investment is needed for greater access to school-based mental  health and behavioral health, individuals and families with employer- sponsored health insurance must also have robust access to treatment  outside of school.   Some insurers, unfortunately, have placed arbitrary coverage limits  on mental and behavioral health care, making it hard for patients to  access treatment in the same way they would for physical ailments. This  legislation makes great strides in the fight for mental health parity  so that families can focus more on staying healthy and less on battling  insurers for coverage.   Mental health and suicide prevention are deeply personal issues for  me, having lost my own father to suicide almost 34 years ago. In  advancing this bill, it is my hope that we can prevent many families  from having to experience what mine went through several decades ago.   Also included in today's rule is the Merger Filing Fee Modernization  Act. This bipartisan bill would increase the filing fee that large  corporations must pay the Federal Trade Commission in order to conduct  a merger.   A recent surge in merger filings has placed a strain on the FTC's  resources, and updating the fee schedule will help the agency cope with  its many demands.   Finally, we will also consider the PAVA Program Inclusion Act under  the rule. This Senate-passed legislation would help ensure that all  programs designed to help voters with disabilities can access Federal  funds regardless of their location.   Unfortunately, programs designed to help individuals with  disabilities vote who are Native Americans or who live in the Northern  Mariana Islands are not currently able to access the Protection and  Advocacy for Voting Access funds in the same manner as other Federal  programs. The PAVA Program Inclusion Act will fix this injustice, and  passing this bill will send it to President Biden's desk to be signed  into law.   Mr. Speaker, we have a great opportunity this week to make  transformative investments in our Nation's future and our mental health  and pass other commonsense legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate the comments from my friend.   Just on the mental health part, we did have hearings in the  subcommittee I am proud to chair, the Subcommittee on Health,  Employment, Labor, and Pensions. We have had ongoing discussions with  both the ranking member of that subcommittee and the ranking member of  the full committee, so I think this is to be continued.   I would say on the mental health part of the rule, the urgency is  right now, as I outlined in my opening comments. It is something we  will have to continue to work with and hopefully will in good faith  because all of these issues are on mental health, particularly for  young people. I have agreed in my conversations with my friends, the  ranking members, Ms. Foxx and Mr. Allen, and I look forward to  continuing that. I think there is a real urgency on that.   On the trust, I respectfully disagree. Given the level of inequality  in this country right now, I think it is really important that we  support competition in the marketplace, and the Federal Trade  Commission needs the resources to make sure that that happens.   The PAVA bill obviously has bipartisan support.   On all of these bills, I am anxious to get them off the floor today  as a rule and look forward to seeing the continued debate tomorrow on  the specific bills and the outcome of those bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I always say that I respect and admire  my friend from the San Francisco Bay Area. Sometimes, we disagree.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the names and  correspondence of several organizations I will mention just briefly.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record The Washington  Post article titled: ``U.S. arrests along Mexico border top 2 million a  year for first time.''                 [From the Washington Post, Sept. 19, 2022]    U.S. Arrests Along Mexico Border Top 2 Million a Year for First Time                              (By Nick Miroff)         U.S. authorities made more than 2 million immigration       arrests along the southern border during the past 11 months,       marking the first time annual enforcement statistics have       exceeded that threshold, according to figures provided by       senior Biden administration officials Monday.        In August, U.S. Customs and Border Protection detained       203,598 migrants crossing from Mexico, the latest figures       show, putting authorities on pace to tally more than 2.3       million arrests during the government's 2022 fiscal year,       which ends Sept. 30. The total, which includes some people       apprehended more than once, far exceeds last year's record of       more than 1.7 million arrests.        The historic migration wave this year has been driven by       soaring numbers of border-crossers from outside Mexico and       Central America, the two largest traditional sources of       illegal entries. Migrants from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba       accounted for more than one-third of those taken into custody       along the southern border last month, according to Customs       and Border Protection, a 175 percent increase over August       2021.  [[Page H8176]]         Biden administration officials blamed the governments of       those countries, whose strained relations with Washington       severely limit the ability of authorities to send them       deportees. Many of the migrants apply for humanitarian       protection in the United States and tend to have strong       asylum claims.        ``Failing communist regimes in Venezuela, Nicaragua, and       Cuba are driving a new wave of migration across the Western       Hemisphere, including the recent increase in encounters at       the southwest U.S. border,'' Customs and Border Protection       Commissioner Chris Magnus, said in a statement. ``Those       fleeing repressive regimes pose significant challenges for       processing and removal,'' he said, using the official term       for deportations.        Biden administration officials continue to insist they are       building a ``safe, orderly and humane'' immigration system       while blaming the Trump administration for ``dismantling''       channels for legal migration.        Critics say Biden administration officials have fallen far       short of meeting their refugee admission goals, and the       number of migrants who have died this year attempting to       cross into the United States is at an all-time high. Scores       have drowned in the Rio Grande in recent months, and 53 were       killed in June when smugglers in Texas packed migrants into a       sweltering tractor trailer with a failing cooling system.        Republican lawmakers blame the record number of crossings       on President Biden's reversal of Trump administration border       policies. Over the past several months, the Republican       governors of Texas and Arizona have sent more than 10,000       migrants on buses to Washington, New York and other northern       destinations to put pressure on Democrats by straining relief       services in their jurisdictions.        Last week, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) shipped a       planeload of Venezuelans to Martha's Vineyard in       Massachusetts, transporting them to a wealthy island enclave       with limited services for migrants.        Biden administration officials also say the high border       numbers are distorted by repeat crossing attempts by migrants       who have been previously arrested. Last month, 22 percent of       those taken into custody had a prior arrest in the previous       12 months, the latest figures show.        One factor Biden administration officials blame for the       repeat crossings is the Title 42 emergency public health       policy, implemented at the start of the pandemic, that allows       U.S. agents to rapidly ''expel'' some migrants back to       Mexico. The Biden administration's attempt to phase out Title       42 was blocked in federal court last spring.        The latest figures show the percentage of border-crossers       expelled under Title 42 has been falling and remains far       lower under Biden than President Donald Trump. About 36       percent of the 203,598 migrant ``encounters'' resulted in an       expulsion last month, down from 83 percent when Biden took       office.        Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), said Monday that the strain on       Democratic-run cities will force the administration to see       the border surge as a crisis. ``Maybe, just maybe, they'll       see that what's happening along our border every day is       dangerous, unsustainable, and a problem that we need to work       on together to address,'' he said.        Biden officials defending the administration's border       record pointed to a decline in the number of Mexican and       Central American migrants arrested over the past three months       as a sign their enforcement policies are having some success,       including efforts to target smuggling organizations in Latin       America.     Mr. Speaker, the numbers don't lie. If the annual  number of apprehensions at the border is set to break records, that  means fewer migrants are making it into the country. The notion that  Biden is doing nothing is just absolutely not true.   Just secondarily, my good friend and co-chair of the Cancer Survivors  Caucus from Georgia, we have a wonderful relationship. On this I agree,  but I disagree on the process. As somebody who has spent a lot of time  on opioid abuse, and we know that in our experience with people like  myself who survived cancer, particularly more painful ones, that is a  product when used properly that can bring relief to people, but we know  about the abuse. As you said, a lot of that led to fentanyl.   We are against illegal drugs hurting Americans. We want to support  effective remedies to that. I would say that one of the most effective  things we can do--having had a long experience personally and  professionally in behavioral health--is to invest in the kind of bill  we have in front of us--with all due respect, with my name on it--to  get upstream, so we make sure that people have the resources, evidence- based resources. So it is not as subjective to get the services they  need to protect themselves in an, unfortunately, far-too-free market  when it comes to the abuse of both legal and illegal drugs.   With all due respect, again, I am happy to work with the gentleman,  but I really think, from my perspective, it is an argument to engage in  the investment in behavioral health and mental health services. I will  still work with the gentleman to make sure people aren't bringing these  awful products across our border.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I would say in brief response that I have great respect,  obviously, for our emergency responders. I appreciate what the  gentlewoman's husband does for a living and what they have to go  through. We all agree that we have to support thoughtful oversight to  stop these drugs from getting into the hands of people who it can do  great damage.   I have been to the border multiple times, both as a Member of  Congress and as a member of the California State Legislature. We have a  problem, and it has been a problem through Republican administrations  and Democratic administrations, both in State houses in the border  States and here in Washington, D.C.   We are not for open borders. We want to stop people being harmed by  illicit drugs. So the idea that we are not, I would respectfully say  that is not accurate.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I will read a few numbers, particularly on the part of the rule that  is the Mental Health Matters Act, which I am proud to be the author of  with Chairman Scott.   Suicide is the second leading cause of death for ages of Americans 10  to 24; second for 12 to 18.   For adolescents, depression, substance abuse, and suicide are  extremely important concerns--an epidemic, I would say--among  adolescents age 12 to 17.   In 2018 to 2019, 15.1 percent of young Americans had major depressive  episodes; 36.7 had persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness; 4.1  had a substance abuse disorder; 18 percent seriously considered  attempting suicide; 16 percent made a suicide plan; and 10 percent  attempted suicide.   Madam Speaker, 10 percent of America's young people have attempted  suicide; 2.5 percent made suicide attempts requiring medical treatment.   For all those reasons, the part of the rule that is the Mental Health  Matters Act is extremely important to this country. Is it perfect? Of  course not, from every perspective of 535 Members of Congress and 435  Members of the House. But the need is too urgent, in my view, to wait.  That is why it is so important that not just this rule passes but the  bill is passed.   We need to put resources in the FTC with the most income inequality  and consolidation of wealth through mergers. Not always in our best  interest. It is important that the FTC has the resources it needs to  actually enforce the statutes as they currently have.   Madam Speaker, we need to help Americans, and specifically teachers  and students, get back to doing what they do best, teaching and  learning.   The legislation before us on the rule will help provide the resources  to improve mental health outcomes and educational attainment.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1396         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 11. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 6184) to amend the Controlled Substances Act with       respect to the scheduling of fentanyl-related substances, and       for other purposes.
