 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding the time, and for all of her effort and help in making sure  this bill passes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my legislation that  addresses a dangerous and deadly public safety issue by directing the  Consumer Product Safety Commission to establish a standard for  requiring flame mitigation devices to be used in portable fuel  containers and to help educate our communities about the dangers of  flame jetting.   This issue is very personal to me. I met with local fire officials  and Margrett Priest Lewis, a mother and constituent. Margrett's  daughter, along with her twin sister and a few friends, were roasting  marshmallows. Their portable fireplace used a common biofuel that,  unfortunately, did not have a flame mitigation device. As Margrett's  daughter went to refuel the outdoor fireplace, the fuel exploded from  the bottle in a process called flame jetting, which you heard about  earlier. Portable fuel containers are found in households across  America and, yet, even when used correctly, like in the case of  Margrett's family, present a risk for severe injury and, in some cases,  death.   This story of survival and Margrett's advocacy on behalf of burn  survivors  [[Page H7729]]  has inspired my legislation, and she has been the driving force behind  this bill.   Flammable or combustible liquids cause over 160,000 fires per year,  $1.5 billion in property damage, and some 4,000 injuries and over 450  deaths every year. These accidents can happen in any community, and the  results can be devastating. These accidents are caused when fuel vapors  flash back and ignite the container contents, leading to flame to flame  jetting or explosions. These accidents are easily preventable.   Flame mitigation devices can prevent accidents caused by flammable  vapors igniting within liquid containers. While workplace safety  regulations govern the use of approved flame mitigation devices in  flammable liquid containers for industrial use, there is no requirement  for consumer containers used in homes, campsites, or schools across our  country.   This bipartisan solution is supported by a broad coalition, including  the American Burn Association, the Congressional Fire Services  Institute, the International Association of Fire Fighters,  International Association of Fire Chiefs, National Volunteer Fire  Council, National Fire Protection Association, the Consumer Federation  of America, the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors, the Portable Fuel  Container Manufacturers Association, and the National Association of  State Fire Marshals.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the National Association of  State Fire Marshals' letter of support.                                             National Association of                                             State Fire Marshals,                                   Maitland, FL, September 16, 2019.      Hon. Mike Thompson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Thompson: The National Association of       State Fire Marshals (NASFM) membership comprises the most       senior state fire officials in the United States, with a       primary mission of protecting human life, property and the       environment from fire and related public safety issues.       Therefore, NASFM strongly endorses H.R. 806, Portable Fuel       Container Safety Act of 2019.        Flammable or combustible liquids cause over 160,000 fires       per year, causing $1.5 billion in property damage, almost       4,000 injuries and 454 deaths annually. These accidents can       happen in any community, and the results can be devastating.        Flame Mitigation Devices (FMD), such as flame arresters,       can help prevent accidents caused by flammable vapors       igniting within the liquid container, causing an explosion or       flash fire. While workplace safety regulations govern the use       of approved flame arresters in flammable liquid containers       for industrial use, there is no requirement for consumer       containers used in homes, camp sites, and schools across the       country.        H.R. 806, Portable Fuel Container Safety Act of 2019 would       address this gap by directing the Consumer Product Safety       Commission to establish a standard for requiring FMDs to be       used in these containers and reduce the risk of catastrophic       accidents.        Thank you again for your leadership, NASFM looks forward to       working with you to enact into law this important fire safety       prevention legislation.            Sincerely,                                                      Jim Narva,                                                 Executive Director,                       National Association of State Fire Marshals.     Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member of this  body to keep our constituents and their children safe by passing this  bipartisan, commonsense consumer safety bill.   I thank the cosponsor, Mr. Joyce of Ohio, and, again, Chairwoman  Schakowsky, for helping move this bill through her subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote in favor of this bill.
