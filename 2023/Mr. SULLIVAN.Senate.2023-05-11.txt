 Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for that  heartfelt welcome here on the Senate floor.   I know the Presiding Officer is excited, and I know the pages are  excited. Heck, half of America is excited because, once again, it is  Thursday afternoon, and I am back on the floor giving probably my  favorite speech of the week, the ``Alaskan of the Week.'' As many of  you know, it is an opportunity for me as I love to come down to the  Senate floor and brag about somebody in my State who makes it such a  great State. Usually, it is somebody who is doing something good for  their local community, maybe for the State, maybe for the country,  maybe for the world.   Boy, we have had so many famous Alaskans of the Week, but this one--  [[Page S1619]]  this one, my colleagues--is really special. It is about real special  heroism that we see in Alaska a lot. It is about a young man named  Andrew Chapoton. I am going to talk a lot about Andrew--he is an Army  soldier up in Alaska--and how his bravery and heroism saved some lives  in a way that is just remarkable. But I always like to begin my speech  by talking a little bit about what is going on in Alaska.   I try to get home with Julie, my wife.   Hi, Julie.   She is up in the Gallery. Am I allowed to do that? I am doing it  anyway.   Anyway, pretty much every weekend we have been home. Boy, over the  last couple of weekends, I was out on an epic--epic--Kodiak hunting  trip. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to partake in one of our  State's most cherished traditions. It was an experience I won't forget.  I will never forget it.   Kristin Wilson, if you are watching, I know you love bears, and I  love bears too. She is a big fan of the ``Alaskan of the Week.''   But I also like to talk about what is going on with the weather.   It is still pretty cold in a lot of places, but the Sun is higher in  the sky. It is actually getting really high. The days are getting  longer and longer. Today, in Anchorage, the Sun rose at 5:30 a.m., and  it will set tonight at around 10:30 p.m., gaining more than 5 minutes  since yesterday. So sunlight is really increasing rapidly. Birds are  migrating by the tens of thousands. The excitement of spring is in the  air. Winter is finally retreating. We love winter in Alaska, but, boy,  we had a long, cold winter in most places.   So, if you are watching, by the way, in the Gallery or on TV, come up  to Alaska. It will be the trip of a lifetime. I guarantee you it will  be the trip of a lifetime.   Now let's get to our Alaskan of the Week, SFC Andrew Chapoton, and  the heroic actions he took last May--about a year ago--that earned him  the U.S. Army Soldier's Medal. That is the highest honor a soldier can  receive for an act of heroism in a noncombat situation.   Andrew was born and raised in the township of Clinton, MI, but he  knew that he was always going to join the military. Being in the  military, from his perspective and his family's perspective, was a  good, honorable thing to do. Of course, he is right. His father fought  in Vietnam, and his grandfather fought in World War II. Both of his  sisters are in the Army. So he enlisted when he got out of high school  and did a number of deployments--three tours to Iraq, a deployment to  Haiti--and then was stationed in Alaska from 2015 to 2018 as part of  the 4th Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division. It is what we call in  Alaska the 4-25. I am a marine, but the 4-25 sure is one of my favorite  units in the entire U.S. military, but that is a story for another day.  I love the 4-25.   Andrew and his wife love Alaska--the hiking, the camping.   He said:         Everything [is] available right outside my front door.    So they were determined to come back to Alaska. They bought a house  in beautiful Eagle River, outside of Anchorage. They did come back. In  2021, he came back to Alaska where we now have the storied U.S. 11th  Airborne Division. A lot of people don't know that. We stood up an  airborne division in Alaska just last year, so now we have the 82nd  Airborne Division on the east coast and the 11th Airborne Division in  Alaska. Andrew and his wife, now with two children and another one on  the way, love Alaska.   So what did Andrew do to win the Army Soldier's Medal? Here is how  the Army described it in the summary of that medal:         Sergeant First Class Andrew Chapoton voluntarily risked his       own life in the heroic pursuit of saving others at a deadly       car wreck near Seward, Alaska. His extraordinary act of valor       exemplified the highest standards of selfless service and       character as he repeatedly put himself in mortal danger to       save others trapped in a horrific . . . car wreck. SFC       Chapoton dived into the burning vehicles again and again to       save three trapped occupants, without [any] regard for his       own life [or his own safety].    So that is the summary.   Here is the longer version of why this great American, great Alaskan,  is today's Alaskan of the Week.   Last May, Andrew and his wife had an out-of-town visitor who wanted  to go whale watching. OK. That is something we do in Alaska. It is  amazing. It is a great thing to do in our State. So one of the great  places to whale watch is out of Seward, which is a few hours south of  Anchorage. He almost didn't go as he had done that tour often, but in  his words, he caved and said: Let's go do it.   So they all went. Their friend, his spouse, and their two kids got in  the car and headed to Seward. They had a great time. By the way, it is  another great thing to do in Alaska--whale watching. They saw a lot of  whales, and they were celebrating the trip on the way back.   Then something tragic--horrible--happened. On the Seward Highway, two  cars collided--a Jeep and a Dodge Dakota--almost right in front of his  car. He had to swerve to miss them. It was a nasty, horrible crash.  Debris went flying; smoke was billowing from both cars; and gasoline  was dripping out of these cars. But Andrew didn't continue to drive. He  pulled over on the shoulder, jumped out of his car, and without  thinking, in his words, ``as cliche and corny as it sounds, 18 years of  training kicked in, and I ran toward the scene of the accident.'' That  is what Andrew said. As a result, he saved the lives literally of three  people.   Now, he doesn't even have a memory of how he got from his car to the  accident--training, bravery, heroism--but he does remember approaching  the first car, the Dakota. He was flagging people down and yelling for  a medic. There were three people in the Dakota, but none of them were  moving, and the car was bursting into flames. He tried to smash the  driver's door open. He had to move the camping equipment that had  fallen on the driver, and he was able to get her safely out of the car.   At this point, the car was engulfed in flames, but he went back in  and got another person out of the car and to safety, which was so  difficult because the car door had been smashed and crushed.  Unfortunately--and we know this is hard for Andrew. I hope he is  watching, by the way, and his family--he went back again but could not  save the third person. The door was also crushed, and he couldn't open  it. He couldn't find a pulse. He says it haunts him to this day.   But, again, Andrew's instincts and training kicked in, and he  transitioned to getting the driver out of the other burning car, the  burning Jeep. After he got that passenger out, he performed Combat  Lifesaver triage and lifesaving medical care for these three very  seriously wounded Americans.   This story of heroism doesn't end there.   Both cars, by now, had turned into raging infernos. Flaming liquid  was flowing down the road and toward one of the injured passengers.  With the help of another Good Samaritan, Andrew moved one of the  gravely injured passengers away from the impending explosion of this  car. Then he shielded her body when the car did explode. Debris and  shrapnel were flying everywhere. Even after the fire department  arrived, Andrew continued to take the lead in performing lifesaving  medical treatment.   Eventually, a Life Flight helicopter arrived to take the seriously  injured individuals to the hospital. Andrew stayed and gave his  statement to the troopers. He handed his keys to his wife, got back in  his car, and drove back home several miles--a couple of hours--to  Anchorage. It was a quiet ride.   He said:         I used up every single ounce of adrenalin that was in my       38-year-old body.   His children saw much of what happened, and they are proud of their  father, and Andrew is proud and so deserving to receive the Army  Soldier's Medal. But he did say he would trade that in a thousand times  over if only all the passengers had survived.   These are the kind of people who live in Alaska--brave, selfless, and  heroic. And these are the kind of people--by the way, America--who make  up our military. Not every American citizen would have done what Andrew  just did. As a matter of fact, I would say most people probably  wouldn't--people who risk their lives, their own lives, whether it is  protecting Americans at home or people abroad, so that others could  live. That is what our military members do.  [[Page S1620]]    This is how the Army summed up this heroic action:         SFC Chapoton's ability to perform these heroic acts under       extreme pressure while simultaneously taking control of the       scene [of this horrific crash] is a testament to his [U.S.]       Army values. [Fundamentally] understanding the extreme       personal risk to his own life, SFC Chapoton selflessly       endangered himself again and again to save American lives. He       risked his own safety to help avert a catastrophic outcome.       Without his selfless courage in the face of grave danger,       more lives would have been lost.    So thank you, Andrew, for your bravery, your heroism, your example,  not just to your friends and family or to Alaskans but to all Americans  and all veterans. Thank you for protecting our Nation. Thank you for  volunteering to serve. Thank you for making your home in Alaska. Thank  you for your heroic actions on that day. We want to congratulate you  for being awarded the U.S. Army Soldier's Medal, one of the highest  honors a soldier can achieve and, certainly, Andrew, one of the highest  honors you can achieve in the U.S. Senate: being our Alaskan of the  Week. Great job.   I yield the floor.
