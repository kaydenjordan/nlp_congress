 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about a recent  trip to McAllen, Texas, where I had the opportunity to tour the  southern border. What stuck out to me most was hearing from border  agents about the sheer volume of fentanyl that is being seized right  now.   In fact, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that 1,053  pounds of fentanyl was seized at the southwest border in June alone.  That is more than the last three Junes combined.                                time  1015    Following my trip, I introduced an amendment at a Judiciary Committee  markup to ensure that penalties are maintained for criminals convicted  of fentanyl possession. This amendment should have been a slam dunk,  but it was not adopted.   I question or challenge my colleagues who voted against this. We must  find a way of stopping the flow of fentanyl. However, I suspect because  most do not want to confront this issue at the border, that they are  not going to address this issue.   In the absence of action, there is going to be no winners on this  issue, only families who continue to grapple with the consequences  firsthand.                            ____________________
