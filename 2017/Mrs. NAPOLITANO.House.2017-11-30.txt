 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pallone and Mr. Shimkus for  their hard work.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of the  Environmental Protection Agency's brownfields program, H.R. 3017, a  highly successful program by all accounts.   In the past two Congresses, the Subcommittee on Water Resources and  Environment has evaluated the program  [[Page H9545]]  in multiple hearings. What we have learned each time is that the  program continues operating, as it has since its creation, very  efficiently and successfully.   Data provided by the EPA shows that, since its inception, the  brownfields program has leveraged more than 122,800 jobs and over $23.6  billion in cleanup and redevelopment funding. For every dollar of  brownfields funding--Federal funding--more than 16 other public and  private dollars are leveraged on a national level, and more than eight  jobs are leveraged for every $100,000 of EPA brownfields funds  expended.   It is undeniable that this program is working as it should and that  communities across the Nation are benefiting from the investment of the  Federal dollars in this program.   The changes made to the program in this bill before the House today  will improve it and increase the flexibility with which communities  will be able to utilize the program.   Although I support the bill, I am puzzled by this body's reluctance  to increase the funding for a very successful program for the  brownfields. This program's successes have been continually hindered by  insufficient funds, as you have heard from other speakers.   By the EPA's own estimates, over the past 5 years, funding  deficiencies have caused 1,676 viable proposals to go unfunded. These  sites are not only sitting idle and unproductive, but we are missing  out on the return on the investment that these sites could realize. In  fact, had these proposals received funding, it is estimated those  grants would have leveraged approximately 54,680 jobs and over $10.3  billion in public and private financing.   This begs the question: Why aren't we investing more in the  redevelopment of brownfields space?   If this is the success rate of an underfunded program, imagine the  potential economic impact and potential for job creation that could  come from fully funding the program.   Nevertheless, the program received bipartisan support, and I am  pleased to support the legislation to reauthorize the program and  improve its success.   I also plan to continue working on the issue of ensuring that local  governments maintain their existing obligation to exercise care in  preventing potential exposure of our citizens to hazardous substances  found on brownfields sites.                                time  1500    In reconciling the differences between H.R. 3017 and H.R. 1758--the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's reported brownfields  reauthorization bill--a provision in H.R. 1758 requiring communities to  maintain an appropriate level of care in association with the liability  protections was dropped from the bill.   I will continue to push for the restoration of this protection, and  will continue to move through Congress. Again, I support the program.
