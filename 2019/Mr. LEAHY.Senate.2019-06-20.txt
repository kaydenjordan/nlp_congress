 Mr. President, I have spent much of my career in the  Senate working to eradicate landmines, which kill and maim far more  civilians than combatants. These insidious, inherently indiscriminate  weapons often remain active for years or even decades after the  fighting has ended and the soldiers have left, lying in wait for the  unsuspecting footstep of a child on her way to school, or a farmer  working in a field.   In 1997, the Yemeni Government signed the Mine Ban Treaty which  outlaws the production, stockpiling, export, and use of anti-personnel  mines. With the help of international donors, they made great strides  in humanitarian demining, to the point that, by 2012, they were on the  cusp of declaring the country landmine free. Unfortunately, the civil  war between the Houthi rebels supported by Iran, and the Yemeni  Government supported by the Saudi-led coalition, changed everything.  The use of landmines made a resurgence, due to Iranian mines that the  Houthis have planted by the thousands throughout the country. More than  9,000 Yemenis have reportedly been killed or injured by landmines, the  overwhelming majority of them innocent civilians.   Children are especially vulnerable to mine accidents. They run and  play; they explore open fields; they are curious about strange objects.  Most children who step on a landmine will die from loss of blood before  they can obtain medical attention, and the survivors often do not have  access to the specialized care and support they need. Even children who  do not become victims are affected by landmines in their communities.  They cannot play or go to school without fearing for their lives, and  they suffer from malnutrition when militants turn farmland into  minefields.   As I have said many times before, the use of landmines is an affront  to civilized societies. Regardless of who uses them, they are an  illegitimate weapon, triggered by the victim, and are often used to  terrorize and brutalize the innocent. They impede development for  decades, even generations. In Vietnam today, for example, landmines  continue to kill and injure civilians 44 years after the war ended. The  Houthis' use of landmines cannot be justified any more than their use  of child soldiers and other violations of the laws of war, and should  stop immediately.   Similarly, the United States should stop supporting Saudi Arabia's  indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which has caused thousands of civilian  casualties. This war will not be won militarily, and the longer it  drags on the more innocent people will pay the price, with their limbs,  their livelihoods, and their lives.   The Department of State is supporting efforts to help locate and  destroy landmines in Yemen, but far more needs to be done. Even though  [[Page S4164]]  the Yemeni army, the UN Development program, and nongovernmental  organizations have cleared more than 300,000 mines in the country, it  is estimated that at least 1 million remain.   The Leahy War Victims Fund, administered by the U.S. Agency for  International Development, has provided artificial limbs, wheelchairs,  rehabilitation, and vocational assistance to landmine survivors in many  countries, and could be used in Yemen.   Yemen was an impoverished country before Iran and Saudi Arabia  decided to go to war there, which has caused immense suffering among  the Yemeni people. War crimes have been committed by both sides, and by  providing weapons to the Saudis, we also are implicated. Every effort  should be made to pressure the Houthis to stop using landmines and  child soldiers, and the Saudis to stop their bombing of civilian areas.  The Department of State should increase its support for humanitarian  demining in Yemen, and the U.S. Agency for International Development  should increase its support for organizations that help mine victims  rebuild their lives.                            ____________________     Mr. President, tomorrow, I will be back home in  Burlington, VT, to take part in a joyous occasion. In an afternoon  ceremony at the Ethan Allen Homestead, I will attend a naturalization  ceremony in which 14 new Americans from 11 countries will be  administered the Oath of Allegiance. The participants will be  surrounded by family and friends as they stand proudly next to the  American flag and formally became U.S. citizens. It will be an honor to  stand with them.   As we celebrate these immigrants who will join our ranks as American  citizens, today, on World Refugee Day, we must not forget the plight of  millions of refugees who have not been as fortunate. Right now, there  are over 70 million people across the globe who have been forcibly  displaced from their home countries by the horrors of persecution, war,  famine, and chaos. In 2018 alone, nearly 13.8 million people were newly  displaced, meaning that 25 people were forced to flee their homes every  single minute of 2018. Nearly half of all refugees are children under  the age of 18, many of them just infants and toddlers.   On World Refugee Day, we must recommit ourselves to the hallowed  American tradition of being a refuge for the persecuted and the  oppressed. Welcoming refugees with dignity is not a Democratic or a  Republican priority; it is the American way. We are a better country  for it. No single administration will ever be able to erase that from  our DNA as a nation of refugees and immigrants.   I couldn't think of a better way to highlight the indelible  contributions of immigrants and refugees to our society than to share a  personal story that my good friend, U.S. District Court Judge Bill  Sessions, recently offered at a naturalization ceremony at Vermont's  State House marking the 17th anniversary of 9/11. Judge Sessions'  remarks came just months after he suffered a life-threatening injury,  only to later discover that the medical professionals who helped save  his life were the very same immigrants he had sworn in as American  citizens years earlier.   I for one, am most grateful that they were here in America to save  his life.   I ask unanimous consent that Judge Sessions' statement be printed in  the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Statement of U.S. District Court Judge William K. Sessions III, Vermont            State House Naturalization Ceremony--Sept. 11, 2018         I am going to tell you my story. Of course I'm not going to       tell you my whole life story, just that part which relates to       my injury and illness a number of months ago. So on one level       I will share with you my story, my experience. But it really       isn't about me. It's about all those who came to my aid. It's       about wonderful people who have recently moved here to this       country to pursue their dreams, and it's about what these       folks do for all of us.        I've been a federal judge since 1995, about 24 years. One       of my favorite parts of the job is to preside at       naturalization ceremonies. Over the years, I've had       ceremonies, in courtrooms, schools, museums, on boats and in       legislative halls. Currently, there are 24 such ceremonies       performed each year in Vermont, and between 700 and 800       people are sworn in as American citizens. I do two a year,       aboard the Ticonderoga at Shelburne Museum and in the State       House on September 11th of each year. The State House       ceremony is very special. Patrick Leahy and I organized the       first such ceremony on the first anniversary of the September       11th attack as a statement that we cherish what immigrants       bring to this country, that our welcome to new citizens will       not be diminished by the acts of terrorists. It's a large       group of between 60 and 80 applicants for citizenship. We       have held ceremonies on September 11th of each year ever       since.        Naturalization ceremonies are joyous celebrations. The new       citizens are from all over the world. In fact these       ceremonies often evolve into celebrations of their own       cultural traditions. Many come in their native dress, and all       of their families share in their celebration. They come up       after the ceremony for pictures with me. My photo must rest       on hundreds of mantles.        There are a couple of themes that seem universal. First,       they are all very happy. For many, this day is the       culmination of a long struggle. Many have come from refugee       camps in Bhutan or Nepal or war-torn areas, such as Somalia       or Bosnia. Some were raised in Communist countries, including       Russia, China and the Eastern Bloc countries. Some were from       Central and South America, having come here to escape       violence at home, and others were from Europe or Canada. They       speak about their dreams of America. The American dream is so       inspirational for so many new citizens: hope, freedom,       education, employment. It is inspirational for us who have       lived here all of our lives to be reminded that so many look       to this country as a beacon of hope. And we are a multi-      cultural community. We take pride in our diversity. The       infusion of rich cultural traditions is in many ways our       lifeblood.        At the same time, naturalization ceremonies mark       transitions from their homes and extended families to our       community, and that transition is hard. They bring with them       such rich cultural traditions, but often they see in their       children the influence of the western community. Fernanda       spoke to this--you feel caught between two worlds.        But where do they go after being naturalized? There have       been over 12,000 new citizens sworn in since I have been a       judge. That's a very significant portion of our whole       community. Yet I never understood where they go. How do they       integrate into our Western culture? Just what were they doing       here that impacts all of us? Now I have a much greater       understanding of what they contribute for all of us.        Now to my story. In late February, Abi and I were skating       on the frozen fields of Blue Ledge farm, our daughter's and       son-in-law's property. I took a fall backwards, striking my       head on the ice. The sound could be heard throughout the       county. I gathered myself. I seemed to have a headache, but       not more. We skated back to the car. I of course did nothing.        Over the next two months I occasionally had minor       headaches. It seemed like nothing more than a distraction.       Things changed on a Sunday night in May. I had trouble       speaking. Abi wanted to take me to the nearby ER, I said I'd       visit a doctor the next day. John Barstow called. He in his       own blunt way ordered I go to the ER. Two vs. one, so we went       Sunday night. A CT scan was done and sent to the University       of Vermont Medical Center. A neurosurgeon reviewed it and       sent back the following message: I had massive bleeding in       the brain, I was to be transported to Burlington, and he had       scheduled brain surgery for 4 that morning.        So I remember very well meeting the neurosurgeon outside of       the operating room. He explained the presence of blood and       the movement of the brain from the pressure. He then waited       for my response, but I couldn't answer him. I could not       speak, I couldn't make a sound. He was an older man, almost a       contemporary of mine. He put his hand on mine and said in a       very kind way: ``We're going to make you all better.'' I       could only nod.        I spent close to a month in the hospital, rotating between       UVM Medical Center and Fanny Allen. One of my first       observations was that people who took care of me were from       all over the world. Those included nurses, medical       technicians, and support staff. I just loved talking with       them about their stories. They all had such pride in their       cultural heritage. And they had such hope for their life here       in the United States.        One day one of my favorite nurses said to me: ``You       probably don't remember me, but you swore me in as an       American citizen.'' I didn't remember her, but I felt an       immediate connection. The ceremonies were special to both of       us, and I felt a joy and a level of comfort that she was       taking care of me. Also there was such a sense of small       world.        During my hospitalization I had a number of setbacks that       are common with this type of operation. Those setbacks took       away my strength. They also impacted my ability to walk and       to speak. I began occupational and physical therapy and       speech pathology to relearn those skills. On the second day       of meeting my occupational therapist, she told me that I had       sworn her in as a citizen on September 11th at a State House       ceremony. She brought the program for the ceremony the next       day. Yes indeed, I was the judge who performed her ceremony.       And in the course of my rehabilitation, I met a number of       therapists, many of whom were either naturalized citizens or       were married to naturalized citizens. So the answer to my       original  [[Page S4165]]       question: Where do immigrants go to integrate into the       community? Many go in to the health care community.        But then how about the neurosurgeon? He had reviewed the CT       scan, ordered that I be transported to Burlington. He       scheduled surgery at 4 a.m., and waited all night to perform       the operation. And he was so kind to me before the operation.        My follow-up appointment with him was one month after the       operation. Abi and I went to his office. A CT scan was done,       which he showed us. The bleeding had stopped, the blood was       all gone, and the brain had moved back to where it was       supposed to be, about 2.2 cm. He then said to both of us:       ``You will make a full recovery.'' As he was leaving the       room, I said to him: ``Doctor, thank you for saving my       life.'' He stopped, looked directly at me and said: ``You're       welcome. And thank you, Judge.'' I had no idea why he would       thank me and asked for what. His response: ``On September       11th, 2006, on the fifth anniversary of the attack on New       York and Washington, at a ceremony at the State House in       Montpelier, you swore me in as an American citizen. It was a       very special day for me.''        So what have I learned from my experience? Immigrants bring       to us their stories, the richness of their cultural       traditions. This makes our community so much more diverse and       interesting. We all benefit so much by their presence.        But now I look at the group being sworn in as citizens in a       different light. Among the group may be nurses, medical       technicians and aides who care for us when we are our most       vulnerable; there may be therapists and speech pathologists       who work to restore us who have been injured to our previous       health; there may be doctors and surgeons who make life-      altering decisions that may save our lives; there may be       teachers and principals who care for and educate our       children; there may be civil rights lawyers who defend our       liberties, and police officers who protect us in the       community. With the exception of native Americans we or our       ancestors made that same voyage, often with those same       dreams. We are them and they are us. We need to welcome them,       but we also should thank them for all they do to make our       community a safer, healthier and richer place in which to       live.
