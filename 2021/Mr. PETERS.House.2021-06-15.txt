 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I introduced the Ocean Pollution Reduction Act II, or  OPRA II, for three reasons: one, to ensure that the Point Loma  Wastewater Treatment Plant's waiver process is fair and efficient; two,  to further reduce the facility's pollution output to the ocean; and  three, to increase our region's freshwater supply.   The city's proposed wastewater recycling plan, the Pure Water  Program, will guarantee the region's water security and further reduce  the amount of wastewater that flows into the ocean from the plant.   OPRA II requires that the city of San Diego demonstrate that the Pure  Water Program can produce 83 million gallons of freshwater a day by  2036. This is an estimated one-third of the entire city's drinking  water needs. Over the same period, the program is expected to reduce  treated wastewater flows from the Point Loma plant by over 100 million  gallons.   This bill replaces the complex and expensive secondary treatment  waiver application with a simpler process, as long as the city meets  stringent water recycling milestones.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
