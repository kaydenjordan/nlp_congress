 Mr. Speaker, this week, I was so proud to welcome  President Joe Biden to our district to see firsthand the impact the  American Rescue Plan will have on our community and small businesses in  Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and to see the enthusiasm with which his  visit was welcomed.   Together, we visited Smith Flooring, a successful, minority-owned  small business in Chester that provides good union jobs and is an  economic driver in an area that has struggled. The President and I  spoke with founders Kristin and James Smith about how the COVID  pandemic has impacted their business. The struggling economy has meant  leaner times, but they are trying to do right by their employees until  things get moving again.   The American Rescue Plan has over $50 billion in aid for small  businesses, including over $7 billion for the Paycheck Protection  Program. These funds will help small businesses, like Smith Flooring,  keep up their payroll, protect jobs, and keep going until the economy  is fully open again.   I wanted President Biden to see up close one of the Delco businesses  that is the backbone of our economy. Thank you to Smith Flooring for  talking with President Biden and me. And equally important, I wanted to  thank Congress and President Biden for bringing renewed help and hope  to our community with the American Rescue Plan.                            ____________________
