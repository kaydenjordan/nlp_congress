 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the need for  us to prohibit the physical restraining of young children as a form of  discipline in schools.   Shockingly, in the 2017 through 2018 school year, nearly 71,000  elementary school-aged children were physically restrained. Even worse,  80 percent of the restrained children were kids with disabilities, some  younger than 5 years old, even though they only make up 13 percent of  the student population.   In Texas, 91 percent of all reported restraints are experienced by  children with disabilities. Regrettably, children who are Latino and  Black are at much higher risk of being restrained.   Since 2020, nearly 20 fatalities have occurred because of poor  restraining techniques and children's bodies simply being too small to  endure this form of discipline. This is simply heartbreaking and is  totally unacceptable.   It doesn't appear to be slowing down. Just this month, Moesha Baker,  a mother from the Houston Independent School District, received a  letter from her 4-year-old son's elementary school and was told that he  had been restrained at school. Ms. Baker learned 2 days after the  incident that this restraining had been unjustified and that the  teacher was on administrative leave.   This is a very deeply troubling case. Fortunately, her son was not  physically hurt, but think of the emotional scars that he must endure.  This is, again, totally unacceptable.   Many times children are hurt, like a 10-year-old student from a  charter school in Waco, Texas, who sadly was restrained to the point  that he actually had a broken arm in four places when he was restrained  last month. The child had a learning disability.   Madam Speaker, put yourself in the shoes of these families. One  minute, you are hugging your child, saying goodbye, they are off to  school. The next minute, you get a call that your child has been  restrained, put in handcuffs or zip-tied as a form of discipline. This  is flat wrong, it is inhumane, and it must stop.   Madam Speaker, today, I will be introducing my resolution called the  No Kids in Cuffs Resolution to encourage local and State governments to  prohibit this practice.   Young children who are restrained are more likely to experience  short-term and long-term problems in sleep, learning, relationships,  and trust. In fact, being restrained is so traumatic that it even  impedes a child's development. Many of them go on to struggle with  suicidal thoughts and are forced to live with post-traumatic anxiety.  All of this on top of the physical pain that they may experience.   While the children clearly must be the first we protect, sometimes  teachers, administrators, and officers are also at risk of developing  trauma from just simply witnessing a child being restrained to the  degree that their little arm is broken in four places. It is hard to  endure, it is hard to witness, and this trauma must end.   Let's make sure no other parent must endure what Ms. Baker and  thousands of others families must go through. Let's begin the  conversation of prohibiting the physical restraining of children. Let's  put children over restraints. Let's put books over cuffs.   That is why I am introducing today, Madam Speaker, the No Kids in  Cuffs Resolution, and I ask all my colleagues to help me. We must end  this practice. Children should focus on their books and their learning,  not on cuffs and trauma.                            ____________________
