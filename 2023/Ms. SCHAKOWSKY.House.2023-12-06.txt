 Madam Speaker, it is known that the transportation  sector is responsible for the single largest greenhouse gas emissions.  I choose not to contribute to that. I am the proud owner of a Chevy  Volt, which is a very affordable, all electric vehicle--not one of the  expensive ones that the Republicans like to talk about. It has zero  emissions from the pipe. It is a beautiful little car that most  families could afford.   I would say that the legislation that has been proposed actually  takes choice away from Americans because it says that the EPA will no  longer have the authority to regulate the emissions that are allowed.  This will save lives.   This legislation that has been proposed is absolutely dangerous. What  we know is that if the EPA can conduct its mission, then we would see 7  billion tons of greenhouse gases that would not be in the air. Lives  would be saved.   This legislation is so important. The legislation that Republicans  have proposed would take away the right of Americans to have a safe  environment and health. We say that this legislation is going in  absolutely the wrong direction. We want to be sure that no one will  vote for it. We will protect the lives of Americans, the right of the  mission of the Environmental Protection Agency, and that we will have a  better world to live in. That should be the right that is given to  Americans.
