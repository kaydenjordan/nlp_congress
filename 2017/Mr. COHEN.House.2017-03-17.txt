 Mr. Speaker, I am a proud member of the House of  Representatives. Yet, at the same time, I am embarrassed that, in  somewhat of a Felliniesque nature, we have followed down the rabbit's  hole.   Our current President suggests that President Obama wiretapped Trump  Tower. Our President has the FBI and the intelligence agencies at his  beck and call. He can easily make a phone call and know whether or not  it is true; but, instead, he asks Congress to make an investigation,  and Congress agrees.   This is absurd. It didn't happen. In fact, his security adviser  called the British to apologize for suggesting that the British were  listening in at Trump Tower.   Our Nation needs to be more like it was when George Washington was  President. He was known to have said: ``I cannot tell a lie.''   We need to be straight with the American people. Microwaves cannot  take pictures or surveil your house. The past President is an honorable  man and committed no crime. He should not be accused of such.   I hope this Fellini movie ends quickly.
