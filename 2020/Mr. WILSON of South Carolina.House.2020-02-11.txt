 Madam Speaker, congratulations to  Charles Waites McCabe, a freshman at A.C. Flora High School in  Columbia, son of John and Amanda McCabe.   Next Sunday, Charles will receive the extraordinary award of Eagle  Scout from Troop 10 at Eastminster Presbyterian Church. He is preceded  by his brother, John Franklin McCabe, Jr.; and his first cousins,  Michael Joseph Harty III, Daniel McCabe Harty, and Christopher Robert  McCabe; as well as his uncle, Robert Ainsley McCabe, Jr., in earning  this prestigious honor with the Boy Scouts of America.   Charles has also been elected senior patrol leader in Troop 10,  serving with Scoutmaster Flynn Bowie, as well as being elected to the  Order of the Arrow.   As the father of four sons who are Eagle Scouts, I am grateful to  attend courts of honor such as for Charles. This weekend, it was  inspiring to be with Andrew Talkish at St. Simon and St. Jude Episcopal  Church in Irmo.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism, led by President  Donald Trump.   Congratulations to Coach Dawn Staley on her continuing victories for  the Gamecock women's basketball.                            ____________________
