 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Shuster for yielding.   I rise in very strong support of H.R. 4, the reauthorization bill.   The Subcommittee on Aviation began the reauthorization process over 3  years ago, a very long process. In that time, we have held a series of  roundtables and hearings on the state of the FAA's certification and  safety processes, regulatory efforts, airport grant programs, customer  service, and the air traffic control system.   The subcommittee also had more than 200 stakeholder meetings in order  to gather feedback and hear from various constituencies to understand  what would work in the real world--not what 535 Members of Congress may  think, but to get input from the people who have to make it work every  day.   I want to thank those who came to the table willing to share their  thoughts and to work together with us.   With the passage of H.R. 4, we will be taking an important step  toward ensuring the FAA and our aviation industry does not suffer  through another long series of extensions.   Unfortunately, it seems like just about every year Congress is voting  to keep the government open, while the FAA and nearly 4,000 of the  FAA's incredible employees, who are my constituents working at the  Technical Center in Egg Harbor Township, which is at the Atlantic City  Airport, are forced to make preparations in case they have to shut  down.   Now, just so everybody understands, when we do an extension, we  generally don't act on it until the last minute. These dedicated  employees, these engineers in these laboratories that only exist at  this Tech Center, are forced to stop their work and prepare for a  shutdown. This costs a tremendous amount of dollars each time we do  this. Hopefully, with the passage of this bill, we will be able to  avoid that.   H.R. 4 also provides the long-term authorization of the FAA, which  will allow us to avoid the shutdowns and these threats of shutdowns.  This means that important safety projects will be  [[Page H3595]]  able to move forward without the inefficient starts and stops and they  come without any hesitation, as we have seen in the past.   Most importantly, FAA employees, including, again, dedicated  employees of my Tech Center--now, just keep in mind, this is the  premier facility in the Nation for safety, security, research, and  development. As I mentioned before, these laboratories don't exist  anywhere else. Many of these engineers' expertise doesn't exist  anywhere else. This will enable them to help keep the United States  premier in the world.   Mr. Larsen referenced our position in the world. We don't want that  challenged. We want this bill to be able to allow us as an economic  driver. When you start looking at the numbers of what aviation means to  the economy of the United States, you get an understanding of how  critically important this is.                                time  1300    We have worked closely with a number of constituency groups, and I  think we have included their provisions in this bill.   I want to point out that some of these battles take a while. And very  diligently and very forcefully, the flight attendants have made their  case for the 10-hour rest period. As mentioned by Mr. DeFazio, this is  something that we don't want flight attendants being fatigued no more  than we want pilots being fatigued.   Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Shuster for including this in the bill.   Mr. Chair, as we move forward, I want to particularly thank Rick  Larsen, who has been a great partner. For those who may not be aware,  Rick and I have been together first through the Coast Guard and  Maritime Subcommittee and now through the Aviation Subcommittee. I  think the relationship that we have and what we have been able to do is  a model that can and should be worked for the rest of Congress. It is  one that I cherish and value. And, Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Larsen again  very much.   Mr. Chair, I also want to thank Peter DeFazio for being a good  partner and thank Bill Shuster for helping me become Aviation chair 6  years ago, putting his faith in me. I think we have had a great  partnership. Mr. Shuster has been a great leader in the Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure. I value our relationship. I value  our work together.   Mr. Chair, I urge everyone to support this bill. I think it is going  to move America forward.
