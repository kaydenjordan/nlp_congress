This designation now places Georgia's own Winship Cancer  Institute in the top 1 percent of all cancer centers in the United  States.   Winship Cancer Institute was established in 1937 with a gift from one  of Georgia's generous philanthropists, Robert W. Woodruff, whose  mission was to allow Georgians to get the best cancer treatment in  their home State. He envisioned doctors and researchers working  together in the same facility, so that scientists would be reminded of  the urgency of their work and motivated to bring innovative treatments  to patients. Winship treated 168 patients in its first year. Today  Winship sees more than 15,000 patients every year.   The research being performed at Winship Cancer Institute is  particularly important to Georgians because Winship researchers are  studying the environmental and genetic issues unique to cancer in our  State. Winship's goals are very specific: reducing the risk of cancer  and detecting cancer at the earliest possible stage.   An estimated 50,000 Georgians will be diagnosed with cancer this  year, and approximately a third of them will receive some component of  their treatment at one of Winship's clinical locations in metropolitan  Atlanta.   In recommending Winship for this special designation, former  President Jimmy Carter spoke of the research and work being performed  at Winship that helped save his life after his cancer diagnosis at his  advanced age.   Today Winship continues to stand out because of its commitment to  aligning its outstanding cancer research and education initiatives with  its significant cancer prevention and cancer care efforts. I am proud  to congratulate Winship Cancer Institute on this important milestone,  as its researchers and clinicians continue their mission to lessen the  burden of cancer for the citizens of Georgia.                            ____________________
