 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule for H.R.  7617, the second appropriations package.   The funding included in this bill will advance crucial priorities  like increased broadband access, advancing medical research, and  supporting police reform. These investments are necessary as we  continue to combat the spread of COVID-19 and encourage economic  recovery.   By providing $61 billion in emergency funding to the FCC, we can  expand internet access to unserved and underserved households. As  schools continue to adjust to distance learning, I believe every  student, regardless of their family's ZIP Code or income bracket,  deserves a reliable internet connection to participate in the modern  classroom.   The rule also provides consideration of my amendment to advance  breakthroughs in medical research. My amendment directs an additional  $4.5 million to DOD's Congressionally Directed Medical Research  Program. This program funds high-impact projects, including medical  research for rare diseases like bone marrow failure.   Some of you remember we lost my late husband, Bob Matsui, to MDS, a  bone marrow failure disease. Countless other families across the  country rely on the Defense program's work to discover and develop new  therapies and cures, especially for rare diseases.   I am also very glad that this program dedicates $400 million in grant  funding to help implement needed police reform. This includes pattern  and practice analyses and independent investigations of law enforcement  departments across the country.   While there is still much work to be done, this funding will move us  closer to an America where all are treated equally under the law.   This is a strong comprehensive bill, and I look forward to supporting  it on the floor soon.
