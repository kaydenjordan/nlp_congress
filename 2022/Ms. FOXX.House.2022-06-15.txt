 Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate the staff,  volunteers, and board members of Oak Hill Charter School in Caldwell  County, North Carolina.   The school was unanimously approved by the North Carolina Charter  Schools Advisory Board, and its doors will officially open this August.   This accomplishment is amplified by the fact that Oak Hill is one of  only two accelerated schools to earn this opportunity this year. Let me  tell you, Madam Speaker, this is no small feat.   Recently, I received a heartfelt email from Kelly McIntyre, the board  chair of the school. She marveled at how God has guided the journey of  everyone involved at Oak Hill and how along the way the right people  and resources came together in perfect harmony.   Kelly, I agree with you wholeheartedly. God's hand has been in your  work every step of the way.   Right now, nearly every single class at Oak Hill has a waiting list.  Families are beyond enthusiastic at this opportunity for their  children.   The outpouring of support from the surrounding community must also be  recognized. Donations of furniture, school supplies, and other  essential items continue to stream in on a weekly basis, and volunteers  continue without delay to see projects through.   Madam Speaker, there is a quote from American anthropologist Margaret  Mead that encapsulates the story of Oak Hill perfectly: ``Never doubt  that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the  world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.''   It is clear that these committed citizens are also working in the  will of God. In Kelly's email to me, she remarked that, ``It's the most  amazing thing to see this mission that started as just a thought, a  spark, grow into a force that I believe will be life-changing for  many.''   Madam Speaker, that sentiment is profound, and it is a direct  reflection of the opportunity that charter schools provide across the  country.   Parents, teachers, and communities recognize the value of charter  schools because they challenge a failing status quo. Charter schools  are guaranteed operational autonomy to provide rich alternatives to  students and families. Most importantly, they provide educational  freedom and choice, two fundamental principles that are desperately  needed in education right now.   Instead of being held accountable to the education bureaucracy,  charter schools are accountable to students, families, and their  communities, as they should be, Madam Speaker.   Congratulations again to everyone at Oak Hill Charter School. The  work you will undertake and the opportunities you will provide to our  next generation of leaders in the coming months and years will be  nothing short of spectacular.   May God continue to bless you in your mission of serving the Caldwell  County community.                            ____________________
