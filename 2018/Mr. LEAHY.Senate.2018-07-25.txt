 Mr. President, I simply say to the Senator from Alaska, in  my having had the honor of serving here with both her father and with  the former chair of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, that  I hear her saying things that are very similar to what I had heard both  of them say. Perhaps Senator Stevens--rest his soul--would have said it  with a little bit more emphasis, especially if he had been wearing his  ``Incredible Hulk'' tie, but the Senator from Alaska is one of those  who believes in the Senate working the way it should and getting things  done, and I compliment her efforts.   Senator Shelby and I made a pact that we would try to get these  appropriations bills through, which is something that had been stalled  for years. The Senator from Alaska has been essential, as have been a  number of Senators on both sides of the aisle, in our getting that  accomplished. We have gotten our bills through. Almost all of them have  passed the Appropriations Committee unanimously. I joke that sometimes  you can't get a unanimous vote around here that the Sun will rise in  the East, but here is a case in which we have shown that it can.   The Senator from Alaska is absolutely right in that one person's  poison pill may be another person's essential, but we have worked it  out. If we can get the appropriations bill through--and I realize the  other body is going on a 6-week vacation, but I hope there will be some  who stay around. We are going to be here. We could conference some of  these bills and get them passed. I think it would encourage the country  to see both bodies do what we have done here in the Senate. It would  improve how the government runs.    I share the frustration of heads of Departments, whether here in this  administration or any other administration, who never know whether  their appropriations are going to pass. How do they plan? How do they  spend money? Where do they go?   We can make this process work the way it is supposed to work.   I see the distinguished Democratic leader on the floor, but I do want  to compliment the Senator from Alaska for her efforts in making this  possible.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I totally agree with both the Senator from  Alabama and the Senator from Maine.   First, as they said, this violates the bipartisan agreement this body  made and agreed with the President about the things we would do.  Seventy-three thousand jobs would be cut from the Federal Highway  Administration projects when we need them, including 800,000 low-income  women, infants, and children no longer receiving WIC.   Mr. President, the Paul amendment proposes an 11.39-percent cut in  each of the four bills under consideration. If adopted, it would undo  the bipartisan budget deal the Senate passed and the President signed  into law just a few months ago, and it would undo all of the work that  has gone into crafting the bipartisan bills we are considering today.   More importantly, an 11.39-percent across-the-board cut would have  devastating impacts on programs that are important to millions of  Americans and to our economy.   I would mean a loss of over 73,000 jobs that would otherwise be  created through Federal Highway Administration projects. An 11.3- percent cut to our National Parks would cause steep reductions in  visitor services, law enforcement, and natural resource protection, all  at a time when our National Parks are seeing a dramatic increase in  visitors.   An 11.39-percent cut means 108,000 low-income families, the elderly,  and disabled will lose their HUD rental assistance and be at risk of  becoming homeless. It means 830,000 low-income women, infants, and  children would no longer receive WIC assistance.   These are just a few examples. I urge a no vote on the Paul  amendment.
