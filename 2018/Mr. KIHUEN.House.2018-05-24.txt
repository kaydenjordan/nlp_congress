 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Rocio  Guillen Rocha. Rocio attended the Route 91 festival on October 1 in Las  Vegas.   Rocio would say that her greatest accomplishment was being a mom to  her four kids--Marcus, Christopher, Sofia, and Austin--and being  engaged to her fiance, Chris Jaksha.   Rocio had lived through many major life events. She had given birth  to her youngest child, Austin, just 6 weeks prior to her death, and she  was paralyzed after giving birth to her second child, Christopher.   Rocio was a fighter who worked hard to walk again after being  paralyzed. After a lot of work and training, she eventually was able to  walk again.   Rocio was known as being a supermom who loved supporting her kids  while they played baseball. She was an amazing mom who worked long  hours as an assistant manager at California Pizza Kitchen so she could  take care of her kids.   Rocio had a great sense of humor, and she was always laughing, even  through the tough times. She is remembered for being patient and loving  by all those who knew her.   I would like to extend my condolences to Rocio Guillen Rocha's family  and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of  Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
