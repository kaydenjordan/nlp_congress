 Mr. President, I am here this morning very pleased to  be at this point where we are talking about consideration of an  appropriations package that includes the fiscal year 2020 bills for the  subcommittees on Interior and Environment; Commerce, Justice, and  Science; Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug  Administration; and Transportation and Housing and Urban Development;  and the various related agencies.   It may be premature to call this a return to regular order, but I  think that is kind of what it feels like. I would note that it is  October 23, well past time that we should have finished our  appropriations work, but we are advancing. We have bills that we have  moved through the subcommittees and the full committee, and we are now  moving packages of these to the floor.   I am pleased that we are here, where we have an opportunity to take  up these substantive measures that the full committee has addressed  with strong bipartisan support.   In the case of the Interior and Environment bill, there was unanimous  support for our bill. Then, there is the opportunity to bring the bills  to the floor for consideration, where other Members have an opportunity  to debate these appropriations bills, offer amendments, and, then,  advance them through the process.   I am pleased this morning--particularly pleased--to be able to speak  on the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee bill and to be here with my  ranking member, Senator Udall. We have worked through this subcommittee  account now for several years. It has been a good partnership, a strong  partnership, with our teams working side by side. It is not the easiest  of bills. We get our fair share of controversy.   In addition to taking care of all of our public lands, we also have  oversight of our Native peoples. We also have oversight of the EPA. So  we have a range of subject matters that sometimes can bring us together  and sometimes can cause some bumps along the way. Yet what we have  committed to doing, I think, in working collaboratively, in working  together, has resulted in a good, strong measure that the Senate now  sees before it.    Last year was the first time since fiscal year 2010--9 years now-- that the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations was  brought before the full Senate. We have been in a situation in which,  for years, we have kind of been at the tail end of the line, the last  of those spending bills to move. Now we are debating it in the first  package, so we really feel like we have kind of arrived here. Again,  you don't arrive here as part of the first package without having done  a great deal of work. You don't do that and receive unanimous support  coming out of the committee for the second year in a row now if you do  not demonstrate this strong commitment that both sides have made to  create an environment in which we can work through these issues in a  bipartisan manner.   The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies portion of this  minibus includes funding for all of the major Federal land management  agencies. This includes the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land  Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Forest Service, as well  as the Environmental Protection Agency. We also provide funding for  essential Indian health, education, and resource management programs  through the BIA and the Indian Health Service. Then we also provide  funding and oversight for important cultural institutions, like the  Smithsonian Institution, our National Gallery of Art, the National  Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.  This aspect of our oversight is often kind of forgotten because it  doesn't necessarily fit in with the public lands, with the EPA, with  the BIA, but it is an important and an integral part of our  subcommittee's work.   Our subcommittee's allocation for fiscal year 2020 is $35.8 billion.  This is $248 million more than last year, with an additional $2.25  billion being made available by the wildfire cap adjustment, and I will  speak to the wildfire cap issue a little bit later here. Similar to the  approach that we took in fiscal year 2019, the bill rejects the  proposed budget decreases. We make investments in our highest  priorities, such as infrastructure investments for our land management  agencies, Indian Country, and wastewater and drinking water  improvements.   The Department of the Interior itself is funded at $13.7 billion.  These funds go to support energy development that is critical to our  Nation's economy, to recreation activities that power our rural  communities, and to conservation efforts to protect our public lands  and the wildlife that relies on them. Funding is provided to support an  all-of-the-above energy approach, both onshore and offshore, that will  continue to help our country achieve energy independence.   On the conservation front, investments in grants programs for species  protection, wetlands conservation, and to combat wildlife trafficking  are included. We also took a keen look at some of the invasive species  that are wreaking havoc in certain of our regions, like the Asian carp,  so we provide a lot of good focus there.   Americans love to love our national parks, so this bill provides the  funds that are necessary to meet our responsibility at the national  park units. We also focus on the deferred maintenance, which is  something we have talked a lot about in committee and on the floor. We  invest $127 million for deferred maintenance. We also increase funding  for historic preservation, which is critical to preserving the sites  and the stories of our Nation.   The USGS, the U.S. Geological Survey, receives funding for important  programs that help our emergency responders during natural disasters  like earthquakes or tsunamis. We work within this bill to provide  assistance for responses to natural hazards and disasters as well as to  inform the public. In my State of Alaska, the support for the  Earthquake Hazards Program helps us. As a State that is very  seismically prone, it helps us with warnings, and it helps to enhance  the earthquake monitoring capability. The bill also maintains funding  for mapping initiatives that will help to gather data to improve our  maps, which enhances the safety of activities such as aviation. In  certain parts of the country, believe it or not, we do not have current  and accurate mapping. Certainly, in my home State--and I know in other  parts of the country--the updates to the maps have simply not been  made.  [[Page S6058]]    We also fully fund another lands matter, PILT, which is estimated at  $500 million, and it maintains our commitment to meeting the needs of  local communities for county roads, public safety, and schools. I know  many of us in this Chamber hear from our constituents about the  significance of adequate PILT funding.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund is something that is near and  dear to many in this body. You will see in this bill an increase to the  LWCF, which receives $465 million. This is $30 million above the  enacted level. This also includes $140 million for the NPS State side  program as well as additional funding for recreational access. We focus  on how we are able to access our treasured lands and ensure we have a  level of conservation that is supported across the country.   In working with Senator Udall over these years, I think it has been  important--it has certainly been important for me--to have had a great  partnership, a strong partnership when it has come to trying to meet  the needs of those within Indian Country and having to fund the  critical services. With this bill, I think we are making good measure  to do that. The two primary agencies that deliver services to the  Indian community are the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health  Service. They receive a combined increase of $288 million over the 2019  levels. We maintain all critical program funding with some important  increases for Indian Country.   For the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the BIA, we maintain the  substantial increases we have provided over the last 2 fiscal years. We  are helping on matters such as the construction, operation, and  maintenance of Indian schools. We know, unfortunately, that in so many  of the reservations in the lower 48, our schools are simply inadequate.  The education scores we are seeing from our schools are not where we  need to be. Making sure we are doing right by our Native children  around the country is so important when it comes to education.   We also include funding for irrigation systems. We also fully fund  contract support costs. We increase funding for public safety and  justice facilities construction and programs. Certainly, as I hear from  folks in Alaska and those around Indian Country in the lower 48, public  safety is something by which, again, we are not doing right by those  whom we must serve in these areas. This is an effort that I intend to  continue to push in my going forward.   I would specifically like to point out to my colleagues that for the  very first time, we include a comprehensive look with new funding into  those issues related to murdered and missing indigenous women. Many of  us have been shocked at what we are coming to understand about the  murdered and missing of our Native women around the country. The data  we have we know is lacking. We don't know what we don't know. Thus,  oftentimes it is difficult to respond and to address resources. The  fact is that many who live in Tribal communities are often located in  rural areas that lack public safety, and even though you have high  rates of violence, abuse, murder, trafficking, we simply don't have the  resources there to help to respond to it.   I have been working with several of my colleagues to address these  challenges--Senator Udall, Senator Hoeven, Senator Daines, and so  many--to shine a light in this area. We know it is going to take a lot  of coordination and communication among law enforcement agencies to get  this right. In this bill, we include $6.5 million for cold case  investigations, equipment, training, background checks, and the  necessary report language to move us in the right direction.   Attorney General Barr came to the State of Alaska in May. In  Anchorage, he had an opportunity to sit and listen to statewide  leaders, Native leaders, and law enforcement. He then had an  opportunity to get out of the rural areas and into the villages. After  he left, he declared a public safety emergency in the State of Alaska  because of where we sit. So we have been working with the Attorney  General and greatly appreciate his efforts there, but we need to do  more through these appropriations to look specifically at these issues  as well.   For the Indian Health Service, there are also programs we have an  obligation to fund that are vital to Indian Country. Many of these  programs and the costs associated with them have grown since we enacted  the 2019 bill. Among these are leasing and staffing costs that are  associated with new healthcare facilities that are operated by the IHS  or by Tribes under compact agreements. Our bill funds these new  increases. We provide additional funding for recruitment and quality  improvement as well as providing a $24 million increase for facilities,  including an increase for medical equipment.   The Forest Service receives investments in funding for the improved  health and management of our Nation's forests, including for recreation  assets, such as the cabins so many of us enjoy, the trails on which we  hike, and recreation special use permitting to allow certain businesses  to operate in our national forests in order to enhance the many  recreational experiences and opportunities.   At the beginning of my comments, I mentioned the wildfire cap  adjustment. It was back in the 2018 omnibus that we created the  wildland fire cap adjustment, and fiscal year 2020 is the first year  this is now available. The bill invests $5.167 billion in wildland fire  activity, including $2.25 billion in fire cap adjustment funding.   In my State over this past summer, we certainly saw intense and  extensive fires. It was a recordbreaking heat year this past summer,  and we had some pretty devastating fires. We are still talking about  the fires just last year in California. We know the threat is real, and  we know we have to respond. So making sure we have the capacity to  fight fire is important. In this bill, we not only invest in fire  suppression, but we also invest in State and volunteer fire assistance.  We provide increases for hazardous fuels reductions.   As far as the EPA budget goes, we prioritize funding for the programs  that result in concrete actions to improve the quality of the  environment across our country. The bill provides significant increases  in State and Tribal grant programs, which will lead to tangible, on- the-ground cleanup and environment benefits, which was another priority  that was strongly supported by many in this Chamber.   The priority that was targeted by many in the waters phase was water  infrastructure development. Many of the newly authorized programs in  America's Water Infrastructure Act are funded for the first time in  this measure. Funding is also provided for the Clean Water and Drinking  Water State Revolving Funds and for the WIFIA Program to build and  support critical water infrastructure in communities in every State.  The bill also equips the EPA with a powerful set of tools to further  the Agency's core missions of clean air, clean water, and clean land.   One of the issues I hear a lot about from the folks back home, as  well as from my colleagues in the Senate, is the issue of PFAS and PFAS  contamination. In this bill, we have provided $25 million in increases  to address PFAS, including new funding for State-led cleanup and  remediation efforts. We also focus on the research of human health and  environmental impacts and related priority regulatory actions. There is  a $20 million increase provided for EPA grant programs to support  States in their cleanup and remediation efforts of PFAS-contaminated  water sources as well as the water systems and the lands.   The remaining $5 million in increases will support the EPA's priority  actions on PFAS and supplement the research that other agencies are  currently conducting on the chemicals.   So we heard the concerns of so many, and we really worked to respond  in this measure.   Lastly, the bill includes important increases for our cultural  institutions and our agencies. The Smithsonian Institution, the Gallery  of Art, and the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities all  receive increases in our measure.   I think it is so important to make sure that when we think about our  treasures--clearly our land, the cleanliness of our water, but we also  have national treasures, and we see so much of that reflected in the  arts, whether it is the Smithsonian, the galleries, or what the  Endowment for the Arts and the Humanities do.   Consistent with fiscal year 2019, we do not include new policy  provisions  [[Page S6059]]  that were not in the enacted bill. So we worked with Chairman Shelby,  Vice Chairman Leahy, and the ranking member, again, with Senator Udall,  to assemble a package that both sides supported in committee.   I want to reiterate the work Senator Udall and I put in to produce a  bipartisan product that invests in programs that we care about-- programs that protect our land and our people and enable infrastructure  projects to boost the economy and help communities provide vital basic  services that many might take for granted. We also worked hard to shape  this bill so that it reflects the priorities of Members on both sides  of the aisle. I am proud--I am really very proud--of the good,  bipartisan work to ensure that this Interior appropriations bill  directs the Federal resources to where they are needed most, providing  critical investments in communities across the Nation.   Of course, this Interior bill is just a part of this package. We also  have Commerce-Justice-Science, Agriculture, and T-HUD. All of these  have significant impacts across the country. Certainly in my home  State, we are looking at the Commerce-Justice-Science bill to help keep  our fisheries healthy and provide assistance for public safety  programs.   In the Agriculture bill, there is funding for much needed water  infrastructure in our villages, and it helps expand our ever-growing  agricultural industries.   Of course T-HUD makes sure that rural communities in my State can  still receive things like essential air service and helps with our  ferry transportation system and to provide Tribal housing.   There is so much good in all of these measures. I would commend them  to Members' consideration but would certainly urge passage of this very  important Appropriations bill.   I am pleased to be here with my colleague, the good Senator from New  Mexico.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, as the Senator from Missouri has  stated, this is a significant day. This is a very special day in the  Congress, as later this afternoon we are going to gather to pay tribute  to a truly great Senator, the late Senator Ted Stevens from Alaska. His  official portrait will be unveiled shortly by the U.S. Senate  Commission on Art. It will be part of the U.S. Senate Leadership  Portrait Collection, which honors past Presidents pro tempore and past  leaders. Like all of the family, the friends, the colleagues, and the  former staff who have gathered for this occasion, I am so very pleased  that he will be memorialized forever here in the U.S. Capitol and will  be watching over all of us.    There are only 38 Members who are currently in the Senate who served  with Ted, but I think it is important that all of us--and really every  American--know who he was and why he so clearly deserves this honor.   Ted was a public servant. He was the ultimate public servant. He  dedicated his life to public service. He spent more than six decades  fighting for our State and the country he loved. His service began  during World War II, when he flew as a pilot in the Army Air Corps. He  flew missions behind enemy lines in China in support of the Flying  Tigers. The stories we have heard over the years are truly legendary of  his efforts in the war.   After the military, Ted helped Alaska to achieve its dream of  statehood. He was basically Secretary Seaton's point man at the  Department of the Interior during the Eisenhower administration. Think  about what that means to have the opportunity to shape statehood for  your State and then to go on and serve your State at this level as he  did for some 40 years.   He went on to become one of the longest serving Republican Senators  of all time. In this Chamber, he represented Alaska with great dignity,  with great distinction over the course of 40 exceptional years. He was  truly a public servant.   Really, from the very beginning, Ted was one of those special kinds  of guys. After being appointed to the Senate in 1968, he established  himself as a leader among leaders. Over the course of his time in the  Senate, he chaired the Select Committee on Ethics; Rules and  Administration; Governmental Affairs; Commerce, Science, and  Transportation, as well as the Committee on Appropriations. From 1977  to 1985, his colleagues chose him to be the Assistant Republican  Leader. He led the Senate's Arms Control Observer Group for 15 years,  and he served as the President pro tempore, the senior member of the  Senate's majority party, from 2003 to 2007--so leadership across all  levels.   As one might expect, Ted was a force to be reckoned with. He made  sure Alaska's voice was heard and was heard in every debate. As such,  he secured an incredible number of legislative victories that shaped  both the State of Alaska and our Nation.   He helped to settle most of Alaska's Native land claims, returning 44  million acres of land to First Alaskans and establishing a new model  that empowered our Native peoples to create new economic opportunities.  Ted was instrumental in securing the passage of a bill that enabled the  construction of our 800-mile-long Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which, to this  day, remains the backbone of our State's economy and is a critical part  of our Nation's energy security supply.   Ted was a guy who worked very, very hard but who also loved to fish.  He loved to be outside. His focusing on fishing led him to be very  concerned about what he saw as being the overfishing by foreign fleets,  which was taking place just miles off of Alaska's shores. So he worked  across the aisle with Senator Warren Magnuson to protect and sustain  our fisheries into the future. The Magnuson-Stevens law has been  repeatedly reauthorized and, to this day, still bears their names.   It really is impossible to overstate the beneficial impact that Ted  had on Alaska. Now, keep in mind he came to the Senate in 1968--less  than a decade after Alaska had become a State. So he knew as well as  anyone how tough those early years of statehood were. He knew probably  as well as anyone how difficult life was for so many Alaskans,  particularly in the rural parts of our State and, more than anyone  else, he helped to change that.   Ted was an appropriator for a long time. He was legendary in that  role. He once convinced the entire Committee on Appropriations to go to  Alaska for 2 weeks to see Alaska's needs firsthand. The Federal funding  he secured year after year allowed many Alaskans to gain access to very  basic infrastructure. We are talking water and sewer--things that most  Americans would take for granted. He also worked to help develop Alaska  so we would have a telemedicine network that would work. He helped to  facilitate bypass mail and Essential Air Service for our rural  communities--programs and benefits that continue to this day.  [[Page S6077]]    There is absolutely no doubt that the people of Alaska are better off  because of Ted Stevens. Many around the State still lovingly refer to  Ted as ``Uncle Ted.'' We are happier, and we are clearly healthier. We  are a safer and more prosperous State because of his contributions. Yet  the same is true for every American because Ted's accomplishments did  not end with the State of Alaska. He was a patriot. He was firmly  committed to our national defense and the security of our country. He  had great admiration for those who answered the call to serve in  uniform, as he had. He traveled the world to visit with our troops and  hear directly from them.   He was a longtime leader on the Appropriations Subcommittee on  Department of Defense. He and Dan Inouye would kind of share the  chairmanship, one between the other practically. Throughout his Senate  tenure, he fought tirelessly to make sure our military had the best  equipment, better pay, and the needed care it sought. He was a defender  of those who defended us.   Ted was an avid surfer when he was young, and he recognized the  importance of sports in our daily lives. I can remember a story that  has gone around for so many years; that of having to put his eldest  daughter, Sue, on a boy's softball team because we didn't have a girls'  league in Alaska at the time. So he championed title IX of the  Education Amendments Act, which provides equal opportunity for women to  participate in sports. He also authored the Amateur Sports Act, which  created the U.S. Olympic Committee, and worked to ensure funding for  physical education programs--programs, again, that had that fingerprint  of Ted Stevens from so many years prior.   I can go on and on about Ted's accomplishments. His legislative  accomplishments are considerable and far too many to speak to here  today, things like his work to ban damaging high seas drift nets to the  funding he secured to advance AIDS and breast cancer research. He was  involved in so much.   In recognizing that other colleagues wish to speak of Senator Stevens  as well, I, instead, will speak very briefly about what I feel made him  so effective and really so beloved--because he was beloved, maybe  feared a little bit but beloved.   The first thing to understand is that Ted had a pretty simple motto.  It was not very complicated.    He said:         To hell with politics. Just do what is right for Alaska.    He lived by that every day that he served here. He would work with  anyone who was willing to do right by the State of Alaska no matter who  one was, where one came from, or which side of the aisle one was on. I  mentioned Senator Inouye and the relationship that Ted had with him on  the Subcommittee on Department of Defense and on the Committee on  Appropriations. They formed a very close relationship. They had a lot  in common. Obviously, they were both veterans, and they were both from  young, offshore States. Yet they looked out for one another. They had  one another's backs. On committees, as I mentioned, they would be  chairman and vice chairman and would trade off but would work with one  another. In later years, it was not uncommon to find them both smoking  cigars out on the pro tempore's balcony in the early evenings, talking  about what had happened that day or what was going to happen the next  day.   Another thing that folks should know about Ted is that he was  definitely a fighter. I am told that Newsweek described him as a  ``scrapper'' when he first arrived in the Senate, and it certainly  proved to be an apt description throughout his tenure. Yet Ted was,  again, pretty clear: If Alaska's interests were at stake, he was out  there to defend them.   There were times he would put on his Incredible Hulk tie and channel  the big guy's persona. When that happened, everyone knew to look out  because Ted was going to the mat for Alaska on that day. Look out. Some  suggested that Ted had a bit of a temper.   A Senator is chuckling back there. I hear that.   I think Ted knew that a little bit of a temper could actually serve  him pretty well, and he would usually have a cute, little gleam in his  eye when he would say, ``I never lose my temper. I know exactly where I  left it.''   Ted was one of those guys who was great to his people, but when  something needed to be said--when it needed to be direct and to the  point--he was not going to shy away from it. That was another part of  what really made him a legend around here.   I think those who are listening and those who know me know I have an  immense, great affection for Ted and that this day and the recognition  he is receiving has great personal meaning. I had the extraordinary  fortune to know Ted Stevens for almost my entire life. At one point, he  was my boss. I was a high school intern. My first opportunity to really  be out of Alaska on my own was when I was an intern here for Senator  Ted. Later, of course, he was my colleague in the Senate, where he  mentored me and partnered with me to help serve Alaska. Above all that,  he was a true friend--truly a friend--and I miss him dearly.   I am reminded of him all the time. I have his old office in the Hart  Building. I have pictures and mementos that remind me of Ted. Every  time I go back home to the State, I think of him. It is not just  because, when I land, it reads ``Ted Stevens Anchorage International  Airport.'' It is also when I go out to the communities and see a road  or a bridge or a community that is no longer utilizing a honey bucket  system because of the work that Ted did. When you go home, when you  visit in Alaska, you see firsthand the impact he had. You see it  everywhere. I often say that Ted built Alaska and that Ted was Alaska.  So you can see why we named him the ``Alaskan of the 20th Century'' and  why we remain so grateful for all that he has done for us.   I am happy there is now going to be a place in the Capitol where I  can visit Ted, talk to him, and think about what he might have said and  about the counsel he might have provided for our State and our Nation.  I do hope his portrait will be a reminder to those of us who serve here  that we can work together even on the hardest of days and that, if we  do, we can achieve great things for the American people, which  sometimes might just require us to say: To hell with politics. Just do  what is right.   I am honored and privileged to be here with so many Alaskans,  including Catherine, Ted's wife, as well as many of his children and  grandchildren. I know they are overwhelmed by the number of friends and  colleagues and staff who are here to celebrate Ted's life and legacy.   In channeling here, I think Ted is looking down on all of this and is  thinking: Enough already. This is too much. You all have to get back to  work because, after all, we have appropriations bills on the floor.   With that, I yield to the fine Senator from Mississippi.
