 Mr. Speaker, the tax bill put forth today by  congressional Republicans is a gift to the wealthiest 1 percent and  multinational corporations at the expense of our students, homeowners,  and seniors.   It eliminates critical deductions that help central coast families,  including deductions for State and local taxes, mortgage interest,  student loans, and medical expenses.   With wildfire season in California growing longer each year, this  bill callously eliminates tax relief for personal casualty losses  resulting from wildfires as well as earthquakes. In fact, this bill  would raise taxes on 36 million working and middle class taxpayers by  an average of $1,130 a year.   With a national debt that has now surpassed $20 trillion, the  American people cannot afford this tax bill that adds $1.5 trillion to  the deficit and leaves our children stuck with the bill. Americans  deserve bipartisan tax reform that simplifies our Tax Code and puts the  middle class first.                            ____________________
