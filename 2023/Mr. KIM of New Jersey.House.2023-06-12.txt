 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I join my colleague, Mr. Bergman, and rise in support  of the CADETS Act.   This bipartisan bill raises the age requirement for MARAD's Student  Incentive Payment Program, which provides financial support to cadets  who attend one of six State maritime academies and commit to a post- graduation service obligation.   Current age requirements for the Student Incentive Payment Program  limit participation to people between 17 and 25 years of age. This  proposal would expand eligibility to people up to age 42. This bill  would widen the pool of potential candidates and aligns the age  requirements with that of the Navy Reserve.   Many military veterans attend these State academies, but many  applicants are too old to qualify for aid or the program.   Graduates from the State maritime academies become licensed officers  in the U.S. Merchant Marine and are part of the Navy's Strategic  Sealift Officer Force. Currently, our merchant mariner force is around  1,800 officers short of wartime needs. Because the average age of a  merchant mariner is 47, we need to increase the number of eligible  individuals for this program.   This bill would open up additional opportunities to our best and  brightest and bolster our national security.   State maritime academies provide our veterans unique opportunities to  transition to well-paying jobs and continue to serve in support of our  Nation.   For those reasons, Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
