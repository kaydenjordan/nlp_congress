 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering this  amendment. I offered a similar amendment, which was not made in order  but would have had the same effect.   Much discussion has resolved around EPA Region 5, which is the region  that I represent, and the important office that has, as part of its  responsibility, protection of the Great Lakes, which is one of the most  unique ecosystems on the planet, and it is one that deserves and needs  full-time protection.   I listened carefully to the chairman's comments, and I agree with  them. I think, as my friend from Colorado stated, if there is no  question as to whether there is a plan to close these offices, I can  tell you that the people that I represent would benefit from the  assurance that the body that is responsible for making these decisions  has made a clear statement that it is on record that these offices will  remain open.   Certainly, administratively, they can do all the consideration they  need to do to think about how they want to save money. But it is up to  Congress to decide these questions, and Congress should be clear.   And when it comes to the Great Lakes, with all the other cuts that  the President has proposed, namely the elimination of the Great Lakes  Restoration Initiative, we need this reassurance.
