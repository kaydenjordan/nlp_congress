 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Second Class Petty  Officer Marilyn Childress, a woman who served during the Vietnam war.   Marilyn Childress enlisted in the Navy in 1972. Since women were not  allowed in combat areas at the time, she was attached to the dispensary  at Naval Air Station Glynco, Georgia, and then at the then-Naval Air  Station Millington, Tennessee, as an operating room technician  corpswoman.   After completing her service to her country in 1975, Marilyn enrolled  at the University of Tennessee and earned her master's degree. She  settled in Georgia upon the completion of her degree, where she became  the first female president of the Georgia Amateur Women's Soccer  Association. Perhaps her greatest accomplishment was her work in  getting women's soccer recognized as an Olympic sport in 1996.   When she returned to Knoxville in 2013, she helped establish the  Veterans Heritage Site Foundation, which created the Sharp's Ridge  Veterans Memorial Park in Knoxville, Tennessee, my hometown.   Our country's heroes are the men and women of our Armed Forces like  Marilyn Childress who served in sacrifice for our freedom.   It is my honor to recognize Second Class Petty Officer Marilyn  Childress  [[Page H1214]]  as the Tennessee Second District's February 2020 Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
