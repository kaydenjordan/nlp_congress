 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Last Thursday, I was wandering the Capitol searching for the  Republican's secret repeal bill. We went from room to room, and it  wasn't there. But now that I have seen it, I understand why they would  want to hide it.   Even if we can all agree that we need to make health care more  affordable and more accessible, this bill is not the solution. In fact,  this bill will only make things worse.   The Republican repeal bill gives tax breaks to the rich. We are  talking about over $600 billion overall, while taking away health  coverage from millions of Americans. The Republican repeal bill will  drastically increase the cost of health insurance for millions of  Americans, with the biggest increase for seniors and for working  families.   It would radically change the Medicaid program, slashing funding, and  covering fewer people.   The Republican repeal bill will force Governors and State legislators  to ration care. My Republican Governor weighed in now and said that it  would be trouble for Illinois if Medicaid is cut back.   Who do they want to cut out? Children, the elderly, people with  disabilities. Thousands of hardworking individuals in Illinois will  lose access to health coverage. As I said, in fact, Republican Governor  Bruce Rauner said that our State ``won't do very well'' if the  Republican repeal bill becomes law.   The Republican repeal bill breaks the promise made by President Trump  to cover more Americans at lower cost.   I oppose this bill. I am going to fight tooth and nail to protect our  care. And, frankly, I think this bill, as my mother would say, is  deader than a door nail.
