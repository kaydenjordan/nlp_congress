 Mr. Speaker, Speaker Johnson brought to this floor a  bill to prevent the IRS from auditing the wealthy because: ``Every time  a billionaire cheats on their taxes, a member of the House Freedom  Caucus earns his wings.''   Speaker   Mike Johnson said today that Israel can't wait for this  critical aid. Then, he brings to the floor a bill that he knows is dead  on arrival in the Senate. He knew full well that all he had to do was  bring it up without the IRS provisions and it would pass overwhelmingly  in this House and the Senate, and would be on the President's desk in a  day.   For 50 years, every Israel bill that came to this floor passed with  overwhelming bipartisan support. That is critical because Israel has  one friend in the world. If Israel becomes a partisan issue, then  Israel has one-half of one friend in the world.   Hamas was willing to kill, to decapitate, and to die to undercut  world support for Israel, particularly bipartisan support here in the  United States. No one has done more than our new Speaker to help Hamas  achieve that objective.
