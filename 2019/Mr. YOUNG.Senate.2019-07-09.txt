 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is  very important to me and to the 1,300 Hoosiers currently in need of an  organ transplant. That issue is the lack of organs for patients in need  and our broken organ donation system.   For more than 30 years, our Nation's organ donation system has  operated in complete darkness. Groups known as organ procurement  organizations, or OPOs, are responsible for getting organs from the  donors to the patients who actually need them, but questions surround  the effectiveness, transparency, and accountability of these  organizations.   OPOs are the main link between donor hospitals and organ recipients,  and their performance can be a limiting factor for all stakeholders in  the organ donation system.   In the last 20 years, no OPO has been decertified despite serious  issues of underperformance. For example, CMS recently recertified the  New York City OPO despite persistent underperformance for nearly a  decade. This problem exists throughout the country.   Currently, OPO performance is measured by data that is self-reported,  unaudited, and fraught with errors. Many of these errors have been  documented by Lenny Bernstein and Kimberly Kindy at the Washington  Post.   That is why today I introduced legislation that would require organ  procurement organizations to be held to metrics that are objective,  verifiable, and not subject to self-interpretation. This way, there can  be meaningful transparency, evaluation, and accountability. Updating  these metrics will also enable geographic-level donation rates to be  evaluated and improved. This is desperately needed for the more than  113,000 Americans currently waiting for a lifesaving transplant. The  legislation I introduced today is supported by the American Society of  Nephrology, Dialysis Patient Citizens, and the nonprofit group  ORGANIZE. Additionally, in April of this year, I wrote to CMS  Administrator Seema Verma urging CMS to update OPO metrics to be  objective and verifiable.   I am hopeful that we will soon see action from the White House and  the Department of Health and Human Services. You see, this issue is  very personal to me. My friend Dave ``Gunny'' McFarland from  Jeffersonville, IN, died because his heart transplant never came. We  served together in the U.S. Marine Corps, and over the years, I have  gotten to know his widow, Jennifer McFarland Kern. Jen has made it her  mission to raise awareness about the organ transplant process and to  help prevent others from facing a similar situation.   Because the system is so complex, most people don't know how it works  or if patients are actually being protected. It is time to change that.  Today's legislation is the first in a series of bills I am working on  to reform our organ donation system once and for all and help save  precious lives. I will not stop until we increase the availability of  organs for patients in need.   Semper fidelis.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is  very important to me and to the 1,300 Hoosiers currently in need of an  organ transplant.
