 Madam President, thank you for your willingness to  preside over the Chamber at this late hour, at least in the Nation's  capital, midnight, here, or 10 o'clock in the great States of Colorado  and Montana.   My colleague and one of the lead sponsors of this legislation has  been doing a lot of work this past week on the Great American Outdoors  Act to make sure that we can get this across the finish line. The truly  bipartisan spirit of this bill has been remarkable. I think that is  kind of what I wanted to start off with my comments tonight, is really  the coast-to-coast nature of this legislation, the Great American  Outdoors Act, because so many people  [[Page S2950]]  have put in not just a couple of weeks of work or a couple of months of  work or a couple of years of work but decades of work on the  legislation that we have before us.   The Great American Outdoors Act combines two pieces of legislation:  the crown jewel of our conservation programs across the Nation, the  Land and Water Conservation Fund, and the Restore Our Parks Act. The  Restore Our Parks Act focuses on the catching up with the maintenance  backlog in our national park systems.   About 70 percent of the funding, $1.9 billion a year, will go towards  our national parks. Additional dollars will go towards the Bureau of  Land Management, the Bureau of Land Management now headquartered in the  great State of Colorado. A portion will go to the U.S. Forest Service.  A portion will go to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and a portion  will go to the Bureau of Indian Education.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund, of course, goes toward the  efforts to protect some of the greatest spaces in our Nation. I wanted  to thank the people who have been working on this--and we have more  work to do, to be clear--Senator Manchin, Senator Heinrich, Senator  Cantwell, Senator King, Senator Warner, Senators Portman and Alexander,  and Senator Daines, all have been working very diligently to make sure  that we can pass this. I am sure I missed a few people, as we have  talked about them tonight and will be talking about this over the next  several days.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund has benefited every State in the  country. There are a few things that have been said on the floor today  that I thought I would clear up and address because they need to be. I  am going to show a chart here that talks about the States that will  receive the benefit under the Great American Outdoors Act and the  States that do not benefit from the Great American Outdoors Act.   The States that do not benefit from the Great American Outdoors Act  are highlighted in orange, and the States that benefit from the Great  American Outdoors Act are highlighted in green. As you can see from  this map, there are no orange States. This is an entire country-- Alaska, Hawaii--48 States that have benefited from the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, who will benefit from the Restore Our Parks Act.   All 50 States across the country have already benefited from these  programs. The March 9 letter begins: ``The Land and Water Conservation  Fund has been our nation's most successful conservation and recreation  program for 55 years, now permanently reauthorized by Congress after a  nationwide advocacy effort.''   That was a bill that came forward in the John D. Dingell conservation  bill, the public land bill we passed last Congress. It passed this  Chamber 92 to 8, another extremely bipartisan provision.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund isn't just about the coast. It  is not just about the interior. It is about all of our States. Half the  money goes to the East; half the money goes to the West. It is  distributed across the Nation. It is not a Federal land grab. I think  it is important that some people want to talk about this being a  Federal land grab.   Ninety-nine percent of the funding from the Land and Water  Conservation Fund actually goes to inholdings within existing public  lands, meaning if you have a place like Rocky Mountain National Park in  Colorado--and there is a little bit of land somehow in the middle of  that--Land and Water Conversation Fund--99 percent of the funds from  that have been used to purchase those inholdings.   You have a significant portion of the Land and Water Conservation  Fund that is not managed by the Federal Government at all. It is  actually handled by the States. It is an important thing. It is  baseball fields, soccer fields, and other programs the States can  handle. So a huge chunk of funding from the Land and Water Conservation  Fund goes back to the States and out of the hands of the Federal  Government.   If you go to another letter we talked about before, the six previous  Secretaries of the Interior sending a letter, June 3, 2020, talking  about the privilege and responsibility of stewarding some of America's  most scenic landscapes--incredible landscapes and natural and cultural  treasures.    It talked about how they are all cognizant of the critical role our  public lands play in our lives, with places to recreate, recharge, and  to seek solace in the midst of great uncertainty and also to create  jobs. This was signed by both Republican and Democrat Secretaries of  the Interior, most recently Secretary Zinke and Secretary Jewell and  Ken Salazar from Colorado; Secretary Dirk Kempthorne; Secretary Gale  Norton, another Coloradan; Secretary Bruce Babbitt, from Arizona, under  President Clinton. This talks about the importance of the Great  American Outdoors Act with how it will help ensure a better, brighter  future for nature and for all of us.   Speaking of sort of bright futures, some people have said on the  floor that this legislation was crafted in secret. That couldn't be  further from the truth. The Land and Water Conservation Fund has been  around since 1965, 1964, in this Chamber. It was approved by the  committee just a couple of months ago. The Restore Our Parks Act  cleared the Energy and Natural Resources Committee just a couple of  months ago. It was debated. There were amendments offered; they failed.   We combined these two pieces that came out of committee, and we put  them into the Great American Outdoors Act. That is what we are being  asked to vote on tonight. Of course, the Secretary's letter talks about  the dollars that will be going to our communities, the opportunities  for more conservation. We talked about the letter here from the  coalition.   Let's talk about the jobs, too, though. It is important as we start  voting tonight that we recognize that this is a jobs bill and an  economic opportunity for our country. It is estimated that the Great  American Outdoors Act will create over 100,000 jobs across the country.  As we get our feet underneath us again, as we get back on our feet from  the health pandemic, COVID-19 emergency, we have a chance to create new  jobs and new students.   Remember where these jobs are going to be created; they are going to  be created around the country because Land and Water Conservation Fund  is in nearly every county across the country. For every $1 million we  spend on the Land and Water Conservation Fund, we support between 16  and 30 jobs. The national parks supports over 100,000 jobs through the  Great American Outdoors Act; the Land and Water Conservation Fund,  every $ 1 million, between 16 and 30 jobs. Those communities that have  been impacted because of job loss--maybe their tourism season ended  earlier, maybe it started late, maybe a combination of both as we faced  in Colorado--those communities that have 20 percent, 22 percent, 23  percent unemployment are going to be able to gain significant  economically across the country thanks to this legislation.   We also have a letter here from the Archery Trade Association, the  Association of Fish and Wildlife, the Boone and Crockett Club,  California Waterfowl Association, Catch-A-Dream Foundation. You name  it--Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation--from a March 11, 2020, letter  in support of the Great American Outdoors Act.   The jobs aspect of the Great American Outdoors Act, of course, is  recognized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. On June 4, 2020, they sent  a letter to Members of the U.S. Senate. ``The U.S. Chamber of Commerce  strongly supports [S. 3422], the `Great American Outdoors Act,'--an  important, bipartisan bill that would provide certainty for the Land  and Water Conservation Fund [LWCF] and address the pressing maintenance  and construction backlog on public lands.''   It addresses long overdue infrastructure modernization challenges,  international park system, and other Federal and agricultural lands. It  would also permanently authorize the LWCF, providing an important tool  for smart development of open spaces in communities across the Nation.   Enactment of this bill would also provide much needed funding to  support and sustain funding Bureau of Indian Education schools. By  setting aside 5 percent of the funds created in this act, as much as  $475 million could flow to Bureau of Indian Education schools over the  next 5 years.  [[Page S2951]]    API, the American Petroleum Institute, writes in support of the Great  American Outdoors Act. They start with: ``Practical, safe, and  responsible offshore energy development doesn't just create jobs and  power our lives--it also funds America's largest federal conservation  program.''   Senators will soon vote on the Great American Outdoors Act, and they  hope that we would support this legislation.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record letters from the Chamber of Commerce and API   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      June 4, 2020.        To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S.       Chamber of Commerce strongly supports S. 3422, the ``Great       American Outdoors Act,'' an important, bipartisan bill that       would provide funding certainty for the Land and Water       Conservation Fund (LWCF) and address the pressing maintenance       and construction backlog on public lands. The Chamber will       consider including votes related to this legislation in our       ``How They Voted'' congressional scorecard.        This bill would address long overdue infrastructure       modernization challenges in the national parks system and on       other federal and agricultural lands. It also would       permanently authorize the LWCF, which provides important       tools for smart development of open spaces in communities       across our nation.        Local LWCF projects have the potential to put many       thousands of Americans back to work as the American economy       recovers from the pandemic. Such projects can also help       companies and communities promote open spaces, build       resilience, reduce risks from future disasters, and better       manage stormwater.        Enactment of this bill would also provide much needed       funding to support and sustain Bureau of Indian Education       (BIE) schools. By setting aside 5% of the fund created in       this Act, as much as $475 million could flow to BIE schools       over the next five years.        The Chamber opposes any poison pill amendments that would       undo the carefully balanced components of this legislation.       In particular, the Chamber opposes any efforts to establish       moratoria on energy production, which is not only crucial to       America's economic growth and energy security, but also       provides the underlying funding for the LWCF.        We applaud the bipartisan leadership of Sens. Gardner,       Manchin and Daines, who crafted this legislation. The Chamber       urges passage of the Great American Outdoors Act.            Sincerely,      Jack Howard,        Senior Vice President, Congressional and Public Affairs,       U.S. Chamber of Commerce.                                   ____                                                      June 10, 2020.        Dear Jennifer: Practical, safe, and responsible offshore       energy development doesn't just create jobs and power our       lives--it also funds America's largest federal conservation       program. For decades, the natural gas and oil industry has       directly contributed to outdoor recreation and environmental       conservation, thanks to a long-standing law that would be       strengthened by legislation that is up for a vote in the U.S.       Senate.        Senators will soon vote on S. 3422, the Great American       Outdoors Act, a bipartisan bill that would codify a permanent       funding stream for the Land and Water Conservation Fund       (LWCF) and address a considerable maintenance and       construction backlog on public lands.        Since 1965, LWCF grants have provided more than $4.4       billion for over 40,000 projects, supporting resource       management, habitat restoration, and outdoor recreation such       as hiking, hunting, and fishing. Offshore natural gas and oil       royalties provide the primary source of funding for all LWCF       projects, from the Grand Canyon National Park to community       basketball courts.        As summer starts and the coronavirus limits the nation's       ability to convene inside, outdoor activities are more       important than ever. Last month, API was happy to see the       Interior Department announce a $227 million LWCF distribution       to all 50 states, five U.S. territories, and the District of       Columbia for specified park and outdoor recreation and       conservation.        But we won't stop there. Energy producers are proud to grow       the economy, create good-paying jobs, and invest in projects       that enhance America's natural beauty. Offshore energy       revenues are essential to conserving the LWCF itself.            Sincerely,                                                      Mike Sommers,                                              President & CEO, API.     Madam President, furthermore, to highlight the economic  importance of this legislation, the outdoor recreation industry--these  have some of the most notable names in outdoor recreation, which I  think everybody would recognize: Polaris, Bass Pro, Cabela's--you name  it--North Face, Patagonia. They are all on here, in support of the  Great American Outdoors Act.         The outdoor recreation industry is extremely encouraged by       recent announcements that the Senate plans to hold a vote on       the Great American Outdoors Act. As outdoor recreation       business leaders, we know investments and recreation access       and infrastructure are vital to the outdoor recreation       industry and economies across the country.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed  in the Record.         There being no objection, the material was ordered to be       printed in the Record, as follows:        Dear Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer: The outdoor       recreation industry is extremely encouraged by recent       announcements that the Senate plans to hold a vote on the       Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) in June. As outdoor       recreation business leaders, we know investments in       recreation access and infrastructure are vital to the outdoor       recreation industry and economies across the country.        Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, the outdoor recreation       industry contributed $778 billion in economic output,       accounted for 2.2 percent of United States Gross Domestic       Product, supported 5.2 million jobs and was growing faster       than the economy as a whole in every indicator.       Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and shutdowns       necessary to slow its progression, America's outdoor       recreation economy was hindered when we needed the outdoors       more than ever. Outdoor Recreation Roundtable's April survey       of the sector shows that 79 percent of outdoor businesses       have had to lay off or furlough employees, and 89 percent are       seeing decreased revenue. However, we know there is a bright       future for outdoor recreation ahead, as several sectors of       the industry are already experiencing rapidly increasing       demand.        These outdoor businesses are the backbone of our industry       and range from specialty retailers, apparel, gear and vehicle       manufacturers, outfitters and guides to campground and marina       operators. They are often foundational to a community's       economy. With rising unemployment and Americans eager to       experience the outdoors, investment in our industry's core       infrastructure--public lands and waters--will allow our       businesses to get back to what we do best: stimulate local       economies, put people back to work, and allow Americans to       benefit from time spent outside.        This is why we respectfully ask you to pass the Great       American Outdoors Act as soon as possible.        GAOA will fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund       (LWCF) at $900 million annually, providing more recreation       access for communities across the country and fueling more       outdoor recreation economic activity. In a nutshell, if       Congress invests the intended amount of $900 million into       LWCF recreation access projects on local, state and federal       lands, it will create much-needed close-to-home recreation       opportunities while revitalizing the outdoor recreation       economy.        Additionally, GAOA dedicates up to $9.5 billion over the       next five years to maintenance backlog projects that have       been devastating our public lands and waters. Investing in       these projects will improve outdoor recreation-related       facilities such as docks, restrooms, campgrounds, trails,       roads and more that have deteriorated significantly from       decades of underfunded maintenance. As business leaders, we       understand the need to make sure customers have good       experiences when they visit stores or facilities, it ensures       they come back again. Funding the maintenance backlog will       also ensure that adequate infrastructure for all types of       recreation on our public lands and waters exists so more       people who are seeking the benefits the outdoors has to offer       can get outside safely and grow our industry sustainably.        Passing GAOA now would stimulate the outdoor recreation       industry made up of thousands of businesses that support       communities in all SO states, support rural economies, create       jobs to carry out essential work, and provide opportunities       for millions of Americans to recreate on our public lands and       waters for generations to come. We know this vital       legislation is slated for a vote in the coming weeks and we       urge you to move as quickly as possible to get this       legislation across the finish line. Your support of GAOA is a       vote for American jobs and health, community resiliency and       the outdoor recreation economy. Thank you for your       leadership.

Madam President, REI--a place that Secretary Jewell  knows very well--REI Co-op writes in support of the Great American  Outdoors Act, talking about the impressive process that this bill came  together with, the bipartisan nature of this legislation.   My colleague, Senator Heinrich, from New Mexico, is on the floor. I  can't thank him enough for the work we have done together and for  making sure that we can get to these votes, as we approach very late  hours in Washington.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record a letter from REI Co-op, dated June 9, 2020   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                       June 9, 2020.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:       On behalf of REI Co-op, I want to express our strong support       for the Great American Outdoors Act. This bipartisan       legislation represents a historic opportunity to reduce the       chronic maintenance backlogs that have been diminishing our       federal lands and waters. The bill also will make permanent       Congress's financial support for the Land and Water       Conservation Fund, ending decades of erratic support.        As you know, our public lands and waters are places for       recreation, connecting to others and even healing. This is       true for Americans across the country, irrespective of       geography, and has proven especially true over the last       several months during the COVID-19 pandemic. The connection       between outdoor recreation and public health may have never       been so evident as it is today. I strongly believe that these       trends are part of a broader shift in our society and will       remain in place well beyond the end of the pandemic, so long       as we put healthy investment into this portion of our public       infrastructure.        It's also important to note how much the outdoor recreation       economy has suffered during this economic downturn, in       particular those small, main street businesses that rely on       the public lands to be open and accessible. Most in our       industry have not yet been deemed ``essential businesses''       and, therefore, have faced significant financial pressures as       store hours are cut and guided trips, cancelled. As of last       fall, the U.S. Commerce Department had found the outdoor       recreation economy to account for 2.2.% of GDP and 5.2       million jobs. The recreation sector is not nearly so robust       today. It will benefit greatly--both near and long term--from       investments that better conserve our public lands and waters,       and provide access to more outdoor recreation opportunities.        Equally impressive is the process by which this bill has       come together. Not long after last year's passage of the       landmark John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and       Recreation Act, Republicans and Democrats in your chamber       came together to advance concepts that previously seemed       impossible to move through Congress. Now, another historic       opportunity for bipartisanship is on the docket. In an era       when divisive politics and disagreement regularly frustrate       the legislative process, Congress's commitment to the       outdoors demonstrates our capacity to find common ground.        As you continue to work through the important legislative       agenda that is before the Senate, I urge you to pass the       Great American Outdoors Act and look forward to this vital       legislation becoming law.            Sincerely,                                                         Eric Artz,                                        President & CEO, REI Co-op.     Madam President, this is about national treasures, the  great American outdoors. It is about national treasures. It is about  protecting these incredible places that our own biologists--not just  the people of Colorado or New Mexico or the great State of Georgia-- owned by all of us.   It is about some of the most scenic and majestic landscapes, unique  ecosystems that they create. But it is also about a national treasure  and the American people. That national treasure has been hit pretty  hard over the last several months, with pandemics, conflict in our  society, and racial injustice. It is this national treasure, the  American people, that this legislation is focused on, the national  treasure that will help create jobs and opportunity and empower  people's lives, get their communities back on track, and maybe--just  maybe--provide a little bit of respite to somebody who is seeking that  opportunity to get outside, to get away, to find time to think.   As Enos Mills said, to make them a little bit more reflective and  kind during difficult times. We have a long ways to go in this  legislation. We will have more debates later tonight and a vote later  tonight. I hope my colleagues will support me in this legislation. It  is tremendously bipartisan in nature. It has significant support of the  American people. It benefits our country from sea to shining sea.   We are going to have some votes next week, on Monday, as well, and  perhaps Tuesday, maybe even more. But one thing this bill is not is a  surprise. This bill is a collection of debates and arguments and  passion and advocacy for decades. I think the argument has been won. We  want to protect our country's most treasured places. Now, we just have  to win the debate and make sure we can do that with the bill tonight.   I encourage my colleagues to vote yes tonight and through the  remaining votes that we have either today or next week to move on to  passage of this legislation and the good it can do. I thank the  President and I thank my colleagues.   I yield the floor.    I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his work on this  legislation and the opportunity to continue to work together on the  Great American Outdoors Act. We adjusted to the Zoom conference  meetings and the Skypes and the FaceTimes. We all figured out our best  way to do that.   Millions of Americans were still at work each and every day at the  gas station, at the grocery store, the clerks and the people stocking  shelves and providing restaurant work across the country.  [[Page S2953]]    There is a lot of stress, and this is a tense time for this country.  You can see it and hear it and still feel that strain on the American  people. That sort of relief valve we have as a country is our system of  parks and recreation opportunities.   It is about jobs. It is about the dollars they spend in communities,  the gateway communities, when they go to a place like Rocky Mountain  National Park. Yet it is also about that opportunity for people to get  away and to find that time to think, that time to be themselves, to  focus, to get into an area where they can exercise, recreate, and enjoy  the environment and the resources around them.   I make a joke; I don't know if anyone else laughs at it. I talk about  the last several months being spent in the great indoors. It is time  for the great outdoors. I think that is what we talked about.   As a kid growing up, we had these road trips. We didn't fly very  often, at least. It was expensive. You would drive and drive great  distances. You would drive to the Grand Canyon National Park if you  could or certainly drive up to Rocky Mountain National Park with the  family.   Maybe the great American road trip is going to come back as people  adjust to what we have to do to protect ourselves from the pandemic, as  economic concerns grow in this country. This provides an opportunity  for all of it.    In Colorado, I think I mentioned before, we have an area  the size of Rocky Mountain National Park that is held by the public  across the State of Colorado, but it is inaccessible. You can't get to  it. The Land and Water Conservation Fund provides this opportunity to  get to that, to access land.   I heard my colleague Senator Daines talk about how a significant  portion of the fishing access in Montana--he just talked about it--is  through the Land and Water Conservation Fund.   We have projects in the Rio Grande National Forest through portions  of Colorado and into Texas, where the Lower Rio Grande Valley National  Wildlife Refuge has benefited. I think it was Will Rogers who once said  that the Rio Grande was the only river he ever saw that was in need of  irrigation.   I think if you look at the Land and Water Conservation Fund, that is  something we can all benefit from.   Of course, while we don't directly border Montana, we do border New  Mexico. There was an article recently featured, I think, by the Nature  Conservancy, about Colorado's newest State park. It is in southern  Colorado, right outside a little town called Trinidad, and it will  encompass a local landmark known as Fisher's Peak.   Trinidad has a great and amazing history in the West, from mining to  agriculture and the challenges that mining and agriculture have posed  over the years, and forestry and other things. But what they are hoping  for now is that this newest State park can provide an opportunity for  economic revitalization of this rural town and area. It is actually  going to border right up against New Mexico, and part of that special  land goes into New Mexico. Maybe someday the Land and Water  Conservation Fund will be able to benefit that project. In fact, I know  they are working on it, and they have received it by now. It is an  opportunity for us to save rural communities.   This Land and Water Conservation Fund is not all out of Washington.  It is coming through the States as well, and that is an opportunity for  both of our areas to prosper, particularly our rural communities.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  postcloture time with respect to the substitute amendment No. 1617  expire at 5:30 p.m., Monday, June 15.

There being no objection, the Senate, at 1:28 a.m., adjourned until  Monday, June 15, 2020, at 3 p.m.
