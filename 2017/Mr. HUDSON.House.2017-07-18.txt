 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 2786, my bipartisan legislation focused on tapping our  Nation's immense conduit hydropower potential.   Hydropower remains one of the most efficient and affordable sources  of electricity, as well as one of the largest sources of renewable  electricity in America. In North Carolina alone, it generates enough  electricity to power 350,000 homes each year.   The opportunity is tremendous. Picture a tiny turbine placed in an  existing man-made pipe that transports water from a water treatment  plant. We can produce clean electric power inside these types of man- made conduits. There are over 1.2 million miles of water supply mains  in the United States creating literally thousands of energy-recovery  hydropower generation opportunities. This technology is readily  available and environmentally friendly, but Federal regulations have  discouraged and stifled the development.   That is exactly why I introduced this commonsense bill with my  colleague, Diana DeGette, whom I will say, even though her Broncos  defeated my Panthers in the Super Bowl a couple years ago, it has  really been a pleasure to work with on this.   What we are working on is to streamline the Federal review process  for noncontroversial conduit hydropower projects and make the projects  eligible for streamlined consideration.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to  expand the development of conduit hydropower projects, create clean  energy jobs, increase production of affordable renewable power, reduce  consumer electricity costs, and improve energy diversity.
