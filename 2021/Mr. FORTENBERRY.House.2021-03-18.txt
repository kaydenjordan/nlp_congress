 Mr. Speaker, Nebraska is famous for its high-quality  beef; and what wine is to France, beef is to Nebraska.   Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, a number of us took note when Microsoft  founder Bill Gates proposed that the wealthiest nations move to a  hundred percent synthetic beef--synthetic beef--to fight climate  change.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I have been in meetings with Bill Gates, and I  respect his intellect and his desire for social responsibility by the  world's wealthiest, and I have no beef with Bill for his desire to see  us transition to a much more sustainable economy, and I agree. But  making supper from a lab? That is not a solution. That is a chemistry  experiment.   Mr. Speaker, America makes food, real food, and we shouldn't disrupt  a nutritional food source and management of our animal resources that  would have minimal effect on greenhouse gases.   I have an idea. I would like to invite Mr. Gates to the West Point  Livestock Auction, and he can present his proposal for lab-based meat  to the farmers and ranchers there. We would have a healthy debate.                            ____________________
