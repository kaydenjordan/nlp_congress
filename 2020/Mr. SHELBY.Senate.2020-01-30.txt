 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Shelby is for the counsel for the  President:         Though not charged in the Articles of Impeachment, House       Managers and others have stated the President's actions       constituted criminal bribery. Can this claim be reconciled       with the Supreme Court's unanimous decision in McDonnell v.       United States?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator, thank you for that  question.   I think the answer is, no, it can't be reconciled with the McDonnell  case. Let me make a couple of points in my answer.   The first is, of course, because there is no bribery or extortion  charge in the Articles of Impeachment, the managers can't rely on that  now to try to establish their case.   I pointed out yesterday, I believe, that that is a due process  violation of the most fundamental sort to have a charging document and  leave out certain charges in the charging document, then come to trial  and say: Well, it is not in the indictment, and it is not in the  charge, but, actually, what we have shown you is he did something else  wrong. It was ``this crime.'' As the House managers well know, that  would result in an automatic mistrial in any actual trial in a court in  this country. So that is the initial problem with trying to go there on  bribery or something else.   Then, as the Senator's question raises, the McDonnell case made  clear, that simply arranging a meeting for someone--simply setting up a  meeting with other government officials--couldn't be treated as a thing  of value in an exchange under the bribery statute. It pointed out,  particularly in terms of government officials who all the time are  asked by their constituents to introduce them to someone else in the  government, to arrange a meeting, that that is not an official act. It  is not an official policy decision, an action that is determining some  government policy. It is simply allowing someone to have a meeting and  then talk about something. If that is the nature of the meeting, that  can't be the thing of value that is being exchanged and can't support a  charge of bribery.   So they can't raise it because it is not in the Articles of  Impeachment. If they had wanted to charge that, they had to charge it  in the Articles of Impeachment. They can't come here now and try to try  a different case from the one they framed in the charging document that  they had complete control over drafting. Even if they did, they can't  make out the claim with respect to the White House meeting because the  McDonnell case prohibits that.   I would like to make one other point because the House managers today  have brought up a lot. There have been a lot of questions again and  again about the subpoena power and were their subpoenas actually valid  and how it is going to destroy oversight if the President's arguments  are accepted. I just want to point something out.   The subpoenas that were issued--that were purported to have been  issued--were not under oversight authority but pursuant to--every  letter that came out said: pursuant to the House's impeachment inquiry.  They purported to be exercising the authority of impeachment, and that  makes a difference.   One of the House managers mentioned that the legislative oversight--  [[Page S718]]  the authority to acquire the information for legislative purposes--has  to actually relate to something that legislation could be passed on.  There are certain constraints on what information can be sought. It is  slightly different if you are going under the impeachment power because  then you can investigate into specific past facts more readily because  that is relevant to an impeachment inquiry that might not be for  legislative purposes. They purported to be using the impeachment  authority. They didn't have that authorization because the Speaker's  press conference did not validly give them that authorization. We  pointed out that the subpoenas were invalid. They did nothing to try to  cure that deficiency. They didn't reissue the subpoenas. They didn't  have the votes to reissue them or anything.   To say now that all oversight will be destroyed forever if you accept  the President's arguments is totally false. It is totally misleading  because they were not purporting to do just regular oversight. As we  pointed out several times in the October 8 letter that the White House  Counsel sent to Chairman Schiff and others, it said, specifically, if  you want to return to regular oversight, we are happy to do that. As we  have in the past, subject to constitutional constraints, we will  participate in the accommodation process. It was the House Democrats  who didn't want to take that route. They insist on using the  impeachment authority. We pointed out that they didn't have it, and  they didn't seek to cure that problem.   Accepting the President's position here has nothing to do with  destroying oversight by Congress for all time and all circumstances. It  has to do with the mistake that they made in trying to assert a  particular authority that they didn't have in this case.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Virginia.
