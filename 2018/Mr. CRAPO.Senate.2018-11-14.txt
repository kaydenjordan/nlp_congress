 Mr. President, along with my colleague Senator James E.  Risch, I congratulate Judge Ryan Nelson of Idaho Falls on his Senate  confirmation to serve as a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.   Throughout his diverse legal career, Ryan Nelson developed the  necessary tools to serve the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as a  sound and principled jurist. Since 2009, Ryan Nelson has served as  general counsel of Idaho Falls-based Melaleuca, Inc. Before joining  Melaleuca, Mr. Nelson served in the Federal Government as special  counsel for Supreme Court nominations to the ranking member of the  Senate Judiciary Committee; as deputy general counsel to the White  House Office of Management and Budget; and as deputy assistant attorney  general in the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the United  States Department of Justice, DOJ. At the DOJ, Mr. Nelson argued 13  cases in the U.S. Courts of Appeals and was division counsel for 50  briefs filed in the Supreme Court. Before joining the DOJ, Mr. Nelson  practiced in the Washington, DC, office of Sidley Austin LLP, where he  was a member of the firm's appellate, litigation, products liability,  and religious liberties practice groups.  [[Page S6960]]    Upon graduation from law school, Mr. Nelson served as a law clerk to  Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  District of Columbia Circuit and to Judges Charles Brower and Richard  Mosk of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal at The Hague. Mr. Nelson earned  his B.A. from Brigham Young University, BYU, and his J.D., with honors,  from BYU Law School, where he was inducted into the Order of the Coif  and served as a lead articles editor of the BYU Law Review.   Ryan has been widely recognized by his colleagues for his judgement  and legal expertise and will respect and be a servant of the law. He  understands that a judge is responsible for interpreting and applying  the Constitution and laws of the land as they are written and not to be  a maker of laws from the bench.   Congratulations, Ryan, on your confirmation, and thank you for  bringing your valuable perspective to the court.                            ____________________
