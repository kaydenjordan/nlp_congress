 Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg and to express my grave concerns at rushing to fill  this Supreme Court vacancy rather than focus on the pandemic and its  health and economic devastation.   The passing of Justice Ginsburg is a monumental loss for our country,  but she will leave an indelible mark as a historic and brilliant  jurist, civil rights trailblazer, and personal hero to countless  people. We can all take inspiration from her stalwart and lifelong  crusade for equality, shaped by her own struggles facing gender  discrimination as a young lawyer, despite her outstanding education and  obvious talent.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S5825, September 23, 2020, third column, the following  appears: We can all take inspiration from her stalwart and  lifelong crusade for equality, shaped by her own struggles facing  gender discrimination as a young lawyer, despite her outstanding  education.      The online Record has been corrected to read: We can all take  inspiration from her stalwart and lifelong crusade for equality,  shaped by her own struggles facinggender discrimination as a young  lawyer, despite her outstanding education and obvious talent.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Notably, one of her first and most important rulings as a Supreme  Court Justice was when she wrote the majority opinion that struck down  the male-  [[Page S5826]]  only admissions policy at the Virginia Military Institute. In this and  many other cases, Justice Ginsburg opened the door for generations to  come and heralded a new era of equality so that those who were  traditionally excluded and oppressed could truly partake in the  American dream.   Congress should honor Justice Ginsburg's legacy by grieving her loss  with her family, her friends, and the rest of the Nation. More  importantly, we should listen to the Justice's wish that the Court she  loved and served so honorably should not be part of the election  season. My sense is Justice Ginsburg recognized that, while the Court  has become more political over time, filling her seat a month or so  before an election would do incredible harm.   Some say we need nine Justices. They certainly didn't feel that way  about Justice Scalia's open seat. Rushing here seems unnecessary, shows  a disregard for history, and shows a lack of faith in the American  people's choice in November, but it appears they will not be thoughtful  and wait. Instead, it is full steam ahead.   I am angered and saddened that my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle are choosing to ram through a nominee who they know will not get  broad support. While this is no different than their agenda over the  last 4 years, the timing and circumstances could be not more startling  or revealing as to their true priorities of power and stacking the  deck.   My colleagues have been rushing to issue statements pledging their  support for a Supreme Court nominee that President Trump has not even  nominated. However, in the 4 months since the Heroes Act passed the  House, they have not been able to muster any urgency to help the  millions affected by the COVID pandemic. Indeed, my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle keep bidding down the amount of assistance they  want to provide.   Public health experts and economists alike have been sounding the  alarm for weeks about what will happen if Congress does not provide  further assistance. They warned that, without resources for testing,  contact tracing, and other critical public health interventions, the  case counts and deaths will only increase. They warned that, without  rental, unemployment, and food assistance, evictions would skyrocket  and households with children will go hungry. They warned that States  would have to resort to deep budget cuts and layoffs without additional  aid.    My Republican colleagues disregarded these warnings even as COVID-19  numbers continued to climb and even after the pandemic unemployment  assistance and Paycheck Protection Program expired. They looked for  excuses not to act, only pausing to bring up their so-called skinny  bills, which fell woefully short of providing the help that is needed  for families, businesses, and the States.   Due to the Trump administration's mismanagement and Republicans'  inaction, much of what these experts predicted is already happening,  and we continue to pass grim milestones signaling that we have failed  to contain the virus and to adequately mitigate the economic fallout.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S5826, September 23, 2020, second column, the following  appears: Due to the Trump administration mismanagement and  Republican inaction, much of what these experts predicted is  already happening, and we continue to pass grim milestones  signaling that we have failed to contain the virus and to  adequately mitigate the economic fallout.

Despite the  overwhelming need, Republicans seem eager to move on and shift all of  their attention to filling a Supreme Court seat in as little time as  possible.   They want to do it in a way that has never been done before. While  other vacancies have arisen in an election year, the history is clear:  The Senate has never confirmed a nomination to the Supreme Court this  close to a Presidential election. Yet it is looking more like  Republicans want to barrel ahead and deny the American people a chance  to weigh in.   We have to ask ourselves: Why? One answer is easy: healthcare. My  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, along with President Trump,  had complete control of Congress and the White House for 2 years, and  after spending 7 years saying that they would repeal the Affordable  Care Act, they tried with all of their might to do just that. What they  didn't anticipate was that the American people would turn against that  effort.   In 2017, I heard from countless constituents, writing and emailing  me, calling my office, approaching me at the grocery store and around  Rhode Island, telling me about how the ACA had benefited them and their  families and urging me to do everything in my power to stop the  Republican effort to repeal the law. I was not alone in this. I know my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle were hearing similar concerns  from their constituents.   President Trump and congressional Republicans did not expect that  they wouldn't be able to convince everyone in their party to go along  with this scheme.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S5826, September 23, 2020, second column, the following  appears: President Trump and congressional Republicans did not  expect that they wouldn't be able to convince everyone in their  party to go along with the scheme.      The Record has been corrected to read: President Trump and  congressional Republicans did not expect that they wouldn't be  able to convince everyone in their party to go along with this  scheme.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     As we all remember, late one night in July 2017, while voting on the    Republican TrumpCare bill, my friend and my chairman, Senator John  McCain, shortly before his death, courageously stood up and gave their    proposal a thumbs-down, saying enough was enough.The following year,  the American people swiftly voted many Republicans out of office,  handing control of the House of Representatives to Democrats, largely  because of healthcare. Democrats won by vowing to protect the ACA for  the American people.   So, now, President Trump and congressional Republicans are counting  on the courts to overturn the ACA for them. They have spent the last 3  years stacking the courts with judicial nominees who they think will  rule against the ACA, regardless of the facts or merits of the case.   With the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, they have their  opportunity to add another anti-healthcare Justice to the Supreme  Court, just days before the Court will begin arguments on the Trump  administration's lawsuit to repeal the ACA.   What is worse is that they are not going to wait until the election  to pursue this because they know the American people do not agree with  them and they can't take the chance that they will lose the election  and, along with it, their opportunity to take healthcare coverage away  from millions of Americans.   Republicans' fervor to fill a Supreme Court vacancy goes beyond  dismantling affordable healthcare and denying healthcare to those with  preexisting conditions. They are counting on a conservative  supermajority on the Supreme Court to accomplish many of their extreme  conservative goals, which they know the majority of the American people  do not share.   This will endanger so many of the rights that Americans have fought  for decades to win. It could mean making our country less democratic by  gutting what is left of the Voting Rights Act. It could mean  overturning the right of women to make their own reproductive  healthcare decisions, in consultation with their doctors, and the  rights of LGBT individuals to live free of discrimination. It could  include stripping away environmental protections, which will become all  the more important as climate change wreaks havoc in our communities.   How these and many other issues are decided by the Supreme Court for  the next several decades is hanging in the balance. That Republicans  want to speed through their nominee shows not only their disdain for  the will of the American people but, also, their lack of confidence  that voters support these policy goals and those who wrongly espouse  them.   The only good that may come of this is that the American people will  gain an even clearer understanding of what is at stake. The American  public now has a clear choice, and I have no doubt that it will make  the right one. They can see and understand what Majority Leader  McConnell is doing.   At the very time the majority leader should be joining with us to  protect the health of the American people in the midst of so much  suffering and needless death during this pandemic, they are, instead,  undertaking a misguided and unjustifiable effort to ram through a  Supreme Court nomination. While I have little belief that Majority  Leader McConnell will change his plans, I would hope that my colleagues  would take a moment and look at where we are. We can debate how we got  here, but right now the matters before us are profound. I hope a few in  the majority decide to reconsider and take a step back from their  maximalist power theory and leave this issue to the next session.   Until then, I will do everything I can to honor Justice Ginsburg and  her  [[Page S5827]]  life's work for what is right and what is fair. We will demand justice  for the American people to make sure that their voices are heard.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Timely  Reauthorization of Necessary Stem Cell Programs Lends Access to Needed  Therapies (TRANSPLANT) Act of 2020 with Senators Richard Burr, Tina  Smith, and Tim Scott. This bill offers promise to the tens of thousands  of individuals diagnosed with leukemia and lymphomas, sickle cell  anemia, and rare genetic blood disorders.   Our bipartisan legislation renews the C.W. Bill Young Cell  Transplantation Program and the National Cord Blood Inventory (NCBI),  the only programs in the country that maintain donor registries for  individuals in need of a bone marrow and umbilical cord blood  transplantation. Over twenty-two million Americans are registered bone  marrow donors resulting in nearly 6,500 transplants just last year. In  the years since NCBI was established, more than 300,000 cord blood  units have been collected, facilitating more than 100,000 blood stem  cell transplants. The TRANSPLANT Act would reaffirm the commitment to  these life-saving programs, which have been helping to connect  individuals in need of bone marrow or umbilical cord blood transplants  with donors for more than two decades.   The public registries, made up of donors from all over the country,  have been a true lifeline for the Americans who have found an unrelated  match. By strengthening and enhancing the important programs operating  these registries, many more Americans will be afforded the opportunity  to find a match if they are ever in need. I look forward to swift  consideration of this legislation in the Senate Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee and working toward passage in the full  Senate.                            ____________________
