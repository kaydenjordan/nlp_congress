 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's leadership on  this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, our veterans deserve high-quality healthcare. They have  earned it. That is why I rise today to urge support of S. 1094, the  Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. This  is landmark, bipartisan legislation to reform the VA and improve care  for our veterans after years of poor performance and scandal.   My grandfather is a World War II veteran who regularly attends the VA  in Indianapolis, so I know firsthand that the vast majority of  employees at the VA are honest and hardworking public servants. Lack of  accountability at the agency, though, has allowed a few bad actors to  damage the VA and harm our vets, from manipulating wait lists to  letting calls to the suicide hotline go unanswered, to theft and  wrongful prescribing of opioids.   Our veterans deserve better.   The Veterans Accountability Act will hold bureaucrats accountable for  wrongdoing, make it easier to dismiss bad employees, and strengthen  protections for whistleblowers. These are commonsense reforms and long  overdue.   Because our military men and women, our Hoosier heroes, fought to  protect us, the least we can do is fight for them and ensure that they  get high-quality care.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill.
