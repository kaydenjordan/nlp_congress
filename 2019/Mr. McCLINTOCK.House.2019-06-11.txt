 Mr. Speaker, there is a reason for the abusive  rhetoric from the left. For 2\1/2\ years, they peddled a monstrous lie  that Donald Trump is colluding with a hostile foreign government. They  concocted it with a phony dossier commissioned by the Clinton campaign  and promoted by the highest officials in the FBI, our intelligence  agencies, and the Justice Department, first in a failed attempt to  interfere with the 2016 Presidential election and then to undermine the  constitutionally elected President of the United States.   Now, despite spending $25 million on an outrageously biased team of  partisan zealots assembled by Mr. Mueller, which initially included the  now-infamous Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and using some of the most  abusive prosecutorial tactics ever employed in this country, they could  find no evidence to support the lie.                                time  1500    So what to do?   They had to think up another lie and think it up quick. So now we  hear cries of obstruction and coverup. Good luck with that.   Coverup of a crime that never happened?   Obstruction, by turning over every document Mueller requested and  even waiving executive privilege to allow the White House counsel to  testify?   Now, Mr. Speaker, you compare that to Hillary Clinton's willful  destruction of 30,000 emails under subpoena and you get a sense of the  double standard involved here.   This is a desperate scavenger hunt to salvage their false narrative,  and their time and the Nation's patience is running out. The other shoe  is about to drop. Broad investigations are now well underway and will  soon reveal how this lie was perpetrated and promoted. Two governments  interfered in our elections, the Russians through ham-handed  propaganda, and the Obama administration by turning the most terrifying  powers entrusted to our government against our political process.   The reckoning is coming. As Longfellow said:         The wheels of the gods grind slow, but they grind       exceedingly fine.
