 Mr. President, I am delighted to commend Dr. Levesque  Elementary School in Frenchville, ME, on being named a 2018 National  Blue Ribbon Exemplary High Performing School. This outstanding school  is one of only 349 schools across the country to receive Blue Ribbon  recognition from the U.S. Department of Education this year.   Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and  private schools that are either academically superior in their States  or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The  schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high  educational standards and accountability.   This award continues a tradition of quality education at Dr. Levesque  Elementary School, which first received a Blue Ribbon in 1999. Serving  128 students from the small rural communities of Frenchville and St.  Agatha in northern Aroostook County, this school is succeeding in its  mission to encourage engaged lifelong learners. As a native of  Aroostook County, I am especially proud of this accomplishment.   Faculty and staff are committed to both academic excellence and each  child's social, emotional, and physical health. They work to ensure a  safe and secure learning environment and to develop strong and  collaborative relationships with parents and community members.  Teachers emphasize math and reading, while also giving students rich  and diverse opportunities, from art and music to robotics and physical  education. The Franco-American communities of Frenchville and St.  Agatha are bilingual, and the school provides daily instruction in the  French language and Acadian culture.   The school's name is a tribute to Dr. Romeo Levesque, who provided  expert, dedicated, and compassionate medical care to these communities  for many decades. The strong school community, where students are  encouraged to pursue their interests and to be of service to others,  honors his memory.   I applaud the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Dr.  Levesque Elementary School. Together, they are succeeding in their  mission to build students' confidence and generate momentum for  learning. They are making a difference in the lives of their students,  helping them reach their full potential as independent, responsible  learners and citizens. I congratulate the entire school community for  this outstanding achievement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am delighted to commend Falmouth High  School of Falmouth, ME, on being named a 2018 National Blue Ribbon  Exemplary High Performing School.
