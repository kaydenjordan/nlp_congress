 Madam President, as we all know by now, last Friday,  President Biden submitted an emergency funding request to Congress. As  we all expected, it calls for funding to support Israel as it defends  itself against the terrorist organization known as Hamas, a proxy for  Iran. It also asks for funding for Ukraine, which continues its heroic  defense against a Russian invasion. It requests funding to strengthen  security in the Indo-Pacific to help our friends and allies combat  increasingly aggressive threats from China.   And, notably, President Biden has also called for emergency funding  to help address the crisis at the southern border. At face value, this  shouldn't be surprising. After all, the Biden border crisis has been  raging for nearly 3 years; and, somehow, it continues to get worse  every day.   Last month, Customs and Border Protection logged nearly 270,000-- 270,000--migrant crossings at the southern border, making it the  busiest month on record. In total, nearly 2.5 million migrants have  entered the United States since last fiscal year--or during the last  fiscal year. That is another record.   We don't have the resources or the personnel to deal with this influx  in what we all should hope would be an efficient, fair, and humane way.  And that needs to change.   First of all, we need to wrest immigration out of the hands of the  cartels who care nothing about the people who smuggle individuals into  the United States for money--a lot of money. It is a very profitable  business. And, also, there are affiliated cartels that are smuggling  the drugs into the United States that killed 108,000 Americans last  year alone. That is also the source of a lot of money for these  criminal organizations, again, who care nothing about the life or  welfare of individuals, either the migrants or people in the United  States. That is what happens when you outsource immigration controls to  criminal organizations as the Biden administration has done.   The President's funding request does include a few items that are  definitely needed, starting with additional Border Patrol agents.  Personnel shortages have impacted all of our missions at the border,  including those that have nothing to do with migration. More Border  Patrol agents would help fill the gaps and alleviate the strain on  frontline law enforcement; but this change is meaningless unless we  address the polygraph examination, which is a major barrier for hiring.   Just to be clear, the policy on passing a polygraph varies so much  from Agency to Agency. But currently, the policy employed by the Border  Patrol has basically made it impossible to fill the quota of Border  Patrol agents that we seek to hire.   The administration has also asked for 375 new immigration judge  teams. There is no doubt that our immigration courts are drowning under  a rapidly growing case backlog. In 2020, before President Biden took  office, there were just under 1.3 million cases pending in the  immigration courts. But thanks to the administration's current  policies, the backlog has now doubled to 2.6 million cases. Simply  adding more judges will be an exercise in futility unless we also  address the pull factors or the policies that are causing the backlog  to grow at such an alarming pace.   I am reminded of something the former Chief of the Border Patrol said  amidst another migration surge. In the summer of 2019, border crossings  were on the rise; although, they pale in comparison to what we are  seeing now.  [[Page S5130]]  Then-Chief Carla Provost testified before the Senate Judiciary  Committee and talked about what it would take to fix the situation. She  said:         We cannot address this crisis by shifting more resources.       It's like holding a bucket under a faucet. It doesn't matter       how many buckets [you have if you don't turn the water off].    The President's request for emergency funding is a bucket, a  relatively small one. But it does nothing to stop the flow. The only  way to do that is by deterrence, and the only way to achieve deterrence  is by delivering consequences for entering the country illegally. We  need to send a message to the people who have no legitimate reason to  remain in the United States that if they come, they will not be able to  stay.   President Biden does not seem to understand that. And in his  emergency funding request, he asks Congress to provide for noncustodial  housing for migrants and expedited removal proceedings.   This is the process that allows law enforcement to quickly remove  migrants who have no legitimate reason to remain in the United States.  I am talking about expedited removal now, the idea that we would  release migrants who are on the verge of being deported is patently  absurd and just shows the chaos and confusion and the lack of any  logical coherence in the Biden border policy.   Anyone who believes that these individuals would come back for their  removal hearing is living in an alternate reality. This would  constitute yet another massive pull factor attracting people to make  that journey to the border. President Biden also called on Congress to  expand the so-called lawful pathways his administration created. But to  be clear, there is nothing lawful about these pathways.   The administration, once again, has usurped Congress's authority in  paroling entire classes of migrants into the United States. ``Parole''  is a technical term. It basically means to release them, even if they  are not claiming asylum, which the Biden administration continues to do  on a massive scale--simply release people into the United States.   This is, unsurprisingly, a violation of the Immigration and  Nationality Act, and any effort to expand these so-called pathways is a  nonstarter in Congress. We will not legitimatize these unauthorized  programs and provide an even bigger incentive for migrants to make the  dangerous journey to the border.   We need to discourage people who have no legitimate claim to come to  the United States this way, not bolster an incentive package. In my  view, there are two broad goals that need to be met in order to address  this crisis in a meaningful way: First, we need to end catch-and- release. So far, the administration has sent a message to people around  the world that if you enter the United States illegally, there is a  good chance you will be able to stay, which, in turn, only encourages  more people to come--just show up at the border, say the magic words,  and then disappear into the great American heartland. We need to revise  this message and make it clear that only those with a legitimate claim  can remain in the United States. Ending catch-and-release is the most  effective way to do that.   No. 2, the administration must remove people who have been determined  to have no legal right to enter or remain in the United States. The  Biden administration has proven it does not take this responsibility  seriously.   In 2021, arrests and deportation by ICE, known as Immigration and  Customs Enforcement, reached an alltime low. So not only are more  people coming into the country than we have ever seen before, but fewer  people are going out who have no legitimate basis to stay here.   In 2021, the Agency carried out fewer than 60,000 deportations that  year, the lowest number on record by a long shot. The following year,  the number of deportations increased slightly but not nearly enough to  make an impact and certainly not enough to discourage people from  continuing to come illegally to enter the United States.   Apprehensions are at record highs; deportations are at historic lows;  and it is clear that this is all part of somebody's plan. Despite  having every tool at its disposal, the administration is trying to move  a mountain with a teaspoon. It is doing just enough to make some people  think they are doing something meaningful without having any real  impact.   While I am glad President Biden seems to have awakened to the fact  that the status quo at the border is unsustainable, his emergency  funding request shows he is still absolutely disinterested in solving  this crisis. He has proven, once again, that he doesn't care about  deterring illegal immigration; he doesn't care about delivering  consequences to individuals who break our laws; and he doesn't care  about solving this crisis. He merely wants to ``manage'' the flow, not  stop it.   This is not a serious proposal. Some of the proposed spending is  actually harmful, and the positive aspects are just window dressing.  The President needs to get serious about the border, and what he sent  us is not serious. One thing is certain, the Senate will not  rubberstamp his paltry border request. You can be certain of that.   This emergency funding bill will absolutely include more funding to  address the border crisis, but this is about more than funding; it is  about the appropriate policies. We need real changes that produce real  consequences, real ways to turn off the flow of illegal immigration and  continuing to enrich the criminal organizations that smuggle people and  drugs across our border.   Later this week, I am eager to talk with some of the true experts on  the border crisis about the current challenges they are facing. Senator  Cruz and I are leading another visit to the Rio Grande Valley, and I am  glad that Senator Ricketts, Senator Lee, and Senator Barrasso will join  us. We are going to spend some time talking to the Border Patrol agents  who actually work on the ground as well as the Customs officers who  deal with the consequences of the administration's failed policies day  in and day out.   We will tour the border to see how virtually anyone--from vulnerable  migrant children to dangerous drug cartel members, to people on the  Terrorist Watchlist--are able to enter the United States. And we will  hear from State officials, local law enforcement, and landowners about  the broader impact of the border crisis in communities across our  State.   It is going to be 2 busy and informative days, and, as always, I am  grateful to the men and women who take the time to meet with us who are  doing the hard job. It would be nice if they knew that this  administration had their back, but they are demoralized, despite the  fact that they continue to do their job, day in and day out, because  they realize that the Biden border policies are designed to fail.   Their insight, however, is invaluable to my work here in the Senate,  and there couldn't be a more important time to hear from the frontline  experts who know about this crisis and how to solve it better than  anyone else.   I especially commend my colleagues from Wyoming, Utah, and Nebraska  for taking the time to make this important trip and their willingness  to hear from Senator Cruz and my constituents on the frontlines of this  issue.   I yield the floor.
