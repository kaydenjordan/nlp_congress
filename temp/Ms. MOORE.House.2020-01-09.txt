 Madam Speaker, late last week, President Trump ordered the  assassination of a high-ranking Iranian official while he was in Iraq.   This action threatens to cascade the United States into an ill- advised, not authorized war with Iran, and is already setting into  motion a series of disastrous unintended consequences for American  security and interests in the Middle East.   The President trashed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which  Iran was following and that put in place the first real restraints on  Iran's nuclear program. The world and America were safer under the  JCPOA framework, period.   Enter Trump, and now we see Iranian rockets firing, U.S. forces being  pushed out of Iraq, and alliances strained as we all await further  retaliations.   Oh, history is replete with the misery befalling those poor empires  who first fight and mistake that for might.   This escalation with Iran must end, Congress must reassert its war  powers authority, and I urge adoption of the resolution.
