 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to an American  patriot and a prominent fixture in my community, retired Major General  Norbert Rappl, who passed away earlier this month.   General Rappl was a courageous veteran who dedicated his life to  serving our great Nation in the United States Army.   A Korean war veteran, he rose through the ranks, retiring as  Commander of the 98th Training Division of the United States Army  Reserves. We are deeply grateful for his service.   Upon returning home, General Rappl turned his dedication to his  community, and my hometown of Irondequoit, becoming a charter member  and past president of the Irondequoit Rotary Club chapter.   His never-ending devotion to serving others was his life's calling  and is a key piece of his legacy that will never be forgotten. May he  rest in peace.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished and, by his own  admission, highly caffeinated gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter),  my Rules Committee colleague and great friend, for yielding me time.   I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation.  In particular, I would like to say a few words about the Affordable  Insulin Now Act.   Over the past two decades, the costs of prescription diabetes drugs  like insulin have artificially skyrocketed by more than tenfold.   A few years ago, I was proud to commission a report by the House  Committee on Oversight and Reform to determine the extent of this price  gouging and how it is affecting communities across the country,  including my own in Rochester, New York, and the impact it is having on  patients, especially older adults, and our uninsured population. The  results of that review were staggering.   In communities across the country, out-of-pocket costs have risen by  400 percent for the Medicare program and beneficiaries over the last  decade. The average price for a standard unit of insulin in the United  States was more than 10 times the average price in a sampling of 32  other countries.   These excessively inflated prices have real consequences on how  patients manage this chronic disease. I have talked with many patients  and families in my own district that have had to ration their dose or  stop taking this lifesaving and life-sustaining medication altogether.   For the richest and most powerful nation in the world to allow this  to continue is nothing less than shameful.   In passing this bill, we are taking the first step of many to rein in  these inflated costs and protecting patients to ensure the best  possible health outcomes.   I am so proud to deliver for my constituents back home, and I look  forward to voting for this rule and getting one step closer toward  seeing the bill passed into law.
