 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of H.R. 2345, the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act, and  I want to thank Mr. Stewart and the committee leaders for the hard work  in presenting this on the floor today.   This bipartisan legislation asks the Federal Communications  Commission and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration to study the designation of a three-digit dialing code  similar to 911. Even 3-year-olds can remember 911. When a family is in  crisis, an 800 number sometimes is difficult to remember.   The suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system makes  it all American because we are faced with these kinds of incidences  many times every day. The bill also requires them to perform a cost- and-benefit service analysis of using a three-digit dialing code for a  national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system and  examine the overall effectiveness of the current National Suicide  Prevention Lifeline and Veterans Crisis Line and recommend ways to  improve the current system.   Each year, 45,000 Americans take their own life, an average of 123  completed suicides every day, and an additional 1 million-plus  Americans attempt suicide each year. While there are many resources for  individuals experiencing a mental health crisis, it can be difficult to  find these resources during this extreme time of need.   The current National Suicide Prevention Lifeline has increased  access, but the dialing code can be cumbersome to remember, 1-800-273- TALK. Just try to remember dialing that many digits.   Unfortunately, in many States where there are numerous entities  providing services, there is not always one consolidated number to  call. The National Suicide Prevention Hotline Improvement Act is an  important step to achieve that end. This legislation will build upon  the success of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to increase  access to lifesaving services while evaluating new and innovative ways  to improve the current system. It is critical that we move quickly on  this bill so that we can begin saving more lives each day.    Mr. Speaker, the judicial branch  serves as one of the key pillars of our democracy, charged with  restraining both the legislative and executive branches from reaching  beyond their constitutional authority first envisioned by our Founding  Fathers. The importance of having qualified judges on the bench is not  only vital to the judiciary, but also to the proper functioning of our  system of checks and balances--and by extension, our democratic system.  By stacking the courts with biased, unqualified judges, President Trump  and Senate Majority Leader McConnell are choosing party over their  country in a manner that will cause enduring harm to the process and  principles that we hold dear as a democratic nation.   The nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme  Court is already a dangerous threat to longstanding precedent on  matters regarding civil rights, abortion, and government oversight.  However, the lower federal courts are equally as important to the  judiciary's ability to protect the fundamental rights that we enjoy as  Americans. President Trump has demonstrated time and time again through  his nominations of extreme candidates that he has little to no regard  for due process, and has every intention of leaving behind a lifelong  legacy of stacking the courts to favor radical right-wing conservatism.   Mr. Speaker, the nominees being put forth by this Administration and  the process by which they are being vetted is a wild and dangerous  departure from regular order. Senate Republicans are knowingly  sidestepping traditional vetting protocols in order to rush right-wing  judicial nominees through the process before the American people can  react. It is a misguided practice that places partisan politics over  the needs of the American people, and I urge my colleagues in the  Senate to oppose any unqualified nominee at every opportunity.                            ____________________
