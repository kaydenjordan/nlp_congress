 Mr. President, today I recognize Lee Axdahl for  his years of leadership to the State of South Dakota and our Nation as  a strong advocate for highway safety.   Lee has always been a leader. Before becoming involved in highway  safety, he had a successful career in radio broadcasting where he won  numerous broadcast journalism awards, owned several radio stations, and  served as president of the South Dakota Broadcasters Association.   Lee got his start in highway safety in 2007 when he began working at  the South Dakota Office of Accident Records as the statistical program  manager. In 2010, when I was working as Governor of South Dakota, I  appointed Lee to serve as director of the South Dakota Highway Safety  Office. He was subsequently reappointed by Governors Dennis Daugaard  and Kristi Noem.   Under Lee's leadership, South Dakota has experienced record-low  traffic fatality levels, including a 22-percent decline in 2019. Under  his leadership, the State of South Dakota has secured a record five  highway safety programming commendations in its most recent National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration Management Review.   Over the years, Lee has worked to implement the State's award-winning  ``Grim Reaper'' public awareness campaign and advocated for expansion  of South Dakota's innovative 24/7 sobriety program to reduce impaired  driving. He also modernized South Dakota's crash reporting abilities by  adopting an electronic system, which has improved data submission  periods from more than 4 months to less than 7 days.   Lee's impact on highway safety has extended beyond South Dakota. He  has served on the board of directors and executive committee of the  Governors Highway Safety Association--GHSA--most recently having served  as its treasurer. In this role, he has mentored new highway safety  directors from other States by offering insight into the successes of  South Dakota. Additionally, he has served as the Federal  Reauthorization Subcommittee chair for the GHSA, where he improved the  Nation's transportation policy in the FAST Act.   I commend Lee Axdahl for his service to South Dakota and our Nation.  I wish him the best in his future endeavors.                            ____________________
