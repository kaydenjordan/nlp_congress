 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate as a  proud alumnus of the recently crowned 2022 College Football National  Champions, the Georgia Bulldogs.   Going 12-1 on the season, the Georgia Bulldogs came into Indianapolis  to face the Alabama Crimson Tide.   In true heavyweight fashion, the grudge match opened as a hard-nosed  defensive battle without one touchdown being scored in the first half  of play.   The Dogs came out down in the second half and captained by head  coach, Kirby Smart, Georgia was able to score the first touchdown to  take the lead.   With a defense championed by the likes of Jordan Davis and Nakobe  Dean, the Bulldogs managed to hold Alabama to one touchdown all game.   Quarterback Stetson Bennet, who by the way is from Blackshear in  Pierce County in the First Congressional District of Georgia that I  have the honor and privilege of representing, quarterback Stetson  Bennett completed his Cinderella-story season, stepping up when it  mattered most.   With an interception returned for a touchdown to seal the deal, the  University of Georgia was victorious.  [[Page H17]]    It has been four decades and some change since the University of  Georgia brought a national title home to Athens, and I am so excited to  see it finally happen.   I was especially excited to see several players from the First  District, the aforementioned Stetson Bennett, Nolan Smith from  Savannah, and Jack Podlesny from Glynn County help secure this amazing  victory.   Congratulations to the Georgia Bulldogs. You will live in the hearts  of Georgia fans forever. Athens is title town again. Go Dawgs.               Celebrating the 100th Birthday of Charley Trippi     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  momentous 100th birthday of the Georgia Bulldog legend, Charley Trippi.   Charley is a fixture in Dawg Nation and the football community.   A member of both the college football and pro football Hall of Fame,  Charley was a dual athlete at the University of Georgia, playing both  baseball and football in 1942, 1945, and 1946.   While in college, Charley played halfback and quarterback and  received the Maxwell Award given to the Nation's top all-around player.   Charley was also honored as a unanimous All-American SEC player of  the year and as a two-time All-SEC player.   In 1942, Charley helped lead the Georgia Bulldogs to their first  national championship.   Selected as the first pick in the first round by the Chicago  Cardinals in the NFL draft, Charley continued to have an illustrious  career in the pros.   The Cardinals organization inducted Charley into the Arizona  Cardinals Ring of Honor following his time in the NFL.   We are so happy and excited that Charley has reached this milestone.  Happy birthday, Charley.       Congratulating the Benedictine Cadets High School Football Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Benedictine Cadets High School football team for winning the 2021  Georgia 4A State title.   Winning football games in Georgia, where the sport practically runs  through our veins, is hard. But winning the State title requires  exceptional grit, determination, and perseverance.   After the Benedictine Cadets suffered a loss in the 2020 State  playoff semifinals, they entered the 2021 season with one goal: Winning  a State title.   Benedictine has consistently exhibited drive, dedication, and the  winner's mentality.   Head coach Danny Britt has tirelessly worked to lead this team to a  State title, and their work has finally paid off.   The Georgia 4A State title included Division 1 talent on both sides  and was a battle from the beginning. Winning by only a touchdown, it  truly was a game for the ages.   We here in the First District of Georgia are so proud of the  Benedictine Cadets and all that they have accomplished and will  accomplish.   Let's do it again next year.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  David Estes on his appointment to be the new top prosecutor for the  Southern District of Georgia.
