 Mr. Speaker, I will emphasize something I think that  has been said before. You always try to think of something new.   You can't help but notice that the number of people who do not want  the gray wolf delisted live in areas that don't have gray wolves. The  State of Wisconsin is maybe typical in this. They introduced gray  wolves to northern Wisconsin. When there was controversy about it, they  said, Well, that is okay. These are northern areas where very few  people live. Of course, even then I had a problem with it because  people did live up there.   I don't think the people near where this judge lived would want the  gray wolves wandering around the Virginia and Maryland suburbs. They  would not want the concern, walking around at night with the wolves,  even though  [[Page H9547]]  they don't normally attack humans. They would not want the concern of  the wolves out there if they have dogs or other pets around. If they  had cattle, they wouldn't want that concern.   Wisconsin being very typical, I think the gray wolves that began in  the northern part of the State are now all the way down to areas like  Columbia County or Sheboygan County in the southern part of the State.  And they will, unless somebody does something about it, continue to  grow, continue to go further south, and the herds will continue to  grow.   I would ask people who are going to vote against this: Think how you  would feel if you have a significant number of gray wolves wandering  around your subdivision--or even one gray wolf wandering around your  subdivision--and then have more respect for the Congressmen who are  living with these gray wolves.
