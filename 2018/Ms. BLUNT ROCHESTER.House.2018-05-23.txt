 Mr. Chairman, first let me thank Chairman  Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith for the time. I also want to thank  both of them for including my amendment in the en bloc 2 amendment  package.   My amendment expresses this body's strong support of the Dover Air  Force Base in Delaware. The Dover Air Force Base is a pillar of our  community in the First State and a pillar of the Air Force community at  large.   The Dover Air Force Base is home to the 436th and the 512th Air Lift  Wings, representing over 4,000 Active-Duty military and civilians. The  436th was recently recognized with the Air Force Outstanding Unit  Award. The award served as recognition of the exemplary  [[Page H4677]]  work of the entire unit led by Colonel Ethan Griffin who will,  unfortunately, soon be leaving Dover.   Along with supporting the missions of the two Air Lift Wings, Dover  is also home to the Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs and  carries out the solemn obligation of caring for our fallen heroes.   Mr. Chair, it is right and fitting that the United States Congress  recognize and acknowledge the incredibly important work of the Dover  Air Force Base, and I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc  amendment package.
