 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition  of November as National Family Caregivers Month.   Nearly 600,000 New Yorkers are caregivers for loved ones living with  dementia. This is difficult work, and it takes an emotional toll that  too often goes unrecognized.   My bill, the Comprehensive Care for Alzheimer's Act, would enact  higher-quality dementia care standards in Medicare and Medicaid. It  broadens assistance, including direct education and support for  caregivers and improved access to high-quality doctors with expertise  in dementia.   Dementia care is very complex, so we need to do all we can to make  sure the patients and their families have what they need.   I hear regularly from my Alzheimer's advocates in Buffalo and western  New York and throughout New York that much more needs to be done.   This bill can help them get the best possible care for their loved  ones while providing support to them as caregivers. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.                            ____________________
