 Mr. Speaker, I represent a working coastal community. Our  communities in Texas District 36 were hit very, very hard by Hurricane  Harvey, and our Nation's energy security relies on those communities.   Coastal energy and petrochemical refining facilities like the 150  that I represent cannot function without a steady and reliable  workforce, and that workforce cannot exist without a stable housing  market.   I am hopeful that my House colleagues will have the wisdom to see the  necessity of passing S. 1182, so that we can maintain this national  security issue.
