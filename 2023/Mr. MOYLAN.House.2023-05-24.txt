 Mr. Speaker, it is with distinct honor and respect that I  rise to recognize the Honorable Madeleine Bordallo who is celebrating  her 90th birthday this month. An eight-term Member of the House of  Representatives, Congresswoman Bordallo stood in these very sacred  Halls and under this historic dome for 16 years representing Guam and  ensuring our community needs were always prioritized on a Federal  level.   A two-term Lieutenant Governor, a senator for several terms in the  Guam legislature, and an iconic first lady for 8 years, Congresswoman  Bordallo's record with public service is vast and endless.   As a pioneer for education and advocate for our youth and one who has  always prioritized the beautification of our island, there are many  achievements in Guam which are credited to the work of the  Congresswoman. I would need several hours just to name a handful of her  accomplishments over the decades.   On behalf of a thankful Nation and island, I thank Congresswoman  Madeleine Bordallo for her decades of work for the people.   Mr. Speaker, I request this august body to join me in these sacred  and historic Halls of Congress to wish Congresswoman Madeleine Bordallo  a happy birthday and blessings for many, many more.                            ____________________
