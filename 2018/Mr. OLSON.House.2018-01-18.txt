 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New Jersey for  allowing me to join this important debate. My friends on the other side  are showing why the people, the American people, like root canals, head  lice, and colonoscopies more than Congress. In a brazen act that hurts  our youth in poverty, congressional Democrats are going to vote against  basic healthcare for these needy kids.   The CHIP program is their only choice for their health. Nearly half a  million young Texans depend upon SCHIP. It expired September 30 of this  year. This bill we vote on tonight will extend SCHIP for 6 more years.   Mr. Speaker, I beg my colleagues, listen to your heart, to your soul,  and the voice of these kids who want basic healthcare. Vote for SCHIP  today. Vote for the CR.
