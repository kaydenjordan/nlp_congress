 Mr. Speaker, today, I want to recognize a nonprofit  organization in my district providing a home and a future for horses  who have experienced abuse and neglect. Starfish Equine Rescue works to  rehabilitate and ultimately adopt unwanted, abused, and neglected  horses.   Since 2012, this organization has been rescuing horses from the most  deplorable conditions and giving them a second chance at life. Starfish  Equine Rescue works hard to bring these horses back to health and  identify caring and supportive homes in south Jersey and in surrounding  states.   In addition to rescuing horses from abuse and neglect, Starfish  Equine rescues horses that were slated for slaughter and are saved. And  this is a practice that I have joined with Representative Schakowsky  and other House colleagues in opposing under H.R. 961, which I hope  someday will be the law of the land.   The volunteers at Starfish and the adoptive homes of these once  vulnerable horses have provided a great service to south Jersey and  into the future. We are proud of them. May God bless them.                            ____________________
