 Mr. Speaker, throughout America's 241-year history,  millions of brave men and women have fought for our freedom, and we are  grateful for their service.   Sometimes, Mr. Speaker, we find an American hero who worked behind  the scenes to keep us free. Eugene Wing of Fairfield, Maine, in central  Maine, is one of these heroes.   Gene was a gifted student who graduated from Bowdoin College in 1905  and then studied economics at Oxford University in England. He was then  hired, Mr. Speaker, by The International Banking Corporation and sent  to the Philippines, where he became an expert on the trade of natural  resources in the Far East.   At the start, Mr. Speaker, of World War I and, later, World War II,  the Army Intelligence Service asked Gene to help defeat the enemy and  save the world. Mr. Wing took extraordinary risks to locate and help  control the flow of coal, oil, gold, silver, and iron ore which were  desperately needed by the enemy's war machine. His daring spirit and  extraordinary knowledge of these raw materials gave America and our  Allies the upper hand to win both World Wars. Mr. Wing's unusual skill  made him a target of our enemies, and he was eventually captured and  put to death.   Mr. Speaker, Eugene Wing from Fairfield, Maine, is a true American  hero. Millions of people around the world who live in freedom today are  the beneficiaries of his sacrifice, his bravery, and his patriotism. We  are grateful for Mr. Wing, and we will never forget.                            ____________________
