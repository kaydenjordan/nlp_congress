 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, October  1, 2019.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of a  pillar of New England's law enforcement community. Don Kennedy served  with honor in the Rhode Island State Police for 24 years before  retiring as a captain in 1998.   When he left the force, he did not leave his brethren in blue,  though. Rather, for more than two decades, he has guided the work of  the New England State Police Information Network, or NESPIN. As deputy  director of field services, he helped departments across the Nation  with investigations, and he will be retiring as executive director of  the program.   Don has been a great advocate for the Federal Regional Information  Sharing Systems program that helps fund NESPIN. From Don, I have  learned the  [[Page H8074]]  immense value of networking State police resources, and my friend Mr.  King from New York and I have helped ensure the program is  appropriately funded by Congress.   Don's legacy will live on in the RISS programs that he has helped  support and the communities made safer by them. As a fellow Rhode  Islander, I wish him the best of luck in this exciting, new, and  forthcoming chapter of his life as he enters retirement.                            ____________________
