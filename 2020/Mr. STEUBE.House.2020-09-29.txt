 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we are here to waste time on an unnecessary  resolution to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.   To be clear, President Trump and House Republicans are committed to  ensuring Americans receive a free and fair election. Republicans are  also committed to peaceful transitions of power.   Democrats have been the ones to contest Presidential elections. They  contested the 2000 election, they contested the 2004 election, and  Democrats still refuse to believe that President Trump won the 2016  election fair and square. So ahead of November 3, 2020, the Democrats  are using floor time for partisan smear tactics to undermine the  President.   The administration has been clear. On September 24, 2020, Press  Secretary Kayleigh McEnany stated: ``The President will accept the  results of a free and fair election. He will accept the will of the  American people.''   The real question today is: Will the Democrats accept the results of  the election?   They are already questioning the legitimacy of this election. Hillary  Clinton, the Democrats' nominee in 2016, has advised: ``Joe Biden  should not concede under any circumstances.''   A senior House Democrat stated that President Trump is not going to  win fairly.                                time  1715    Democrat Presidential nominee Joe Biden has said that his ``single  greatest concern'' is that the President is ``going to try and steal  this election.''   This resolution is just another attempt by the Democrats to instill  fear within the American people, just one more hoax for them to  perpetrate upon the American people.   Not only have Democrats prematurely questioned the results of the  election; they have proactively sought to erode basic election security  safeguards as States move toward all mail-in voting, universal mail-in  ballots. This is the concern that President Trump has been warning  about.   In several States, Democrats are trying to eliminate absentee ballot  witness and notary requirements, expanding ballot harvesting, and  extending deadlines for States to receive mail-in ballots for up to a  week after the election. If successful, Democrats will inevitably open  the door to election crimes and administration errors.   So while making baseless accusations about President Trump stealing  the election, Democrats are also undermining the integrity of the  electoral process by pushing for less accountability. On top of that,  we are here today to consider a resolution to chastise the President  for raising policy concerns about the process. This is ridiculous, and  it needs to stop.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr Speaker, let's be clear: The real threat to our democracy are the  attempts to undermine the election process.   Universal mail-in voting is not the same as absentee ballots like we  do in Florida. When a voter requests an absentee ballot, she knows to  expect it. Universal mail-in voting is when States mass mail ballots to  voters, whether or not a voter has moved, has died, or is otherwise no  longer eligible to vote or is even a citizen of our country. Universal  mail-in voting increases the risk of election crime or administrative  error because States are providing prepaid return envelopes for  election ballots.   The U.S. Postal Service does not typically postmark premarked mail,  and although it has a policy to postmark election-related mail, its  policy is not foolproof, as we have seen in some primary elections over  the summer.   All of these last-minute changes will harm the integrity of the  election process and risk chaos in the general election. We are already  seeing the disastrous results of the Democrats' last-minute process  changes.   Last week, the Justice Department found that several military ballots  were discarded in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. Seven of the nine  ballots were cast for President Trump--not surprising.   This month, the Georgia Secretary of State revealed that at least  1,000 Georgians voted twice in the June 2020 primary, once via mail-in  balloting and once in person.   In New York, Governor Cuomo's last-minute shift to all-mail voting  cost thousands of ballots in Chairwoman Maloney's primary to be  discarded for lacking postmarks. Election officials took 6 weeks to  certify the results of the primary.   In a New Jersey municipal election, a last-minute shift to all-mail  voting resulted in the Postal Service still delivering ballots to  election officials weeks after the election.   If these problems occurred in local primary elections, the risk to a  national general election is even greater. The President is right to  highlight these problems, and I fail to understand why Democrats won't.   The best and surest guarantee of electoral integrity is for Americans  to vote in person where safe and possible, with absentee ballots  available for those who legitimately cannot make it to the polls or  have voter ID safeguards in places like we have in Florida.   This resolution is nothing but political messaging and creating a  narrative without any facts to base it, just like the Russia collusion  hoax.   There is no question that every single American, including President  Trump, wants a peaceful transfer of power after a free and fair  election, but this rhetoric and fear-mongering by our friends across  the aisle must end. The liberal mainstream media and Democrats should  stop this nonsense and let the American people speak.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
