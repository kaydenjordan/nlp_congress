 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his words on the importance of  making sure that our Federal workforce is properly compensated. Indeed,  this is an important subject.   Mr. Chairman, I guess my question here today is, fundamentally, if it  is so important, then why haven't we had a hearing? Why haven't we had  a markup? Why the rush to push this bill on the floor?   Not too long ago, my good friend from Maryland, the chairman of the  committee, would be on this same floor arguing the same thing: Why are  we not having a markup? Why are we not going through regular order?   Mr. Chairman, I remind this body that, less than 30 days ago, there  was a vote on the House floor that said we are going to return to  regular order; we  [[Page H1296]]  are going to make sure that every bill goes through the committee, has  a markup, and actually has fair debate.   Yet, here we are, less than 30 days into this new Congress, and we  are putting forth a messaging bill that, quite frankly, has not been  vetted. The amendment process has not come out of the Committee on  Oversight and Reform.   I will also say, and this is no laughing matter, I have been one of  the few Members on our side of the aisle on this committee who has  actively engaged in trying to make sure that our Federal workforce is  not only compensated, but properly recognized.   Mr. Chairman, here is my problem. According to Federal workers, over  25 percent of them believe that raises do not happen based on merit,  that everyone gets a raise. Indeed, this bill does that. It says,  regardless of how you perform, we are going to give everybody the same  increase.   Now, that same Federal workforce went even further. One-third of them  said that we don't do enough to get rid of poor performers.   What message are we sending to the Federal workforce here today? We  are rushing a bill that has not gone through committee. We have not  provided meaningful amendments that are actually appropriate. We have a  Federal workforce that says they don't get raises based on the merits  of their work, on the hard work they put forth. Indeed, they are saying  that a third of the employees are getting compensated regardless of  their performances.   Now, when we look at that, what message does this body send to the  Federal workforce? It says that it doesn't matter what kind of job you  do. I think that is a terrible message to send.   I can tell you, Mr. Chairman, as we look at this bill--and I am sure  we will debate the merits of this particular piece of legislation--we  have the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Connolly, here, and the gentleman  from Maryland, Mr. Cummings, both Members who I respect greatly. Yet,  this rush to put this messaging bill on the floor does nothing but  damage the underlying support that many of us on both sides of the  aisle have for the Federal workforce.   I strongly object to this particular measure. Let's slow it down.  Let's go through the appropriate time to make sure that, indeed, we  have a markup, that we have a bill.   The chairman knows full well that Federal workers, not only in and  around Washington, D.C., but across the Nation, deserve our full  attention, and this deserves a full debate.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), my good friend, the ranking member of  the committee, and a champion for the American people.                                time  1100     Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am glad the Chairman made this admonishment because some of the  comments that were just offered actually seemed to be directed at me  from a standpoint of respect. I would remind the gentleman from  Maryland, both gentlemen from Maryland, that this is one of the  individuals who has actually worked in a bipartisan fashion on TPS and  a number of things. The majority leader knows that well.   I would also say if we are going to make broad-sweeping statements  that impugn the motives of individuals, it needs to start with the  previous President of the United States, Barack Obama, because he froze  the Federal workforce at zero three different times.   I didn't hear the outrage on this floor, Mr. Chairman, that I am  hearing today. It is somehow always one side of the aisle's fault,  unless it happens to be their party's President that invokes the  freeze.   So I would say, Mr. Chairman, we need to make sure that those broad- brush characterizations are not conveyed here on the House floor.    Mr. Chair, I respectfully yield to the gentleman from  Maryland.    I appreciate the gentleman, but I want to make sure, Mr.  Chairman, we correct the record because the gentleman is correct in  2009 and 2010. But we gave them raises in 2010. The Federal pay freezes  were 2011, `12, and `13 when the same President was saying that  everything was going fine. So I want to remind the gentleman that if we  are going to look at history, then I think--to use the gentleman's  words--let's not use revisionist history.    Mr. Chairman, I am going to direct it to you. The same  gentleman who is making the argument here today was not on the House  floor talking about how evil the President was and how he should not be  doing that. So I just want to make sure we correct the record here  today.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Jordan).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, before I make some statements, I would  notify the gentleman from Maryland, my good friend, Mr. Cummings, that  I have no additional speakers on this particular topic, so I am  prepared to close at any time he would like to do so.   Mr. Chairman, I will continue to reserve the balance of my time based  on the speakers the gentleman might have.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We hear a lot of discussion today on what is reasonable and small  amounts. In fact, the pay raise that they are talking about is about  $5.5 billion a year or $55 billion over 10. Actually, CBO would  probably score it higher than that, closer to $60 billion over 10  years. Yet this whole shutdown that we are talking about could have  been solved with a compromise between zero and $5.7 billion for a wall.   So it was an extreme amount of money when we are talking about  securing families, securing our borders, and protecting our  communities. It was a price too high to pay. But now, all of a sudden,  it is not too high of a price to pay because it is a small amount of  money? I fail to see the logic, Mr. Chairman.   When we are looking at this, if we are really talking about  compromises, where was the compromise over the last 35 days? There was  zero money for a wall on day one. There was zero money for a wall on  day 35. Yet, here today, we are talking about $5 billion or $6 billion  as if it were pocket change.   I find that interesting, Mr. Chairman, because, as we look at this  particular issue, my friends on the opposite side of the aisle would  have the American people think that it is only the Republicans who are  totally responsible for everything. Yet we know that history shows  that, when there was a Democrat in the White House, indeed, there was a  pay freeze 3 different years.   We also know that there were two votes during the economic and  financial meltdown in 2008 and 2009 where they gave Federal workers a 3  percent increase while everybody else was out looking for a job. Now,  where is the parity in that?   The last question I would have for you, Mr. Chairman, is this: Where  is the parity, when we look at our military men and women's faces, when  we start talking about 2.6, that they are getting the same amount? They  are not getting the same amount. Talk to a chief master sergeant who  has been on the job for 15 years. He is getting far less pay than the  Federal worker who is getting this same increase when you have over 25  percent of the Federal workforce making over $100,000 a year.   We hear all these statistics that are low statistics, but let's at  least be honest in our debate. When we look at what we have, if this is  a small amount of money, I guess I would challenge my colleagues on the  opposite side: Let's find a compromise on border security measures.   What amount of money is proper to save families from losing loved  ones? I have looked in the faces of angel moms and angel dads, where  they have lost their kids. Are we going to just turn our back on them  as well?   Perhaps there is a spirit of compromise here where we can work  together and find a compromise where there are no more shutdowns. Let's  look at passing a bill that freezes congressional pay if there is a  shutdown. I am all in. Are all the Democrats in? Let's look at it, Mr.  Chairman.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me close by saying a sincere word of compliment to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Connolly).   We have great differences on this piece of legislation, and, indeed,  we represent very different districts. It has been said many times that  you can disagree without being disagreeable, and I want t compliment  the two gentlemen for their vigorous debate today yet where they didn't  make personal attacks. I hope that, Mr. Chairman, they have seen the  same from me, and I have high respect for both of them.    I also believe that, at times, where perhaps we deescalate the  emotions--and I know this is a highly charged, emotional debate, as it  should be--we can find common ground.   Mr. Chairman, I commit to the two gentlemen with whom I have had the  privilege of working for the last 6 years that I will continue to work  hard and with great resolve to find ways that we can not only recognize  and compensate our Federal workers, but we can do so in a manner that  is fair and equitable and certainly makes sure that the servants they  are is recognized.   Mr. Chairman, I would also say that this particular piece of  legislation, hopefully, will provide the fodder for us going back to  the committee and going through a markup process to look at how we  actually address this, where we actually have hearings and bring in  experts, because, Mr. Chairman, we have had the majority leader of the  Congress on this House floor citing one particular survey and we have  had me here citing the CBO, and those two statistics are at odds. So I  think it is important that we hear from real experts and figure out how  we do this.   The time is now for us to find a way to work in a bipartisan manner  to truly move this country forward. The Federal workforce is an  important part of that.   I believe this particular piece of legislation sends a bad message to  those Federal workers who believe that pay raises are not based on  merit, that they don't identify the poor performers. We have to address  that as well, Mr. Chairman.   Mr. Chairman, I urge rejection of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment suffers some of the same defects as the  underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, while there are numerous dedicated civil servants in  all parts of the Federal Government, offering an additional across-the- board pay raise is simply not good policy. It rewards the bad along  with the good.   The United States Secret Service is made up of many brave men and  women, very honorable men and women. However, in 2015, the bipartisan  report issued jointly by then-Chairman Chaffetz and the new chairman of  Oversight and Reform, then-Ranking Member Cummings of the Oversight and  Government Reform Committee, detailed significant personnel problems.  The report describes ``an extraordinarily inefficient hiring process  which overburdens the USSS with low-quality applications.''   So the men and women of the uniformed division render critical  services to our government. Many of them are friends. And, truly, as we  see their dedication, they have to sacrifice so much. Whether it is at  the Vice President's residence or whether it is on the complex just a  few blocks from here, there is no margin for failure with respect to  their protective mission, and I acknowledge that.   However, an across-the-board pay increase does exactly that. It  rewards the good along with the bad. That is why we have to have,  indeed, a merit-based system that truly recognizes the great  performers--the vast majority of whom are great performance--but does  not recognize and reward those who are not doing it. We need to do  that. And for that reason, I would reject this particular amendment and  ask my colleagues to oppose it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, to rehash all the reasons, both good and  bad, I am willing to work in a bipartisan way with the chairman of both  the committee and the subcommittee to try to find ways to address this  issue. This amendment does not do that.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I am going to keep my remarks brief as we  have got a number of different amendments going through.   I acknowledge the gentlewoman's tenacity and her willingness to offer  this. I would point out, Mr. Chairman, though, this particular across- the-board pay raise, it really shouldn't apply to the very individuals  that she is talking about because they have flexibility already. We  know that. I mean, they get different pay raises.   That is not to undermine the wonderful work that they do. I have been  privileged to be able to talk to NASA folks from here in Washington,  DC, to her home district in the great State of Texas and across this  country. Remarkably, they are one of the best run agencies--and I say  that under the previous NASA Administrator and under the current NASA  Administrator.   So it is not to not acknowledge their good work, but the whole  premise of being able to give them a bump, there is already great  pushback among some Federal workers about the flexibility of those  individuals and the way that they get their pay raises. There are  claims of unfairness. So I think that this sends a wrong message.   Mr. Chair, I urge the rejection of this particular amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I would highlight one thing.   We are going through all these amendments that are clarifying and  technical amendments and all of that. That could have all been avoided  if we had just had a hearing and had a markup and we had gone through  it, and yet here we are today on the House floor trying to make  amendments to a bill that, candidly, is missing the mark.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Jordan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan).    Mr. Chairman, I can tell you that when we look at  sending a message, this sends entirely the wrong message. We need to  make sure that we reward Federal workers, but we also hold them  accountable. I urge rejection of this particular amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I notice a smirk on your face. We find it laughable as  well. But I enjoy the gentleman from Missouri.   Is that the way you say it, the gentleman from Missouri?    Missouri. Excuse me, Mr. Speaker. Thank you.   Mr. Speaker, I enjoy the humor, but unfortunately, there is nothing  funny about this.   I find it just unbelievable that the gentleman opposite would be  talking about how important this resolution is. They just dropped it on  Monday night. I mean, it hasn't been out there for any length of time.  In fact, it violated the very rule that this Chamber passed in the  beginning of this Congress, yet somehow this resolution is so  unbelievably important.   It is nothing more than a message meant to go after the President of  the United States. Quite frankly, I find this resolution nothing more  than a political stunt. I am troubled by it, Mr. Speaker, because here  we are today arguing over this resolution that could have been  dropped--we were here working. It could have been dropped long ago, but  the gentlewoman from Virginia drops it just on Monday night of this  week.   Maybe they were working on the wording in Puerto Rico when they were  down there caravanning with lobbyists, Mr. Speaker, that you know very  well.   Maybe when Christmas was here, when the President was in the White  House willing to negotiate, they were working and fine-tuning this  message to make sure that it is here.   No, that is not what this is about. This is about a political stunt.  This is literally a political messaging point meant to garner,  hopefully, the support for some Member of Congress who has a swing  district, so that they can send a message and take it.   Mr. Speaker, I am here today to let you know that we don't need  words. We need compromise.   I take the gentleman from Missouri's word. If we are willing to work  together and find a compromise, I think we all would prefer that there  is never another shutdown.   In fact, I think that we ought to propose legislation that would  suspend congressional pay for every Member of Congress if there is ever  another shutdown. Hopefully, my Members opposite would join me in that,  where we can put some kind of pain to make sure that we are there.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the comments that we just heard from the well, from the  majority leader, fail to mention one critical point about this  resolution.   This resolution doesn't do anything to stop a future shutdown. It is  designed, in its purpose to give cover to a number on the other side of  the aisle who voted in this very Chamber to not fund those who were  deemed essential pay at a critical time. In fact, indeed, the very  sponsor of this resolution voted against giving pay to those men and  women who continue to show up to vote and now somehow are going to vote  on a resolution and make it all okay. If we are going to have history,  let's make sure it is accurate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, in consultation with my friend opposite, we  are going to yield to the gentleman from West Virginia and then  recognize the Republican leader after that, and then I will be prepared  to close.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia  (Mr. Mooney).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   We have dozens of people who are willing to speak, but in the  interest of time, none more important than the Republican leader.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, these are powerful words by our Republican leader. There  has been a lot of debate. I don't think a more somber moment have I  experienced this week on the House floor than when the 50 names were  read out, where their loved ones will never be able to welcome them  home. There will be ball games that are missed. There will be calls  that are no longer made of, ``Welcome home, Daddy,'' or ``welcome  home'' to a son or a daughter.   Mr. Speaker, we have talked a lot about the pain and anguish of  Federal employees. Indeed, there are real hardships there that are  undeniable. But, Mr. Speaker, they are getting their pay back. For the  lives of the 50 people who were just named on this House floor, there  is no returning. Their lives were extinguished, Mr. Speaker, and we  must do something about that as well.   I am committed to my colleagues opposite to work with them to protect  Federal workers, as long as they are willing to work with us to protect  the communities and the safety of moms and dads from coast to coast.   On that, it is important that we have no more show votes. This  resolution is meaningless other than to provide cover for some on the  other side of the aisle who voted against giving pay to those who were  essential employees.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
