 Mr. Speaker, night after night, young people in  Portland, joined by thousands of their neighbors, gathered to demand  justice that Black lives matter. Yet, today, thousands are caught in  the legacy of Richard Nixon's cynical ``War on Drugs.'' It targeted  young, and especially Black people, for selective enforcement. Too many  are in jail or prison for nonviolent, often trivial offenses.   Today, over two-thirds of Americans--and the majority of  Republicans--think that cannabis should be legal. Let's pass the MORE  Act, with many of Barbara Lee's marijuana justice provisions already  approved by the Committee on the Judiciary. Stop discriminatory,  selective enforcement. Let's legalize it and stop enforcement all  together.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to finally protect young Black Americans from  the dangerous, discriminatory, selective enforcement on the War on  Drugs. Time to finally legalize marijuana.                            ____________________
