 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from  Michigan for the time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 732, which would prohibit  the U.S. Government from entering into settlement agreements or  enforcing settlement agreements if the settlement agreement includes a  term that provides a payment to be made to a third party. In the class  action context, these donations are known as cy-pres.   Under existing laws, settlements from Federal enforcement actions can  include payments to third parties to advance programs that assist with  recovery, benefits, and relief for communities harmed by lawbreakers to  the extent such payments further the objectives of the enforcement  action. This bill would cut that ability off. It cuts off any payments  to third parties other than individualized restitution and other forms  of direct payment for actual harm. That restriction would handcuff  Federal enforcement officials from actually doing justice.   This legislation arose out of the Wall Street too-big-to-fail episode  in 2008, which resulted in the Great Recession, where millions of  Americans lost their homes to foreclosure because of the actions of  these too-big-to-fail banks insofar as the subprime mortgage crisis is  concerned.   So the Department of Justice sued these big banks, which, by the way,  [[Page H8114]]  have continued to just get bigger and bigger after they received their  Wall Street bailout, and the American people who lost their homes did  not receive a bailout.   This legislation is to protect those same banks, and I would add that  we have got Steve Mnuchin now as the head of the Treasury Department in  the Trump administration. So this legislation is in keeping with that  which would protect and coddle these Wall Street thugs who have now  ascended to the seat of government and look to lock down their control.  With this legislation, they prevent themselves from being sued.   My friends on the other side of the aisle are complicit. They support  too big to fail. They support the big banks. It is at the expense of  the little guy, the people who work hard every day working for a  salary, an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, which seems to be  harder and harder to do these days because of the legislation that this  Congress passes.   This is just another in a long line of pieces of legislation that  coddles and protects those who really need no protection. They should  be under the jail for what they have done to the American people.   I fight against this kind of legislation. It is wrong for America,  and it is wrong for its citizens. It is great for the big banks.    Mr. Chairman, the Department of Justice, the  same Federal agency that obtained benefits for the homeowners who were  hurt by the excesses of the big banks, that Justice Department is now  controlled by Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, who is not very keen on  trying to recover damages on behalf of the people. If he has to get  permission from Steve Mnuchin of the Treasury Department to do it, they  work so hand in hand, you know that there is not going to be any relief  for the homeowners of this country.     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 3, line 11, insert after ``settlement agreement'' the       following: ``(except as provided in subsection (g))''.        Add at the end of the bill the following:        (g) Exception.--The provisions of this Act do not apply in       the case of a settlement agreement that directs funds to       remediate the indirect harms caused by unlawful conduct,       including the intentional bypassing, defeating, or rendering       inoperative a required element of a vehicle's emissions       control system in violation of section 203 of the Clean Air       Act (42 U.S.C. 7522).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 577, the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to  this so-called Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act. It is not a slush fund  at all. It is a fund that goes to compensate people who are harmed due  to the wrongdoing of mostly large multinational corporations. So this  is misnamed. It talks about a slush fund. There is no slush fund  involved here.   This is an unwise and odious bill. What my amendment would do would  be to exempt cases concerning manipulations of emissions standards from  the harshness of this bill. In other words, the Federal Government,  through the EPA, could institute a lawsuit against a firm or company,  large multinational foreign company like Volkswagen, as it did a couple  of years ago, and obtain benefits that would accrue to not just the  direct recipients of the harm from Volkswagen, but also to society at  large that was harmed by Volkswagen's fraudulent activity.   What happened was that Volkswagen sold about 590,000 diesel-powered  vehicles here in the United States. These vehicles were supposed to  conform with U.S. law insofar as emissions standards are concerned.  What Volkswagen did was put a mechanism in the cars that would defeat  the ability of the regulators who wanted to check to find out whether  or not the vehicles complied with emissions standards. So Volkswagen  cheated. They sold 590,000--almost 600,000--vehicles on America's roads  that were unknowingly polluting the very air that all of us breathe. So  we all suffered a harm as a result of Volkswagen's fraud. But there  were 590,000 vehicle owners who had to be protected as well.   So the EPA sued Volkswagen. Volkswagen knew they were wrong. They  settled the case. It was about $15 billion. That shows you how much  money they have and how much money they are trying to protect here with  this bill. The $15 billion was to go to compensate the aggrieved  vehicle owners as well as society at large for the harm that was done  due to the fraudulent conduct.   Now, what this legislation would do would be to cut the ability of  the U.S. Government to sue a corporate wrongdoer and receive benefits  that it would then put into the hands of the individuals who were  harmed, as well as to rectify the harm done to society.   This amendment would exempt this kind of case, the Volkswagen case,  from the harsh restrictions of this legislation. So I would ask, in the  interest of our environmental consciousness, that this body would vote  in favor of this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is nonsense to say that this  bill protects corporate polluters and corporate wrongdoers--that is  what we just heard--and that the amendment is unnecessary because it  addresses indirect harm, and that indirect harm should be addressed by  not bureaucrats in the EPA, but by Congress.   Now, we all know how gridlocked Congress has been over the years.  There has been nothing coming out of this Congress. I predict they  won't even be able to do--they couldn't do repeal and replace. They  were at it for 9 months, stalled everything else out,  [[Page H8121]]  couldn't do repeal and replace. So now they are on comprehensive, what  they call, tax reform, which is only tax breaks for the top 1 percent  when you peel everything back.   They are not going to be able to do that because my friends in the  Freedom Caucus will prevent them from adding $1.5 trillion to the  national debt. I support them in that endeavor. They can count on my  vote for that.   But this is nonsense, ladies and gentlemen. We have to stop  protecting these corporate wrongdoers and put the hands back into the  courts and to the American people.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
