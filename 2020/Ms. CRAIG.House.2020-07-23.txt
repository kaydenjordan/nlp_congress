 Mr. Speaker, we owe our veterans our utmost respect and a  debt that can never be repaid.   Earlier this year, I testified for increased mental health services,  especially in rural communities, and increased access to care on behalf  of the veterans in Minnesota's Second Congressional District.   I am proud that my legislation is included in the bill that we will  pass tomorrow, and it includes the following:   My amendment for a $1.5 million increase in the Veterans Health  Administration medical services' account to expand the Rural Health  Resources Center's program and increase funding for the Office of Rural  Health so that they can continue their research to navigate barriers  and expand access to care.   I ask all of my colleagues to join me in stepping up to support our  veterans.                                time  1530
