 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National Native  American Heritage Month by honoring a dedicated community leader and  warrior from Nebraska's Second Congressional District.   Growing up on the Umonhon Nation Reservation in Macy, Nebraska, Dr.  Rudi Mitchell was one of eight children raised by a single mother.  Rudi's mom, Mary Lieb Mitchell, was a strong woman and a major  influence in the lives of her children. Her focus was education and  ensuring her children had the opportunities that she did not have.   It was because of her that Rudi and his siblings all went out to  pursue  [[Page H8530]]  higher education. Including nieces and nephews, 15 members of his  family have earned degrees ranging from bachelor's to doctorate, to  medical degrees.   In 1964, Rudi felt the call to serve our Nation at a time of war and  enlisted in the United States Army Medical Corps. As he will tell you,  Native Americans consider it an honor to serve as a warrior, and he was  proud to do so in the U.S. Army. He was a part of the Army Medical  Corps and served a total of 3 years and 13 months of which he deployed  to South Korea, providing medical support to troops.   Once his service was complete, Dr. Mitchell used the GI Bill to  attend the University of Nebraska Omaha, and in August of 1973, he  earned his bachelor of general studies with an emphasis on social work.  He then pursued and received his master of social work in August of  1975.   With his degrees in hand and inspired by his mother's dreams, Dr.  Mitchell worked for the Nebraska Indian Intertribal Development  Corporation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs for Winnebago. After that,  he returned to the Umonhon Nation Reservation in Macy, Nebraska, and  was the acting director of the outpatient mental health-social services  department at the Carl T. Curtis Health Education Center. Rudi then  earned his doctorate of education and counseling and psychology from  the University of South Dakota in December of 1987.   Dr. Mitchell continued to serve those residing at the Macy and  Winnebago Reservations, including as interim president of the Nebraska  Indian Community College and, most recently, as the assistant professor  of Native American studies at Creighton University. He is also listed  as a qualified expert witness in Indian child welfare cases in the  courts of the State of Nebraska.   His deep compassion for the youth of the Umonhon Nation inspires him  to continue to make an impact. With the high suicide rate and many  suffering from depression, Dr. Mitchell has made it a mission of his to  interact with the youth as a social worker and mental health therapist.  As an elder of the Umonhon Nation, Dr. Mitchell participates and leads  traditional Umonhon prayer ceremonies in welcome and graduation  ceremonies.   Rudi continues to preserve his native language, which his mother did  not allow to be spoken in his childhood home because she wanted them to  learn English. He also is working to revive the lost culture of his  Nation, including the importance of his Indian name. His is Sihi-duba  of the Buffalo Clan.   As a direct descendant of Chief Big Elk, the last hereditary chief of  the Umonhon Nation, Dr. Mitchell followed his great-great-great-great- grandfather's legacy of leadership, and has served as a Native American  leader on the local, State, and national level. From 1992 to 1995, he  was the Tribal chairman of the Umonhon Nation and the chief elected  governmental representative of his people. He presided over the elected  Tribal Council at all official meetings and represented their interests  with county supervisors, the Nebraska Unicameral, the United States  Congress, State Governors, the President of the United States, and  international leaders.   In addition, Dr. Mitchell serves on the board of directors for the  Big Elk Native American Center, a nonprofit that is working to provide  a multitude of services to more than 8,000 Native Americans from over  130 Tribes that reside in the Omaha area. Currently, the nonprofit  provides language services, teaching the Umonhon language, and  providing expert witnesses.   Dr. Mitchell is a lifetime member of the VFW Post 1581 and the  American Legion Post 1, and although he has officially retired, he  still serves as an elder of the Omaha Tribe. Through his lifetime of  dedicated service, he has helped many youth and members of the Umonhon  Nation overcome depression and learn about their heritage.   We are proud to recognize Dr. Mitchell as a true warrior, patriot,  and selfless servant; one that not only fought for his Nation, but also  for those impacted by mental health issues, and continues to keep his  Native American culture and heritage alive for future generations.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  Armed Services be discharged from further consideration of the bill  (H.R. 3897) to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for the  issuance of the Gold Star Installation Access Card to the surviving  spouse, dependent children, and other next of kin of a member of the  Armed Forces who dies while serving on certain active or reserve duty,  to ensure that a remarried surviving spouse with dependent children of  the deceased member remains eligible for installation benefits to which  the surviving spouse was previously eligible, and for other purposes,  and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Moolenaar). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Nebraska?   There was no objection.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3897         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Gold Star Family Support and       Installation Access Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Since World War I, the gold star symbol has been used       by American families to honor members of the Armed Forces who       have given their lives in service to the Nation.        (2) Surviving families of deceased members of the Armed       Forces confront many challenges, often made worse by policies       that fail to compassionately honor the memory of their loved       one's service and sacrifice to the Nation.        (3) There is an obligation to ensure that the Gold Star       family connections to the military community remain an       eternal bond providing strength and comfort to surviving       family members and to those still serving.        (4) Individual military services have recognized the need       to provide installation access to Gold Star families to       attend memorial events, visit gravesites, and access other       benefits for which family members are eligible and entitled.        (5) Surviving families of deceased members of the Armed       Forces relocate to other parts of the country, often far away       from the service installation where their loved one last       served.        (6) Current Department of Defense policy rescinds on-base       benefits to surviving spouses of deceased service members who       remarry, even when dependent children under the guardianship       of the surviving spouse remain eligible for benefits,       effectively rendering these benefits inaccessible by the       children of the deceased member.       SEC. 3. ISSUANCE OF GOLD STAR INSTALLATION ACCESS CARDS.         (a) Issuance and Conditions on Use.--        (1) In general.--Chapter 57 of title 10, United States       Code, is amended by inserting after section 1126 the       following new section:       ``Sec. 1126a.
