 Mr. Chair, I must first start by thanking Chairwoman  Black for her excellent work on this bill.   There are a lot of things that I can talk about that are very  positive in  [[Page H7780]]  this budget, but today I want to emphasize how it prioritizes our  national security.   With the growing threats around the globe, it is imperative that we  fund defense of our Nation in an appropriate and a substantial way. We  need to invest in our Armed Forces. We have to upgrade our defense  systems and weapons systems, and we have to ensure the readiness of our  military.   The United States must continue to lead on a global scale. This  budget takes us in that direction by investing in our national defense.  Obviously, coupled with targeted soft diplomacy funding, we accomplish  that.    This budget takes us, as I said, in that direction, and it does so in  a very positive way. I believe this budget makes those critical  investments.   Mr. Chairman, I don't have to tell you that under the previous  administration, cuts to our defense spending left the world a more  dangerous place and it left our country in a more vulnerable place.  Thankfully, the current administration recognizes the failure of the  last 8 years and is, again, willing to lead again. Now it is up to us  to do our part to provide the resources to allow the administration and  our military to lead again. This budget gets us there. I am pleased to  support it.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank the chairwoman for her invaluable  leadership. I urge my colleagues to do the same and, again, make sure  that we stand toe to toe with our adversaries and we stand, most  importantly, with the national security interests of the United States.
