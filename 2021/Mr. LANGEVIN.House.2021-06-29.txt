 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong support  of the INVEST Act, which contains nearly $19 million in funding for  three infrastructure projects in Rhode Island's Second District.   This legislation will improve roads in Westerly and Charlestown to  increase accessibility along the Scenic Highway, repair roads in  Cranston to smooth the commute for Rhode Islanders traveling across the  State, and connect a key stretch of the East Coast Greenway in Coventry  to boost tourism, create jobs, and spur economic development.   Madam Speaker, Rhode Island's roads and bridges desperately need  repair. According to the White House, 148 bridges and over 860 miles of  highway are in poor condition in Rhode Island, earning our State the  grade of C-minus on our infrastructure report card.   Investing in our aging infrastructure will create good-paying jobs  and make our roads safer and less congested. That is true of Rhode  Island and every State across the country.   Supporting the INVEST Act and the important projects within it is a  no-brainer.   As my New England Patriots always say: Do your job.   To my colleagues, let's do our job so Americans can get on with  theirs.                            ____________________
