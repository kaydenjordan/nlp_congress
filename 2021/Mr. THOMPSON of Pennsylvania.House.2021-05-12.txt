 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and  I appreciate his leadership on this Special Order of standing with  those who stand for us each and every night.   These are folks, members of our law enforcement, who, because of what  they do, because of their courage, because of their commitment, we can  sleep without concern and fear and we can make our way throughout the  day.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today during this National Police Week to honor  these men and women in blue. Established by a joint resolution of  Congress in 1962, National Police Week plays a special recognition to  those law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of  duty for the safety and the protection of others.   National Police Week is sponsored by the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial Fund and supported by a variety of organizations to  honor the law enforcement community. The mission of the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund is to tell the story of American law  enforcement, honor the fallen, and make it safer for those who serve.   Over the past year, our law enforcement officers have been in the  spotlight. Bad actors must be held accountable, but it is dangerous to  villainize all police officers, and it is even more dangerous to seek  to defund the police.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the National Police Week  resolution, which honors by name the 384 officers who were killed in  the line of duty in 2020.   This resolution underscores the steadfast support and appreciation  for law enforcement. As we honor National Police Week, it is important  to take a moment to remember the sacrifices many officers, as well as  their families, have made.                                time  1830
