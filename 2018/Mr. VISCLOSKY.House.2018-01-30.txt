 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   (Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   (Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I first want to start by associating  myself with the remarks of my chairwoman and suggest to this body that  it is time for Congress to begin to govern and run the day-to-day  operation of the Government of the United States in a timely fashion.   Mr. Speaker, this is the third iteration of the fiscal year 2018  Defense Appropriations Act that has been brought to the floor. I, for  one, have  [[Page H720]]  nothing more to say about the merits of this legislation that would not  be redundant. However, I do want to reiterate my profound respect for  the exceptional work that has been put into this legislation, time and  time again, by Chairwoman Granger, all of the members of our  subcommittee, and our superlative staff.   Today, January 30, 2018, Congress is 122 days late. We are 122 days  past the start of the current fiscal year and 122 days past the time  that the legislation we are considering today for the third time should  have been completed, conferenced, and signed into law.   Mr. Speaker, we have a number problem. As an appropriator, I ask for  a number to craft a bill that, by law, does not violate the Budget  Control Act. We need a number so that Chairwoman Granger, our  subcommittee members, and I can make decisions on how best to move  forward so our military leaders are not hindered and forced to comply  with the constraints of continuing resolutions. As an appropriator, all  I want is a number. Give us a number, and we will finish our work for  this fiscal year and give the certainty that has been repeatedly asked  for by the Department of Defense and our 17 intelligence agencies.   Unfortunately, operating under the fourth continuing resolution and  passing essentially the same Defense Appropriations measure for a third  time does nothing--nothing--to solve the number problem, nor does it  remedy the slight inconvenience that this bill exceeds the Budget  Control Act by $35 billion.   Today's legislation does recognize this inconvenience by obviating  sequestration. I guess that is what passes as budget control in these  days in this Congress.   Some may say that we must pass this bill today to support our men and  women in uniform. I would respond by saying that today's 60 minutes of  theater continues to avoid meaningfully addressing the needs of our  troops. If we were serious about that, we would have solved our number  problem and allowed the chair and ranking member of the full committee,  and the subcommittee chairs and ranking members of all 12 committees,  to negotiate a realistic budget figure last summer so that we could  have completed our bill last September. That would be helping our  troops.   I would also add that if we don't agree to an overall domestic  discretionary number, then we will continue to disinvest in the true  security of this Nation--our people.   We need a domestic number so we can make decisions and give direction  to all Federal agencies so they can plan on how to best invest in our  national economy, jobs, and the health and prosperity of our people.  The International Trade Commission needs direction so they can fully  enforce our trade laws. Customs and Border Protection needs direction.  This government needs timely decisions and certainty.   According to the Department of Defense, 71 percent of people aged 17  to 24 years of age in the United States would fail to qualify for  military enlistment because of physical or mental health issues, low  educational scores, or major criminal convictions. General Joseph  Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has testified that  the strength of the United States military is a direct reflection of  the strength of U.S. society.   I would propose that improving the strength of our country is not  just a robust defense number that I desperately want. We need a robust  domestic number that allows for the critical investments necessary for  the success of our economy, the creation of jobs, and for the people of  this country.   Our number problem is solvable. Give us a negotiated budget number so  we can stop wasting everybody's time and the money of the American  taxpayers. Then we can truly start supporting the strength of our  national security, our troops, and our national economy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Lowey), who is the ranking member on the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is the ranking member on the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee and a member of the  Defense Subcommittee.                                time  1415    Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, here we are again. For 4 months, the  Federal Government has been operating under a series of short-term  continuing resolutions. And as we approach yet another deadline to fund  the government next week, the Republican majority is spending time on  the floor today voting a third time on a Defense Appropriations bill  that they know will not pass in the Senate.   The most basic, fundamental responsibility of Congress is to provide  adequate and timely funding for the entire Federal Government, both our  national defense and our domestic priorities, for a full fiscal year.  The fact that this bill is on the floor for a third time highlights the  absolute failure of the Republican majority to advance a responsible  budget process.   Mr. Speaker, voting on the same bill three times is the very  definition of playing political games. The American people deserve  better than this continuing Republican chaos.   Democrats and Republicans agree. We agree that defense spending is  vitally important, but so is funding education, transportation,  healthcare, and all the other Federal programs that all Americans and  our military--their families, included--depend upon.   If anyone doubts the harmful impacts of the endless stopgap spending  bills, perhaps they should listen to our Secretary of Defense: ``For  too long, we have asked our military to stoically carry a `success at  any cost' attitude as they work tirelessly to accomplish the mission  with now inadequate and misaligned resources, simply because the  Congress could not maintain regular order.''   If Republicans are serious about supporting our military, they should  heed the Secretary's warning and work with Democrats on a bipartisan  budget agreement to fund the entire government for the rest of the  year. I have been ready. Democrats have been ready for months to work  across the aisle to advance this process. It is long past time that  Republicans join us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Energy and  Water Development, and Related Agencies, and also a member of the  Subcommittee on Defense.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an  additional 30 seconds.     Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an  additional 30 seconds.     Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an  additional 30 seconds.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), my friend and a senior member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California  an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California  an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member on the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for his leadership--particularly, his responsible  leadership--as the ranking member of the Defense Appropriations  Subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the political gambit that  the Republican leadership is pulling today.   Virtually identical versions of the Defense Appropriations bill we  are considering have already passed the House twice. The Republican  majority is so bankrupt of ideas that they are now going around in  circles playing political games.   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I strongly support  moving appropriations bills through the committee and to the floor  through regular order. I applaud all of my committee colleagues on both  sides of the aisle for working in good faith on all 12 appropriations  bills.   But the appropriations process has been hijacked by Republican  leadership and the rightwing ideologues who now run the House.  Regardless of the outcome of today's vote, all appropriations bills  will remain stuck in the swamp that is this Republican Congress.   The reason for this holdup is that Republican so-called leaders have  refused to work across the aisle toward an agreement on a budget that  would prevent the gutting of investments in vital national priorities:  from education to infrastructure, from healthcare to housing, from  diplomacy to defense.   We need to provide our military with the resources they need. There  is no question about that. Instead, the Republican majority is using  the brave servicemen and -women who defend our Nation as pawns in a  partisan crusade that would undermine the nation our troops are  defending.   The stated Republican rationale for their intransigence is that they  are concerned about the deficit, yet these are the same Republicans who  voted to explode the deficit by more than $1.5 trillion in order to  give a huge tax cut to big corporations and the top 1 percent.   As each day passes, it becomes more and more clear that the  priorities of the Republican majority are backward and immoral.   Instead of expanding access to affordable healthcare, Republicans  tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act and leave millions uninsured.   Instead of investing in the middle class, Republicans gave a huge tax  giveaway to those who have turned their backs on the middle class.   Instead of building on bipartisan efforts to advance reasonable  reforms to our immigration system, Republicans are trying to tear apart  families and close the door on aspiring Americans.   Instead of responsibly funding national priorities, Republicans are  playing political games to distract from their failure to govern.   Instead of investing in all of our people, Republicans are pitting us  against each other to deflect the blame from where it belongs--with the  party who controls both Houses of Congress and the White House.   This is no way to keep the state of our union safe. This is no way to  keep the state of our union strong.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this political charade.  Let's work together to invest in all of our national priorities and  make the state of our union more perfect.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would simply close at the point where I began and ask  the Members of this institution at large--the United States Congress,  both Houses--to please give the Appropriations Committees numbers for  defense and discretionary spending so that under the leadership of  Chairman Frelinghuysen and Mrs. Lowey, in this case under Chairwoman  Granger, myself, and the other 11 subcommittees, we can finish our  work. It is less than 2 weeks before we will begin fiscal year 2019. I  would ask my colleagues to please give us those numbers so that we can  do our work effectively.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
