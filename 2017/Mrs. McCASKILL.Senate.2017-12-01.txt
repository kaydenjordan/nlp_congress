 Mr. President, would the Senator answer a question  about this provision?   Do you know who the biggest donor was to the Hillsdale College  endowment?    Would that be the DeVos family, by any chance?    Do you know who added this provision in here?    What does it have to do with taking title IV money as  to whether or not your endowment will be taxed? How is that apples and  apples? It sounds like apples and oranges. What in the world do those  two have in relation to each other?    Yes.    So the rationale is, if you choose not to take  Federal money, then your endowment is no longer subject to any tax even  though the endowment money comes from people who get a deduction for  the money they give, correct? The endowment comes from donors. I  thought the reason we were taxing the endowments is because the people  who were giving the money were getting a tax deduction when they put it  there.    Are the people who are giving to the endowment still  allowed to take a tax deduction?    So it doesn't matter, in terms of the people giving  to the endowments, whether they get a tax deduction, just whether the  school takes money from the Federal government?    My point, Senator, is that the people who are giving  to the endowment get the exact same tax benefit as people who give to  any endowment in the country.    It doesn't feel that way to us. It feels as if this  is a very limited provision written for a very special person.
