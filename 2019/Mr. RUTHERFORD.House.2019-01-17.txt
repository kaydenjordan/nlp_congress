 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Ms. Granger,  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am sad to again rise in opposition to this bill. It is  now 27 days into this shutdown and almost 1 million people are out of  work, and we are still bringing bills to the floor that have no chance  at all of passing.   It is well past time for a compromise to be found, but, Mr. Speaker,  that requires a reasonable negotiation.   Many Members in this Chamber, myself included, have expressed  frustration over this political process and the lack of negotiation  taking place here in the people's House when President  [[Page H692]]  Trump has made it completely clear--in fact, he has offered negotiated  positions and compromise, with no response from my good friends across  the aisle.   The leader, I think, made some great points about our adversaries,  our peer adversaries like China and Russia, and why this shutdown is a  bad thing, which is why I ask them to come to the table and negotiate.                                time  1115    Everything he said, almost everything he said, I would agree with.  Those are the reasons we need to come together and reasonably  negotiate. And I think at the basis of all that, we should remember  what this legislative body is all about, which is security for and  service to our hardworking, taxpaying citizens. We are 435 different  voices from different walks of life, and we know the perfect agreement  is rarely possible.    However, making compromises and trading ideas would  do us a whole lot of good right now, but that requires reasonableness.  It is time to come together on behalf of the American people and stop  this political bickering that is befalling this conversation.   Our country is in desperate need of border security, but we aren't  even talking about that now. We are not talking about the humanitarian  crisis.   Mr. Speaker, we can do better. I ask the Speaker to come to the  table, find a compromise, and let's get back to the work of the  American people.
