 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 309, sponsored by my Texas neighbor,  Congressman Pete Olson, and our other colleague on the Energy and  Commerce Committee, David Loebsack of Iowa, the National Clinical Care  Commission Act.   This legislation aims to improve Federal efforts to treat and prevent  metabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases, and diseases resulting from  insulin deficiency or insulin resistance.   The most common metabolic disorder in the U.S. is diabetes, which  affects more than 29 million Americans. Racial and ethnic minority  communities suffer increased rates of this condition. 15.9 percent of  American Indians and Alaskan Natives, 13.2 percent of non-Hispanic  Blacks, and 12.8 percent of Hispanics have diagnosed diabetes, compared  to just 7.6 percent of non-Hispanic Whites.   Diabetes takes a huge toll on human health. It is the seventh leading  cause of death in the United States. Additionally, all too often,  diabetes leads to avoidable complications such as blindness, limb  amputation, and kidney failure.   In addition to the effects on human health, diabetes care makes up a  large percentage of U.S. healthcare expenditures. Currently, $1 of  every $5 of healthcare costs is spent on caring for people with  diabetes. The proportion of Medicare funding is even greater.  Currently, $1 of every $3 of Medicare expenditures is spent caring for  people with diabetes.   That is why it is important to improve Federal efforts that prevent  avoidable cases of diabetes and metabolic disorders and ensure all  Americans have treatment and management of services necessary to  successfully manage this and other of these conditions.   I am glad to see this legislation move forward, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 309.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers.   I reserve the balance of my time in case someone shows up.    Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Carter) to the Energy and Commerce Committee.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 315, the Improving Access to  Maternity Care Act.   This important legislation would require the Health Resources and  Services Administration to better identify areas with increased need  for maternity care services. This would help ensure the placement of  maternity care providers within the National Health Service Corps in  areas with the most need for their services.   Improving access to maternity care providers in our most underserved  communities will help reduce the poor health outcomes that can result  when women don't have access to quality, prenatal maternity services  that they need. Those outcomes can include increased infant mortality,  preterm births, low birth weight infants, and maternal mortality.   To provide just one example of how limited access to quality  maternity care service is affecting American communities is that while  global maternal mortality rates have fallen by more than a third from  2000 to 2015, the maternal mortality rate in the United States has  increased. In 2015, 25 women lost their lives during pregnancy or  childbirth per 100,000 births in the U.S., compared to 23 women who did  so in only 2000.   It is clear that we must do more to reverse the troubling trend and  other poor outcomes that result in limited access to maternity care  providers. Congress must make it a priority to ensure our women have  access to prenatal and maternity care services.   I support H.R. 315. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 302, the Sports Medicine Licensure  Clarity Act. This bill solves a problem unique to sports medicine  professionals who are required to travel to different States with their  teams. Medical licensure is regulated on a State-by-State basis and  does not work across State lines. Thus, often when a sports medicine  provider travels with a team to another State, they are technically  practicing without a license, and their medical liability insurance is  rendered null. This is not something that is not important.   This weekend, the Houston Texans are proud to be in the playoffs.  They are going to New England, and we would like to have our Texas  doctors making sure our players are safe.   This bill would ensure that sports medicine professionals who  contract with a team are covered by their medical liability insurance  while traveling with their team. It also provides that any incidents of  medical malpractice occurring under the care of a traveling team sports  medicine professional must be treated as if it occurred in the  professional's primary State of practice, regardless of where the game  took place. Providers still would not be allowed to practice beyond the  scope of their licenses, and they may only treat athletes on the field.   By working with the Energy and Commerce Committee and stakeholders  last Congress, the sponsors of this bill have created a sensible  solution to this distinct problem. I encourage my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on the bill.   I thank Mr. Guthrie from Kentucky and Mr. Richmond from Louisiana for  their excellent work.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 304, the Protecting Patient Access to  Emergency Medications Act of 2017.   Ensuring that we have access to the right medicine at the right time  is critically important in emergency situations. While controlled  substances have abuse and diversion potential, they also have  lifesaving potential. In fact, they are very often used by emergency  medical services--EMS--providers in situations where every minute  counts.   Currently, these providers must often administer controlled  substances during emergencies using a standing order. However, it is  unclear whether or not this is permissible under current law.   To help clarify the current law, H.R. 304 would amend the Controlled  Substances Act to make clear that EMS personnel can, in fact,  administer controlled substances in emergency situations under a  standing order from an EMS medical director.   This bill helps guarantee that patients will have timely access to  drugs they need during an emergency. It will also streamline the DEA's  emergency medical services registration process by allowing a single  registration for a State EMS agency as opposed to a separate  registration for each EMS agency location.   To help safeguard against diversion, the bill will hold registered  EMS agencies responsible for receiving, storing, and tracking all  controlled substances.   This bill passed the Energy and Commerce Committee and the House  floor last Congress, and it incorporates important feedback from a wide  range of stakeholders. I believe our efforts in this important bill  will ensure that EMS professionals have the flexibility that they need  to respond during emergencies, while preserving the DEA's ability to  enforce controlled substances laws and regulations.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of H.R.  304.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume. I thank Congressman Hudson and Congressman Butterfield,  both great members of our committee on this very bipartisan bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.
