 Mr. President, this amendment is a direct attack on  the Midwest and America's hundreds of thousands of farmers. Capping the  price of biofuel credits at 10 cents per gallon would stifle the RIN  market and destroy the Renewable Fuel Standard Program.   When my good friend the Senator from Texas last proposed this 10 cent  cap in 2017 and 2018, it was opposed by the National Corn Growers  Association, the American Soybean Association, and the American Farm  Bureau, to name just a few. Now, farmers get up pretty darn early in  the morning, but, even tonight, I did not bother to call any of these  associations to get their response on this amendment.   So I will quote the National Farmers Union's previous president, who,  in 2017 and 2018, said that not only is a RIN cap harmful to American  agriculture, it is a sellout of America's farmers and a handout to  refiners.   America's corn and soybean growers have suffered for years under the  Trump administration's anti-biofuel policies.    I urge all my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   (Applause.)                          Vote on Amendment No. 871
