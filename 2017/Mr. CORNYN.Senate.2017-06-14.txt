 Mr. President, let me join my friend, the senior Senator  from Utah and President pro tempore of the Senate, in his remarks about  the U.S. Capitol Police.   All of us who work on Capitol Hill, all of our visitors who come  here--our constituents from around the country--are in their debt  because they literally do keep us safe and secure here on Capitol Hill.  I do think the events this morning give rise to some additional  concerns of what happens off the Hill, when ordinarily there might not  be the sort of security measures in place that are necessary.   I think this is another wake-up call to all of us to be vigilant, to  be aware of our situations, and to exercise concern for our own safety.  Of course, we do need to continue to look at what the needs are of the  Capitol Police, in terms of training and equipment and staffing, to  make sure they can continue to do the outstanding job they have done  here, yet again, this morning.   It is safe to say that without the Capitol Police being present, as a  result of Congressman Scalise's location there at the Congressional  Baseball Game practice, the results of this might have been much more  serious--much more tragic--than they already were.   Of course, we are continuing to keep Congressman Scalise in our  prayers. I was looking at the TV screen on the way out. It looks like  he is out of surgery but is still in critical condition. Of course, we  continue to think about him and his family and offer them our support  and our prayers.   While there is a lot we do not know about this morning's incident, it  is clear that this is a new environment we are living in, and we need  to do everything we can to keep our constituents safe when they visit  us on Capitol Hill as well as to keep safe all of the staff and  everybody involved.   Mr. President, at a time when people do not believe anything  bipartisan happens here in Washington, DC, I know we have seen a  remarkable vote on these Iran-Russia sanctions with the vote of 97 to  2. Virtually every Republican Senator and virtually every Democratic  Senator voted in favor of these sanctions which target two of the most  aggressive regimes in the world.   The first is the Iranian regime, the No. 1 state sponsor of  international terrorism. The second is the Russian regime, which, as we  all know now, was so aggressively involved in trying to sow discord and  chaos in the days leading up to the 2016 election.   It is staggering, really, to see the extent to which Russia has  raised its game when it comes to disrupting core, democratic  undertakings like elections. We know they are doing that in the United  States, and we know they have attempted to do that in France. This is  the way they operate. This is part of their tradecraft. Through a  combination of cyber espionage, propaganda, the use of social media,  and then unfortunately sometimes too gullible a mainstream media, we  know false stories have somehow been elevated to a level at which  people actually begin to believe them and cause them to distrust their  own government. This is a real threat to the United States and to our  democratic institutions.   The talk of the Russian collusion that led up to the election is  fading because, as so many people have said, including distinguished  Democratic leaders like Senator Feinstein, who served with distinction  as chair of the Intelligence Committee and who serves on the Judiciary  Committee and Intelligence Committee now, there is no evidence of there  having been collusion in the election. What we need to turn to now is  how we can countermeasure what Russia tried to do when it came to the  so-called active measures, which was a combination of cyber espionage,  the use of social media, and propaganda right here in our homeland.   We are a country that believes in freedom of speech and the First  Amendment, and sometimes that makes us more vulnerable than perhaps  others who have state-owned media because we let anybody who has a  point of view express it freely. That is part of our DNA. It also means  that aggressive, hostile regimes like Russia can take advantage of our  open society and our freedoms to try to sow discord and distrust in our  own country.   I hope, now that the allegations about collusion are fading, we will  take a serious look at how to respond appropriately with  countermeasures to this sort of aggressive action on the part of  Russia. I am really pleased that with a vote of 97 to 2, we have voted  to impose sanctions on the rogue nation of Iran and the rogue nation of  Russia.                           PROTECT Our Children Act    Mr. President, in turning to another topic, earlier this year, with  the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Nevada--Senator  Blumenthal and Senator Heller--I introduced a bill that was called the  PROTECT Our Children Act. I am proud to see it is moving through the  Senate this week.   This is an important piece of legislation that most people will not  hear or read much about because it is not particularly controversial,  but that does not mean it is not important, which is why I want to talk  about it briefly. This bill helps to stop the exploitation of children  across the country and over the internet by reauthorizing the Internet  Crimes Against Children Task Force Program.   Years ago, when I was attorney general of Texas--from 1999 until the  time I came to the Senate--we created in the Texas attorney general's  office  [[Page S3476]]  something we called, quaintly, the Texas Internet Bureau, which was  cutting edge for the time. Now it is more of a cyber crimes unit that  deals with, frankly, a lot of the same subject matter--child  exploitation, child pornography, and other crimes--which are committed  using the medium of the internet. I had a chance to see, sadly, how  vulnerable children can quickly become victimized at the hands of some  truly despicable individuals as well as the resources it takes to stop  and to prosecute these predators.   One of the things we did at the Texas Internet Bureau back in the  1999 to 2000 timeframe was to link up, of course, with local law  enforcement officials, but what we learned is that every municipal  police department or county sheriff's department has the kind of  expertise and has the sort of equipment they need in order to combat  this new type of crime.   Through a national network of 61 coordinated task forces that  represent 3,500 Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies, we  have now been able to comprehensively investigate and prosecute child  predators. These task forces develop victim support programs, and they  provide training and technical assistance and advanced forensic  methods, which are very important when trying to track the online  fingerprints or footsteps of these predators who operate online.    Through this legislation, these task forces will also help continue  to facilitate community education, for example, by helping to inform  parents and legal guardians what they can do to help protect their own  children or the people for whom they are responsible.   Tragically, in this day and age, the internet's vast scope provides a  dark, deep harbor for predators. Without the proper training and  equipment, it can be difficult for our law enforcement officials to  track down these child predators. This legislation ensures that they  will have the resources they need to fight cyber crime and keep our  communities safe by reauthorizing these important programs until the  year 2022.   Last week's passage through the Judiciary Committee was the first key  step. I am thankful for the work of my colleague from Connecticut,  Senator Blumenthal, and one of our principal cosponsors, Senator Heller  from Nevada. I am hopeful we can keep moving forward with this  legislation so we can get these essential programs reauthorized by  passing this in the Senate and then moving it on through the House and  swiftly to the President's desk for signature and enactment.
