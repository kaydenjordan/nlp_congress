 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me first thank Chairman Smith, not only for  articulating the exact reasons as to why we must support the Paperwork  Burden Reduction Act, but for sharing this opportunity to co-lead on  such a commonsense measure that will benefit taxpayers, not just in my  Congressional District, the 19th District in California, but so many  people all across this country.   The bipartisan Paperwork Burden Reduction Act will ease confusion for  taxpayers by reducing the paperwork that is necessary for filing taxes  for small business employers and their employees.   Under current law, employers must send a 1095 tax form to employees  to verify their health coverage for the previous year. However, for  many employees, the IRS no longer requires this form for them to  complete their taxes. So the Paperwork Burden Reduction Act would allow  employers to provide a 1095-B or a 1095-C form upon request from  employees, rather than mandating it and wasting time, wasting money,  and wasting paper.   It is a bill that is popular, not just among taxpayers, but Democrats  and  [[Page H3051]]  Republicans alike, as demonstrated by its passage out of the Ways and  Means Committee without a single vote in opposition.   It is understandable why it is so popular because the one thing that  we can all agree on is that we need to reduce unnecessary burdens on  taxpayers and small businesses.   Now, although the Biden administration has already ordered this, I am  proud to join Chairman Smith and put that order into statute, and I  would urge my colleagues to vote for the Paperwork Burden Reduction  Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1915     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is not every day that we can come together on such a  straightforward issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this  commonsense, bipartisan legislation, the Paperwork Burden Reduction  Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
