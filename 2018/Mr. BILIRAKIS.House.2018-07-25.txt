 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of both the Hellenic Caucus  and the Congressional Hellenic-Israel Alliance, I rise tonight with my  colleagues to provide an update on one of the United States' most  strategic allies, the Republic of Cyprus.  [[Page H7682]]    Sadly, Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 44th anniversary of the  illegal invasion and occupation of 40,000 Turkish troops in Cyprus.  Turkey, a NATO ally, must cease its inflammatory rhetoric, normalize  relations with the Republic of Cyprus, and commit to peacefully working  toward a negotiated solution. Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Mr. Speaker,  deserve an end to the senseless division and occupation.   Despite the challenge of continued occupation, Cyprus has long been a  strong and faithful ally of the United States. Due to Cyprus' unique  geopolitical role in the eastern Mediterranean, it is in the best  interests of our country, the United States of America, to support  peace and the end of this illegal occupation. Cyprus' special  geopolitical position stems from its location at the southeasternmost  corner of the EU.   The eastern Mediterranean is turbulent, Mr. Speaker, but holds a  promise of significant opportunity. Cyprus' status as an EU member  state, as well as its excellent longstanding relations with its  neighbors, enhances its strategic importance to the United States.   Cyprus has taken steps in recent years to facilitate international  partnerships and demonstrated an impressive ability to serve as a  catalyst in the development of mutually beneficial goals among  countries in the region and around the globe.   Of equal importance, Cyprus also enjoys a longstanding record of  serving as an unwavering U.S. ally by promoting regional stability,  energy security, and counterterrorism efforts. Regional stability is a  necessary precursor to attainment of its full economic, social, and  strategic potential.   Moderate countries in the eastern Mediterranean have an obligation to  strengthen their ties because, the stronger the bonds, the greater the  opportunity for building a more prosperous, peaceful future.   As discussed by Cyprus' Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulides,  Cyprus recognizes the importance of regional stability. Along with  Greece, it has spearheaded efforts to create trilateral cooperation  mechanisms with moderate countries of the region, including Israel,  Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon.   This initiative has been one of the most successful developments of  the past decade and has laid the foundation for regional cooperation on  a variety of priority goals that are crucial to the international  community. These trilateral discussions are now commonplace, and the  meetings are taking place at regular intervals, creating and  facilitating the development of mutually beneficial partnerships around  a broad range of areas, including economic cooperation, culture, and  education.   Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and Prime Minister Tsipras joined  President Anastasiades in Nicosia in May for a trilateral meeting.  Currently, preparations are under way for a trilateral meeting between  Cyprus, Greece, and Egypt in Crete, and in December with Israel.   Minister Christodoulides has explained that the central tenets of the  trilateral cooperation are neither exclusionary nor exclusive;  additionally, they are not directed against any country but, instead,  are utilized as an opportunity for promoting enhanced cooperation.   As with everything in life, there is no one-size-fits-all approach,  as you know, Mr. Speaker, but each trilateral meeting has been crafted  to meet the needs of participating countries when it makes sense to do  so.   Additionally, Cyprus has taken the lead to include countries from  outside the regions to further economic, social, and international  goals. For example, Cyprus, Greece, and Israel have expanded their  talks to include Italy and the European Commission in negotiations on  energy-related issues. The benefits from these regional developments  positively impact participating countries as well as the United States  of America and the international community as a whole.   Cyprus holds the potential to play an important role in international  energy security, Mr. Speaker, which is obviously a natural interest to  the United States of America. The discovery of hydrocarbons in the  eastern Mediterranean has motivated countries within the region to work  together in order to maximize the benefit of these natural resources.   The U.S. Geological Survey assessments indicate the eastern  Mediterranean region holds large quantities of natural gas and oil. It  is in the United States' best interest, in my opinion, Mr. Speaker, to  ensure that these resources held by an allied nation contribute to the  availability of affordable energy. This development can help ensure the  long-term financial sustainability of the region.   Minister Christodoulides, again, also heralds the work of Egypt,  Israel, and Lebanon, in partnership with Cyprus, again, to formulate  their own exclusive economic zones, or EEZ, which has created greater  transparency based on international law, outlined new economic border  structures, and established a proven framework for cooperation around a  common goal.   This framework also created the necessary legal and institutional  structures to attract investment in Cyprus by major oil and gas  companies. ExxonMobil, Eni, Total, Noble Energy, and Shell have entered  into agreements with Cyprus for exploratory drilling and development  work. Energy expansion in Cyprus holds even greater future potential,  and it will compete directly with Russian energy in the region.    Cyprus is also close to concluding agreements for the export of  natural gas from its Aphrodite reservoir in its EEZ to Egypt and the  plants there in Egypt. It is also concluding an intergovernmental  agreement with Egypt that will create a direct, underwater pipeline to  carry Aphrodite's natural gas to Egypt.   Similarly, the East Med pipeline project will allow for the transfer  of natural gas, by an underwater pipeline, from Israel and Cyprus to  Greece via Crete and from Greece to Italy.   Energy potential and its accompanying economic benefit has become a  tool of cooperation and alignment of initiatives that would create an  economy of scale and invite investment while meeting the energy  security needs of the region.   Cyprus has also proven itself as an important partner in the global  war against terrorism. Since their inception, the trilateral meetings  led by Cyprus have always included counterterrorism cooperation as a  priority. Minister Christodoulides, again, correctly asserted earlier  this year that it is not enough to secure one's country and borders;  close cooperation with reliable and like-minded partners is also  necessary.   Cyprus has entered into a close dialogue with its regional neighbors  to create a unified approach to battling terrorist ideology,  understanding that there are no firm barriers to the spread of radical  indoctrination, especially given the advent of social media, Mr.  Speaker.   Cyprus is participating in a number of international efforts,  including the Coalition Against the Islamic State and the Aqaba  Process. Minister Christodoulides further noted that Cyprus has  actively, and in cooperation with some of its European allies, provided  military assistance and nonmilitary support to international efforts in  the African region of the Sahel.                                time  2015    Cyprus has cooperated with the U.S. in providing specialized training  assistance to officials from neighboring countries and collaborated  closely with Egypt. The training revolves mostly on civilian type of  expertise, in customs and border controls.   Additionally, Cyprus has provided training on the identification and  containment of various chemicals, as well as better storage and  handling of dangerous substances. Cyprus has also explored  collaborative efforts to counter violent extremism and radicalization  in an attempt to attack the problem at its root.   In recent years, Cyprus has invested a great deal of energy and  resources in education and the exposure of its communities to the  historical roots of anti-Semitism and racism. This is an invaluable  investment, not only because it is the right thing to do, Mr. Speaker,  but because it is the best proven way to prevent radicalization and  violence.   Cyprus is committed to remain at the forefront of these efforts.  After suffering a profound financial crisis not long ago, the previous  decade, Cyprus has undertaken significant reforms  [[Page H7683]]  under the great, capable leadership of President Anastasiades that have  stabilized and strengthened the country's economy and its banking  sector.   The result of these reforms, coupled with other government policies  and the ingenuity of the very special Cypriot people, is that the  Cypriot economy is experiencing strong growth and is one of the fastest  growing economies in Europe.   The future is bright for Cyprus. They are really a great model to go  by. Again, the future is bright for Cyprus and its banking sector.   This is the fourth year in a row, Mr. Speaker, that they have had  positive GDP growth. The EU predicts that real GDP growth is expected  to reach 3.6 percent in 2018 and 3.3 percent in 2019. Unemployment  continues to shrink with the rate being cut in half to 8 percent since  the financial crisis, and it was a crisis, there is no question. I  talked to many people who live on the island and many relatives here in  the United States of those folks, and they went through a lot, but they  recovered.   Cyprus can survive, Mr. Speaker. It is surviving without dependence  on Russian money. Russian deposits have dropped nearly 50 percent and  make up just 5 percent of the three largest banks' portfolios.   Cyprus has been actively promoting policies to counter money  laundering and terrorist financing activities. The powers and tools of  the regulators, principally the Central Bank of Cyprus, the office of  the attorney general, and financial intelligence units have been  greatly upgraded.   As a result, the Cyprus banking sector has significantly improved  ultimate beneficial ownership transparency, greatly reduced its  dependency on foreign deposits and transactions, and terminated  accounts that do not meet its rigorous new standards.   Ending the illegal occupation of Cyprus, Mr. Speaker, would safeguard  the country's independence while amplifying its bridge-building  capacity. What a capacity it has. They have done so much. So just  think, if there was reunification, Mr. Speaker.   Again, further stabilizing and bringing peace to the region, it is in  our national interests, Mr. Speaker. All of which, again, makes Cyprus  an even stronger ally of the United States.   After stalling earlier this year, reunification efforts are once  again underway. Former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Jane  Holl Lute has recently been appointed the U.N.'s new special adviser in  the Cyprus reunification talks.   Ms. Lute plans to tour Nicosia, Athens, and Ankara this month and  provide an assessment to the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres on  whether there is potential for the assumption of negotiations on the  issue of reunification.   The Republic of Cyprus has been a steadfast ally, and Cypriots of all  backgrounds desire an end to the senseless division of their homeland.  Today, the United States, despite Erdogan's provocative language and  actions, still enjoys a unique role as a partner for both Cyprus and  Turkey. As an honest broker to both sides, we can help them see that a  unified future for Cyprus is far more promising than the present  division.   Our relationship with our allies must be based on shared values and  mutual respect. At the core, the rule of law must be respected above  all else.   I encourage the Greek and Cypriot leaders to keep up the hard work of  unifying a people divided for more than a generation. Tough and  important issues remain, but, hopefully, this illegal occupation will  come to an end.   A reunified island nation would serve as a spark for further  cooperation and economic stability. In short, it would unleash the  region's incredible potential.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn  B. Maloney), co-chair of the Hellenic Caucus. She is a founder, along  with my father, Michael Bilirakis, of the Hellenic Caucus and also a  member of the Congressional Hellenic-Israel Alliance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline), a great advocate for Cyprus. We have  cosponsored legislation together.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island  for those remarks. He is a great advocate for Cyprus.   Cyprus is a great partner, a great strategic ally, and will continue  to be. We wanted to highlight that this evening, and I think we have.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 34 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, July 26, 2018, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
