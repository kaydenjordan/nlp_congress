 Mr. President, I ask for consent to speak for up to  20 minutes prior to the scheduled rollcall vote.    Mr. President, every year, I meet with local leaders  and citizens in all 95 Tennessee counties, and with each visit, I am  more and more encouraged by the changes I see. Low taxes, pro-business  policies, and less invasive government have encouraged growth that my  Democratic colleagues are not seeing back in their States. But still  many areas of Tennessee are hurting, and those that  [[Page S766]]  aren't are feeling the negative effects of inflation and broken supply  chains.   What has happened over the past few years is proof that these  Tennessee families and businesses are much better at spending their own  money than the Federal Government is at spending taxpayer money. They  have to be because if they were as reckless with their paychecks as the  Biden administration is with taxpayer funds, they would have gone  bankrupt a long time ago.   When they saw what the President put together in his latest budget  request, they were not surprised, but they were incredibly discouraged  at the idea of another year of Federal spending that leaves our  southern border vulnerable and guarantees another year of unsustainable  inflation.   Joe Biden and the Democrats have made it their mission to tax and  spend this country into oblivion, but adding insult to injury is their  commitment to ignoring the actual problems the American people are  facing on a local level: inflation, drugs, crime, and continued supply  chain problems.   During my recent visit with officials in Cannon County, they had a  lot to say about how this failure to govern has affected their ability  to follow through on even the most basic public works projects.   Like many distressed counties around the country, Cannon County  received emergency funding during the pandemic. They put it toward  short-term projects that, for this community, were really a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity to grow.   But here is the problem: Over the past 2 years, my Democratic  colleagues have spent so much money and driven inflation so high that  any progress Cannon County leaders could have made with those projects  has been completely washed out by the overall effects of inflation.   For Joe Biden and the Democrats, this is something that is easily  brushed aside, but for the people of Cannon County, it means that  something as essential as a water project is stalled indefinitely.   The topography of Cannon County makes it pretty hard to bring water  in, but with this particular project, they would have been able to  install a water line from neighboring Warren County and alleviate the  pressure on their water supply. It wasn't a perfect solution, but it  would have provided relief.   But, now, inflation and supply chain breakdowns have turned this  project into a nightmare. Local leaders are questioning the  construction estimates because they change or expire before their  contractors can get their hands on the right materials. This means that  by the time those materials come in, the county may not be able to pay  for the work, and on and on it goes. There is no light at the end of  the tunnel.   The White House can spin this all they want, but this is not how  business normally works. Joe Biden and the Democrats have embraced  dysfunction at every turn and Tennesseans--they are the ones who are  suffering.   Our wide-open southern border has come up in every single county  meeting I have taken since Joe Biden took his oath of office, and, over  the past few years, we have watched the situation become increasingly  dire.   Every town is a border town, and every State is a border State,  including Tennessee.   When I was in McMinnville, earlier this year, local leaders described  to me in great detail how the Biden administration's refusal to secure  the border has pushed local police to the breaking point. For a town  that small, the people of McMinnville should not be suffering from so  much crime. But the flow of drugs is out of control, and the law  enforcement officials I spoke with can trace it from their  neighborhoods to the closest cartel distribution hub in Atlanta and  then down to the southern border.   They find fentanyl in just about every drug that they seize--deadly  fentanyl. Overdoses caused by marijuana laced with fentanyl are common  now, something that just a few years ago would have been rare if not  unthinkable.   The rampant availability of drugs has caused a crisis among teens and  young people, who are now using at such a rate that law enforcement has  nowhere to house juvenile offenders. Fentanyl, the leading killer of  Americans age 18 to 45. Fentanyl, the fastest growing killer of  children under 18 fentanyl. Fentanyl that is flooding across our  southern border--14,000 pounds apprehended last year by Border Patrol.  That is enough to kill 3.3 billion people--3.3 billion people.   This is why every town is a border State. It is why every single  local law enforcement official is saying: We need help. Secure that  southern border.   When I have talked to them about what they need to get a grip on the  fentanyl issue, they have told me the same thing that local officials  are telling other Members of this body: Secure the border and make the  resources available so that we can get a grip on this. They need to  hire more law enforcement officers. They need to give them better pay  and training, and they need to expand antidrug programming for younger  children. As sad as that is, they are the ones who are being introduced  to and affected by these drugs.   You could visit any county in the United States and probably hear  very similar stories from local officials who have worked hard, kept  their own spending in check, and who have done their best to plan for  the future of their communities. They love their communities. They are  worried about crime. They are worried about drugs. They want more  choice and options for education. They want security in their local  streets.   Officials in the White House and here on Capitol Hill know what their  policies have done to these local leaders and to the American people.  They also know that the President's budget request doesn't reflect what  they need or even what they want.   They are asking for relief. They are not asking for new programs.  They are not asking for pie in the sky. They are not wanting to see  more bailouts. They don't need more mandates.   What they need is relief--relief that will address inflation, relief  that will address supply chains, relief that will address the drugs and  the crime that is flowing across that southern border.   These are issues they look at as root causes of rampant, out-of- control crime and out-of-control spending that has stalled growth in  many communities.   They won't be able to do that until Joe Biden and the Democrats  realign their priorities with those of the American people.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, it is an honor to join my  friends in Bradley County, TN, as they gather for the centennial  celebration of their beloved library.   The Cleveland Bradley County Public Library is more than just a  repository for books and historic documents. When a dedicated group of  local leaders first opened its doors in 1923, they did so knowing that  there were no taxpayer funds available to support their vision of the  library as a hub for local life. Not to be deterred, the community came  together. Organizations like the Kiwanis Club held fundraisers to  ``keep the lights on,'' and the Women's Club held annual ``book  showers'' to keep the shelves full.   That dedication to the pursuit of knowledge and community continues  to this day. I want to thank Bradley County Mayor Gary Davis, city of  Cleveland Mayor Kevin Brooks, and the library's many employees and  patrons for supporting this unique and essential institution. I believe  I speak for all Tennesseans when I say that I cannot wait to see what  the next 100 years holds for you.                            ____________________
