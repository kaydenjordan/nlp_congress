 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 5894, and that I may include  tabular material on the same.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support this morning of H.R. 5894, the FY 2024  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and related agencies  bill.   This is my first year as chair of this very important subcommittee,  and I am proud to be able to support programs that touch the lives of  literally every American in one form or fashion.   Our Nation remains mired in high inflation, which was only worsened  by the massive infusion of government spending, both during and  immediately after the COVID pandemic. I have said on numerous occasions  that inflation is a tax on every single American. Moreover, it is a tax  borne disproportionately by low-income Americans.   We cannot continue to make our constituents pay for our reckless D.C.  beltway spending. At some point, we must stop the out-of-control  spending spree that we have seen over the past 2 years. This bill that  is before the House this morning represents a clear first step toward  returning to fiscal responsibility while at the same time ensuring that  funding for critical and high-priority functions are maintained.   Yes, the bill before us today reflects the challenges in achieving  deficit reduction solely through reductions in discretionary spending.  To be honest, a $60 billion cut to social spending programs in this  bill requires scrutiny and priority setting.   Over 50 programs are proposed for reduction and another 60 programs  are eliminated. Most of those that are eliminated are unauthorized or  they have expired authorizations. Title I grants to States are cut by  almost 80 percent, or more than $14 billion.   While title I grants do support school districts everywhere,  including rural districts and the districts back in Alabama that I  represent, these funds disproportionately support big city public  schools, those same public schools that failed to educate the most  vulnerable children that were entrusted to them by closing their doors  for almost 2 years during the pandemic.   It is estimated that over $20 billion in unspent funding still  remains available from those funds that were provided during the  pandemic to these schools. Until this funding--over $21 billion--is  drawn down and used responsibly, the Federal Government should not  continue to make further investments in these failing schools.   At the same time, the priorities of this bill are biodefense,  programs that support rural America, targeted education programs,  including those for children with special needs and congressional  oversight responsibilities.   The bill also maintains support for Pell grants and language to  ensure borrowers can quickly resume payments of their student loans  following the recent Supreme Court decision.   Other programs for certain vulnerable populations, such as Americans  with disabilities, older Americans, and foster children, are maintained  at current levels.   Childcare block grants, which provide vouchers for families to choose  childcare settings of their choice, are maintained at $8 billion.   In response to this administration's executive branch overreach, this  bill prohibits funding for programs focused solely on diversity,  equity, and inclusion. It eliminates funding for Planned Parenthood and  other controversial grantees. It also protects religious freedom and  values by stopping the administration's regulations that would require  schools to allow biological boys to compete against girls in women's  sports programs and prohibiting any Federal funding from going toward  enforcing gender identity politics or social, hormonal, or surgical  interventions to look like the opposite sex.   The bill prohibits funding for controversial ideologies like critical  race theory. These radical views do not belong in public schools.  Schools should be teaching our children how to think, not what to  think.   The bill maintains the longstanding Hyde amendment to ensure that  taxpayer funds are not used for abortion on demand and that no one is  forced to participate in an abortion or refer for one under any Federal  program.   The bill also makes sure that taxpayer funds are not used to  circumvent State laws restricting abortion and also ensures that  Federal research funds are not used on human fetal tissue obtained from  an elective abortion.   Furthermore, the bill before us also includes provisions preventing  this administration from moving forward with job-killing regulations  that relate to independent contractors, joint employer status, and  federally forced wage rates for agricultural workers. The  administration's regulatory agenda is stifling small businesses, which  should be an incubator for innovation.  [[Page H5741]]    To protect against man-made pandemics, the bill prohibits any funding  from going to EcoHealth Alliance, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or  any lab located in Russia or China. The bill also prohibits funding  from being used for any gain-of-function research, which was being used  on bat coronavirus prior to the COVID pandemic, and it prohibits  enforcement of the CMS COVID vaccine mandate on healthcare workers.   In closing, Mr. Chairman, in addition to thanking everybody that has  had a part in this, I want to say a special thanks to the chair of our  committee, Chairwoman Granger, and also my fellow subcommittee members  and their staff. I certainly also thank the Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education Subcommittee staff on both the Democrat and the  Republican side, as we have had to work through this bill over the last  several months. I just appreciate everyone's hard work and input as we  have moved forward on this.   Mr. Chairman, I look forward to the debate today, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Carl).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  rise in support of these remarks from my friend and colleague from  Alabama (Mr. Carl).   Hospitals in Alabama and, really, across the Nation are facing  financial pressure because of healthcare disparities created by a  specific Medicare regulation called the Medicare area wage index, as  Mr. Carl just mentioned.   The wage index system is broken. It is punishing cost-effective  hospitals in so many rural areas. Despite increases in labor costs, the  wage index in these States consistently decreases over the years, and  the decline is projected to continue.   I thank the gentleman from Alabama for raising this issue here today.  Although this is primarily under the jurisdiction of the authorizing  committees, I am proud that this bill includes provisions drawing  attention to this very important issue.   I hope that, moving forward, Congress can work to address this long- broken system, which is continuing to create serious challenges for our  rural hospitals and their communities.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Steube).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Ciscomani), a member of our Appropriations  Committee that has been very helpful on this bill that is before us  today.    Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Ciscomani for his comments. As  we move forward with this bill, I look forward to working with him, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Harris), the chair of Subcommittee on Agricultural and also a  member of our Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services.
