 Madam Chair, I thank my colleague and  ranking member, Mr. Fortenberry, for yielding, and I thank Chairman  Bishop for including my amendment in the en bloc amendments.   Agriculture research plays a critical role in the future of our food  supply. In our last spending bill, we helped secure  [[Page H4942]]  a 5 percent increase in funding for the USDA's National Institute of  Food and Agriculture. That program had seen increased funding because  of bipartisan support on the House Agriculture Committee from many of  the members, including my good friend and fellow cochair of the Ag  Research Caucus,   Jimmy Panetta of California, who fondly likes to  remind us all that he represents the Salad Bowl of America.   This year, I led a bipartisan letter signed by 111 of my colleagues  advocating for robust funding for USDA NIFA's Agriculture and Food  Research Initiative in the 2020 appropriations and I am extremely  excited that the House appropriators increased funding by $45 million  over fiscal year 2019 levels to $460 million for NIFA and AFRI.   I am proud to see such bipartisan support for ag research, because  ensuring research is necessary and vital.
