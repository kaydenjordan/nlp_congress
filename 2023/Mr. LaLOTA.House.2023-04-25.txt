 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to a critical  veterans program that has been helping veterans in my district for  years. The PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Peer Support Program is a program that  helps veterans deal with the invisible scars of war, including PTSD.   This program was named after Iraq war veteran Army Private First  Class Joseph Dwyer, a native of Mount Sinai, New York. After years of  struggling with PTSD and addiction, PFC Dwyer passed away. He tried to  seek help, but it was never enough.   As a Navy veteran myself, I understand the difficulties many of our  servicemembers face when they return home.   I recently introduced the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Peer Support Program  Act to help nationalize an important program that has been incredibly  successful in my district. This program has a proven track record of  success in helping veterans deal with their mental health issues in a  safe and welcoming environment among their fellow veterans.   My bipartisan bill would provide grants for State and local entities  across the country to make the program easily accessible to all  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense  bill to help our veteran community.                      Calling for the Release of Kai Li     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on the Chinese  Communist Party to release Kai Li of Huntington Station, who has been  unjustly held as a prisoner by the CCP since 2016.   Mr. Li immigrated to the United States from China decades ago and  soon after became a United States citizen.   For years, Mr. Li visited China to see relatives and conduct  business, never having an issue. Yet, in 2016, while Mr. Li was  visiting Shanghai for the anniversary of his mother's passing, he was  apprehended by Chinese police at the Shanghai airport. Mr. Li's secret  trial ended in just an hour, and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison  for espionage.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Li is being detained unjustly and for purely  political reasons.   On March 17, I sent a letter to Secretary Blinken urging him to do  everything possible to bring Mr. Li home. I again urge President Biden,  Secretary Blinken, and Ambassador Burns to bring Kai Li home. He and  his family have suffered long enough. Let's bring him home.                  The Threat of the Chinese Communist Party     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the growing threat  coming from the Chinese Communist Party.   For too long, the Chinese Communist Party has been allowed to grow  and spread its influence throughout the world. They have encroached on  Taiwan's territorial sovereignty. They have developed in and around the  Paracel and Spratly Islands, continuing to falsely claim their control  over the South China Sea. They have supercharged the Belt and Road  Initiative to spread their influence. They continue to lie to the world  about COVID-19. The list goes on, Mr. Speaker.   Every day, we read stories of the CCP's attempt to become the  dominant power in the Indo-Pacific and around the world.   Mr. Speaker, we must act in a bipartisan manner to address the  threats from the Chinese Communist Party before it is too late.                            ____________________
