 Madam Speaker, last week, one of our  colleagues from across the aisle made very ignorant comments and  questioned Representative Judy Chu's loyalty and service to this  country.   These claims were baseless, discriminatory, and flat-out wrong. As  one of his own Republican colleagues said, these types of troubling  comments are out of bounds and, yes, beyond the pale.   Questioning Congresswoman Judy Chu's loyalty to the United States  purely based on her Chinese heritage is not only racist and xenophobic,  it is very dangerous, and it is not new.   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was subject to baseless accusations of  being a communist by J. Edgar Hoover. These same harmful bouts of  hateful misinformation have been cast on myself, Congresswoman Ilhan  Omar, and other women of color in Congress. It is despicable.   Madam Speaker, hate speech leads to hate violence. We must clearly  and strongly denounce this kind of rhetoric, especially during a time  when our AAPI community continues to be a target of hateful aggression  against the country.   Congresswoman Chu has been a steadfast warrior for constituents in  her district, the AAPI community, and for all marginalized communities  she has worked for across our country. She is a great patriot.   To question her service and loyalty to the United States is shameful  and unacceptable.                            ____________________
