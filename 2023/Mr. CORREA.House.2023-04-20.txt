 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate students from  my district, Orange County, California, for winning C-SPAN's 2023  StudentCam documentary film competition. Congratulations.   This competition invites high school and middle school students to  make documentaries on issues of national importance.   This year, they were asked to answer the question: ``If you were just  elected to Congress, what would be your priorities?''   Amber Khaub, Darwin Lopez, Evan Spence, and Christian Kim made  exceptional films engaging with issues of artificial intelligence,  agriculture, and the environment. Their films were among the best and  few of those that actually won an award out of nearly 3,000 entries.   It is inspiring to see them grow and be so successful.   Congratulations to all of them. We are very proud.                            ____________________
