 Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a little bit today about  accountability. Accountability is something we teach our children. Let  me burden you with a short story.   About 20 years ago, I am sitting in my kitchen. I think it was a  Saturday morning. My son, Mattie, who is 4 years old, was in the middle  of the kitchen floor and dropped a plate. It landed at his feet. He was  wearing shoes. He looked up at me, I looked at him, and he said to me,  Dad, I didn't do it.   Well, it is a funny story and it is cute, but the point is that you  teach your children about accountability. You teach them to accept  responsibility, to make things right that they have done wrong, and to  move on with their lives.   My wife, Marion, and I have two boys, and we like to say we have done  a marvelous job teaching them about accountability and taking proper  responsibility.   But there is a poison in this country. There is a pestilence that has  been occurring for at least a couple of generations. I want to say it  started with the Watergate era back in the seventies, when people  didn't want to take accountability and they didn't want to take  responsibility. You heard phrases come up like ``plausible  deniability.''   And then we went on into the corporate world and we had the Enron  scandal. Rather than taking accountability and responsibility, standing  up and admitting what they did and making it right, no, what did they  do? They were shredding the documents as fast as they could shred them.   It is routine in this country now for people in positions of power  and responsibility to say, ``mistakes were made,'' not ``I messed up.''  ``Mistakes were made.'' It is a pestilence in this country to deny  accountability and responsibility. It is unacceptable.   The question is: What do we do to bring back accountability to the  American culture? Well, the FAIR Act makes a big step in that  direction. It invalidates forced arbitration clauses: the ones that  show up in the boiler plate of the contracts that consumers sign with  every agreement we have with a big corporation. It shows up in the fine  print. And if you take the time to read it, it is not debatable, it is  not negotiable. You have to sign it or else you have to not get the  contract, not get the account.                                time  1245    Mr. Speaker, if you look at those contracts, it makes you waive your  constitutional right, as Congresswoman Torres just said.   We have a constitutional right to go to court to settle our disputes.  Our Founding Fathers and people in the American Revolution fought and  died for that constitutional right.   Mr. Speaker, with the stroke of a pen, you are allowed to give this  away, even though it is in the fine print. Instead, you have to go to a  rigged and secret arbitration process that the corporations control and  usually win. It also means you can't band together with other  claimants.   Think of what that means, Mr. Speaker. It means if you have an  account with a big corporation and they decided to charge an extra $500  for the year, even though that is in violation of the contract, and it  may be in violation of State law, who is going to bring a case for  $500? A lawyer won't take that case. These clauses prohibit banding  together in class actions and doing the cases together.   What does the upshot of that mean? It means that these corporations  that do it act with impunity. They are immunized from accountability.  They can do anything that they want without having to account for it in  court.   This is a license to steal. It is wrong, and it goes against the  American ideal of responsibility and accountability, what we try to  teach our children. This is not something that really applies to small  businesses. It applies to big corporations.   Eighty-one out of the Fortune 100 corporations use these forced  arbitration clauses, and almost nobody goes to arbitration under them.  Take Amazon Prime, for example. They have 101 million subscribers to  Amazon Prime. In the last 5 years, there have been only 15  arbitrations. That is because it just doesn't make sense. The economics  don't work. If you can't band together and do it as a class action,  then it doesn't work.   Class actions keep American corporations accountable and responsible.  That is why we don't want to shut them down.   My friend from across the aisle, the gentlewoman from Arizona, just  said that this bill shuts some people out of the justice system and  that it is an important option. It is not an option. That is the point  of this bill. It is mandatory. It is forced. They don't have a choice.  They go into a secret and rigged system.   Vote for the FAIR Act. I thank the gentlewoman, Mrs. Torres, for  yielding.
