 Mr. President, I left my business to run for Senate  because I was fed up with business in DC as usual. Americans are fed up  as well.   I think the place is broken when it comes to our budgeting process.  We don't do them anymore. We are debating a funding bill for the fiscal  year that ends today. That is how you end up $28 trillion in debt.   Congress can agree on basically one thing: budgets, deficits, debt  don't matter anymore. Well, they do. Every business, every State, and  local government have to do them. Congress should as well.   No budget, no pay is simple. If we do not fund the government by  October 1, we don't get a paycheck until we get it done. It is a  popular bill because it works.   In 2013--the only time we have done one on time in 20 years--it was  in place. Many here voted for it, including the majority leader.   Americans are watching. They are tired of the job we are doing. They  demand accountability. Vote for this amendment. It makes sense. Our pay  is in the 94 percentile of income to boot.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
