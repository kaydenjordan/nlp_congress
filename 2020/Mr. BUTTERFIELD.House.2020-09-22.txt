 Madam Speaker, on Friday night, a great American,  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, passed from labor to reward. Moments after  her passing, the Senate Republican Leader announced that Republicans  will confirm any name that President Trump will send over, whether it  is before or after the election.   It was in February of 2016, 9 months before the election, that  Justice Scalia unexpectedly passed away, and Senate Republicans  announced they would wait until the election of the new President to  consider the replacement. Because of this obstruction, President Obama  was denied an opportunity to replace Justice Scalia. Republicans then  took control and packed the Court with the confirmation of Justice  Gorsuch.   And now this is 2016 in reverse. The Senate Republican Leader and  Lindsey Graham are determined to confirm a replacement before the  election. This is the height of hypocrisy. It places the integrity of  our judiciary in a place where it should not be. We will not tolerate a  second court packing. Do it at your peril.                            ____________________
