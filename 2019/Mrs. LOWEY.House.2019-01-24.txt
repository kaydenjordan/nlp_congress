 Mr. Speaker, the Trump shutdown is now in its 34th day.   Yesterday, the House passed six bills to reopen most of the  government, and with this bill today, we can reopen the entire  government while providing time to negotiate a full-year bill for the  Department of Homeland Security.   This continuing resolution would ensure that the Department of  Homeland Security is open, and its public servants, including Secret  Service agents, Transportation Security officers, Border Patrol,  Customs officers, and the brave men and women of the Coast Guard are  paid for their work.   According to The New York Times, as many as 1 of every 10  Transportation Security officers are not coming to work. Frankly, they  simply can't afford to. As a result, some of our busiest airports are  deploying backup and reserve workers. Other airports have closed  checkpoints and entire terminals. Notwithstanding the long lines for  travelers, this reduction in staffing puts our Transportation Security  workforce on the brink and could risk national security.   Additionally, 41,000--41,000--Active-Duty servicemembers and 2,100  civilians in the Coast Guard are working without pay.   No one should have to face the uncertainty of not knowing when they  will get paid, especially the men and women of our Armed Forces.   Each week of the Trump shutdown costs the United States economy $1.2  billion. Instead of continuing down this wasteful road, I urge my  friends on the other side of the aisle, reopen the government, pay our  Federal workers, and then we can work together in a bipartisan way to  determine the most effective border security. But we must open the  government.    Make no mistake--I want to make it very clear--Democrats support  smart investments in our homeland security, including increased  infrastructure investments at our ports of entry, advanced technology  to scan for contraband, new technology for detecting unauthorized  crossings. We can work together to meet these needs--there is no  question in my mind--because we have worked together in a bipartisan  way for many years. If we sit down together, we can work out answers to  these questions that could be supported by both sides of the aisle.   But, frankly, Mr. Speaker, until the government is open, the  President's actions are hurting hardworking families and putting our  security and economy at risk.   We are appropriators. We know how to work together in a bipartisan  way. Frankly, it is not that difficult. The facts are there. We have  all gotten many, many briefings on the best way to secure our borders.   And, by the way, drugs have been mentioned. The facts are that 90  percent of the drugs are coming through at the ports of entry.   We can work this out. But to keep the government closed and to see  thousands of people suffering, not being able to support their  families, is just unconscionable.   So let's open the government. Let's sit down. Let's get to work.  Let's resolve this now.    Madam Speaker, Federal workers should not have to  struggle to pay their bills just because my colleagues across the aisle  and the President refuse to end the Trump shutdown. They should not be  in a position of having to apply for unemployment while continuing to  work without pay, which is exactly what one of my constituents from  Westchester County, New York, has been forced to do.   Others in my district, nonprofit employees, working reduced hours  because of the shutdown, have been forced to rely on food donations to  feed their families.   It is inexcusable that Republicans have rejected 11 opportunities to  end the Trump shutdown, pay workers, and reopen government. I urge them  to come to their senses and reopen government without further delay.                            ____________________
