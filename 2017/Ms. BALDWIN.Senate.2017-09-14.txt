 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask  unanimous consent to make brief remarks and engage in a colloquy with  the chairman and ranking member.    Mr. President, I have filed Baldwin amendment No. 329.  This deals with the subject matter of ``Buy American'' in the National  Defense Authorization Act.   I have long been a strong supporter of our manufacturing sector, of  our national security, and I believe this amendment strongly supports  both.   All week we have been going back and forth about whether we are going  to vote on amendments to this measure. The Senate is supposed to be an  institution where we can debate and bring our ideas forward, represent  our States, represent the hard workers of this Nation, and I reserve  the right to object to this unanimous consent request because I am  frustrated, on behalf of those I represent, that we are not going to  see a vote on this ``Buy American'' amendment.   I would additionally note the unique status we have--actually, in  this case, a Statement of Administration Policy indicating strong  support for the amendment that I have filed. To me, the ultimate test  will be what is in the final bill that is signed into law. I am going  to continue to push on, but I am, again, disappointed that this Senate  is not operating in a fashion where we can offer amendments, debate  those amendments, and have votes on those amendments.   I wish to yield to both the chairman and ranking member, as we have  had discussions on this subject matter during these negotiations.    Mr. President, I had reserved the right to object, but I  will not object to proceeding to the vote to move the NDAA forward. I  would note that this amendment is germane  [[Page S5732]]  postcloture, and I still would like to see the Senate operate in a  manner where Senators can bring forth their amendments, can debate  them, and can get votes.   I yield back.
