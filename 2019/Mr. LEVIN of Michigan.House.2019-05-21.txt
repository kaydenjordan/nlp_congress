 Madam Speaker, today marks 100 years exactly  since the U.S. House of Representatives approved the 19th Amendment and  moved our Nation one step closer to full voting rights for women.   I am so proud that the great State of Michigan was among the first to  ratify the 19th Amendment, and I was proud to join my colleagues today  to pass a bipartisan resolution to commemorate and celebrate the  amendment.   I rise now to honor all the suffragettes whose names we know and all  those we don't, who put themselves in danger to help make a more  perfect union. But I also rise to honor those who follow in their  footsteps, like my incredible classmates in the 116th Congress.   Just like the suffragettes helped usher our Nation forward, they,  too, have opened doors that young women like my own daughter, Molly,  may walk through some day.   It is an honor to fight alongside them today and every day.  [[Page H4053]]                                ____________________
