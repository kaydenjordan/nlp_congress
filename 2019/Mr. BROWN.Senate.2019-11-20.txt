 Mr. President, I was walking by and heard Senator Wyden--I  do not usually sit over here--Senator Wyden was speaking about  healthcare. It is just so clear to me some of the things that this body  could be doing to bring down the cost of healthcare and to expand the  number of people that have health insurance. I know, in my State, I  worked with, I know, a friend of the Presiding Officer, Governor  Kasich, a Republican--I am a Democrat--on expanding Medicaid in Ohio.  In fact, after the Affordable Care Act, we now have 900,000 more people  that have insurance.   But what I liked about what Senator Wyden was saying was some of the  things we could do in the future. It is clear to me, if we allowed the  government to negotiate drug prices on behalf of Medicare  beneficiaries, directly with the drug companies the way we do at the  Veterans Administration, it could make a huge difference in drug costs.   We, in this body, a large part is because the drug company lobby  refuses to do it.    Yes.   MR. WYDEN. My colleague has been an enormous champion for consumers,  and I just want to ask my colleague, didn't he and finance Democrats  try in the Finance Committee to get rid of the restrictions on  negotiating to do exactly what he is saying?    Yes, that is exactly right. It should be an easy process.  We know how to do it at the Veterans Administration. The cost is 40 or  50 percent of what typically is the cost a patient pays.   The other thing we could do--and we were this close to getting it in  the Affordable Care Act, is giving people the option, at age 50 or 55,  to buy into Medicare because, as Senator Wyden knows, we all have in  our States--whether it is Utah or Oregon or Ohio, we have 58-year-olds  that lose their jobs or 62-year-olds that lose their jobs, and they  cannot really often find insurance, or it is not affordable if they  can. If they had the option to buy in--rather in a neutral way we built  it into the Affordable Care Act, but lost in the end. We fell one vote  short. But it would have made a huge difference in people being able to  get through that.   I will never forget, I had a townhall in Youngstown some years ago. A  woman stood up and said, ``I'm 62 years old. I hold two jobs. I never  had health insurance. I just want to stay alive until I'm 65.'' She did  not say I want to stay alive to raise my grandkids or to take a trip.  It was to stay alive so I can get on Medicare and get insurance, and  that just should not be in this country.    Absolutely--I thank Senator Wyden--absolutely. Just give  them that option. It is something we ought to be able to do. We can do  it in a cost-effective way. In the end, it means fewer trips to the  emergency room. In the end, it means a healthy population of people at  those 10 years when they are more likely to get sick and more likely to  need Medicare, but are not likely to be eligible.   I thank Senator Wyden.   I yield the floor.    Go ahead, Senator Alexander.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2557     Madam President, I reserve the right to object.   I and my colleagues here--Senator Carper, Senator Coons, and  prominent Democrats in the education debate--have deep concerns about  Senator Alexander's proposed micropackage. To be sure, it is a  micropackage of higher education bills. It is not a complete  reauthorization.   Our caucus has been clear about what a comprehensive bill should look  like. It addresses access, affordability, accountability, and campus  safety. This Alexander proposal falls well short.   The Senator from Tennessee says this package is bipartisan. That is  sort of true but not entirely. He has made a number of changes to the  underlying bipartisan bills that do not have the support of lead  Democrats on this and, in some cases, the lead Republicans of the  original bills. For example, this package includes a limited repeal of  the ban on Pell grants for incarcerated adults instead of the full  repeal of the ban included in the bipartisan bill. Our bill adds to  Pell grants.   His version of the short-term Pell Grant Program makes significant  changes to the bipartisan JOBS Act of 2019, a bill of which I am an  original cosponsor. The JOBS Act excludes for-profit colleges from  eligibility for the program. We know the Trump administration is all  about for-profit institutions, with the Secretary of Education leading  the charge. This version allows for-profit colleges--the sorts of  schools we know mislead and scam students in too many cases--to sneak  their way into eligibility.   One of the things I admire about the chairman of the HELP Committee-- and have admired since I met him 20-some years ago--was his work not  just as Secretary of Education but his work as president of the  University of Tennessee. He knows what for-profit colleges do for and  to far too many students. His legislation removes a number of the  protections meant to ensure programs eligible for this funding are  actually high-quality ones that educate students. These are just a  couple of the ways this micropackage is different from the original  bipartisan bills. We know the micropackage cannot pass the House.  Chairman Scott and Speaker Pelosi have been clear that they want  comprehensive reform. A comprehensive HEA reauthorization can pass.  That is not what this is.   I hope we can come to a bipartisan agreement, but as we work  together, we can't hold hostage historically Black colleges and  universities. Most of them are in the South. Most of them are in the  States of my colleagues who are from the South. Most of them are in  Republican States with Republican Senators. As mentioned by Senator  Carper and Senator Coons, of Delaware, my State, which is similar to  Delaware, has historically Black colleges. In Ohio, Wilberforce and  Central State are prominent institutions that matter so much to our  State. For the nearly 2 years now since the Trump administration has  been in office, these schools have been in fiscal limbo.   I know Senator Alexander cares about these schools, but there is no  evidence that the President of the United States does. They need their  funding extended now. The mandatory funding, which is vital to these  schools, ran out on September 30 because the Senate refused to act and  because the President didn't seem to care. The House did its job in  passing the FUTURE Act. Now HBCUs are facing impossible decisions in  the face of dwindling funding. The Senate needs to immediately take up  and vote on the bill the House already passed to provide full,  mandatory funding for MSIs and HBCUs.   We all agree--Senator Burr, Senator Alexander, the two Senators from  Delaware, and Senator Cardin, who has just joined us--that HBCUs have  fostered generations of Black leaders. They are a critical part of our  Nation's higher ed system. These schools have rich legacies and proven  track records of educating students of color and other underrepresented  students.   Wilberforce was founded in 1856 in Wilberforce, OH, as the Nation's  first private institution of higher ed for Black students. Central  State, which is in the same town across the road in Wilberforce, has a  rich legacy of educating students as an 1890 land grant institution. We  have helped it this year through the Committee on Agriculture,  Nutrition, and Forestry. It is further tasked with strengthening  research, extension, and teaching in food and ag science.   We know that without our HBCUs, millions of Black students would have  been denied the opportunity to pursue higher ed. HBCUs account for  approximately a quarter of all of Black students who earn bachelor's  degrees and nearly a third of all of the African-American students who  earn STEM bachelor's degrees. Our country owes an enormous debt to  these schools that we don't seem to be paying back. That is why it is  unconscionable that the Senate has abandoned these schools and these  students.   I have heard from schools about how their budgets have been thrown  into chaos. They tell me that academia is about planning, and many of  them already operate close to the margins. HBCUs have already received  letters from the Department of Education telling them that they are not  getting future funding and that they can't use any Federal funding for  long-term projects. It could mean program cuts and layoffs. It means no  long-term construction projects. It means not hiring permanent faculty  and not purchasing major equipment. Imagine operating a school like  that.   It is shameful that in 2019 we still ignore schools that serve  students of color by treating this as anything other than a must-pass  bill. I know that very few African Americans voted for President Trump,  and I know he seems to care for only those people who voted for him.  Yet this is an obligation. Senator Alexander wants to fulfill it, but  he is operating in a straitjacket with this President.   It is so important that we do this. The FUTURE Act is budget neutral,  and it is fully paid for. We use the same offset the administration has  used. It is a bipartisan pay-for, not a gimmick.   I should add that less than 2 years ago, this Senate and President  Trump had no problem passing a $1 trillion tax cut for corporations and  the wealthy that wasn't paid for. We have seen that under Republican  leadership in the White House. We have seen what has happened to our  budget debt, and we know corporations have had huge tax cuts. We know  70 percent of the tax cuts went to the wealthiest 1 percent. Yet this  body can't take care of historically Black colleges. They hold schools  that serve students of color to a different standard.   I am hopeful that Senator Alexander, whom I trust, and Senator  Murray, whom I trust, will continue to negotiate a truly bipartisan and  truly comprehensive higher ed reauthorization that supports HBCUs. I  support those efforts. That is the way forward for the priorities that  Senator Alexander has outlined in his micropackage and for the updates  and reauthorizations all of our students and families need. HBCUs and  MSIs can't wait  [[Page S6702]]  until that process is over. They need action now. They have all had to  overcome enough hurdles every day in order to educate their students.  The U.S. Senate should not be one of those hurdles. We need to pass the  FUTURE Act now.   Accordingly, I object.
