 Mr. President, another election night in America,  another win for women's choice, another win for democracy, another win  for the Democratic agenda of jobs, infrastructure, and lowering costs  for the middle class.   Another terrible defeat for the MAGA agenda. Americans don't want  hard-right extremists to govern this country. At stake last night was a  woman's right to choose in Ohio, the Governorship in Kentucky, cannabis  reform in Ohio, control of the legislature in Virginia, State Supreme  Court seats, and so much more.   In almost every major election, Democratic candidates and Democratic  issues prevailed. This continued and strengthened the trend of  Democratic victories last year. There is no possible takeaway from last  night other than this: Americans fiercely oppose MAGA extremism,  fiercely oppose total abortion bans, and want bipartisan leaders who  can put America's needs first.   After last night's results, I have a message to my Republican  colleagues: When the MAGA agenda can't win in deep red Kentucky or in  Ohio or help you in Virginia, it is time to recognize MAGA extremism is  the wrong answer, not just for the country, but even for the GOP.   I hope Republicans in Congress see that after last night, extremism  must be rejected and bipartisanship embraced. Time will tell if House  Republicans choose the right path.   I want to say one more thing about the results in Ohio. With strong  support, the people of Ohio have voted to legalize the recreational use  of marijuana. Americans think it is long past time to enact cannabis  reform. So here in the Senate, I will continue to work with colleagues  on both sides and my good friend Senator Brown to keep moving on  bipartisan cannabis legislation as soon as we can.   Last night shows just how precious and vital and sacrosanct our  system of elections is. It shows how much work we have to do to  preserve democracy so that it can survive in the 21st century.    Mr. President, it is my honor to recognize an  outstanding Senate Stationery Room employee, Dale Montgomery, who is  retiring today after more than 50 years of service to the U.S. Senate.   For Dale, working in the Senate was more than just a calling; it is  in his blood. Dale's father worked in the Senate Library for 35 years,  and his grandfather worked with the Architect of the Capitol dating  back to 1914. So, when the opportunity arose to follow in his family's  footsteps, Dale couldn't refuse. Without ever even filling out an  application, Dale accepted a job where he would spend the next half- century of his life.   Dale's first day in the Stationery Room was in 1973, in a different  world and a very different Senate. He rose through the ranks, starting  in the warehouse doing deliveries before moving to the Stationery Store  as a clerk and then as a sales associate. No matter the title he held,  Dale approached each task with a great level of care and attention to  detail. His contributions to the day-to-day operations of the Senate  are truly immeasurable.   Dale quickly became one of the Senate community's most beloved  members. His affable nature and affinity for music attracted friends  and strangers alike, people from all around the country. Dale was a  sought-after DJ and  [[Page S5423]]  was known to make an appearance at Senator Ford's Kentucky Derby  parties. It didn't matter where, when, or how you met Dale, he was sure  to leave a lasting impression.   The mark of a good employee is a steadfast commitment to the work.  The mark of a good friend is a steadfast presence for each other. To  everyone he encountered over the last 50 years, Dale was both--and so  much more.   On behalf of the entire Senate community, we thank Dale for his years  of dedicated service, and we wish him and his family the best in  retirement.                            ____________________
