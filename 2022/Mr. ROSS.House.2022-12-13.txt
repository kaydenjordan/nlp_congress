 I now ask the clerk to call the roll of all former and  retiring Members.   The Clerk called the roll and the following Members were ``present'':   Mr. Altmire of Pennsylvania   Mr. Bartlett of Maryland   Ms. Bourdeaux of Georgia   Mr. Capuano of Massachusetts   Mr. Chabot of Ohio   Mr. Clay of Missouri   Mr. Cook of California   Mr. Davis of Tennessee   Mr. Davis of Virginia   Ms. Edwards of Maryland   Mr. Faso of New York   Mr. Graves of Georgia   Ms. Harman of California   Mr. Holt of New Jersey   Mr. Hutchinson of Arkansas   Mr. McEwen of Ohio   Ms. Morella of Maryland   Mr. Rick Nolan of Virginia   Mr. Paulsen of Minnesota    The Chair announces that 32 former and retiring Members of  Congress have responded to their names.   The Chair now recognizes the Honorable L.F. Payne, president of the  Association of the Former Members of Congress to address the Members.    The Chair recognizes the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.     Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from  Virginia?   There was no objection.    The Chair again wishes to thank the former and retiring  Members of Congress of the House for their presence here today.   Before ending these proceedings, the Chair would like to invite those  former and retiring Members who did not respond when the roll call was  called to give their names to the Reading Clerk for inclusion in the  roll.   On behalf of FMC, my sincere thanks to all congressional staff who  were such a terrific resource and support to make today's presentation  possible. Thank you, and we look forward to seeing you at the  reception.   We are adjourned.                            ____________________
