 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of Senator  Schumer's address on anti-Semitism in the Senate.   I echo Senator Schumer's concerns. Anti-Semitism is on the rise in  our country, and it is simply unacceptable.   As Americans, we have the responsibility to condemn bigotry and hate  in all of its forms, including anti-Semitism.   To quote my friend and colleague in the Senate, ``We are stewards of  the flames of liberty, tolerance, and equality that warm our American  melting pot, and make it possible for Jewish Americans to prosper  alongside Palestinian Americans, and every other immigrant group from  all over the world.''   I thank Senator Schumer for his powerful words. As we watch the  events abroad and here at home unfold, I urge Americans to remember  that our shared humanity, commitment to equality, and tolerance are our  greatest strengths.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record Senator Schumer's remarks.
