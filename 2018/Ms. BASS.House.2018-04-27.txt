 The FAA SoCal Metroplex project has dramatically changed  flight paths into Los Angeles International Airport, effectively  cramming traffic from a six-lane highway in the sky into a single lane.   Constituents in my district now have low-altitude flights over their  heads, sometimes every 3 minutes. Parents have reported that aircraft  noise wakes up their children, movie studios in my district report that  the noise has made it very difficult to film outdoors on their lots,  which poses a major economic threat.   Guided by my constituents, I proposed and supported over 30  amendments to the FAA reauthorization. I am glad to report that a  terminal sequencing spacing amendment that was crafted specifically by  constituents in my district passed yesterday. However, more needs to be  done, and I will continue to urge this body to do more to fix this  problem.   The constant barrage of noise has real measurable costs in disrupted  sleep, lost property values, and business disruption for thousands of  people in my district. We cannot allow airline efficiency to come at  the sacrifice of the health and well-being of those on the ground.                            ____________________
