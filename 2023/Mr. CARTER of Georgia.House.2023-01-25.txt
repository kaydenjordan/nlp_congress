 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  creation of a state-of-the-art poultry science building at my alma  mater, the University of Georgia.   In the State of Georgia, the poultry industry contributes an annual  $21.5 billion to our State's economy. The industry also generates an  annual $2.1 billion in Federal tax revenue. The poultry industry is  vital to not only the State of Georgia but also the country. That is  why I am proud to recognize the University of Georgia for building a  brand-new poultry science building on their campus.   This $54.1 million facility will feature new classrooms, research  labs, and learning labs. These new labs will enhance the traditional  classroom experience by offering students opportunities to learn in a  fieldwork setting. These facilities are vital for preparing students as  they enter the poultry industry.   I know this new project will serve the students at the university and  the people of Georgia's First District well.                     Georgia Among LEED-Certified Top 10     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  State of Georgia for being a top 10 finisher in the country last year  for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-certified green  buildings.   The United States Green Building Council has been working hard to  create a healthier, more sustainable, and resilient world through LEED,  and its annual ranking is an opportunity to recognize everyone working  toward that goal.   Buildings that are LEED certified create healthier spaces for people,  use fewer resources, reduce carbon emissions, and improve efficiency  while providing operational cost savings.   Georgia is a leader in green building and ranks sixth out of the top  10 States. 2022 saw growth in green building and sustainability, and I  am proud that Georgia is at the forefront of building a healthier, more  sustainable future.   I thank all the building professionals who helped our State achieve  this ranking.                     Recognizing Georgia Ports Authority     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Georgia Ports Authority for handling nearly 6 million 20-foot  containers in 2022. In 2022 alone, the Georgia Ports Authority had a 5  percent increase in container handling.   Collaborative effort across Georgia's supply chain ensured that cargo  movement remained a top priority during a very challenging year.   The Port of Savannah achieved 4 of its top 5 months for container  volume in 2022, with trade volumes peaking in August at an all-time  high of 575,500 20-foot containers.   With the renovation of Berth 1 at Garden City Terminal, the 90-acre  Garden City Terminal West expansion, and the transition of Ocean  Terminal to an all-container facility, the Port of Savannah is set to  increase annual capacity from 6 million to 7.5 million 20-foot  containers.   I congratulate the GPA on this wonderful accomplishment.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate the record-breaking completion rates at the University of  Georgia.   In just one year, the university's 4-year completion rate for  freshmen has increased from 72.1 percent to 75.1 percent.   The university's 6-year completion rate has reached a new high of  88.1 percent, and the retention rate of students remains strong at 94.3  percent.   I commend the university's faculty hiring initiatives that have  bolstered this already prestigious institution.   High-demand areas of study such as the Terry College of Business and  the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences continue to provide students  with very talented professors, thanks to these initiatives.   The university has also continued to grow tutoring and peer learning  programs to provide students with all the resources they need to  succeed.   I am proud of the hard work the University of Georgia is doing to  ensure student success across the board. Go Dawgs.                            ____________________
