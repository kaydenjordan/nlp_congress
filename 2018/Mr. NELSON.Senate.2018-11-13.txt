 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we finally have the Coast Guard bill here.  I want to urge our colleagues to support the passage of the Coast Guard  Authorization Act of 2018. We have worked on it and passed it through  committee. We have been in intensive discussions with the House, and  finally, the final product is here.    Coast Guard personnel live by the motto ``Always Ready.'' Just last  month, I saw firsthand how Coast Guard efforts in protecting life and  property followed Hurricane Michael up in the Panhandle of Florida.  Coast Guard ships, planes, and helicopters came from across the country  to help hundreds of people on the Florida coastline and inland, and the  Coast Guard, as always, was there to assist--``Always Ready,'' their  motto. In Panama City, the shallow-water response teams provided food,  water, and oxygen and ensured the relocation of over 130 nursing home  residents, 35 of whom were bedridden, and they saw them to safety and  medical care as far away as Pensacola. The Coast Guard also conducted  damage assessments to facilitate the reopening of the Florida waterways  and ports. This isn't something new; the Coast Guard provided similar  efforts to Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico following  Hurricanes Irma and Maria last fall.   If there is a disaster, aside from the Federal Agency tasked--FEMA-- you can bet your boots that the Coast Guard is going to be there.  During just 5 weeks of the 2017 hurricane season a year ago, the Coast  Guard saved over 11,000 people and more than 1,000 pets and mobilized  nearly 3,000 personnel. For Hurricane Maria alone, a year ago, the  Coast Guard deployed over 500 personnel, 7 helicopters, 17 planes, and  14 cutters. And you know the devastation that Hurricane Maria did on  the island of Puerto Rico.   On behalf of Floridians, I thank the Coast Guard for their hurricane  response and invaluable assistance provided to storm victims. We owe  the Coast Guard our gratitude for their readiness and service to the  Nation. When mariners are out in their fishing boats and get stranded  out in the ocean, who are they so happily contacting but the Coast  Guard for rescue?   The Coast Guard does much more than just save lives; they also serve  as a first line of defense against cartels and smugglers who seek to  flood the United States with illegal drugs. Last year, for instance,  was a banner year for Coast Guard drug enforcement. They prevented over  200 metric tons of cocaine, valued at over $6 billion, from entering  the United States. In Florida, the Coast Guard cutter Mohawk, which is  homeported in Key West, confiscated over 7 tons of cocaine in August. A  [[Page S6908]]  month later, the Coast Guard cutter Tahoma offloaded 6 tons of cocaine  in Port Everglades. And just last month, the Miami-based Coast Guard  cutter Bernard C. Webber confiscated over 3,500 pounds of cocaine and  50 pounds of marijuana.   The bottom line is that the Coast Guard is an adaptable, responsive  military force that maintains a persistent and comforting presence  along our rivers, in our ports, on our coastal waters, and on the high  seas.   I have had the privilege of spending a great deal of time with the  Coast Guard. I have been in their helicopters chasing down go-fasts,  showing me in a simulated chase how they would shoot out the engines  from the open door of a Coast Guard helicopter. I have also done that  chase in high-speed, the Coast Guard getting off the cutters into the  go-fast--go-fasts that can turn on a dime. At the end of the day, the  Coast Guard is going to catch even the speediest boats, and if they  can't catch them with the go-fast small boats, they will catch them  from the air.   I have been with the Coast Guard up in Alaska, where the Navy has  pretty well ceded protection of the seas off of Alaska and up into the  Arctic to the Coast Guard. We have a substantial fishing fleet up  there. Of course, who do they rely on when they get into trouble? That  is why we have a substantial Coast Guard presence in Alaska.   The bottom line is that the Coast Guard is an incredible force. They  are especially present in the State of Florida since we have so much  coastline. Nearly 40 percent of all Coast Guard personnel are in and  around the State of Florida.   Down in Key West is the joint task force center--maintained by all  agencies of the Federal Government--which is tracking the movements of  the drug smugglers. If we had more assets in the Caribbean and the  Pacific, we would be able to pick up a lot more of the drugs trying to  enter and poison our children in the United States. We should do  everything we can to support the Coast Guard's work. That is why we are  here today.   The bipartisan bill before us will reauthorize the Coast Guard for  fiscal years 2018 and 2019. It authorizes a $2 billion funding increase  for the Coast Guard through fiscal year 2019. This includes new money  to help the Coast Guard continue modernizing its aging fleet of cutters  and aircraft. A good part of the Coast Guard's modernization of their  fleet--the new offshore patrol cutters are being built by a shipbuilder  in Florida.   This legislation will also better enable the Coast Guard to execute  their missions, provide adequate resources and training to meet  operational demands, and support servicemembers and their dependents.  You should see these Coast Guard bases around the country, even on the  Great Lakes. Just think--there are mariners on the Great Lakes. There  is a great deal of commercial shipping on the Great Lakes. As a result,  we have a substantial Coast Guard presence and Coast Guard bases on the  Great Lakes.   This is a good bill, and we can be proud of it. Passing it will  ensure that the Coast Guard has the tools they need to continue to  carry out their many important missions, including the lifesaving and  disaster response roles on which so many Americans have come to rely.  When they call, they know they can depend on the Coast Guard.   I urge our colleagues to support this motion for cloture and then  tomorrow to support the final passage of the bill.   I yield the floor.
