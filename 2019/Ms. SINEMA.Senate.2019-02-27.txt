 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent but, had I  been present, would have voted no on rollcall vote 29, the confirmation  of Eric D. Miller to be a United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth  Circuit.  [[Page S1535]]    I was necessarily absent but, had I been present, would have voted  yes on rollcall vote 30, the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination  of Michael J. Desmond to be Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue  Service and an Assistant General Counsel in the Department of the  Treasury.                            ____________________
