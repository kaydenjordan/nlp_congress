 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S6468]]     Mr. President, we are in session here on a Sunday in  Washington for a rare Sunday session in the U.S. Senate so that we can  confirm a terrific woman to be the next Justice of the Supreme Court.   There is an open seat right now that needs to be filled, and Judge  Barrett, who is currently a judge on the circuit court, one level below  the Supreme Court, has really impressed me and the American people with  her performance.   I had a chance to meet with her this past week, and I was already  impressed but even more so, having had a chance to spend some time with  her. I had been impressed with her performance at the hearing because I  thought she showed great patience and calm in the face of some really  tough questions. To me, that is judicial temperament, and I think that  will serve her well in her new role as Justice of the Supreme Court.   I have also been impressed with her qualifications. I don't think  anybody can say she is not highly qualified. In fact, the American Bar  Association, which does not always look favorably at Republican  appointees, was, in her last confirmation, convinced that she was  highly qualified, and again, in this one, they gave her their highest  qualification. That is impressive.   As has been talked about on the floor tonight, she actually has been  through this process before--and pretty recently. I think less than 3  years ago she was confirmed by this same body, and it was a bipartisan  vote, and it was an opportunity for people to get to know her. So this  is not as though we have brought somebody forward who isn't already  known, who isn't already deemed to be very well qualified. In fact, I  don't know anybody in this Chamber who doesn't think that she is well  qualified and that she has done a good job as a judge and a lawyer.   She graduated first in her class at Notre Dame Law School, and then  she went back there and taught. She won the Teacher of the Year Award  three times when she was at Notre Dame, and, most importantly to me,  she is just widely respected by her colleagues. These are professors.  She is also widely respected by her former students. These professors  and students, by the way, are representing the entire political  spectrum from very liberal to very conservative. All of them say the  same thing about her, which is that she is a legal scholar, that she is  highly qualified, and that she is a good person.   In our meeting I got to see some of that. I saw in our meeting that  she is a great listener. People talk about active listening. She was  really interested in what the topics were and had very thoughtful  responses.   She is also a legal scholar who understands very clearly what the  role of the Supreme Court should be in our separation of branches in  our governmental system here. I think that is really important. As I  said to her in our meeting, I hope she will be an ambassador, and I  think she will. In fact, I think she will be an extremely effective  ambassador--as the youngest member of the Supreme Court and also as a  former teacher--with regard to young people, to help them understand  what it means to have a judicial branch and how it is different from  the legislative branch or the executive branch for that matter. Judges  are not supposed to be legislators. That is not what they are hired to  do. Yet in some cases we have gotten the sense that judges ought to be  deciding issues that are reserved for those who are elected by the  people; that is, the legislators.   Judges have an important role, and that is to look at the laws and to  look at the Constitution and to determine whether something is  consistent with those. That is what she will do, and I think she will  do it very fairly, with compassion and with a great understanding of  the legal issues and precedent.   She explained before the committee that she was respectful of  precedent. She also told me that in our meeting. I think she has the  proper understanding of the role of the Court and her role as a  Justice.   I am looking for the opportunity to finally vote. I guess we will do  that tomorrow night, sometime in the evening, and I hope it will be a  strong vote. I hope it can be even a bipartisan vote, as it was last  time she was confirmed by this same body    Madam President, I want to recognize and  celebrate the life of a friend and a true champion of our Great Lakes,  whom we sadly lost recently at age 74.   Captain Dave Spangler was a true leader in the Great Lakes community.  He was a captain for Dr. Bugs Charters and vice president of the Lake  Erie Charter Boat Captain Association. Dave grew up fishing with his  father on the Maumee River and started fishing in Lake Erie in the late  1970s, so it is no surprise that he became known as the expert on  finding the ``hot spots,'' or knowing the best techniques to catch big  walleye and perch. He won many awards for his expertise. He was named  Charter Boat Captain of the Year in 2014.   I first met Captain Dave during one of my annual fishing trips on  Lake Erie more than a decade ago. Dave would also come to Washington,  DC, for meetings, but he and I both knew we would both rather be out on  his boat.   What impressed me most about Dave is that he was not only an expert  among the fishing community but that he was also unafraid to get his  hands dirty--literally--in other issues impacting the Great Lakes,  especially his beloved Lake Erie. He devoted the last several decades  of his life to protecting and improving the entire health of the Great  Lakes. Where most boaters would try to avoid the green, foul odor of  toxic algal blooms that sometimes plague the lakes, Dave drove straight  into them--to take samples, track the movement of the bloom, and work  to develop solutions. Whether it was harmful algal blooms, Asian carp,  or pollution impacting the lakes, Dave eagerly became an expert on all  of them. Not only did I turn to him for his knowledge and advice on  these issues, but I also admired Dave's ability to bring people  together to find solutions, especially in such a divided world that we  live in today.   Dave had a strong conviction and devoted purpose to protecting the  lakes, but he also had a warm and lighthearted demeanor, with a  contagious laugh and smile. I will miss my friend, and he will be  deeply missed by so many in the Great Lakes community, including those  who may have never met him but are able to enjoy the beautiful lakes  thanks to his efforts.   While Dave is no longer with us in person, his passion for protecting  the Great Lakes will continue to inspire us all.   Rest in Peace, Captain Dave.                            ____________________
