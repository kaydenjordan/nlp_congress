 Mr. Chair, I rise today to urge the support of two of my  amendments in this bipartisan en bloc.   My first amendment supports farmers and healthy soils by asking the  USDA to conduct research on the amount of microplastics in farmland.   Microplastics are showing up everywhere: in our bodies, in our  waters, and our soils. My amendment would support efforts to understand  microplastics and support healthy soil, which is essential for our  farming communities and our agricultural sector.   My second amendment is the idea that the USDA should be able to fix  its own stuff. We shouldn't waste taxpayer dollars on tractors and  other farm equipment that cannot be repaired easily--and by USDA  technicians--when it breaks.   My amendment allows the USDA to be better stewards of taxpayer  dollars and supports the longevity of the equipment they use to perform  groundbreaking research.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment.
