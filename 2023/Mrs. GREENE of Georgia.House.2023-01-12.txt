 Madam Speaker, today, I congratulate my alma  mater, the University of Georgia, on their dominating victory over the  TCU Horned Frogs in Monday's national championship.   Last year, the Bulldogs ended a four-decade-long national  championship drought. This year, they became the first team in the  playoff era to win back-to-back titles.   Coach Kirby Smart has built an incredible program with incredible  players, several of which are from Georgia's 14th District.   Ladd McConkey, a graduate of North Murray High School in Murray  County, Georgia, has started as wide receiver for two seasons at UGA.  During his time as a Bulldog, he has amassed over 1,300 total yards and  15 total touchdowns, two of which came on Monday night.   Ladd is not the only outstanding player from Georgia-14. Tate  Ratledge of Rome, Smael Mondon, Jr., of Dallas, Cole Speer of Calhoun,  CJ Washington of Cedartown, Jonathan Washburn of Ringgold, and Cade  Brock from Darlington School have all made our district proud.   Go Dawgs.                            ____________________
