 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise to honor and recognize the folks  who are first to respond when crisis strikes--the folks who patrol our  streets, keep our families safe, and are willing to enter harm's way on  a daily basis.   I rise today to honor our police officers in Montana and every corner  of the country. Police officers answer a call to duty to protect and  defend our communities. While this Nation's police forces are on  patrol, it is critical that the folks in this body are doing everything  we can to keep them safe on the job and to honor their service.   To recognize National Police Week, I have partnered with Senators  Boozman, Gardner, Moran, Udall, Blumenthal, and Carper to introduce the  bipartisan Honoring Hometown Heroes Act. Our bill will provide the  Governor of each State the ability to fly the American flag at half- staff to honor a police officer or any first responder who dies in the  line of duty. This bill will treat our fallen responders with the  respect they deserve.    In the past, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to  strengthen resources for local police officers, and we have ensured  that our first responders have access to critical healthcare services,  but this bill is a bit different. This bill makes sure that our police  officers and their families receive the recognition they deserve for  their selfless service to their communities. When tragedy strikes, I  think it is important the entire State takes a moment to honor that  police officer who was lost while serving others.   This bipartisan bill has the support of police officers and first  responders from across the country--from the Fraternal Order of Police,  the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the International  Association of Fire Chiefs, and the International Association of  Firefighters, just to name a few.   The Honoring Hometown Heroes Act will give our fallen first  responders the honor they so much deserve, but for the police officers  we have already lost, it is too late. Today is Peace Officers Memorial  Day. Across the country, the names of fallen officers will be carved  into granite, and their photos will be hung in stations for all to see.  Yet these folks and their families did not have the honor of seeing  their entire States mourn alongside them because flags were never flown  at half-staff.   To ensure that these folks get the recognition they deserve, today I  enshrine in the Congressional Record the names of 128 law enforcement  officials who have died in the line of duty. They have made the  ultimate sacrifice while protecting their neighbors and keeping our  communities safe. I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Anaconda Police Dept.: Lieutenant Timothy Sullivan, 2/10/      1985; Assistant Chief of Police Edwin E.
