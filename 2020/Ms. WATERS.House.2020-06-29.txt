 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1017, I call up  the bill (H.R. 7301) to prevent evictions, foreclosures, and unsafe  housing conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on H.R. 7301 and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7301, the Emergency  Housing Protections and Relief Act of 2020.   This bill includes several provisions that were included in the  HEROES Act and independently led by a number of members of the  Financial Services Committee. Some people hearing this bill won't  understand what we are attempting to do here today. As I said, this was  a part of the HEROES Act that passed this House, but we have been  waiting on the Senate to take up the HEROES Act. They are not taking it  up. They don't seem to care. They don't seem to understand that there  are people out there who are going to be evicted, and so, we have  pulled it out of the HEROES Act, and we are taking it up independently  so that we can send a message to the Senate that we want this measure  heard.   So, we have a number of Members who have participated in putting this  legislation together and who had independent bills to do so. That  includes Representatives Lacy Clay, Denny Heck, David Scott, Chuy  Garcia, Cindy Axne, Nydia Velazquez, Ayanna Pressley, Katie Porter, and  Al Green.   Mr. Speaker, America was facing an affordable housing crisis before  this pandemic hit. With so many families struggling as a result of the  pandemic, we are now on the precipice of an eviction and a homeless  crisis like we have never seen in our lifetime.   We can't wait any longer. We have got to move. The CARES Act was an  important step towards providing relief, but more help is needed. We  knew, for example, that an eviction moratorium without the provision of  rental assistance would only delay disastrous outcomes as families  would have to pay more than they could afford, a lump sum of 3 to 4  months of unpaid rent at the expiration of the moratorium.   This House followed through on providing several additional and  targeted housing solutions when it passed the HEROES Act.  Unfortunately, in the 45 days since the HEROES Act passed, there has  been no action taken by either our Republican colleagues in the Senate  or the Trump administration. This is simply unacceptable.   As a matter of fact, someone said this morning, and I repeat, we have  not heard one word, not one peep from this administration about rental  assistance.   We saw in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis what the consequences are  when Congress acts too slowly: 10 million foreclosures, almost $17  trillion in household wealth lost, increases in rates of homelessness  all across the country. And we saw how communities of color were  disproportionately hit with foreclosures and a corresponding loss of  wealth after they had been targeted with predatory mortgage products.   Today, there are over 2.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the  United States and over 125,000 Americans have died. The Centers for  Disease Control reported that as of June 20, hospitalization rates for  COVID-19 are highest among Native, Black, and Latinx Americans. We also  know that people of color account for the largest portion of the  essential workers, have a higher incidence of preexisting health  conditions, and that with these preexisting health conditions they  have, they have limited access to healthcare, and have fewer  opportunities to isolate because they cannot work from home.   But I must emphasize that this pandemic did not create such  disparities, it only exacerbated them, and I hope this pandemic has  finally drawn widespread public attention to all of these disparities.   Congress cannot fail again to quickly act as we did in the aftermath  of the 2008 crisis. Since passage of the HEROES Act, our Nation's  renters and homeowners have experienced renewed pressures.   When June rent came due, one in three renters were unable to fully  pay their rent.  [[Page H2654]]    On June 14, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that the number  of homeowners in forbearance reached 4.2 million.   Since passage of the HEROES Act, we have now experienced record days  of both new positive coronavirus tests, including in Texas, Florida,  Georgia and my State of California.   And since the HEROES Act passed, over 11 million Americans have filed  for unemployment insurance. There are now only 25 days left before the  Federal eviction ban expires on July 25. When it does, many families  who have been unable to pay their rent because of the COVID-19 pandemic  will face eviction and the devastating consequences that evictions have  on families, particularly children.   Our committee heard testimony in January from one gentleman about  what it was like when all of his belongings were put out on the  sidewalk and he and his children were forced out of their home. He told  us how he fell behind on rent while trying to obtain training for a  higher paying job and how the sheriff banged on his door one morning  while his 9-year-old son was getting ready for school. He described how  he and his wife watched as all of their personal belongings were thrown  on to the front lawn, including items with sentimental value like their  wedding photos. He said, ``I remember the feeling that I'd failed.  Failed as a husband and as a father to provide a place for my family.''   Several landlords declined his rental applications after charging a  nonreimbursable application fee, likely because they saw the eviction  on his record, and he and his family stayed at motels that were even  more costly than paying rent.   Maya Angelou once wrote that: ``Home is a refuge not only from the  world, but a refuge from my worries, my troubles, my concerns.'' And we  know all too well what happens to families, and especially children,  when their homes are forcibly taken from them.   We cannot sit idly by. We must understand that an eviction can  disrupt every aspect of a family's life, putting them at greater risk  of job loss, homelessness, and gaps or other disruptions to a child's  education.   Housing instability can be particularly traumatic for young children  and can have lifelong impacts. Studies show that children who avoid  eviction due to a long-term housing subsidy have better educational  achievement, obtain higher paying jobs as adults, and are less likely  to become incarcerated. Many families with evictions on their records  cannot find another home and fall into homelessness.    So, again, we cannot sit idly by and let this eviction crisis cause  irreparable harm to millions of families around the country. The bill  before us today pulls out the key housing protection and relief  provisions from the HEROES Act.   Specifically, let me tell what you the bill does. It provides $100  billion for an emergency rental assistance fund and $75 billion for a  homeowners' assistance fund to ensure renters and homeowners can cover  their housing expenses, including rent, mortgage payments, and utility  bills.   It extends and expands the eviction and foreclosure moratoria for all  renters and homeowners, as well as provides additional forbearance  relief.   It provides $18 billion in funding for homeless assistance and other  Federal housing assistance programs to ensure rents remain affordable  and housing is maintained in a safe and decent condition.   It creates a lending facility for mortgage servicers and rental  property owners to help them finance their obligations and shortfalls  in rent.   It ensures robust, fair housing enforcement and housing counseling to  protect all renters and homeowners.   What happens next is up to us. Each of us in this Chamber knows the  value of a place where we and our family come together, share a meal,  and safely rest our heads. We also know that households of color still  have not fully recovered from the 2008 crisis, and we know that they  will continue to be disproportionately impacted if the pandemic causes  the housing crisis to worsen.   I, for one, refuse to do nothing while families suffer. This is an  emergency, and it calls for the emergency response provided by this  legislation.   We can't wait. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) had an  opportunity when this bill went through the House. It is over on the  Senate side. If the Republicans want to do more negotiation, they know  they have to take it up over there.   I don't care how we get it, with this bill or with the one over  there.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Carolyn B. Maloney), the senior member of the Financial Services  Committee and chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind all Members and the  gentleman that Republicans don't care about debt as long as they are  doing the spending; it is only when Democrats are helping Americans,  even in a time of crisis. Remember, it was the President of the United  States, Trump, who said he likes debt. I quote him. He said he likes  debt.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New York  (Ms. Velazquez), the senior member of the Financial Services Committee  and chair of the Committee on Small Business.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Clay), chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing, Community  Development and Insurance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr.   David Scott), a senior member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have yielded to the gentleman extra time.  His time has expired.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Heck), a senior member of the Financial Services  Committee and sponsor of the emergency rental assistance title of this  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), a member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Garcia), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), who is a member of the Committee on Education  and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), who is a member of the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Espaillat), who is a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire, if I may, how much  time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), who is the distinguished Speaker of the House  of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I come from a family of 13 children. We were poor. We  lived in inadequate housing. It was cold in the wintertime, and the  pipes froze on the inside of our house. In the summertime, it was too  hot to be in the house. We sat on the stoop through the wee hours of  the morning, trying to stay cool. But it was home.   I worried that we were going to be evicted, but my mother managed to  put together the money, and we never got evicted. But my neighbors and  my friends, I saw evicted. Maybe my friends on the opposite side of the  aisle have never seen this. They don't understand this.   I have my friend from Michigan talking about a family that makes  $131,000 per year. The Members of Congress make $175,000 a year, and we  have Members of Congress who sleep free in this place, don't pay any  rent when they are in Washington, D.C., and you have the audacity to  come here and talk about denying assistance to people who are at the  worst part of their lives to be evicted.   No, I do not yield. This is an emergency. The hospitals are filling  up. Children are hungry. People have lost their jobs.   This is about whether or not people are going to have a place to lay  their heads. This is about whether or not families are going to stay  together. We have hospitals where the ICU rooms are all filled, and  these people may be sick and not have a place to go home to.   So, I am not about to wait. Yes, he mocked us when we said we can't  wait any longer. No, we cannot wait any longer.   Mr. Speaker, this is why I am in the Congress of the United States of  America. This is why I came, for moments like this, to speak for the  least of these, to speak for the poorest families in America, to speak  for families when they need help.   This is an emergency. Our families need help, and I cannot wait. You  should not wait.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment  offered by my Republican colleague to H.R. 7301.   Mr. Speaker, the amendment before us does nothing to bring relief to  struggling families. The amendment would deny millions of families,  including children, assistance during a crisis because someone in their  family is here without proper documentation. Racism, anti-immigrant  policies hurt children the most.   We are on the precipice of a housing crisis not seen since the Great  Depression, a crisis that threatens to strip countless families of a  home at a time when they are being asked to stay home. The House must  take emergency action to respond and pass emergency legislation.                                time  1530    Over the weekend, States across the country, including my home of  California, experienced the highest levels of infection since the  pandemic began.   On Sunday, Texas reported more than 5,000 cases for the sixth day in  a row. Shortly after passage of the HEROES Act in May, Texas had 1,791  COVID-19 patients in hospital beds; yesterday, there were 5,500.   In California, hospitalizations have now increased by 32 percent,  while ICUs have gone up 19 percent over the past 14 days.   These trends are similar in Arizona, Georgia, and Florida, and many  of these States are halting their plans to reopen the economy. On  Friday, Texas closed down bars across the State and on Saturday warned  residents in San Antonio and Bexar County that local hospitals were  approaching capacity.   Where exactly are COVID-19 patients expected to isolate when the  hospitals fill up? We are not through with this pandemic, and recent  trends suggest it is getting worse.   Six weeks ago, this Chamber passed the HEROES Act, but the  Republican-led Senate and Trump administration have done nothing to  advance the bill. This is totally unacceptable.   Fully one-third of renters were unable to pay their rent in June, and  at least 4.2 million homeowners are now in forbearance. And we know  evictions are already on the rise.   In North Carolina, 9,000 eviction cases have been filed since this  moratorium expired last week.   In Columbus, Ohio, eviction hearings are taking place in a convention  center to accommodate the number of cases and comply with social  distancing guidelines.   In Tennessee, more than 9,000 eviction cases are pending in one  county alone.   The Michigan State Court Administrative Office estimates 75,000  evictions will be filed when its moratorium ends this month.   I would like to share one story about someone this bill seeks to  help. Deanna Brooks, a Navy veteran from Dallas, Texas, lost her job  because of the pandemic. However, because her former employer was  unresponsive, she had trouble collecting the needed documentation to  collect unemployment or other assistance and was unable to pay rent, so  her landlord filed for her to be evicted.   She has no friends or family she can move in with and has been in and  out of the hospital because she has a heart condition. She said: ``I'm  scared. They'll throw everything I have outside on the street. I have  nowhere to go.''   In Delaware, Rhiannon Clark and her fiance were unable to pay their  rent after Clark, who was a bartender, lost her job and her fiance fell  ill with COVID-19 and couldn't go to work. Eventually, Clark and one of  her two children also came down with the illness. Now her family faces  eviction, even as they recover from COVID-19.   Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, rent and mortgages are due for millions of  families. These are two stories. They are sad stories. I fear that this  is going to be repeated a million times over if Congress fails to act.   And so here we are, Members of Congress. We are comfortable. We can  afford to pay our rent. We have millionaires in Congress. They can  afford to pay the rent of a whole lot of people if they wanted to. And  they are going to go home to their families. They are going to be safe,  and they are going to be secure. And while they are in Washington, they  don't pay any rent, many of them. They sleep in their offices at night.  And yet they are talking about denying people rent who don't have  another dime.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
