 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to be removed as  cosponsor of H.J. Res. 25.    Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor a talented young  lady from my district.   Bri Folds, a Lakeland Christian and Auburn grad, was drafted in the  fourth round of the 2020 National Woman's Soccer League draft by the  North Carolina Courage.   Ms. Folds is the first player from Polk County to be drafted by the  National Women's Soccer League. Folds was a two-time Lakeland Ledger  Player of the Year, with 173 goals and 155 assists while at Lakeland  Christian. She finished her college career ranked seventh all-time at  Auburn in assists, eighth in goals, and tied for fifth in game-winning  goals with nine.   I am extraordinarily proud of her dedication and drive. It is  important that our community continues to invest in future generations  to produce stars and leaders like Ms. Folds. Players like her will  influence young girls for years to come.   I encourage all of District 15 to join me in cheering on Bri Folds  when the 2020 NWSL season begins in March.                            ____________________
