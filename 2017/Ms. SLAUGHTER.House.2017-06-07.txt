 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I thank my colleague for yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago, I brought the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform  and Consumer Protection Act to the floor of the House as chairwoman of  the House Rules Committee. This law was a statement from Congress on  behalf of the American people that unchecked corporate greed will never  again bring the United States of America to financial collapse.   My colleague began his speech this morning by saying that this law  had not worked, but I am not aware of major bank failures or bank  failures of any kind since we passed it, and I would say, indeed, this  law has worked.   Since it has been enacted, our economy has had over 80 consecutive  months of private sector job growth. That is pretty good. In fact, it  is a record-setting streak. More than 16 million jobs have been  created, and business lending has been increased by 75 percent. I am  not getting all the complaints that I used to get that they could not  borrow money from banks, particularly the small businesses.   Along the way, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau established  under this law has helped 29 million people in all of our 50 States to  receive nearly $12 billion in relief from companies that engaged in  irresponsible or predatory practices.   One group that sent us a letter begging us not to do away with Dodd- Frank was the Veterans of Foreign Wars who said that far too often  their veterans were the victims of predatory lenders--shysters, people  not telling them the truth--and that is exactly what the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau was established to do.   You can't argue about whether or not it has been a success if 29  million people in 50 States have gotten back $12 billion in relief of  bad practices. But this legislation completely will do away with the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the only thing we have left to  protect Main Street and the small investors.   These gains weren't a coincidence, Mr. Speaker. They were the result  of the Dodd-Frank law. Gutting Wall Street reform will be a historic  giveaway to special interests.                                time  1315    The Wall Street firms who plunged our country to the brink, in 2008,  would be free once again to take advantage of consumers and force  middle class families to go it alone, without the protections this bill  has provided them.   The CHOICE Act is the wrong choice for consumers and families.  Instead of standing with financial lobbyists, I urge the majority to  uphold the trust of the people we all represent.   Five years ago, Democrats and Republicans came together to almost  unanimously pass my bill to end insider trading in Congress. The STOCK  Act passed this Chamber by a vote of 417-2, one of the most bipartisan  bills of that entire session of Congress.   It wasn't easy. I led a 6-year fight to get it signed into law after  learning that Members of Congress and their staffs were abusing their  positions by making money from the information that they gleaned and  that was not available to everybody else in America. They gleaned this  information while  [[Page H4666]]  working on behalf of the people whose information they were stealing.  It took a ``60 Minutes'' investigation on television and a groundswell  of public support, but the bill became a reality.   For me, upholding the people's trust is the most sacred  responsibility I have as a Member of Congress. That is why I am waging  a new battle to strengthen the STOCK Act, after learning that some in  this Congress have used legal loopholes to get around this law.   Once again, we see the importance of investigative journalism and a  free press, which has shined a light on the fact that some Members of  Congress have purchased private, discounted stock deals and taken a  part in initial public offerings outside of the United States. These  special deals are not available to the general public.   All this would have remained in the dark, had the STOCK Act not put  into place a new requirement to timely disclose sales and purchases of  stock. This is precisely the kind of outrageous conduct we intended to  outlaw under the STOCK Act. It plays directly into the public's most  cynical view of Congress.   This, Mr. Speaker, comes at a time when just 20 percent of the public  approves of how Congress is doing its job under the majority's  leadership. That is according to the latest figures from Gallup.   This Chamber put aside partisanship and took a strong, bipartisan  stand against this abhorrent behavior just a few years ago. It has  become increasingly clear that we need to act again today to hold  ourselves accountable to both the letter and the spirit of the STOCK  Act law.   We are not doing that today. Once again, we are taking away the  regulations because some people find them so terribly abhorrent, but  they protect the small investor and the people in the banks. We surely  will never, I hope, see the day where we will ask the taxpayers of the  United States to bail out the enormously rich, big banks. One of the  worst things of that whole era was not a single fraudulent banker went  to jail.   Just 535 of us in a country of more than 300 million people have been  chosen to serve on the American people's behalf in Congress. It is a  sacred responsibility, one we should not be squandering, doing the  bidding of the financial lobbyists or Wall Street firms, who are the  ones behind the CHOICE Act.   The majority should stop fulfilling the wish list of Wall Street and  act on behalf of millions of Americans outraged by insider trading and  other chicanery that still permeates the halls of Congress today. This  Chamber must take action so that Americans recognize we came here to  represent them, not enrich ourselves.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) the distinguished ranking member of  the Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and  Investments.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership and for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 10, the  ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act.   This bill will take us back to the regulatory stone age and would be  a disaster for the entire financial system.   Let us remember why we passed Dodd-Frank: we confronted the worst  financial crisis, caused by mismanagement from the financial industry,  that cost this country $18 trillion in household wealth, millions lost  their homes, millions lost their jobs, and the suffering was deep and  strong.   First, this bill, the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act, would repeal the orderly  liquidation authority, which is the only tool that would allow large  financial institutions like Lehman Brothers or AIG to be wound down  safely, without requiring a taxpayer bailout or causing a financial  panic, like Lehman.   We had two choices in the crisis: either bail them out--a bad  choice--or let them fail--another bad choice.   The liquidation authority is helpful, yet the majority claims that  the liquidation authority codifies taxpayer bailouts. Nothing could be  further from the truth. Under the liquidation authority, the FDIC wipes  out the firm's shareholders, imposes losses on the firm's creditors,  fires the firm's management, and completely liquidates the entire firm.  The only people who are guaranteed not to suffer losses are the  taxpayers.   So if we wipe out this protection to the taxpayers, we are putting  the taxpayers in harm's way yet again.                                time  1330    This bill would also devastate investors by rolling back decades of  investor protections and trampling on the property rights of  shareholders by making it virtually impossible for them to influence  the management of the companies that they own.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Palmer). The time of the gentlewoman has  expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Finally, the bill would  completely gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has been  an incredible, effective watchdog for consumers and has protected the  consumers who were often not thought about first of all or second of  all--or not thought about at all. This agency protects them. If we  would have had it, we would not have had the financial crisis we  suffered. This would just make it easier for banks like Wells Fargo to  rip off consumers and would protect them from being punished if they  are caught.   So I want to point out that the Republican ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act puts  Wall Street ahead of Main Street, leads to taxpayer bailouts for big  banks, guts consumer protections for seniors and their families, and  brings back risky practices that caused the 2008 financial crisis. It  is the wrong direction, it is a wrong vote, and I caution my friends on  the other side of the aisle the voters are going to remember this vote.  Don't turn us back to the Stone Age of regulation.   I urge a very strong ``no'' vote on this wrongly directed ``Bad''  CHOICE Act.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of my colleague if he has  further speakers?    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   With each passing day, we learn more about the tangled web of  conflicts of interest and links to Russia and the Trump administration.  Just last week we learned that President Trump's son-in-law, Jared  Kushner, attempted to establish a back channel of communications with  Russia and the Trump transition team before they were even inaugurated.   Tomorrow, former FBI Director James Comey will likely testify that  President Trump attempted to influence the FBI's investigation into  possible collusion between his campaign and the Russian Government.   Who knows what further ties to Russia we will uncover from his  testimony.   Without President Trump's tax returns, we simply have no way of  knowing if he himself has financial ties to Russia, as news reports  have suggested. The American people deserve to know whether or not our  President has any business dealings with Russia or other foreign  governments. It is imperative that we prevent the White House from  becoming another arm of the Trump organization.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Eshoo's bill, H.R.  305, which would require Presidents and major party nominees for the  Presidency to release their tax returns.   If the President has nothing to hide, including financial interests  or business dealings with Russia, then he should freely release his tax  returns to reassure the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the  text of my amendment, along with extraneous material, immediately prior  to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, let me remind the majority why we enacted  the Wall Street reform in the first place.  [[Page H4670]]    Our country was plunged into the worst recession since the Great  Depression after big Wall Street firms played Russian roulette with our  future for years. During the 2008 financial crash, more than 8 million  Americans lost their jobs, $13 trillion in wealth vanished overnight,  and 11 million homes were lost.   After years of excesses and dodging regulation, the financial firms  were finally brought under control by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform  and Consumer Protection Act. The perverse notion of too big to fail was  finally ended, and the financial playing field was tilted back toward  consumers.   We have all seen the results of the law in the form of record-setting  private sector job growth, millions of new jobs, and historic rates of  business lending. It is beyond me why anyone in the world would want to  repeal this law and threaten this progress. Instead of doing the  bidding of the financial lobbyists who don't really care for the law,  we should be acting to uphold the trust of the people who sent us here.   This begins with passing the End Congressional Stock Market Abuse Act  to bring an end to the egregious use of exclusive stock deals and  foreign initial public offerings by Members of Congress.   The American people must be able to trust what we are doing here and  trust that it is right for them without concern that we are using our  position to enrich ourselves.   My bill would enhance the STOCK Act, which passed the Chamber  virtually unanimously--two ``no'' votes--in 2012, with provisions that  I think we could all agree on: no exclusive stock deals for Members of  Congress, no initial public offerings, regardless of where they are  offered.   Mr. Speaker, that is what we should be focusing on today, not  dismantling a law that has brought financial security to millions of  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule, to oppose the  underlying legislation, the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
