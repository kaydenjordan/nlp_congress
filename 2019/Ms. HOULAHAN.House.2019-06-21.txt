 Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise today in support of my amendment which would increase the  Veterans Health Administration Medical Services account by $1.7 million  in order to increase the minimum amount that must be spent on gender- specific care for women at the VA with the appropriate offset.   Women represent the fastest growing cohort in our Nation's military,  and in the past 4 years, the number of women veterans using VHA  services has increased by 22 percent. Yet, we are not providing the VA  with the resources it needs to provide quality care for women.   For example, in my community of Coatesville, the VA does not have a  full-time OB-GYN. Women veterans in my community must wait until 1 of  the only 2 days a month that an OB-GYN visits the VA or find their way  to distant Philadelphia for an appointment.   This lack of available gender-specific care is in no way unique to my  community. It is widespread across our country's VA centers. Our women  who have served deserve better from us, and this amendment helps ensure  that we are specifically addressing the unique healthcare needs of  these courageous women.
