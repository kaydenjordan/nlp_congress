 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 3935, the Securing Growth and  Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act, introduced by T&I Committee  Chair Graves, Aviation Subcommittee Chair Graves, Ranking Member Cohen,  and myself.   I extend my thanks to the chairman of the full committee, Sam Graves  of Missouri, and the Subcommittee Chair Garret Graves of Louisiana, for  their commitment to a bipartisan effort done in good faith to get this  bill done that protects the flying public and secures the future of the  U.S. aviation system.   In my home State of Washington, the aviation sector is a powerful  economic engine that creates good-paying jobs and supports local  communities in the Pacific Northwest.   This bill delivers for my constituents as well as for all Americans  across the country. It advances American leadership in aviation safety  and innovation, strengthens and diversifies our aviation workforce,  expands consumer protections and accessibility, and fosters  environmental sustainability in aviation.                                time  1245    Although the U.S. aviation system is the safest in the world, the  last few years have shown there is still work to do. The rise in runway  near misses at some U.S. airports expose a vulnerability for the flying  public. This reauthorization will help prevent these events by  expanding ground surveillance and detection capabilities to all large  and medium hub U.S. airports.   Further, unruly passengers continue to pose a threat to flight crews  and other frontline workers. This bill better protects workers by  creating a task force on preventing assaults against airline personnel  and enforcing a requirement that airlines establish employee assault  and response plans.   Recent flight cancellations and delays have shaken the confidence of  passengers in the U.S. aviation system. To get us back on the right  course, this reauthorization requires airlines to create resiliency  plans to address mass flight disruptions. It also takes steps to make  passengers whole by requiring airlines to develop policies to cover  food and hotel expenses due to flight disruptions.  [[Page H3709]]    The bill also supports the administration's push for family seating  by requiring airlines to establish policies allowing passengers to sit  next to their young children if adjacent seats are available.   For too long, passengers with disabilities have experienced  inexcusable barriers in air travel from challenges with boarding the  aircraft and inaccessible onboard lavatories, to damaged and mishandled  wheelchairs and mobility aids.   This bill paves the way for safer and more dignified air travel for  this particular community by directing the DOT to create a roadmap for  airlines to reduce damage to mobility aids and to improve training for  airline personnel and contractors on assisting passengers with  disabilities.   Climate change is a growing threat to millions of Americans and the  infrastructure we rely on. This bill makes groundbreaking investments  in sustainability, increasing Federal funding for the Airport  Improvement Program from $3.35 billion to $4 billion and dedicating a  minimum of $150 million to airport environmental and noise programs.   It also allows U.S. airports to use these funds for alternative fuel  infrastructure and environmental resiliency projects and works to  mitigate the impacts of aviation noise on local communities.   It directs the FAA to review and revise Federal aviation noise  standards and to seek feedback from neighboring communities as well.  Furthermore, the bill requires the FAA to take certain actions to  reduce undesirable aircraft noise when implementing or revising a  flight procedure. These actions build the foundation for a cleaner  future for our aviation ecosystem.   To secure American leadership in aerospace innovation, we must  provide a clear and predictable framework for emerging industries to  scale safely while ensuring the needs of communities are addressed.   From drones to electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft, advanced  aviation technologies have clear economic and societal benefits.   In Washington State, drones will soon be used to deliver critical  medical supplies in the Tacoma area, helping to reduce barriers to care  for patients. This reauthorization also requires the FAA to issue  proposed rules for drones to safely scale in this country, providing  regulatory certainty to a growing sector, ensuring their safe  integration into our skies, and creating U.S. jobs.   It will also help State, local, and Tribal governments acquire drones  for infrastructure inspection and repair to help workers do their jobs  more safely. It also extends a program that I championed to fund State  and community efforts to plan for a future with advanced air mobility  operations and infrastructure.   Our talented and dedicated U.S. workforce is the backbone of American  aviation and makes the Nation's leadership in aviation safety and  innovation possible.   This reauthorization is a jobs bill. It helps build the economy from  the middle out and bottom up and diversifies the aviation workforce,  recognizing how critical that effort is to our Nation's long-term  economic success.   It makes robust investments in the FAA's aviation workforce  development program to upskill the next generation of pilots,  maintenance technicians, manufacturing workers, and other critical  professions.   This will help local businesses, like Aviation Technical Services in  Everett, Washington, to expand their apprenticeship and training  programs and compete in the rapidly evolving global aviation sector.   The bill also creates the Willa Brown Aviation Education Program and  establishes a National Center for the Advancement of Aerospace to  support and promote aviation workforce development opportunities for  everyone.   Crucially, it requires the FAA to hire the maximum number of air  traffic controllers, as well as to adopt the most appropriate  controller staffing model to meet growing airspace needs.   I will spend my final bit of comments on the Disadvantaged Business  Enterprise program. This bill also reaffirms and strengthens the U.S.  Department of Transportation's DBE program. As we increase investment  under this bill and dedicate Federal dollars to airport projects, it is  imperative that we ensure the process of awarding Federal  transportation contract dollars allows for full participation on a  level playing field by minority-owned and women-owned businesses.   The committee has accumulated evidence attesting to systemic  discrimination that women and minorities face in attempts to establish,  grow, and operate construction businesses, including those seeking  contracts for airport construction projects and airport concessions  across the country.   This evidence includes testimony at a hearing titled: ``Driving  Equity: The U.S. Department of Transportation's Disadvantaged Business  Enterprise Program'' held on September 23, 2020, since the passage  of the last bill.    We have received and reviewed disparity studies, testimony, and other  evidence, including statistical analyses containing numerous disparity  studies conducted since 2018, the Department of Justice ``Report on  Lawful Uses of Race or Sex in Federal Contracting Programs,'' and the  DOT's own report on DBE goal attainment. These studies and reports  continue to demonstrate that race- and gender-neutral efforts alone are  insufficient to address the problem.   The evidence demonstrates that discrimination across the U.S. poses  an injurious and enduring barrier to full and fair participation in  airport-related businesses of women businessowners and minority  businessowners and has negatively affected firm formation, development  and success in many aspects of airport-related businesses in public and  private markets.   The evidence provides a clear picture of the inequality caused by  this discrimination that continues to plague our Nation and a strong  basis that there is a compelling need for the continuation of the  Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program to address race and gender  discrimination in airport-related businesses.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record 65 studies and reports spanning  communities in 25 States showing significant disparity between the use  of DBE and non-DBE subcontractors. The full text of each report is held  on file electronically with the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure.                              [July 19, 2023]         Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record evidence received by       the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on the       compelling need for the continuation of the Disadvantaged       Business Enterprise (DBE) program.        This statistical evidence includes 64 disparity studies       conducted in 25 states since 2018, showing significant       disparities between the use of DBE and non-DBE subcontractors       in publicly financed, airport-related construction and       concession contracting and in publicly financed, non-airport       construction contracting that involves many of the same types       of subcontracting opportunities available on airport       projects.        The submission also includes reports prepared for and by       the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Department       of Commerce, including a report analyzing over 200 disparity       studies produced by state and local government agencies       between 2010 and 2021 and other evidence related to       disparities faced by minority business enterprises in public       and private contracting markets; and DOJ's 2022 survey of       evidence documenting the compelling interest to remedy the       effects of discrimination in government contracting.        This evidence demonstrates a strong basis that there is a       compelling need for the continuation of the Disadvantaged       Business Enterprise and Airport Concession Disadvantaged       Business Enterprise programs to address race and gender       discrimination in airport-related business.        The full text of each study and report is held on file       electronically with the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure.

The Securing Growth and Robust Leadership  in American Aviation Act is a long-term, comprehensive, and bipartisan  reauthorization that cements a safer, cleaner, greener, more innovative  and accessible future for the U.S. aviation system.   I will end my opening comments by again thanking Chair Sam Graves and  Subcommittee Chair Garret Graves for making sure that they are reaching  out to the Democratic side of the aisle to ensure that we could have a  bipartisan and collaborative bill put together. I thank Subcommittee  Ranking Member Cohen for his leadership as ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Aviation, and for all of the staff for their hard work,  as well.   Particularly, I thank the minority staff of the Subcommittee on  Aviation: staff director, Brian Bell; professional staff, Alex Menardy;  counsel, Adam Weiss; and our FAA detailee, Liz Forro, for the hard work  and the countless hours they have spent crafting this legislation with  their majority counterparts.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stanton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Auchincloss).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Hoyle.)    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Sykes).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Scholten).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Sorensen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of  my time for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Chair, I will conclude by saying that we encourage Members to  support this. This is a bipartisan bill negotiated in good faith. It is  a very substantial bill, and I think it is a product that we can  certainly be proud of to move forward on.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment, although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chair, this amendment reflects bipartisan agreement on a variety  of technical fixes and good policy worthy of inclusion in this bill.   It includes language from Representative Schrier of Washington State  to focus FAA's aviation workforce development efforts on transitioning  veterans to the civilian workforce, an amendment that the committee  worked together on with Representative Gooden to make happen.   It requires the FAA to develop a process to restrict drones from  flying over large outdoor gatherings. It clears unnecessary red tape  for the FAA to issue airport improvement grants and ensures our air  traffic controllers are consulted on major policy changes, protects  information or data reported by pilots or engineers through voluntary  safety reporting requirements, and includes language from  Representative Stanton of Arizona to require the Secretary of  Transportation to propose a rulemaking to improve seating  accommodations for individuals with disabilities.   Finally, it expands FAA's counter-UAS testing authorities to consider  the impacts to the safety of the National Airspace System beyond the  airport environment.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to vote in favor of this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this en  bloc.   It includes a number of provisions that will improve the bill  overall, including:   A proposal from Representative Brown of Ohio to ensure passengers on  air carriers and foreign air carriers have the right to free drinking  water on any flight longer than an hour;   A proposal from Representatives Carbajal, Yakym, and Davids directing  the FAA to test the use of mobile technologies to deliver air traffic  control clearances to general aviation pilots and part 135 operators;   A proposal from Representatives Ciscomani and Stanton to prioritize  air traffic control staffing at towers with strategic traffic and  safety considerations;   A proposal from Representative DelBene to expand the FAA's Center of  Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuels and Environment to conduct  research on hydrogen, supporting increasing efforts to decarbonize the  aviation sector;   A proposal from Representative DeSaulnier to create a task force on  human factors safety to harmonize disparate human factors work being  done currently across the aviation community;   A proposal from Representative Donalds encouraging the FAA to embrace  the use of drones for helping workers to conduct safer, more efficient  infrastructure inspections; and   A proposal from Representative Eshoo to ensure community voices are  heard on aircraft noise issues.   Mr. Chair, I support this en bloc, and I encourage my colleagues to  do the same.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no other speakers on the  en bloc, so I will close by asking Members to please support the  amendment. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this en  bloc. It includes several provisions that will improve the bill  overall, including amendments from Representatives Lee, Hoyle,  Gottheimer, Lynch, and others.   I support this en bloc and encourage my colleagues to do the same. I  have no other speakers on amendments en bloc No. 2, so I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this en  bloc. It includes several amendments that strengthen the bill,  including:   A proposal from Representative Magaziner to ensure AIP funding can be  used for cybersecurity projects;   An amendment from Representatives Meng, Norton, Johnson, Nadler, and  Raskin to ensure overflight community feedback is considered as the FAA  updates its aircraft noise policies;   A proposal from Representative Neguse of Colorado to ensure the FAA  directly interviews residents from communities impacted by aircraft  noise as part of its community engagement efforts;   Several proposals from Representative Pettersen of Colorado to  address community noise concerns, in-flight emergency medical kits, and  pilot mental health;   A bipartisan proposal from Representatives Porter and Westerman to  audit and improve the FAA's responsiveness to congressional requests--I  just can't imagine who couldn't support that; and   A proposal from Representative Pressley to study transit access to  airports.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support en bloc No. 3, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1400     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would create an  apprenticeship program for individuals seeking to become commercial  pilots.   I do want to say I am very pleased to be able to support many of  Representative Donalds' amendments to the bill, working in a bipartisan  manner.   This one I just couldn't come to a place where I am comfortable, but  certainly as a long-time supporter of aviation and STEM-related  apprenticeships, I do appreciate the intent of Representative Donalds'  amendment. However, it is duplicative of several provisions in the  underlying bill that already bolster the pilot pipeline.   This authorization already triples the funding for FAA's Aviation  Workforce Development Grant programs, which funds aviation  apprenticeship programs. It creates the Willa Brown Aviation Education  Program, which could fund apprenticeship programs focused on  underrepresented communities and creates a National Center for the  Advancement of Aerospace, an independently, federally chartered  nonprofit entity to administer grants to establish apprenticeships for  aviation careers and serve as a centralized resource to provide  comprehensive information on aviation apprenticeship opportunities.   I earlier adopted an amendment in the en bloc amendment that was  sponsored by Representatives Schrier and Gooden to help veterans  transition into the commercial pilot world. Apprenticeships are already  well covered in this underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the gentleman's amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to oppose  this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment because  it would create an exemption for nonhub airports from the requirement  to have at least one individual who maintains certification as an  emergency medical technician, or EMT, during carrier operations.   This amendment poses a safety risk that would be detrimental to  passengers. Unlike what the proponent said about the Federal Government  imposing an employment requirement on an airport, this is actually a  single safety standard that applies to all airports, that there be a  certified emergency technician to respond to emergencies at all  airports.   It is, indeed, a national standard, but one done for safety,  especially in support of passenger carrying air carrier operations.   In the event of a medical emergency that occurs at the airport or on  a flight, passengers and airport workers should receive care as quickly  as possible regardless of where they are flying to. Having an EMT  available at the airport could mean the difference between life and  death in the event of an emergency.   All passengers should be reassured that even if they are traveling  out of or through a nonhub airport, they have the same safety  precautions at that airport as they do at all airports in the United  States.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as a Member of Congress who  represents several small rural airports, including ones that are  isolated on islands, I appreciate the argument that the gentleman from  Iowa has been making. Yet, given the fact that I have a district with  some of the same circumstances, even airports that are isolated on  islands, I still believe that there needs to be EMTs available in the  event of emergencies at these nonhub airports. I want one safety  standard for the country, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment, though I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the FAA recently issued a final  rule on requiring secondary barriers to protect the flight deck in  newly manufactured aircraft. The underlying text of this bill creates a  rulemaking committee to consider how to apply this requirement to  existing aircraft, and this amendment adds a rulemaking requirement to  that text.   Secondary barriers are a critical tool to keeping our pilots and  flight decks safe and secure in the event of a horrible, horrible  intrusion.   Mr. Chair, therefore, I rise to support this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition  to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment requires the FAA  to consider the economic viability of commercial air tours over  national parks.   In 2022, the National Park Service recorded 312 million recreational  visits to our national parks. This number reflects the overwhelming  significance our parks have to the American public. They serve as a  place of recreation, a place used to teach new generations about  conservation and wildlife, and a place to admire the beauty of our  great outdoors in the U.S.   National park air tour management plans are in place to help protect  the sanctity of our parks from incessant helicopter overflights, which  can disrupt both the wildlife and the natural beauty of the parks  visitors enjoy.   Mr. Chair, I urge everyone to protect our parks from the noise and  disturbance of increased helicopter tours by voting ``no'' on this  amendment.   This amendment would require air tour management plans to consider  profits in the development of those plans, which would undoubtedly  increase the number of helicopters flying above our parks. This runs  contrary to the original purpose of these management plans, which is to  protect the integrity of the parks.   Helicopter tours are an incredible way to see national parks for the  privileged few, but they simultaneously degrade the park experience for  the vast majority of other park visitors.   Our national parks were created as a public good, to preserve our  natural wonders for all Americans to enjoy. We must not erode that in  favor of tour profits and those who can afford to pay.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, before I yield to my good  friend, Representative Case from Hawaii, I would note that he is a  great American, and I do think that the debates here on the floor of  the House are a reflection of being great Americans as opposed to being  un-American.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case).    Mr. Chair, there has been a good debate on  this bill. Clearly, there is a difference of opinion, and clearly,  there are experiences where helicopters and helicopter tours do disrupt  the wildlife, other visitors, and the people around national parks.   Mr. Chair, I ask all the Americans in this body to vote ``no'' on  this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would require the  DOT inspector general to investigate the FAA's decision to increase the  electrocardiogram, or EKG, range that is permissible for pilots.   This amendment follows a change made by the agency last October to  increase the allowable range of an EKG result from 200 to 300  milliseconds without requiring further documentation from the pilot.   The FAA's change in the allowable EKG result range was based on  scientific data from cardiovascular experts documented in the public  domain. Such data shows that an EKG result under 300 milliseconds  indicates that the pilot has no real risk of sudden heart failure if  there are no other medical issues.   Medical standards and recommendations have always evolved over time  as medicine becomes more advanced and health professionals learn new  information. The FAA should take advantage of the latest guidance from  medical experts to ensure these guidelines for pilots are as safe as  possible.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, in closing, I will say that the  FAA's action, despite some claims, was not taken in response to any  change in pilot medical conditions or heart health due to having  received the COVID vaccine. That has been a claim in less scientific  circles. This decision was made based on science, using the experts,  using science, and using data.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to  the amendment.   The Acting Chair. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would direct the  FAA Administrator to require air carriers, airlines and others, to  reinstate pilots that may have lost their jobs because of noncompliance  with a COVID-19 vaccine mandate.   The FAA cannot direct air carriers on hiring decisions like this. It  cannot require air carriers to hire specific individuals. This  amendment simply is not implementable.   Is that where we are going with this bill, to let the FAA make hiring  and firing decisions for these private aviation companies?   Furthermore, this amendment revives an unnecessary debate on COVID-19  vaccine mandates, one that we had 3 years ago. This is an unwelcome  distraction from this very substantive reauthorization discussion on  this bill that will enhance safety and the aviation workforce.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the FAA does not really have a  role to play in telling air carriers to hire the folks back. It is not  an amendment that is implementable. I am a little flummoxed by it  myself. However, I encourage my colleagues to vote against this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim time in  opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I am happy this amendment is  coming up because I hope the gentleman from Michigan will vote against  a further amendment that may come up later tonight that will get rid of  this program altogether, this vertiport infrastructure grant program.   Mr. Chair, I am glad he likes it enough to add to it, and I hope  others feel that way, too, so we can protect the basis of this program.  I know all about it because I wrote the bill to actually create this  program in the first place. It was done with a very specific purpose in  mind, and the gentleman noted the criteria involved--to help State,  local, and Tribal governments be part of the advanced air mobility  future. We were very clear about that.   Another thing we were very clear about when we wrote that bill and  got it into law was to ensure that it was as neutral as possible when  it came to any number of the advanced air mobility companies that were  seeking to develop and get certified by the FAA and operate within the  United States.   Prioritizing the grants awarded under the AAM infrastructure program  to entities that collaborate with the Department of Defense or the  National Guard would actually put a thumb on the scale for the three  companies that are actually involved with this effort with the DOD.   There are many other AAM companies that are not involved with the  DOD, and this would put these companies sort of at a head start over  these others.   Since its inception in 2019, as a for instance, the U.S. Air Force's  Agility Prime program has focused on the potential defense applications  of eVTOL aircraft, or electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft,  and what we call on the commercial side of things, AAM.   Through Agility Prime, the DOD partners with these industry leaders  and key stakeholders to examine the airworthiness and military uses for  AAM aircraft and necessary infrastructure to support strategic cargo  and personnel transport. In fact, that program within the DOD has  awarded over 20 contracts, totaling more than $100 million, to very  innovative aviation companies to further develop their advanced  aircraft as they work toward civil certifications and commercial  operations, but doing that with the help of the Department of Defense.   Mr. Chair, I support fostering this U.S. innovation, but this  amendment would prioritize the funding through the AAM Infrastructure  Pilot program, which funds State and local government planning efforts  for future civil AAM infrastructure and operations, to efforts that are  being addressed under Agility Prime.   There is a place to do this. It is called DOD's military construction  budget. We just passed an authorization of nearly $886 billion last  week out of the House of Representatives. Surely, there are a few  dollars in that budget for the DOD to use to improve the taxiways and  the aprons at these joint sites that the National Guard and the Air  Force use with civilian airports rather than go after the really fairly  small amounts that are available in these transportation planning  grants that we were able to get through the AAM infrastructure planning  grant.                                time  1500    I would just tell folks there is a place for these companies to go.  It should not be these planning grants. It should be the DOD  construction budget.   Besides, if we do that, it will give these particular companies a  head start over many other companies, and, frankly, in fact, the cities  and counties [that are trying to access these grants already.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, is it my time or his time he  is going to use?    Mr. Chairman, I understand I have the right  to close on this argument, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, to close, I assure the gentleman  that, first, I am 100 percent sure that his amendment will dilute the  original grant program. I am 100 percent sure there are other ways to  finance this, especially through a very large MilCon budget that passed  as part of the defense bill. And I am 100 percent sure that I am  correct in opposing this amendment having been the author of the  original bill to establish the AAM Infrastructure Act.   Mr. Chair, I ask Members to oppose this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, on the committee, the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, we like to pride ourselves  on being boring. We like to let folks know if they want excitement in  Congress, there are other committees to attend or go to. The T&I  Committee is not one of those. We like to think that we are focused on  the transportation and infrastructure of the United States and on the  things that we need to do to ensure its safety and building it out.   I am confused by this amendment, that it exists at all, because what  the amendment is doing is taking out a word, ``social,'' that the  proponent is defining as something that is not in any way defined by  the committee in the way he is defining it.   Think about what we are talking about when we talk about the BEYOND  program and what we would like to do beyond just looking at economic  factors of drones. We want to look at how medical supplies can be  delivered to rural areas. That is not an economic factor to look at.  That is a social factor to look at, the ability to get healthcare to  rural areas. The ability to assist law enforcement with things like  search and rescue, that is not an economic factor. It is a social  factor to ensure safer communities.   Assisting wildfire responders as they fight wildfires, that is not an  economic factor. That is a social issue to protect wildfire responders  as well as the communities that are impacted by wildfires.   I am just really confused. If this amendment had been in our  committee and had been discussed, we would have never brought this up  because it just doesn't live between our ears on the committee--this  debate about the problem that people have with social factors. We would  have realized these social factors are really about the things that I  am talking about here, like how do we use the BEYOND program to ensure  that we can use drones or uncrewed aerial systems, unmanned aerial  systems, in order to provide factors that are beyond just the economic  factors, how do they help the economy grow? They have uses beyond just  helping the economy grow. The BEYOND program should be used to help us  look at those issues.  [[Page H3832]]    I would just ask folks to please let us do a bill that is actually  trying to move aviation forward instead of bogging us down in some of  these debates that frankly are better left, perhaps, in other  committees but not in the T&I Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).                                time  1645     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I  have remaining.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time to close.   Mr. Chair, this is not only an issue that evokes passion among  Members, it is also very bipartisan. It is going to be bipartisan in  opposition and bipartisan in support.   We expected that on the committee, which is why we had asked for the  Rules Committee to put something in order on the floor so we could have  this debate and let the will of the House take its course.   I would just note, though, in my informal survey of Members on my  side of the aisle, the seven slot pairs have been committed only 36  times already.   The point is: There is a lot of overpromising taking place about  which cities are going to be served by this deal.   The problem with that is that one is too many and 100 is not enough,  but the supply of runway at DCA is so small that it can't handle what  it is taking now much less what increased demand will bring to it.   Mr. Chair, it is a difficult issue. Members are going to be voting  for and against on both sides, and I look forward to that vote.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would strike the  requirement that the FAA administrator consider expanding the CLEEN  Program, which stands for continuous lower energy, emission, and noise  program, to new entrants.   Now, I want to be clear. It doesn't necessarily mean new technologies  or different kinds of technologies as much as it can also mean new  companies that are looking to do the same thing but do it better. To  ensure that the FAA administrator is not continually approving grants  to existing companies that are already in the program who may not be  succeeding, we want to be sure the FAA administrator is looking beyond  the current slate of companies that are applying.   In addition to that, of course, there are new entrants in the  airspace. There is more projected use of even electronic aircraft. In  the future, hydrogen is being looked at as a fuel for aviation--not  tomorrow and maybe not in 5 years, but certainly within the next 10 to  15 years.   Doing some of the early work in this field is very important, so the  FAA administrator needs the authority and the freedom to do just that.   This amendment is pulling back on some of the innovation that we,  frankly, can only look to the government to do, so that it builds a  foundation for the private sector to build upon and sometimes in this  industry to take off as well.   Mr. Chair, so I would ask Members to oppose this amendment. Let the  administrator continue to administer the CLEEN Program but send a clear  message that they need to be looking beyond the regular sort of  entrants that they are getting into this program and look to the future  of aviation when they look at the CLEEN Program.  [[Page H3836]]    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, there is a race on. There is a  race on aviation, a race to implement and use new fuels that are more  efficient and that are also cleaner. There is a race on, and other  countries and regions of the world are investing in that race, putting  their companies at a competitive advantage over the U.S.-based  companies. The CLEEN Program is one of our tools to participate in that  race.   The CLEEN Program also helps us invest in fuel efficiency. The fuel  efficiency of aviation has helped reduce aviation fuel burn in this  country.   There is a direct relationship between the goodness of the taxpayer  investment in the CLEEN Program to the new fuel-efficient airplanes  that we see being used today and the fuel-efficient engines that we see  being used today.   The next version of that, the next step of that race is sustainable  aviation fuel. It is in electric propulsion, and in the future it is  hydrogen propulsion. There is quite a bit of private-sector investment  going on in the use of hydrogen as a fuel to move things, including  airplanes.   Now, we are not quite there yet in this country in the private  sector, but no one else is either. I want to win that race, and part of  winning that race is ensuring that the Federal Government is a partner  in winning that race. Winning that race in aviation is ensuring that  FAA has tools like CLEEN to be sure that it is a partner with airlines,  with entrepreneurs, and with innovators who want us to participate in  this race.   Mr. Chair, I ask Members to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Chairman, if going to the Moon in 1969  was viable at all, the private sector would have done it. It didn't. We  did it. America did it, and America did it with investment.   I am not making a wild claim like going to the Moon is exactly this  kind of race that we are faced with, but there is a clear role for the  Federal Government to play in a partnership with innovators and  entrepreneurs to ensure that the next generation of innovation and  aviation happens in the United States and not elsewhere.   I ask folks to support the CLEEN program, to not limit its use, and  to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
