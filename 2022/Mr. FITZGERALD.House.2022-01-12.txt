 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be here today to offer  this MTR.   If we adopt the motion to recommit, we will instruct the House  Committee on Veterans' Affairs to consider an amendment to H.R. 1836  which ensures members of the Armed Forces granted a general discharge  under honorable conditions solely for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine are  eligible for the GI Bill education benefits of which the Speaker just  spoke about.   Mr. Speaker, I therefore ask unanimous consent to include the text of  the amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion  to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, on August 24, 2021, the Secretary of  Defense issued a directive requiring mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for  all servicemembers, including those in the Ready Reserve and the  National Guard. Despite the challenges this vaccine mandate currently  faces in the Supreme Court, the Defense Department has proceeded to  discharge those who refuse the vaccine.    Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and guardians have  already been discharged, and as many as 20,000 servicemembers remain at  risk over being involuntarily removed from service. It is outrageous.   To prevent those who have refused the vaccine from being dishonorably  discharged, Congress included a provision in the fiscal year 2022  National Defense Authorization Act limiting discharges for failure to  receive the COVID-19 vaccine to either an honorable discharge or a  general discharge under honorable conditions.   This change succeeded in stopping further disciplinary action or  court-martial for those who refuse the vaccine, however it potentially  leaves many veterans in limbo between leaving the service with full  benefits or having their education benefits stripped as they walk out  the door.   As many of my veteran colleagues in this Chamber know, those  servicemembers who receive a general discharge under honorable  conditions are ineligible for the Montgomery and Post-9/11 GI Bill  benefits due to restrictions Congress implemented in 2011.   While this change was intended to open eligibility status to members  of the National Guard, there will now be a group of veterans who have  served honorably up until the point of refusing COVID-19 vaccine who  will now have their education benefits completely wiped out.   For those who may not know the full breadth of education benefits  entitled to a veteran, let me give you just a couple of items. A  veteran who was served at least 36 months on Active Duty is entitled to  100 percent of Post-9/11 GI benefits. That includes full tuition  coverage for public schools, or roughly $26,000 annually for private  education or apprenticeships.    That veteran also receives a monthly housing  allowance which varies by location, plus $1,000 annually to cover books  and other school supplies. Add that up, and we are talking about well  over $100,000 worth of education benefits a veteran loses simply by  having their discharge characterized as general under honorable.                                time  1345    And let's be clear on who this is truly affecting, Mr. Speaker. We  are not talking about recruits who are fresh out of basic training or  those discharged at the MEPS station. These are men and women who have  done their time, who have paid their dues, and who have served with  distinction up until the point of refusing this vaccine.   And now we are going to tell them that we don't care how spotless  their record may have been beforehand because they made a moral,  ethical and even religious objection to a vaccine?   Those who have fought to defend our country should not be deprived of  the benefits they so rightly deserve simply for refusing to comply with  this divisive, and potentially unlawful, vaccine mandate.   My motion to recommit corrects this disparity by ensuring any member  of the armed services who receives a general discharge under honorable  conditions solely for the refusal of the COVID-19 vaccine is entitled  to education benefits.   We are a country that rewards our heroes, not punishes them, and this  motion to recommit makes sure of that. I urge the adoption of this  motion to recommit.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the  desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
