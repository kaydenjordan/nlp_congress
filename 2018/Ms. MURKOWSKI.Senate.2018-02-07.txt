 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                      Remembering George and Peggy Brown     Mr. President, every community has one--the iconic  American diner. Its definition, as has been officially outlined, is ``a  friendly place, usually mom-and-pop with a sole proprietor, that serves  basic, home-cooked, fresh food, for a good value.'' This is sort of an  official definition that was coined by a gentleman named Richard  Gutman, who is regarded as the curator and expert on all things diner.   In 1955, 4 years before Alaska won statehood, our very own iconic  American diner opened in Anchorage. It was called the Lucky Wishbone.  It was a friendly place. It featured pan-fried chicken, real  cheeseburgers, great milkshakes, by the way, and French fries that had  been cut from potatoes just that morning. Fitting squarely within  Gutman's definition, it was a mom-and-pop. Mom was Peggy Brown. Peggy  passed away in 2011 at the age of 87 after a long struggle with  Parkinson's disease. Pop was George Brown, who passed away on January  13 at the age of 96.   This is the story of two extraordinary individuals who helped build  our community and helped build our State in remarkable and very humble  ways.   George, along with his partner at the time, Sven Jonasson, built the  restaurant with their own hands. Sven exited shortly thereafter, and  Peggy became George's business partner, as well as his life partner.  She did the books. She greeted the guests. She was involved in every  aspect of the enterprise.   In 2002, the Lucky Wishbone was named Alaska's Small Business of the  Year. When you think about it, there is nothing more homegrown, nothing  more truly small business and entrepreneurial than that small diner  everybody calls home. Peggy flew back to Washington, DC, to receive the  award in 2002. She was introduced at the time to President George W.  Bush by Senator Stevens. Senator Stevens told the President: ``This  lady makes some of the best fried chicken in the country.'' You  wouldn't think that coming from Alaska, but I can testify from personal  knowledge that that is a fact.   The Lucky Wishbone, I expect, will continue on. It is a successful  business with a large following. But with the passing of Peggy and now  George, it marks the end of an era for us in Alaska. We have lost two  beloved pioneers who were dear friends to so many of us, and I am proud  to count myself among that group. It is important that we acknowledge  their place in Alaska's history, and that is what I intend to do  briefly today.   George was a native of Wisconsin. He attended high school in Red  Wing, MN. He joined the Minnesota National Guard. He was selected for  Officer Candidate School.   In 1943, George and Peggy met, and they married the next year, in  1944. It is said that they met ``over Formica.'' George was training to  be a pilot, and Peggy was a waitress. Some would suggest that their  destiny as operators of an iconic diner was sealed at that very moment,  but World War II came first. George received orders to go to India. He  was one of those brave pilots who navigated military aircraft over the  Himalayas, colloquially known as the Hump.   Coincidentally, another significant figure in Alaska's history flew  those same routes during the war. That guy's name was Ted Stevens.   After the war, George and Peggy returned briefly to the Midwest. They  bought a share in a restaurant. In 1951, they sold their share and took  off for Alaska in a 1949 Nash. It was a pretty bumpy, dusty, 2-week  journey, we are told. Upon arrival, George worked construction on  Elmendorf Air Force Base and helped build a home for his family. They  moved to Arizona for a short time in the 1950s and tried out another  restaurant; at that time, it was in Tucson. It didn't work. It was a  flop. So they returned to Alaska to try again, and this time there was  no flop.   On the occasion of the Wishbone's 50th anniversary in 2005, George  recalled the Wishbone's first week in business. He shared this with a  reporter from the Anchorage Daily News, Debra McKinney. He said as  follows:         The first day we took in $80. The second day, $125. Then we       went to $300 on Saturday, I believe it was. We were totally       swamped. And on Sunday it was $460. At that time, why of       course coffee was 10 cents, a jumbo hamburger was 65 cents, a       regular hamburger 40 cents, a milk shake, 35 cents--that kind       of thing. Things were looking pretty good after that first       week. From then on, the business grew and grew and grew.    Those were George's words.   Fifty years later, according to McKinney, the Wishbone was serving up  over 1,000 chickens a week, somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000 a year.   Serving up all of that food, of course, requires a pretty big team.  George and Peggy have four children, and every one of them put in time  at the Lucky Wishbone. Patricia Brown Heller--Pat Heller--is one of  those children. She is  [[Page S683]]  the oldest of the four. She tells the story of her involvement working  in the restaurant. She says she pretty much cut her teeth in the  restaurant. She was the fastest potato peeler and slicer at the  Wishbone, she says on the order of 200 pounds a day. She worked in the  family's restaurant cutting those potatoes, peeling and cutting them  every morning.   Pat decided that the restaurant was not going to be her career and  decided to go another route. She was the longtime State director for  the former Senator Murkowski--my father, Senator Frank Murkowski--and  then when I came to the Senate, she continued on as my State director  in 2003. But Pat has always been, as have her siblings, a true fixture,  along with her parents, at the Lucky Wishbone.   The demands of the business required growth in the workforce, and  George and Peggy maintained a high standard and demanded much of their  employees. Many chose to stay. They were adopted into the Browns'  extended family. If you ask people throughout Anchorage if they know  somebody who has worked at the Lucky Wishbone, I can tell you that  extended family is pretty large. It is pretty significant.   George and Peggy were known for giving away $30,000 to $40,000 in  Christmas bonuses, health insurance, and pensions. They were very  protective of the health of their customers and their employees, and  the Lucky Wishbone became smoke-free long before it was fashionable and  not without more than its share of controversy because many of their  customers liked to smoke, but not at the Wishbone.   Oftentimes, when Mom and Pop pass away, the business dies with them.  Fortunately, that won't be the case here. Ownership responsibilities  going forward will be shared by Pat and two long-term employees of the  Wishbone. And out of love and respect for George and Peggy, they have  made a commitment to Anchorage, so nothing is going to change. It is  comforting to know that the chicken will still be wonderful, the  cheeseburgers will still be real, the milkshakes good, and, of course,  the french fries cut fresh every morning.   Community is a highly valued concept back home in Alaska. George  Brown may have set out to run a successful restaurant, but what he did  was he created a community institution, a place for people to talk  about golf or flying or whatever were the issues of the day.   We have a tradition, I guess you can call it, in my family. During a  campaign, when you come to election day, there is oftentimes not much  more that can be done. You have gotten your message out. You are just  kind of waiting for people to vote. So a tradition in our family is we  go out for a nice lunch, and we always go to the Lucky Wishbone on  election day. I think I am going to continue that tradition. This is a  place where the coffee is warm and the food is hearty, a place where  the smiles and the hugs have always been readily available.   As much as I have missed Peggy since she has passed, I will certainly  miss George. I will miss his smile. I will miss his conversation. But  it is comforting to know that their legacy will continue.   On February 11--this weekend--George's friends and supporters and  admirers will gather at the Alaska Aviation Museum to celebrate his  life. It is really an appropriate place for George because he was a  pilot, and once a pilot, always a pilot. He had 73 years of experience  in the cockpit at age 94 when he last landed his Cessna on Deshka Lake  to fish.   I had an opportunity to speak with Pat before I came to the floor,  and she is worried that the location they have chosen for the service  will be too small because they anticipate that some 400 Alaskans will  come to gather. She made the comment to me: At 96, you wouldn't figure  that there would be that many people at someone's service.   I reminded Pat that George was that person who touched so many  people's lives, whether as a pilot, a small businessman, a community  leader, or just the generous man with a good cup of coffee who would  sit at the banquet table with you there at the Lucky Wishbone and just  share a conversation. He was a man of many talents with an  extraordinary good heart and good will.   On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I bid farewell to this outstanding  Alaskan. I extend my condolences to his family and to all of those  whose life he enriched.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I have come to the floor to pay tribute  to William J. Van Ness, an individual who was instrumental in the  maturation and development of Alaska as a State and who passed away  last November.   Bill's contributions to Alaska began in 1966 when he joined the staff  of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, the  predecessor to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, under the  chairmanship of Senator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson.   As special counsel and later chief counsel for the committee, Bill  was one of the architects of the settlement of the aboriginal land  claims of Alaska Natives, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of  1971, as well as the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act of 1973. The enactment  of these foundational laws has enabled Alaska to achieve many of the  promises of our statehood.   As an Alaskan, a Senator representing Alaska, and the current  chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I was  saddened to learn of Bill's passing, but am proud to help recognize his  contributions to our state.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an essay made  possible by the Henry M. Jackson Foundation, which Bill served as  president of from 1988 until 2008. The essay, which appeared on  HistoryLink.org, highlights many of Bill's accomplishments.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         HistoryLink: Van Ness, William J. ``Bill'' Jr. (1938-2017)         Seattle attorney William J. ``Bill'' Van Ness Jr. worked       under U.S. Senator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson (1912-1983) from       1966 to 1977 on the U.S. Senate Committee on Interior and       Insular Affairs. He served first as special counsel and then,       beginning in 1970, as chief counsel. During his tenure he       drafted several pieces of key environmental legislation that       became law, including the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act       (ANCSA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).                                 Early Years         Bill Van Ness Jr. was born on January 20, 1938, in Wolf       Point, Montana, the son of William J. Van Ness and Mary       Armyda Thomas. About 1942 the family moved to Port Orchard       (Kitsap County), where his father took a job at the Bremerton       Naval Yard. They stayed for three years in Port Orchard, then       moved to Chimacum, Washington, (Jefferson County), a small,       unincorporated community located about eight miles south of       Port Townsend. Van Ness attended his early years of grade       school in Port Townsend, and graduated from Chimacum High       School in 1956.        He worked full time for a couple of years to pay for       college, and graduated from Bellingham's Western Washington       State College (now [2011] Western Washington University) in       1962 with a double major in English and Philosophy. After       graduation Van Ness worked for a year, then went to law       school at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he       served as articles editor on the UW Law Review in his final       year. In 1966 he graduated near the top of his class, and       attracted the notice of some of his law professors, who ended       up steering his career in a different direction than he was       planning.                            A Different Direction         Van Ness had a Sterling fellowship to go to Yale Law       School, and his goal was to get a J.S.D. in Law and become a       law professor. But he first needed to get a job to pay his       college bills. He was thinking of staying in Seattle, but       soon got a phone call that changed it all. Evidently one or       more of his law professors had spotted the young graduate's       potential and passed this information on to U.S. Senator       Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson. Jackson had become chairman of the       Senate's Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs (now the       Committee on Energy and Natural Resources) in 1963, and now       invited Van Ness to interview for a position as special       counsel on the committee.        Van Ness wasn't a particular fan of politics and wasn't       particularly interested in moving to Washington, D.C.,       either, but he needed a job, so he took the interview. He       liked what he saw in Jackson, and described his first       impressions in a June 2011 interview: ``He was a hell of a       nice man, with an open mind, and full of common sense'' (Phil       Dougherty interview). Jackson was likewise impressed, and       offered Van Ness the job. He accepted and moved with his       family to the other Washington in August 1966.        He found the issues and opportunities presented in his new       position invigorating and challenging.                          Alaska Native Land Claims         One of Van Ness's first assignments involved structuring a       settlement of the longstanding Alaska Native land claims. He       began his research in the autumn of 1966 and soon found that       there was virtually no information on who the Alaska Natives       were, what their claims were, or even how many Alaska Natives       there were. Realizing that far more in-depth research was       necessary, he got authority to commission the Federal Field       Committee for Development Planning to do a study. This       committee, which had been formed to deal with reconstruction       in southern Alaska after the great Alaska earthquake of 1964,       prepared a comprehensive 565-page report in 1968 titled       ``Alaska Natives and the Land,'' which addressed virtually       all factual questions which could be asked about the Alaska       Native issue.        That same year oil was discovered at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska,       which made settling Alaska Native land claims more urgent.       Thus the timing of the committee's report, completed late in       1968, couldn't have been better. It became the basis for       hearings and eventually shaped legislation (which Van Ness       drafted and Jackson introduced into the Senate) that became       known as the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA).       Congress passed the act and it was signed by President       Richard Nixon (1913-1994) in December 1971.        ANCSA was a wide-ranging act that paid $962 million to       Alaska Natives in exchange for their claims to many of their       native lands. The act also transferred approximately 45       million acres of federal land to 12 regional and some 200       village corporations in the state (a 13th regional       corporation was later set up in Seattle to handle claims of       Alaska Natives no longer living in Alaska). These       corporations were formed under the act to manage the lands       and to create for-profit business ventures. Since 1971 the       Alaska Native corporations have become an important part of       Alaska's economy and provide thousands of jobs to Alaskans as       well as millions of dollars for scholarships and cultural       programs. In 2009 total revenues for the dozen regional       corporations in Alaska were more than $7.2 billion.                   National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)         In 1967 Van Ness took on another project which eventually       became the National Environmental Policy Act, more commonly       known by its acronym NEPA. Environmental issues were coming       to the forefront in 1960s America, but they were dealt with       by multiple agencies with different priorities and approaches       that often arrived at conflicting positions. Van Ness       realized that there needed to be a process to identify all of       the positions and then pinpoint the common goals to provide a       basis for a better plan of action and better federal policy       and decision-making.        Jackson, along with Representative John Dingell (b. 1926)       of Michigan and others, had introduced legislation in       Congress in 1966 to establish an environmental policy       council. Van Ness took it a step further. In 1967 he prepared       a memo to Jackson that argued the need for a comprehensive       national environmental policy, pointing out that there might       be one in the future in any event. He drafted legislation       that eventually became Senate Bill (S.) 1075, the template       for NEPA, and added that his draft was vetted by fellow       committee member Daniel Dreyfus: ``He had experience that I       didn't have, and kept me grounded in reality. And he was a       great critic'' (Dougherty interview). In 1968 Van Ness helped       draft an additional report that outlined the need for a       uniform approach to national environmental policy. With this       background in place, Jackson introduced S. 1075 in the Senate       in February 1969.        The concept of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS),       now a key component of NEPA, was introduced in April 1969       during Senate hearings on the bill. The purpose of the EIS is       to require federal agencies to provide analytic review of       proposed major federal actions that would have a significant       impact on the surrounding environment. The EIS must identify       and address the environmental impact (particularly adverse       environmental effects) of the proposed action and examine       alternatives to it. Van Ness, assisted by Dreyfus, drafted       the EIS requirement, which ultimately became Section 102 of       NEPA. ``Nobody seemed to pay much attention to it'' [at the       time], remarked Van Ness. ``I wanted the EIS to be short       enough to be easily read and understood by cabinet officers       and other federal decision makers'' (Dougherty interview).        The Senate passed S. 1075 in July and referred the bill to       the House, which had conducted hearings earlier in the year       on a similar bill introduced by Dingell. The House passed       Dingell's bill (H.R. 12549) in September, after which the two       bills went to a joint Senate-House committee to hammer out       their differences. This was accomplished in December 1969,       and the House and Senate both passed the final version of the       act the week before Christmas. President Richard Nixon signed       NEPA into law on January 1, 1970.        Today NEPA is regarded as a milestone in environmental       legislation. It provides transparency and discipline for       decision-making in a process that is open to the public. NEPA       legislation has since been adopted by many states (including       Washington state) as well as by other nations.                 The Alaska Pipeline and Energy Conservation         Van Ness took the lead in drafting two other significant       acts that were enacted in  [[Page S702]]       the 1970s: the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act and       the Energy Policy Conservation Act. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline       Authorization Act resulted from the discovery of oil at       Prudhoe Bay in 1968. There was plenty of oil but no reliable       way to get it to the lower 48 states. Oil companies       determined that the cheapest way would be to build a pipeline       through Alaska from the Arctic Ocean to Valdez, where the oil       could then be shipped south.        Environmentalists fiercely resisted construction of a       pipeline through Alaska. It took the 1973 Arab oil embargo       and resulting gas shortages to tip the scales in favor of       legislation authorizing construction. ``It's doubtful it       would've passed if people weren't forced to sit in long gas       lines,'' Van Ness observed (Dougherty interview). Even then       the Senate deadlocked when the act came up for a vote, and it       took a tie-breaker vote by Vice President Spiro Agnew (1918-      1996) to break the deadlock. President Nixon signed the act       in November 1973.        The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), introduced       by Senator Jackson in February 1975, was probably the least       controversial of the four acts discussed in this essay, and       ``fairly straightforward,'' commented Van Ness (Dougherty       interview). It passed the Senate in April, the House in       September, and President Gerald Ford (1913-2006) signed it in       December 1975. EPCA created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,       mandated automobile fuel economy standards, and extended oil       price controls until 1979.                        Moving On to Private Practice         By 1977, Van Ness had decided it was time for a change. He       had actually considered leaving sooner: ``I tried to leave       numerous times to go practice law, but Scoop was very       persuasive. He was a fun guy to work with--great instincts       and a great mind. Every time I tried to leave he always       persuaded me to stay two more years. The last time I sent him       a memo and was pretty firm that it was time for me to move       on'' (Dougherty interview).        Van Ness established the firm of Van Ness, Feldman, Curtis       and Sutcliffe in 1977, partnering with three other attorneys       who had also worked as counsel or chief counsel to various       committees in both the House and Senate. The firm specialized       in handling energy, environmental, and transportation issues;       one of its first clients was the Arctic Slope Regional       Corporation. He also registered as a lobbyist, but this was       not the central focus of the firm's work. ``None of us [at       the firm] wanted to be known as a lobbyist,'' he explained.       ``We wanted to be known as legislative craftsmen who know the       process in the House and Senate and can achieve substantive       results'' (Dougherty interview). Curtis and Sutcliffe       eventually moved on, but Howard Feldman remained with the       firm, which became known as Van Ness Feldman.        In 1988 Van Ness returned to Seattle, opening an office of       the firm in the Emerald City the following year. Also in 1988       he became president of the Henry M. Jackson Foundation, a       position he held until 2008. The foundation, formed in 1983       after Jackson's sudden death, makes grants and develops       initiatives in four areas reflecting issues that Jackson was       involved in during his years in Congress: international       affairs education, environmental and natural resource       management, human rights, and public service. Since it was       established, the foundation has committed more than $22       million to nonprofit organizations and educational       institutions in both the United States and Russia.        Van Ness also served on the Board of Directors for the       University of Washington Medical School for nine years,       during a time that the U.S. Department of Justice brought       litigation against the UW, alleging massive billing fraud in       overbilling government insurance programs such as Medicare       and Medicaid. In 2004 the UW and the Department of Justice       agreed to a $35 million settlement, but the story remained       hot in the press. Later that year the UW Medicine Board named       Van Ness head of a committee to review the weaknesses that       led to the billing problems and to make recommendations to       prevent a recurrence. ``The committee's review was thorough,       frank and, in some instances, scathing,'' reported The       Seattle Times when the report came out in 2005. ``But it put       the issue to bed,'' concluded Van Ness (Dougherty interview).        Van Ness married Patricia ``Pat'' O'Meara (b. 1940) in 1959       and they had four children: Tamara, Keith, Douglas, and       Justin. Into his seventies Van Ness went into his law office       several days a week and worked from home as needed. When not       working he enjoyed spending time at his beach cabin on       Marrowstone Island in Jefferson County with his       grandchildren, gardening, wood-carving, and fishing in       Alaska. Bill Van Ness died on November 22, 2017, at age 79.
