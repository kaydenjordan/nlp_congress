DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 6087, the Improving Access to  Workers' Compensation for Injured Federal Workers Act    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, today, we are considering a straightforward bipartisan  bill that will alleviate some of the barriers Federal workers face  seeking treatment and care after they have been injured on the job.   Right now, whether we represent urban districts or rural districts,  we are all hearing about the very real shortage of physicians, whether  it is in general practice or specialty practices. That is why it is  important for Congress to surgically and intelligently reform outdated,  antiquated policies in place that prevent qualified providers from  treating patients who need their care.   This bill achieves that goal for Federal employees who need treatment  for workplace injuries or illness and will allow qualified, licensed  nurse practitioners and physician assistants to treat these patients  safely and competently and be reimbursed under the Federal Employees'  Compensation Act.   The bill explicitly states, in section 2, that such treatment must  adhere to the scope of practice for nurse practitioners and physician  assistants, as defined by State law. I repeat: The bill was carefully  crafted so that it does not encroach on the authority of State health  licensing boards to determine the scope of practice. That is one of the  reasons why the Committee on Education and Labor came together on a  bipartisan basis to unanimously endorse passage of this bill.   Right now, injured Federal workers who serve our Nation at agencies  such as the Department of Homeland Security, the Postal Service, and  our National Parks, to name a few, can only receive the care they are  entitled to under the Federal workers' compensation law if it is  provided by a physician, and only a physician can certify a claim  regardless of whether the State the worker resides in allows nurse  practitioners and PAs to practice independently.   As any healthcare patient in America knows, nurse practitioners and  physician assistants are a growing portion of primary care and  healthcare workforce nationwide, especially in rural areas. Patients  are ably and safely treated by NPs and PAs in these settings every day  and having the capability to be treated by a nurse practitioner or a  physician assistant increases access to more timely treatment,  particularly in parts of the country experiencing physician shortages.   The benefit of increased access was confirmed by the Congressional  Budget Office in their analysis of this bill, which found that it would  have no impact on direct spending by the government.   Given the challenges some Federal workers have in accessing their  Federal workers' comp benefits, allowing these providers to be  reimbursed for the care they provide within the scope of their practice  is an extremely commonsense improvement. CBO has even stated that this  legislation would help injured Federal workers return to the job  faster. In this labor market, anything we can do to improve workers'  healthy recovery and job retention is worthwhile.   This bill has been endorsed by the National Rural Health Association,  the American Nursing Association, the American Association of Nurse  Practitioners, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, as well as  a diverse coalition of unions representing Federal employees, such as  the National Treasury Employees Union and the National Postal Mail  Handlers Union.   Further, the Department of Labor's Office of the Workers'  Compensation Programs which administers the Federal Employees'  Compensation Act for Federal workers in agencies as diverse as the  Pentagon, Department of Homeland Security, Interior, and Veterans  Affairs, has confirmed this legislation will help alleviate barriers  that create delays for FECA claimants and would expand injured workers  access to medical treatment.   Madam Speaker, I have the honor to represent the largest military  installation in New England, Naval Submarine Base New London, which  employs over 1,000 civilian Federal workers who perform outstanding  work to support 16 attack submarines that deploy from that base.   Some of that work is physically demanding, such as firefighters,  police, and crane operators, and injuries do happen. This bill will  create healthcare parity for those patriots by ensuring that they will  have their claims handled and treated the same as any other workers who  reside in Connecticut and Rhode Island. This is an overdue and  important, but commonsense, way to bring this program in line with the  reality of 21st century healthcare delivery.   Madam Speaker, I thank my Republican counterpart, Mr. Walberg, for  his great support and work to bring this issue forward. I also thank  Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx for their bipartisan work  supporting this bill and getting it through committee.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on this bipartisan and  commonsense measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I again applaud Mr. Walberg for his  leadership on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the great  Commonwealth of Virginia (Mr. Scott), chairman of the Committee on  Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Just briefly, I agree with the gentleman from Maryland that the goal  here should be what is best for Federal employees, who do critical work  for our country, but I think also what we want is what is best for  people who are protected by Social Security Disability Insurance, by  the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which are programs in  which independent practice of nurse practitioners and physician  assistants has been well established and, again, subject to scope of  practice in the State where the patient resides.   Again, this is just simply conforming Federal workers' compensation  law with existing practice and a whole host of other Federal programs  involving really important populations that all of us have a duty to  protect.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Adams), a member of the Education and Labor Committee who  does outstanding work on the Workforce Protections Subcommittee as its  chair.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Just briefly, again, I thank the ranking member, Congresswoman Foxx,  for her remarks and Mr. Walberg, who I think very effectively and  specifically addressed some of the issues that we have heard in this  brief debate regarding whether or not this is opening the door to  practitioners who really aren't qualified to engage in the handling of  workers' compensation claims.   Right now, today, there are 27 States that actually allow nurse  practitioners and physician assistants to handle workers' compensation  claims under State law, including, by the way, North Carolina and  Maryland. Just going down the list, it is from all different regions of  the country, and, again, I think it has demonstrated that the system  functions smoothly. As the Congressional Budget Office indicated, it  allows for quicker care because you have more access when you have a  broader, larger pool of qualified practitioners.   That is really what this bill is aimed at. It is just to make sure  that Federal workers will have that same opportunity to access care,  particularly when they are in underserved parts of the country.   To sort of frame it, I mentioned earlier the New London sub base  where they have a really sizable firefighters contingent there. Again,  fires on submarines and Navy ships is a demanding, highly specialized  area of practice. If they get injured on the job, they do not have the  same rights as a firefighter who works for the city of New London who  gets injured on the job, in terms of having access to a nurse  practitioner or a physician assistant to handle that individual's  treatment and care and their disability claim.   That is really what this bill is doing. It is just simply  establishing parity for Federal workers who reside in those 28 States  that recognize independent practice by physician assistants and nurse  practitioners.   I have some letters of support, Madam Speaker, which I include in the  Record: one from the National Postal Mail Handlers Union, one from the  National Treasury Employees Union, one from the National Rural Health  Association, one from the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,  and one from the American Association of Physician Assistants.                                                National Postal Mail                                                  Handlers Union,                                                     Washington, DC.      Hon. Joe Courtney,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Courtney: On behalf of the National Postal       Mail Handlers Union, which represents over 50,000 mail       handlers across the country, I write in support of H.R. 6087,       the Improving Access to Workers' Compensation for injured       Federal Workers Act.        Your legislation is a commonsense solution to amend the       Federal Employees' Compensation Act to grant injured postal       and federal workers wider access medical care from eligible       providers. This will ensure they are able to claim workers'       compensation and receive necessary care in a timely manner.        As it can be difficult to expeditiously schedule       appointments with physicians for work-related injuries, H.R.       6087 extends eligible providers to include physician       assistants and nurse practitioners. It is an unfortunate fact       that postal employees are the largest group of beneficiaries       under current FECA regulations. Your legislation will ensure       those injured on the job will have access to medical care and       can see their preferred primary care provider.        I look forward to seeing H.R. 6087 gain support within the       House Education and Labor Committee, and its advancement       through the House.            In solidarity,                                              Paul V. Hogrogian,                                                 National President,      National Postal Mail Handlers Union.                                   ____                                                The National Treasury                                                 Employees Union,                                                       June 6, 2022.        Dear Representative: This week, the House of       Representatives is expected to vote on suspension on the       Improving Access to Workers' Compensation for Injured Federal       Workers Act of 2022 (HR 6087). The National Treasury       Employees Union (NTEU) strongly supports this legislation and       urges you to vote YES.        This bill would improve access to benefits under the       Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), which serves as       the workers' compensation program for federal employees. It       does so by allowing workers to have their medical care       provided by a Nurse Practitioner (NP) or Physician Assistant       (PA), as well as have NPs and PAs provide certification of       injury. This bipartisan bill was introduced by Rep. Joseph       Courtney (CT) and Rep. Timothy Walberg (MI) and passed out of       the Education & Labor Committee on a bipartisan basis.        Thank you for your consideration of our views. Please feel       free to contact Kurt Vorndran of the NTEU Department of       Legislation if you have any questions.            Sincerely,                                                Anthony M. Reardon,      National President.                                   ____                                                      National Rural                                              Health Association,                                       Washington, DC, June 6, 2022.      Re H.R. 6087, the Improving Access to Workers' Compensation           for Injured Federal Workers Act, under suspension in the           House of Representatives.       Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: The       National Rural Health Association (NRHA) writes in support of       House passage for H.R. 6087, the Improving Access to Workers'       Compensation for Injured Federal Workers Act, which is       scheduled to be considered by the House of Representatives       this week. This legislation would allow nurse practitioners       (NP) and physician assistants (PA) to diagnose, treat, and       provide care for federal employees who are injured at work,       consistent with state scope of practice. In fact, most states       already authorize NPs to provide this care for non-federal       employees.        NRHA is a non-profit membership organization with more than       21,000 members nationwide that provides leadership on rural       health issues. Our membership includes every component of       rural America's health care, including rural community       hospitals, critical access hospitals, doctors, nurses, and       patients. We provide leadership on rural health issues       through advocacy, communications, education, and research.        NRHA is supportive of this legislation as NPs and PAs are       common primary care providers in rural communities. According       to MedPAC, in 2018 advanced practice registered nurses (APRN)       and PAs accounted for a third of all primary care clinicians       treating Medicare beneficiaries nationwide. In rural       communities, their presence is closer to half of the primary       care clinicians. Because of the significant presence of NPs       and PAs, and the quality of care they provide, NRHA urges       swift passage of this legislation. This commonsense bill will       ensure increased access to needed services in our rural       areas.        Thank you for your consideration of this important       legislation. If you have questions, please contact Josh       Jorgensen.            Sincerely,                                                    Alan Morgan,                                            Chief Executive Officer,      National Rural Health Association.                                   ____                                              American Association of                                             Nurse Practitioners,                                                      March 4, 2022.      Hon. Joe Courtney,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tim Walberg,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Courtney and Walberg: The American       Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP), representing more       than 325,000 nurse practitioners (NPs) in the United States,       is pleased to support H.R. 6087, the Improving Access to       Workers'  [[Page H5247]]       Compensation for injured Federal Workers Act. This       legislation would retire outdated barriers in the Federal       Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) that limit the ability of       NPs to provide care and treatment for injured or ill federal       employees. AANP thanks you for you continued efforts to       improve the health care system for our nation's federal       employees.        Currently, federal employees can select an NP as their       health care provider under the Federal Employees Health       Benefits Program (FEHPB), and the majority of states       authorize NPs to provide the diagnosis and treatment for a       workplace related injury. However, contrary to the workers'       compensation process in most states, FECA requires that only       a physician can make the diagnosis, certify the injury and       extent of the disability, and oversee the patient's treatment       and care. This barrier places an additional burden on the       over two million federal employees, depriving them from       receiving health care from their provider of choice, as well       as hindering timely access to care and continuity of care.        As you know, H.R. 6087 would update the federal workers'       compensation program and authorize NPs to certify       disabilities and oversee treatment for injured or ill federal       employees under FECA. This would improve access to health       care for injured or ill federal employees, particularly in       rural and underserved communities, and better align the       federal workers' compensation program with the majority of       states and FEHBP. By updating FECA to authorize federal       employees to select their health care provider of choice when       they are injured or become ill in the course of their federal       employment, greater access, overall efficiency and better       continuity of care can be achieved. We thank you for this       impactful legislation and look forward to continuing to work       with you to ensure H.R. 6087 becomes law.        Thank you again for your tireless efforts on behalf of       federal employees. Should you have comments or questions,       please direct them to MaryAnne Sapio, V.P. Federal Government       Affairs.            Sincerely,                                     Jon Fanning, MS, CAE, CNED,                                            Chief Executive Officer,      American Association of Nurse Practioners.                                   ____                                                            AAPA,                                     Alexandria, VA, March 15, 2022.      Hon. Joe Courtney,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tim Walberg,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Courtney and Walberg: On behalf of the       more than 151,000 PAs (physician assistants) throughout the       United States, the American Academy of PAs (AAPA) lends       strong support to H.R. 6087, the Improving Access to Worker's       Compensation for Injured Federal Workers Act. AAPA thanks you       for your continued support of the federal workforce and       unwavering commitment to ensuring that all Americans have       access to high-quality healthcare.        As you know, U.S. federal and postal employees receive       workers compensation coverage through the Federal Employee's       Compensation Act (FECA) for employment-related injuries and       occupational disease. However, as currently written, FECA       does not cover medical care provided by PAs within the       definition of ``medical, surgical, and hospital services . .       .'' and FECA claims signed by PAs are routinely denied. This       undue restriction negatively impacts federal employees,       especially those in rural and underserved areas, who receive       primary care from PAs.        PAs practice in all medical and surgical specialties in all       50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and       the uniformed services. PAs provide high-quality, cost-      effective medical care in every specialty and setting,       undertake rigorous education and clinical training, and are       well established as medical professionals. PAs are recognized       as qualified healthcare providers under Medicare, Medicaid,       and almost every state and federal healthcare program,       including state workers' compensation programs. PAs are also       included in the definition of an ``acceptable medical       source'' by the Social Security Administration for the       purposes of certifying that an individual has a medically       determinable impairment. Further, thousands of PAs are       employed by the federal government as healthcare providers       and work within the Department of Veterans Affairs, the       Department of Defense, the Public Health Service, and Indian       Health Services. However, PAs are not considered healthcare       providers within FECA, an oversight that does not align with       state or other federal programs.        H.R. 6087 would ensure that federal employees can access       high-quality healthcare from the provider of their choice, as       well as further align FECA with state workers compensation       programs which recognize PAs as covered providers. It is well       within the education and training of PAs to provide treatment       to federal employees who are injured in the course of their       work for the government, and it is time to remove this       outdated and unnecessary restriction.        AAPA appreciates your work and dedication to the federal       workforce and our nation's healthcare system. If we can be of       assistance to you on this or any issue, please do not       hesitate to contact Tate Heuer, AAPA Vice President, Federal       Advocacy.            Sincerely                                               Lisa M. Gables, CPA,                                           Chief Executive Officer.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  the Nursing Community Coalition, which represents 63 national nursing  organizations all across America.                                    Nursing Community Coalition,                                                       June 7, 2022.      Hon. Joe Courtney,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tim Walberg,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Courtney and Walberg: On behalf of the       Steering Committee of the Nursing Community Coalition (NCC),       which represents 63 national nursing organizations, we are       pleased to support H.R. 6087, the Improving Access to       Workers' Compensation for Injured Federal Workers Act, which       would retire outdated barriers in the Federal Employees'       Compensation Act (FECA) that limit the ability of Nurse       Practitioners (NPs) to provide care and treatment for injured       or ill federal employees. The NCC is a cross section of       education, practice, research, and regulation within the       nursing profession representing Registered Nurses (RNs),       Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), nurse leaders,       students, faculty, and researchers. We appreciate your       continued efforts to improve the health care system for our       nation's federal employees and strongly support passage of       H.R. 6087.        Currently, federal employees can select an NP as their       health care provider under the Federal Employees Health       Benefits Program (FEHPB), and the majority of states       authorize NPs to provide the diagnosis and treatment for a       workplace related injury. However, contrary to the workers'       compensation process in most states, FECA requires that only       a physician can make the diagnosis, certify the injury and       extent of the disability, and oversee the patient's treatment       and care. This barrier places an additional burden on the       over two million federal employees, depriving them from       receiving health care from their provider of choice, as well       as hindering timely access to care and continuity of care.        H.R. 6087 would update the federal workers' compensation       program and authorize NPs to certify disabilities and oversee       treatment for injured or ill federal employees under FECA.       This would improve access to health care for injured or ill       federal employees, particularly in rural and underserved       communities, and better align the federal workers'       compensation program with the majority of states and FEHBP.       By updating FECA to authorize federal employees to select       their health care provider of choice when they are injured or       become ill in the course of their federal employment, greater       access, overall efficiency and better continuity of care can       be achieved.        We appreciate this important legislation and strongly       support passage of H.R. 6087, the Improving Access to       Workers' Compensation for Injured Federal Workers Act.

Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Walberg's eloquence, and comprehensive closing statement I think  really said it all. I tip my hat to him, Ranking Member Foxx, Mr. Davis  from the minority side of the aisle, and the speakers on this side that  really represent a bipartisan message that we are prepared to get our  Federal Employee Workers' Compensation Act modernized so that the hard  work of nurse practitioners and physician assistants and the work that  they do every single day around the country is now extended to a  critical part of our healthcare system and also our Federal disability  benefits system.   This is really about giving patients a choice. There is nothing in  this bill that mandates that they can't go to a physician or that they  don't have that option. In some areas people just don't have that  choice. If you are in a place where the only real access is to a  physician assistant or a nurse practitioner, sometimes for even a life- threatening injury, we need to open the door to give people that  opportunity. That is precisely what this bill does.   It came out of committee with a unanimous vote. I strongly urge all  of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to follow the lead of the  Education and Labor Committee and pass this bill with an overwhelming  majority.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
