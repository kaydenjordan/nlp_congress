 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon for  yielding.   I rise in strong support of this en bloc, which includes an important  bipartisan natural infrastructure amendment that adds H.R. 3742, the  Recovering America's Wildlife Act to H.R. 2.   When we talk about infrastructure, natural infrastructure, habitat  restoration and resilience projects must be part of the conversation.    Such investments not only create jobs, up to 33 created per $1  million of investment, but they make communities safer. They grow our  outdoor recreation economy. And they help recover at-risk wildlife  populations.   This amendment will enable States, territories, and Tribes to  complete proactive collaborative on-the-ground habitat restoration and  the natural infrastructure projects that will recover more than 12,000  wildlife, fish, and plant species of the greatest conservation need.   This amendment is modeled after legislation that has more than 180  bipartisan cosponsors, and it passed out of the Natural Resources  Committee with a majority of both Republicans and Democrats.   I thank my colleagues, Representatives Fortenberry and Raskin for  coleading this amendment, as well as everybody who helped get us here  today, including Speaker Pelosi, Leader Hoyer, Whip Clyburn, my dear  friend, the chairman leading all of this, Chairman McGovern, Chairman  Grijalva, the Natural Resources Committee staff, and the entire RAWA  coalition.   I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc and to support this  bill. The country needs it.
