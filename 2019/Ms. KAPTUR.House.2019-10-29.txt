 Madam Speaker, I rise to express deep concern about the  timing of Secretary Rick Perry's resignation, and his simultaneous  refusal to provide key information on his many trips to Ukraine, more  than any other Cabinet member. He has played a central role in U.S.- Ukraine relations throughout the Trump Presidency.   Thus far, Secretary Perry has refused to cooperate with lawful  subpoenas issued to him by the Intelligence Committee and other  committees of this Congress. As chair of the Energy and Water  Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of the Committee on  Appropriations, while I have had a productive relationship with  Secretary Perry in the past, from strengthening our National  Laboratories, to supporting the growing range of energy solutions, I  feel his recent behavior raises serious questions.   Madam Speaker, American taxpayers have a right to know what Secretary  Perry was doing on his frequent travel to Ukraine as a public servant  beholden to the public trust. Americans have a right to know what he  observed, who he was meeting with, and who was benefiting from the  contacts and deals he was making.   The Constitution entrusts the House of Representatives with holding  the executive branch accountable. That is what we must do.   As U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine has been sidelined in favor of  President Trump's personal and political agenda and abuse of power,  Secretary Perry should do what is right, and immediately comply with  the House's investigation. America deserves nothing less.
