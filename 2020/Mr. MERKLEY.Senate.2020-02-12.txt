 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am proud to rise in support of S.J.  Res. 68, the Kaine-Lee resolution to ``remove United States Armed  Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran or any  part of its government or military.''   This resolution is crucial at a momentous moment in our Nation's  history. As U.S. Senators, we are no strangers to tough decisions. When  this institution is functioning properly, we make such decisions all  the time. There are tough questions, and we make tough decisions on  which programs to fund or on who sits in judgment over their fellow  citizens on the Federal bench or on issues of civil rights or equality  or fairness. Yet, without doubt, the most difficult decision any  Senator will ever face is whether to authorize war--whether to, through  such authorization, open the  [[Page S1035]]  gates to send the men and women of our Armed Forces into harm's way.   It is a solemn responsibility that all of us here take very  seriously, and it is a responsibility that the Founding Fathers  intended to rest solely here in the Congress of the United States of  America, not down Pennsylvania Avenue, in the White House, not in the  hands of any one person sitting in the Oval Office.   At the Constitutional Convention in 1787, George Mason, a delegate  from Virginia, said he was ``against giving the power of war to the  executive'' because the President ``is not safely to be trusted with  it.''   In speaking to the Pennsylvania ratifying convention that same year,  James Wilson stated:         This system will not hurry us into war; it is calculated to       guard against it. It will not be in the power of a single       man, or a single body of men [such as just the Senate or just       the House], to involve us in such distress, for the important       power of declaring war is vested in the legislature at large.    James Madison, the ``Father of the Constitution,'' wrote to Thomas  Jefferson in 1798:         The Constitution supposes, what the History of all       Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of       power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has       accordingly with studied care vested the question of war to       the Legislature.    All of these comments and so many more are about the gravity of  deciding to go to war--deciding on whether hundreds or thousands or  tens of thousands will walk into the face of danger, suffer injuries,  suffer death. Questions about war are questions of great human calamity  that cannot be taken lightly. They cannot be taken at the spur of the  moment. They cannot be taken with the judgment of a single individual.   Our Founders noted that the decision should not be by any single  President, not by a particular individual. This is not about the  individual in the Oval Office at this moment; it is about the Founders'  vision that it should be the collective decision of Congress,  representing the people of the United States, to weigh this question of  national defense--whether or not we should send our sons and now our  daughters into harm's way in a military fashion, where many will be  injured and many will die. It is an issue of the National Treasury as  well because the cost of war is a huge cost in blood and a huge cost in  injuries and a huge cost to the Treasury. That is why this  responsibility was placed with us and with the House of  Representatives.   In this Constitution--and all Senators here probably have one in  their desks--one just simply has to look in article I, section 8, which  is where that specific responsibility is given to us, not to the  President, not to the executive. Upon coming into this body, we did  swear an oath to this Constitution, not to some vision of our personal  desire that maybe a President would be better at making this decision  and not to any scholars' opinion but to this document, which vests its  power in this body, not in the President of the United States.   For too long, Congress has allowed a steady expansion of the exercise  of military power without authorization--without a declaration of war  from Congress. So this is one of those rare moments in which we are  standing up to say: No. Any decision to conduct war against Iran needs  to come in accordance with the Constitution, in accordance with the War  Powers Act, in accordance with the decision and debate that would occur  here.   S.J. Res. 68 lays out what the War Powers Act reads, which is, ``At  any time that United States Armed Forces are engaged in hostilities  outside the territory of the United States, its possessions and  territories without a declaration of war or specific statutory  authorization, such forces shall be removed by the President if the  Congress so directs.'' This is a debate over whether the Congress  should so direct.   Indeed, it also lays out in this document the vision of our  Constitution and reads that the question of whether U.S. forces should  be engaged in hostilities against Iran should be answered following a  full briefing to Congress and the American public of the issues at  stake--a public debate in Congress and a congressional vote as  contemplated by the Constitution.   This resolution does not read that Congress will not debate the  issue; it reads that Congress should debate the issue if the President  so requests and come to a decision as to whether to open the gates of  our Nation to war. It then proceeds to do exactly what the War Powers  Act provides for, which is to ``[direct] the President to terminate the  use of United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic  Republic of Iran or any part of the government or military unless  explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or a specific  Authorization for Use of Military Force.''   This is all about the vision of our Constitution. Are we going to  support it? Are we going to say no to this warfare unless it is  authorized as envisioned by the Constitution or are we going to say,  ``No. We don't want the burden of that responsibility. It is a tough  decision to make. We are not sure we will get it right, so we will just  let the executive do what he wants even though the Constitution says  no''?   Let us honor the vision of the Constitution. Let us support this that  is before us. Let us ponder how easy it is for there to be a cycle of  provocation, an escalation. We have seen that in Iran. Iran is not a  friendly power to the United States of America. Iran has been involved  in activities that we greatly oppose in its supporting forces in Syria,  in Lebanon, and Yemen; in its developing ballistic missiles; in its  creating concerns inside of its neighbor Iraq with its Iranian  militias. The United States has been involved in this cycle of  provocation and escalation.   We made a deal with Iran of economic assistance to Iran if they  abandoned their nuclear program. They abandoned the nuclear program,  and the inspectors certified they had abandoned it. Then, we have  broken the deal, and we have tightened the sanctions, making life very  difficult for the people of Iran.   Iran launched rockets at our forces inside of Iraq, and the United  States responded and attacked militias sponsored by Iran, killing a  good score of Iranians in the process and assassinating an Iranian  general. Iran responded with ballistic missiles attacks at the U.S.  forces in Iraq, injuring, at this moment, an estimated 100 U.S.  forces--a cycle of provocation and escalation.   We are on the edge of war. We are involved in hostilities that have  not been authorized, and the Constitution essentially says, in this  situation, it is Congress's responsibility to debate and wrestle with  whether to unleash our forces against Iran. So let's carry that  responsibility, and as we do so, let's think how close we were to a  third major war in the Middle East.   We had a war and are still at war in Afghanistan. Now, the  authorization for the use of military force in regard to Afghanistan  was very narrowly tailored. That authorization said that our forces are  authorized to attack those who attacked us on 9/11 and those who harbor  those forces.   It is now as if that AUMF had language added to it, language which  essentially said and: any other group we disagree with in the world.  The words that are often quoted as being part of that AUMF are ``and  related forces.''   But do you know what? That language isn't in that AUMF. This Congress  gave a very, very narrow assignment for the authorization of force, and  it has been expanded massively. We could debate whether or not that  authorization has been stretched to the breaking point. I think it has.  I think it has been abused. It has been misused, and it dishonors the  fact that Congress was so specific with that authorization.   The result is that here we are, 19 years later. We didn't pursue a  simple mission of taking out the training camps. We pursued a mission  that has cost this Nation $1 trillion and thousands of our sons and  daughters and tens of thousands with lifetime injuries.   So we have that war. We know what kind of damage and costs there can  be to an ill-considered strategy.   Then, we have the war we had against Iraq and authorized by a 2002  authorization for use of military force, or AUMF, and this was also  very narrowly crafted. The President is authorized to use the Armed  Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and  appropriate in order to defend the national security of the United  States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq--not posed by anyone  else, just by Iraq--and to enforce  [[Page S1036]]  the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding  Iraq--very, very specific.   Now, the administration is arguing that this AUMF from 2002, about  Iraq, provides authority to go to war against Iran. It is just like the  stretching of the 2001 AUMF that said go after those who harbored the  9/11 terrorists but has been stretched to go after other groups all  over the world.   But in both these cases, it was an authorization. Congress did  debate. Yes, they have been abused after they were passed, but what  there wasn't was an open door without Congress involved.   So we must do our job here and realize the gravity of these conflicts  and get the full, extensive information and make sure there is no fake  news in that information.   On the Iraq AUMF, this body operated on the solemn guarantee that  there were weapons of mass destruction being developed by Iraq. It  proved out to be false.   So when we do hold the debate over Iran, let's make sure we get the  absolutely honest intelligence, not the spin, not the cherry-picked  intelligence, not partial, not selected to drive a conclusion--the  honest, fully honest, situation of our activities and their activities  and the threats that they pose.   That is the responsibility we have--to make sure that the information  we wrestle with is absolutely accurate and then to weigh the heavy cost  of different strategies that may or may not involve force before we  vote for force. It is a big responsibility, and I have heard Members of  this Chamber say: You know what; it is such a tough decision. What if I  get it wrong? Let's just let the Executive make that decision. If I  misjudge it and don't vote to go to war and, for example, maybe there  were those weapons of mass destruction equivalent to Iraq, I don't want  to make that mistake, and people back home will not like it if I make  that mistake. If I vote to go to war and the information is wrong and  the strategy is wrong, well, then, people back home won't like that  either.   So let's just ignore the Constitution. Let's just ignore our oath to  the Constitution. Let's just let the person down Pennsylvania Avenue do  what he wants because we don't like the burden imposed on us by this  document that says that issue has to be debated here.   The decision to use force has to be debated and decided here, not  there, because it is too big a question to leave to a single  individual.   Our Constitution starts out with these words: ``We the people.'' They  did not want to create a King. They did not want to create an imperial  Presidency that acted like a King. They wanted a nation run of, by, and  for the people.   The question of war is our responsibility. We must make the decision  here, and that is why I urge my colleagues to take and say yes, we will  vote for this S.J. Res. 68 because it says we are demanding the  administration do what the Constitution demands, which is to place the  question of going to war with Iran with this body.
