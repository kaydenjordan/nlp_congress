 Mr. Speaker, for years we have witnessed a  concerted effort by activists on the left to abolish the natural  family.   The natural family, a man and woman committed for life to each other  and to their children, was ordained by God as the foundation of our  society. The natural family is essential for our Nation to prosper  because the family is the root of self-government, service, community,  personal responsibility, and faith in God.   That is why today I am launching the Congressional Family Caucus. The  Congressional Family Caucus will serve to defend the natural family  from attempts by the radical left to erode this core foundation of our  society.   The left advances abortion, fatherlessness, surgical castration, and  atheism. These woke progressives attempt to diminish parental rights by  eliminating parental consent and replacing families with the State.   Families are the bedrock of our values and protectors of our youth.  According to Deuteronomy 6, in the context of traditional family in the  home, we are to diligently instruct our children to love God and to  obey His commandments.   I believe we have a moral obligation as servant Representatives to  protect and to conserve the family. Families have made this country  great. I am honored to be joined by Representative Diana Harshbarger  from Tennessee and Representative Brian Babin from Texas in our efforts  to protect the family.                            ____________________
