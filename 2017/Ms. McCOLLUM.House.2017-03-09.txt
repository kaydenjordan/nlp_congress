 Mr. Chair, asbestos is a deadly poison. It can cause  lung cancer and mesothelioma. Once detected, these patients survive  only, on average, 8 to 14 months. It was true for Congressman Bruce  Vento, who proudly served the families of Minnesota's Fourth District  for more than 23 years in this House.   Bruce was a friend, and he died from mesothelioma 8\1/2\ months after  he was diagnosed. Congress has a responsibility to find real solutions  to support mesothelioma victims and their families, but H.R. 985 would  not support the families. In fact, it exposes families at a time of  great vulnerableness.   It exposes them by putting their identity, their name, their address,  and the last four digits of their Social Security number on a public  website--a public website--when this information has already been given  in a confidential manner.   It is especially outrageous to me that once again this legislation is  on the floor and it fails to protect children who are victims of  asbestos exposure from having their information shared publicly.  Parents should have the peace of mind knowing that their child's  privacy is secure and not on the internet where who knows who would be  out possibly preying on them.   I ask my colleagues to stand with me, stand with the mesothelioma  victims, stand with their families, stand with their children, and  oppose this bill, as they have asked me to do.
