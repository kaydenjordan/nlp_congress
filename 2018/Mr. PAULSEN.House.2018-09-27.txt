 Mr. Speaker, September is National Suicide Prevention  Month, reminding us that we lose too many to suicide each and every  day. Unfortunately, suicide is all too common among the men and women  who have served our Nation in uniform, a population that is  particularly at risk of suicide.   In fact, the VA estimates that 20 veterans and servicemembers lose  their lives each and every day, and veterans are 22 percent more likely  to commit suicide than nonvets. Among female veterans, the risk of  suicide is a staggering 250 percent higher.   Veterans are just 10 percent of the U.S. population but constitute 20  percent of suicides. Measures like the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention  Act, which we have already passed into law, are already making a  difference, but even one veteran suicide is too many.   We should always remind our veterans, Mr. Speaker, and those who are  in need, that there are always ways to get help. Veterans can always  call the VA's crisis hotline 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.                            ____________________
