 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

The estimated       total program cost is $52.1 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a major ally that is a force for       political stability and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific       region.        The proposed sale will improve the Republic of Korea's       capability to meet current and future threats while further       enhancing interoperability with the United States and other       allies. Korea will have no difficulty absorbing these       articles into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Raytheon Missiles and       Defense (RMD), Tucson, AZ. There are no known offset       agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of the proposed sale will require U.S.       Government and contractor personnel to visit the ROK on a       temporary basis in conjunction with program technical       oversight and support requirements, including program and       technical reviews, as well as to provide training and       maintenance support in country.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-76       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AIM-9X Block II and Block II+ (Plus) SIDEWINDER       Missile represents a substantial increase in missile       acquisition and kinematics performance over the AIM-9M and       replaces the AIM-9X Block I Missile configuration. The       missile includes a high off-boresight seeker, enhanced       countermeasure rejection capability, low drag/high angle of       attack airframe and the ability to integrate the Helmet       Mounted Cueing System. The most current AIM-9X Block II/II+       Operational Flight Software developed for all international       partner countries, which is authorized for export by USG       export policy, provides fifth-generation Infra-Red Missile       capabilities such as Lock-On-After-Launch, Weapons Data Link,       Surface Attack, and Surface Launch. No software source code       or algorithms will be released.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the Republic of Korea       (ROK) can provide substantially the same degree of protection       for the sensitive technology being released as the U.S.       Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S.       foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in       the Policy Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the ROK.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) is a Navy surface-to-air       missile that provides area and ship self-defense. The missile       is intended to project power and contribute to raid       annihilation by destroying manned fixed and rotary wing       aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Land Attack Cruise       Missiles, and Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles in flight. It was       designed to fulfill the need for a vertically launched,       extended range missile compatible with the AEGIS Weapon       System to be used against extended range threats at sea, near       land, and overland. The SM-6 combines the tested legacy of       Standard Missile 2 (SM-2) propulsion and ordnance with an       active radio frequency seeker allowing for over-the-horizon       engagements, enhanced capability at extended ranges, and       increased firepower.        2.
