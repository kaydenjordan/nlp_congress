 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chair, I represent a district that is  over 42 percent of the southern border, places that, sadly, nobody knew  very well a few years ago and now everybody knows, places like Eagle  Pass, Del Rio, and El Paso.   Right now in my communities, we are completely overwhelmed. In El  Paso alone, there are over 11,000 people who are here illegally in the  community. That has saturated the situation.   In Eagle Pass, we have come to beyond the breaking point where over  2,000 people are coming illegally. In that community, we are beyond a  point of return, and we need help. We need assistance.   Every instinct in my body is to leave this place and go home and help  the people in my district. It feels as if a Category 5 hurricane has  hit the southern border. This is the absolute worst I have seen it, and  there is no bottom to it. There is no end in sight.   My amendment is simple. My amendment asks to end catch and release  essentially in a humane and orderly way. If there is space, if there is  capacity, instead of DHS releasing migrants into a community that is  already saturated, this amendment asks that they look for other places  where they have capacity.   It is humane and orderly, and most importantly, it would end the  catch-and-release policies that have turned my communities upside down.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge this body to please  grant the people in my district, the people in Eagle Pass, the people  in El Paso some relief. We are beyond a breaking point, and we are  completely overwhelmed.   I am here to urge this body to do something today, not a week, not a  month, not a year, not 10 years from now--today. Ending catch and  release is exactly what our communities need to get some relief.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
