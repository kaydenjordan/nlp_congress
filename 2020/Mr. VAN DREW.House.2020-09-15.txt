 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Caleb Schumacher  on the enormous feat of making Eagle Scout. I was proud to join Caleb  and his family this past weekend in Ocean City.   Caleb's Eagle Scout project was a flag drop box so that flags can be  disposed of properly. Caleb's grandfather, who served as a sergeant in  the Army in the Korean war, was the inspiration for this project. Caleb  plans to become a computer engineer, and I know his intelligence and  his drive will push him to accomplish anything he puts to his mind.   Mr. Speaker, I am so very proud of Caleb. I know his mom, dad, and  sisters are proud of him as well. His leadership skills and work ethic  will serve him well, and I know he is destined for great things in  life.   Some folks look to movie stars or, heaven forbid, politicians as  their idols. I always look to people like Caleb. He inspires me.   Caleb, God bless you and your family, and God bless America.                            ____________________
