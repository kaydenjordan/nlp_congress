 Mr. President, each spring, women from across  the Volunteer State gather to vie for the title of Miss Tennessee USA.  Those who shine brightest earn the privilege of competing for Miss  USA's coveted crown; but more importantly, they set an example for  young women in their own communities.   For 30 years, my friend and fellow Tennessean Kim Greenwood has  mentored scores of dreamers seeking their place in this family of civic  leaders. As executive director of the Miss Tennessee USA and Miss  Tennessee Teen USA State Pageants, Kim has transformed these  competitions into opportunities for growth and self-discovery. A former  Tennessee Junior Miss and Miss Tennessee USA herself, she knows better  than most how to empower ambitious young women to become positive  examples of service and success that will transform the lives of little  girls back home.   On behalf of all Tennesseans, I want to thank Kim for helping so many  young women harness their potential and build for themselves the  beautiful and fulfilling lives they have always dreamed of.                            ____________________
