 Madam President, I have a profound reverence for life  and an abiding respect for choice. I believe a patient's room is too  small a place for a patient, her doctor, and the Federal Government.  Healthcare decisions should be made by a patient in consultation with  their doctor. It is important to me that every person, no matter race,  gender, creed, or socioeconomic status, has access to affordable  healthcare. This includes family planning and reproductive services.  Regretfully, I was unable to cast my vote on the motion to invoke  cloture on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 139, H.R. 3755,  Women's Health Protection Act, on February 28, 2022. Had I been  present, however, I would have proudly voted yes to invoke cloture on  the motion to proceed to H.R. 3755.                            ____________________
