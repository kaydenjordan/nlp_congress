 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and service of Sergeant Gerald Dixon of the Edmond Police Department.   Sergeant Dixon has faithfully served our community for 32 years, 13  of which he spent as a school resource officer.   In his time as an SRO, Sergeant Dixon has had a long-lasting impact  on countless students in Edmond. Years after graduating, students still  recall how much his presence meant to them. Looked up to as a great man  and a fixture of school, Sergeant Dixon's commitment to his community  is evident.   Not only has Sergeant Dixon's presence helped make school a safe  place, but his leadership, warm spirit, and love for his job also made  students comfortable. They confided their struggles in him, shared  countless experiences, and are better off from having Sergeant Dixon  serve in their school.   Madam Speaker, Sergeant Dixon has dedicated his life to the community  and made countless sacrifices to ensure the safety of our students and  the public at large. I am truly honored and humbled to recognize Mr.  Dixon, and I am grateful for his service and the legacy he leaves  behind. I wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
