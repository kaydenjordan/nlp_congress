 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of H.R. 2353. It has  been a year since this House passed reauthorization, and I am thrilled  the Senate finally took action to pass the bill earlier this week.   This legislation is vital to supporting career and technical  education, such as apprenticeship programs, all across my district.   As I have spoken with folks back home, I have heard time and time  again from businessowners the importance of training a new generation  of skilled workers. Many of the current employees are nearing  retirement age, and these businessowners are facing an ever-shrinking  pool of skilled labor.   I also see students seeking more opportunities other than a 4-year  degree.   CTE programs are a solution for both of these groups, and I am proud  that there are so many examples of this in the Third District of  Georgia.   In fact, today, Kathy Carlisle from the THINC Academy in LaGrange,  Georgia, testified in front of the Education and the Workforce  Committee. Dr. Carlisle shared how THINC has contributed to a community  revitalization success story and what happens when the local leaders of  the business community and innovative educators come together.    This bill will continue these opportunities, increasing  funding, and giving States more flexibility to implement innovative  programs.   Most importantly, a diverse group of members from our community from  all socioeconomic backgrounds stand on the edge of success, and this  will help get them there.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to seeing this bill pass, and I urge  everyone to support it.
