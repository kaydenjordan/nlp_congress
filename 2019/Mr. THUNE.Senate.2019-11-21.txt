 Madam President, I would like to comment on the Hong Kong  legislation that we passed this week. Tuesday night, the Senate  unanimously passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, led by  Senators Rubio and Cardin, Foreign Relations Chairman Risch, and  Ranking Member Menendez, and a supporting cast of colleagues. This bill  is intended to spur Hong Kong officials and pro-Beijing constituencies  to protect Hong Kong's autonomy and its special relationship with the  United States and to hold those committing human rights violations in  Hong Kong accountable. It builds on the 1992 United States-Hong Kong  Policy Act, which asserts that the United States has a ``strong  interest in the continued vitality, prosperity, and stability of Hong  Kong.'' I am grateful for the leadership of the Senators who worked to  advance this bill.   The issue at hand is Hong Kong's right to an independent judicial  system and its unique status in a one-country, two-system construct.  The bill that spurred the June protests in Hong Kong--a bill pushed by  the communist Chinese central government that sought to impose  extraditions from Hong Kong to mainland China--would have directly  undercut this judicial independence. This bill has been withdrawn, but  a number of other grievances have boiled over into protests.   Hong Kong's autonomy is under attack, and China is posturing to  ``mainlandize'' their economy. Recent educational reforms seek to  undermine Hong Kong's culture and traditions through compulsory  Mandarin classes instead of the Cantonese that most Hongkongers speak.  The Chinese Government will say that westerners have the wrong  impression of what is going on there, that this is strictly an internal  matter. We beg to differ. There are more than 85,000 American citizens  in Hong Kong. Moreover, the human rights of the people of Hong Kong are  directly tied to U.S. interests in Hong Kong and Hong Kong's economic  prosperity.   China has threatened repercussions if the Hong Kong Human Rights and  Democracy Act is enacted. I imagine China is fearful that attention to  human rights abuses in Hong Kong will draw increased attention to other  human rights abuses in China, such as the estimated 1.5 million Muslim  Uighurs in forced detention in one of China's western provinces.   Papers leaked this week from the government of the Communist Party  and General Secretary Xi detail the coercive ``reeducation'' that goes  on in these internment camps. Christians in China also face regular  persecution and imprisonment for following their faith and living out  their beliefs. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act will help  shed increased light on Beijing's aggression and on human rights abuses  in Hong Kong.   Last night, the House sent this Senate bill to the President's desk  with a resounding 417-to-1 vote--a clear statement that Congress stands  with Hong Kong.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Louisiana (Mr. Cassidy) and the Senator from Arkansas (Mr.  Cotton).   [[Page S6735]]         The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Louisiana (Mr. Cassidy).    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Louisiana (Mr. Cassidy).    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Louisiana (Mr. Cassidy), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson),  and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran)  would have voted ``yea.''
