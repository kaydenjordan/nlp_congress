 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 57,  expressing the sense of Congress supporting the State of Israel.   Israel, the historic homeland of the Jewish people, is a robust,  thriving, multiracial, multiethnic, and multireligious democracy that  shares our democratic values. Like the United States, Israel is not  perfect. It has challenges and policies that are openly criticized,  often by the Israeli people themselves.   Let me be clear. Israel is not now and never has been a racist state.  That characterization is contrary to the facts. It is an untrue and  unfair characterization that slanders our strongest ally in the region.   Significantly, Israel is the world's only Jewish state. Prior to its  founding, Jews suffered centuries of persecution with no country, not  one that would guarantee their safe haven. Since its founding, Israel  has valued equal rights for all its citizens. It has provided a home to  Jewish refugees from all across the globe, from Ethiopia to the Soviet  Union to Argentina to Ukraine, all while living under threat from  neighbors and terrorist groups dedicated to Israel's destruction.   Too often, divisive voices are quick to demonize Israel. Today, we  reaffirm our commitment to the U.S.-Israel relationship. Tomorrow, I  will be proud to welcome President Herzog to a historic joint meeting  of Congress where the bipartisan majority of this body will stand  together to commemorate and cherish the U.S.-Israel relationship.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting to support  this straightforward resolution and stand with our democratic ally  Israel.
