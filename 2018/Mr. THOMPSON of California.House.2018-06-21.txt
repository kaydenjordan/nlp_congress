 Mr. Speaker, the President created a  humanitarian crisis that inflicts lasting trauma on children when he  mandated that they be taken from their parents at the border.   The President's executive action just trades one trauma for another  by locking up children indefinitely.   This is about the lives and the wellbeing of children. There are more  than 2,000 kids who were taken from their parents. I want people  watching this to think about those children. The President chose to put  them through this to push his harmful and abusive immigration policies.   The Speaker could allow a vote on bipartisan immigration bills today  to reform our immigration system and to put an end to the President's  policy of traumatizing these kids.   Congress needs to stand up and fix our broken immigration system and  put an end to the deplorable tactics of this administration.   Mr. Speaker, this isn't who we are as a Nation. We need to fix our  immigration system and save these kids.
