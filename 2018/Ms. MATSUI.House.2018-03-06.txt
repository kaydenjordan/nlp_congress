 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that today we are reauthorizing  the Federal Communications Commission through the RAY BAUM'S Act,  which, among other things, ensures our local broadcasters have the  resources they need and will deliver additional spectrum into the  commercial marketplace. Spectrum is the invisible infrastructure that  supports our wireless economy.   As the way we do business continues to depend on connectivity and  mobility, spectrum will be a part of everything from remote health  monitoring to precision agriculture, to public safety communications  and connected devices.   That is why I am pleased that this package includes several of my  priorities, including my Spectrum Auction Deposits Act, which I  coauthored with Congressman Guthrie. This legislation will enable the  FCC to continue to conduct auctions that will unlock the spectrum  necessary to deploy next generation broadband networks. Without this  fix, auctions to deliver more spectrum into the commercial marketplace  may be put on hold indefinitely.   This package also includes my legislation to create a Federal  spectrum challenge prize, which would accelerate the development and  commercialization of innovative technologies to make spectrum use more  efficient.   It could also facilitate the application of existing technologies,  such as blockchain, to develop spectrum sharing mechanisms that will  allow providers to access spectrum on a real-time basis.   This bipartisan legislation will promote the expansion of current and  next generation broadband networks across America. It is an important  step forward, and I am proud to support its passage.
