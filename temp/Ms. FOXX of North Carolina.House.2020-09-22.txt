 Mr. Speaker, maligned policies from  Democrats that seek to defund, destroy, and dismantle our country are  dangerous. Quite frankly, these policies pose a threat to the liberties  and freedoms that define the American dream as we know it. Republicans  understand this threat, and we refuse to sit idly on the sidelines.   That is why we have developed our Commitment to America. The message  is simple. Restoring, renewing, and rebuilding America is a mandate  that we must work every day to uphold. We are fighting for families,  for generations of Americans to come, and for a country that has always  served as a beacon of hope to the world.   In short, it is a blueprint that gets our country back on track. The  American people deserve leaders who fight for freedom, the values that  we hold dear, and the promise of the American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, at such a pivotal moment in the history of our country,  we must work to advance policies that are pro-growth, pro-family, and  pro-America. Anything less is unacceptable.   Time and time again Democrats have turned their backs on the American  people with a ``my way or the highway'' approach to legislating.   This year alone, the House of Representatives has taken up a myriad  of bipartisan messaging bills that do nothing to help our country. If  anything, these bills send a concerning message about the Democrat  vision for America.   Substantive legislation has been pushed to the back burner, the  spirit of bipartisanship has been rendered virtually nonexistent, and  political posturing has replaced meaningful conversations on pressing  issues. We have had ample opportunities to work together, but Democrats  have taken it upon themselves to prolong a partisan blockade that  stifles progress.   Mr. Speaker, that is wrong and that is not leadership. Leadership is  fighting for the American people at every turn. Leadership is defending  the promises of the American Dream. Leadership is advancing policies  that raise America to new heights.   I am proud to stand alongside Leader McCarthy and my Republican  colleagues as we chart a meaningful pathway forward. The road ahead may  seem uncertain, or even arduous, but we are confident that with  steadfast leadership and commonsense policies, America will flourish.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, Democrats love to throw  around the term ``constitutional crisis'' to distract the American  people from the facts.   Was it a constitutional crisis when 22 past Presidents made Supreme  Court nominations in election years? We didn't hear Democrats harping  then, but we sure do now.   Democrats believe that the vacancy on the Supreme Court is theirs for  the taking, and they claim it would be illegal for President Trump to  appoint a Justice this year. It is absurd to say that a duly-elected  President fulfilling his constitutional duty is illegal.   Democrats aren't respecting the Constitution; they are using their  distorted interpretation of it to justify attacking President Trump for  simply doing his job. The seat must be filled without delay.                            ____________________
