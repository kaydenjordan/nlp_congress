 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw  attention to our Nation's abandoned coal mines.  [[Page H8232]]    Pennsylvania's heritage is rooted in coal. It powered an industrial  revolution and won two world wars. However, as more and more coal mines  continue to shut their doors, properly closing these mines is  incredibly important.   Of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, 43 have abandoned mine lands. My  district, Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District, has the most,  nationwide. These sites are a danger to the environment and to  Pennsylvania's residents.   To take action on this, I was pleased to join my colleague,  Representative Matt Cartwright from Pennsylvania's Eighth Congressional  District, in introducing H.R. 4248, the Abandoned Mine Land  Reauthorization Act.   The Abandoned Mine Land trust fund is set to expire in September of  2021. This bill will not only reauthorize the fund for the next 15  years, but helps for economic growth in coal communities impacted by  mine closures.   Since 1977, the AML program has eliminated over 46,000 open mine  portals, and reauthorizing the AML trust fund is critical to continued  progress.                            ____________________
