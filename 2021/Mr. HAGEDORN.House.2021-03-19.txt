 Mr. Speaker, March is Kidney Cancer Awareness Month,  and frankly, every month is cancer awareness month.   Two years ago, I was diagnosed with stage IV kidney cancer, and ever  since, I have received treatment and great care from the Mayo Clinic in  Rochester, Minnesota.   Two months ago, they removed my kidney, and I am very grateful to say  that, just this week, my doctor said ``no cancer detected'' at this  time.   But here is the point about this: My cancer was found through a  routine physical. I had no symptoms.   In this past year, millions of Americans have, for whatever reason,  coronavirus or otherwise, postponed or canceled their doctor's visits  and aren't getting the cancer screenings they have in the past.   I encourage everyone to make sure you get out there, see your doctor  regularly, get looked into, because the earliest possible detection of  serious illness can literally save your life. I am someone who can  attest to that.   To my fellow cancer survivors, hang in there. Keep fighting because  cures are coming along every day. And, Mr. Speaker, it is uncanny how  family, friends, medical professionals, total strangers, they rally  around us and help us fight.                            ____________________
