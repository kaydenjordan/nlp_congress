 Mr. Speaker, if the other side of the aisle thought this  was such an important bill, they should have brought it to the floor.  That is what we do here.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment before us. It is  staggering that the Republicans have the United States careening toward  another government shutdown.   The American people do not want a shutdown. Hundreds of thousands of  workers will be sent home. Many others will continue to work without  pay. Parks and museums will close down. In fact, according to the  estimates by The Connecticut Mirror, this Trump shutdown--and he does  own it--could impact as many as 1,500 Federal employees in Connecticut,  right before the holidays.   The American people don't want a wall. It does not reflect our values  as a nation. Experts are telling us it is not an effective use of  taxpayer dollars with regards to maintaining border security. It is  money we should be spending on working families, on roads and schools  in our communities, not a fence in the desert.   It is not just a border wall, which was a nonstarter. Disaster relief  provisions of the CR are inadequate. It fails to meet the communities  devastated by disaster, risking the future of children who suffer from  severe trauma. Communities are still picking up the pieces.   It leaves out $600 million of antihunger and nutrition support for  women, infants, and children in Puerto Rico. That is unacceptable.   The President and the Republicans have two choices: perform the basic  job of governing and keep the government open, or perform for Fox News.  They have chosen the latter. It is an outrageous tantrum. This is not  government for the people and by the people. It is government by  tantrum and tweets.   Please vote ``no.''
