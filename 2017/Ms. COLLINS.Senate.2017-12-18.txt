 Madam President, I rise to express my support for the  conference agreement on the Tax Cuts and Job Act, the first major  overhaul of our Tax Code since 1986. This legislation will provide tax  relief to working families, encourage the creation of jobs right here  in America, and spur economic growth that will benefit all Americans.   Let me start by discussing the effects of this bill on individuals  and families. Throughout this debate, I have emphasized that reforms to  our outdated Tax Code must help working families. I, therefore,  authored three key amendments that were retained in the final package.   My amendments allow families to deduct up to $10,000 in State and  local taxes, increase the deduction for medical expenses, and protect  tax-free contributions for retirement savings.   The original Senate bill would have eliminated the deduction known as  SALT that allows taxpayers to avoid paying a Federal tax on State and  local taxes that they have already paid. This provision has been in the  Tax Code since 1913, when the income tax was first established. It is  intended to prevent double taxation. My amendment, which was adopted by  the Senate, restored the deduction for property taxes up to $10,000. I  am pleased that the final bill goes a step further by allowing the  deduction of property and income or sales taxes up to this level, which  will assist even more Americans.   My work to restore this deduction is especially important to families  living in high-tax States like Maine, which has one of our Nation's  highest tax burdens; yet Maine's per capita income ranks only 31st,  which is nearly $5,200 below the U.S. average. Maintaining this  deduction therefore provides important tax relief for those Mainers who  itemize.   My second amendment included in the conference agreement is a very  important one. It is aimed at helping Americans struggling with high,  unreimbursed healthcare costs, including seniors paying for long-term  care for a loved one and those with expensive chronic healthcare  conditions. My amendment lowers the threshold for claiming this  deduction for these unreimbursed expenses from 10 percent to 7.5  percent of income for 2017 and 2018.   The House bill would have eliminated this longstanding deduction used  by approximately 8.8 million Americans annually, nearly half of whom  make less than $50,000 per year. Retaining this important deduction and  lowering the threshold will provide relief for those experiencing  particularly high healthcare costs. That is why AARP and 44 other  consumer groups strongly endorsed my amendments, stating: ``It provides  important tax relief which helps offset the costs of acute and chronic  medical conditions for older Americans, children, pregnant women,  disabled individuals and other adults, as well as the costs associated  with long-term care and assisted living.''   At a time when we need to be encouraging Americans to save more for  their retirement, I am encouraged that the final agreement preserves  the pretax contribution limits for retirement savings plans. We are in  the midst of a silent but looming retirement security crisis in this  country. According to the nonpartisan Center for Retirement Research,  there is a $7.7 trillion gap between the savings that American  households need to maintain their standard of living in retirement and  what they actually have saved.   We should be doing everything we can to encourage more saving, not  less. For this reason, I am pleased that the final bill will include my  third amendment, which struck the original Senate language eliminating  the ability of public employees, such as firefighters, schoolteachers,  and police officers, as well as clergy and those employed by charities  and nonprofit organizations, to make what are called catch-up  contributions to their retirement accounts. These employees are  generally paid less than their counterparts employed by for-profit  companies and thus are less able to save for their retirement. My  provision would allow them to continue making these important extra  investments toward a secure retirement.   The conference agreement benefits lower and middle-income taxpayers  significantly, while simplifying the tasks that no one relishes of  completing their tax returns.   Significantly, this bill nearly doubles the standard deduction to  $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for those filing jointly. The  child tax credit will be doubled from $1,000 to $2,000. Thanks to  Senator Rubio's efforts, which I strongly supported, up to $1,400 of  that tax credit will be refundable in order to benefit low-income  families.   Let's be more concrete. What do these reforms mean to families across  our country? The 72 percent of Mainers who already use the standard  deduction will have their taxes reduced. A family with $24,000 in  income will pay no Federal income tax. A single mom earning $35,000 a  year with one child will see her taxes drop by nearly 4,000 percent.  Instead of paying money back to Washington, she will be getting back  nearly $1,100 to help her make ends meet. A couple with no children  earning $60,000 will see their taxes fall by more than $900. A couple  with two children earning $60,000 will get a tax cut of about $1,700.  That is a reduction of more than 100 percent. The bottom line is that  most Maine households will see their taxes go down.   I was very concerned about a number of important deductions for  individuals that would have been eliminated under the House bill.   Having worked at Husson University in Bangor before my election to  the Senate, I am well aware of how critical education deductions and  credits are to our students and their families; therefore, I had  several fruitful discussions with a key conferee, Senator Rob Portman,  about preserving those deductions that help students afford higher  education. I appreciate his strong advocacy for these provisions that I  care so much about as a result of  [[Page S8059]]  my direct experience working with college students. In fact, one of the  very first bills that I introduced in the Senate as a new Senator in  1997 was to provide a deduction for interest paid on student loans. The  conference agreement maintains that deductibility of interest on  student loans, as well as the tax exemption for employer-provided  tuition assistance and for graduate student tuition waivers. All of  those important deductions are maintained in this bill and will help  Americans improve their earnings because of the increased education  they will have.   The bill also maintains a $250 deduction--a provision I authored some  15 years ago--that allows teachers to deduct the costs of classroom  supplies they purchase with their own money. Having visited more than  200 schools in the State of Maine, I know firsthand how dedicated  teachers dig deep into their own pockets to buy supplies to enhance the  education of their students.   In addition, this bill would modernize the ABLE accounts, which are  tax-preferred savings accounts essential for providing long-term  support for individuals with disabilities and their families.   The bill also continues the tax credit to encourage adoptions.   The final agreement also preserves a number of deductions and credits  that are so important to our communities. I worked hard to preserve the  historic tax credit so businesses rehabilitating older buildings in  communities like Lewiston, ME, will continue to do so.   I am also pleased that private activity bonds, which are vital to  many hospitals and institutions of higher education, are continued, as  are the affordable housing and new markets tax credits. We have found  proven ways to encourage public-private partnerships, and we ought to  continue to incentivize these important partnerships.   How this legislation treats employers has also been the subject of  much debate, but the reality is the United States cannot continue to  have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world at 35  percent. We are losing jobs as businesses make the calculation to  invest overseas.   I have talked to the executives of General Dynamics, which owns Bath  Iron Works in Maine and employs more than 5,000 Mainers; to United  Technology, which employs more than 1,900 people in North Berwick at  its Pratt & Whitney plant; to General Electric, which has a major plant  in Bangor; to Proctor & Gamble, which employs 400 workers in Auburn;  and to Idexx, which is such an important high-tech employer in  Westbrook, about the positive difference this legislation will make in  their ability to create jobs in America.   New Balance, which has about 900 workers in Maine manufacturing  footwear, describes the tax reforms as follows: ``New Balance will be  more competitive and manufacture more footwear in Maine that we can  export across the globe.''   This significant Maine employer went on to say: ``Companies like New  Balance, which already has a strong domestic manufacturing presence,  will be able to increase investments in their facilities and be more  globally competitive while remaining a U.S. company hiring U.S.  workers.''   These words are echoed by the manager of the Pratt & Whitney plant  who wrote to me: ``The reforms . . . will allow companies like ours to  bring home earnings from abroad to invest in research and development,  advanced manufacturing, energy efficiency, and workforce initiatives. .  . . Pratt & Whitney plans to hire thousands of people over the next  several years across our U.S. operations, and this tax reform will  further support our efforts.''   Isn't that what we seek? Isn't that what tax reform should bring  about--more jobs, right here in America?   The bill also includes changes important for our small businesses  which employ nearly half of all workers and generate two out of three  net new jobs in our country. They are the true engine of our economy,  especially in the great State of Maine. The bill would provide tax  relief that enables them to create more jobs, increase paychecks, and  grow our economy.   As the president of the Retail Association of Maine recently  commented about this tax reform bill, ``For Maine and its nearly 9,000  retail establishments and the more than 80,000 retail jobs, this is  welcome relief for small businesses.''   According to the National Federation of Independent Business, Maine  ranks fifth in the Nation for the share of workers employed by  passthrough businesses, as most small employers are structured. The  NFIB, our Nation's small business advocacy group, has strongly endorsed  this final bill.   Small businesses make an outsized contribution to our Nation's  economy; yet they face a tax burden that can reach nearly 40 percent at  the Federal level and can be significantly higher than the corporate  tax rates paid by larger firms. Small businesses are forced to devote  more resources to tax payments and fewer resources to creating good  jobs and investing in their communities. This bill provides important  tax relief to small businesses that are the backbone of our economy.   Let's listen to the words of some of the small businesses from Maine  that have written or talked to me. The owner of Windham Millwork, an  architectural woodworking company, described the relief for small  businesses and how it will help manufacturing workers and families this  way: ``Most importantly, it means Windham Millwork will have more money  to spend on what matters--our workers and community. With the money  we'll save, we can create new jobs or offer better pay to our workforce  . . . which helps everyone in our community and contributes to a  growing Maine economy.''    The innkeeper of the Nonantum Resort in Kennebunkport noted: ``This  tax reform bill helps level the playing field for small businesses not  only in the hotel industry, but across the economy. With a lower tax  burden, small businesses in all industries can continue to grow,  creating more jobs.''   Moreover, a family-owned business in southern Maine described for me  how the bill would benefit Maine companies and the people who work for  them: ``When [companies] become more profitable, they reinvest faster,  grow faster, and increase profit-sharing. Employees benefit when  companies grow. There are more jobs, more opportunities, more security,  more mobility, more innovation.''   Tax reform should spur this kind of economic growth. The weak growth  and stagnant wages we have seen in recent years cannot be accepted as  the new normal for our country. It is clear where the current path  would lead if we do not act. CBO projects the current slow growth of  just 1.9 percent per year will continue throughout the next decade--far  below the historic average of 3 percent. This would result in our  public debt exceeding 90 percent of GDP by 2027, just as our  obligations to the baby boom generation begin to crest.   Surely, we can do better. Tax relief and reform will lift our  economy, leading to higher wages for workers and more revenue for  government. Extrapolating from a CBO estimate, an increase of just  four-tenths of 1 percent in economic growth could produce revenues that  are in excess of $1 trillion over the next 10 years.   If we remain on our present trajectory, however, growth will remain  stagnant. Continued slow growth will crowd out many funding priorities,  harm our national security, place significant strain on Federal  programs, and impose a burden on our children and our grandchildren. We  must act now to reignite the engine of growth, to provide for the next  generation the same promise of a brighter future we received from those  who came before us.   Finally, let me discuss the critical issue of healthcare. It has been  deeply disturbing to see seniors frightened about the possibility that  this tax bill could trigger an automatic 4-percent cut in the vital  Medicare Program. Although I knew that the law that could cause this  reduction has been waived 16 times, I felt it was essential that our  leaders publicly commit that Medicare reductions would not be triggered  by this legislation. I don't know of any Senator on either side of the  aisle who is seeking to have an automatic 4-percent cut in Medicare go  into effect.   I ask unanimous consent that my exchange of correspondence with the  Senate majority leader be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my  statement.  [[Page S8060]]    This pledge is ironclad and, I hope, reassuring to our seniors.   I am also concerned about the inclusion of the repeal of the  individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act as part of this tax bill.  I don't think the two issues should have been combined, but let me be  very clear: I have never supported the individual mandate. There is a  big difference between fining people who choose to go without health  insurance versus the bills considered last summer and fall that would  have taken away insurance coverage from people who have it and want it.  Those bills also would have made sweeping cuts in the Medicaid Program.   The financial penalty under the individual mandate for failing to  comply with it falls disproportionately on lower-income Americans.  Eighty percent of those who pay the fine make under $50,000 a year. For  many of these individuals, the cost of insurance under the ACA is  simply unaffordable. Individuals making 250 percent of the Federal  poverty level--that is just over $30,000--are not eligible for the  subsidies to reduce deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs that are  known as the cost-sharing reductions. So, essentially, the insurance  they are being fined for, if they don't buy, is virtually useless to  them because the deductibles and the copays are so high, and if they  make over 250 percent of the poverty level--over $30,000 a year--they  cannot afford it.   I want to make an important point that has been overlooked in this  debate. Any Senator, Democratic or Republican, could have offered an  amendment on the Senate floor to strike the repeal of the individual  mandate. None--not one--chose to do so. That is telling, indeed, and  reflects both how unpopular the mandate is and how burdensome its  impact is.    Nevertheless, repealing the individual mandate without other  healthcare reforms will almost certainly lead to further increases in  the costs of health insurance premiums that are already too expensive  under the ACA.   For these reasons, I have made it a priority to secure passage of two  bipartisan bills that will help make health insurance more affordable.  Shouldn't that be a goal that all of us can embrace? Both of these  bills have the support of the President, the Vice President, and the  Senate Republican leaders. In fact, Majority Leader McConnell and I  engaged in a colloquy affirming that commitment.   The first bill, the Bipartisan Healthcare Stabilization Act,  sponsored by Senators Alexander and Murray, will provide vital funding  to help low-income families pay their out-of-pocket costs, including  deductibles and copays associated with certain ACA health insurance. I  am proud to be one of the 22 cosponsors of the bipartisan Alexander- Murray bill.   The second is a bipartisan bill that I introduced with my friend and  colleague Senator Bill Nelson. It would protect people with preexisting  conditions while lowering the cost of health insurance through the use  of high-risk pools. This plan will provide $5 billion annually for 2  years in seed money for States to establish invisible high-risk pools  or traditional reinsurance programs.   We don't have to guess about the impact. I am going to quote some  actuarial studies shortly. The fact is that we know from experience in  States like Maine and Alaska that high-risk pools can help to lower  premiums substantially, by an average of 20 percent.   Analyses show that enactment of these two bills together will reduce  the cost of health insurance, thus making it more affordable. According  to analysis by experts at Oliver Wyman, the passage of these bills will  more than offset the premium increases caused by the repeal of the  individual mandate. In fact, Oliver Wyman suggests in its estimate that  the $5 billion in funding would be sufficient to allow States to  leverage more than $15 billion in reinsurance coverage, and it would  result in premiums that were more than 20 percent lower than if the  individual mandate were repealed and the package of provisions were not  implemented.   Furthermore, analysis by experts at Avalere project that ``in  combination, CSR funding and $5B in annual reinsurance could lower 2019  premiums by 18% and increase enrollment by 1.3M people.''   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners wrote that these  two bills would significantly reduce health insurance premiums and help  promote more stability in insurance markets. The NAIC said: ``Providing  reliable federal funding to reimburse health insurance carriers for the  Cost-Sharing Reduction (CSR) program assistance they give to low-income  consumers and grants for states to establish invisible high risk pools  or reinsurance programs would reduce premium increases as much as 20  percent and could encourage some carriers to stay in the market.''   In evaluating this bill, the question we should ask is not, Does this  tax cut make Washington better off? The right question to ask is, Does  this tax cut make the American people better off? The answer to that  question is yes.   The bill puts money back into the pockets of American taxpayers with  tax cuts beginning January 1. As soon as the IRS updates withholding  tables this winter, taxpayers will see the benefit of this bill in  their paychecks. Over time, Americans will also see more benefit from  this legislation in the form of higher wages. Businesses, small and  large, will make the investments that will create more jobs.    Madam President, I will cast my vote in support of the  conference agreement on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While it is by no  means perfect, on balance, this reform bill will provide much needed  tax relief. It will benefit lower and middle-income families, while  spurring the creation of good jobs and greater economic growth.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                  Washington, DC, November 28, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell: I write to express my deep       concerns with the Congressional Budget Office's determination       that an automatic four percent cut to Medicare, estimated to       be roughly $25 billion for fiscal year 2018, could be       triggered by the passage of tax reform legislation as a       result of the Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) even though       there is no intention for such a reduction to occur.        Since I do not believe it is anyone's intention to allow       automatic cuts to Medicare to occur, I urge swift action to       waive the PAYGO requirements. Medicare provides essential       benefits to our nation's seniors, and we must remove       immediately the threat that an automatic reduction in the       program's funding could occur.        Since PAYGO was enacted, sixteen laws that would have       otherwise triggered PAYGO's automatic spending cuts have       included provisions to exclude all or part of the law's       budgetary impact, including the American Taxpayer Relief Act       of 2012 that was enacted under the previous Administration.        I look forward to working with you to ensure that no       Medicare cuts are triggered under PAYGO, a goal I believe is       supported by members on both sides of the aisle. Thank you       for your attention to this critical issue.            Sincerely,                                                  Susan M. Collins,      United States Senator.                                   ____                                     U.S. Senate, Majority Leader,                                   Washington, DC, December 1, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your letter expressing       concern about the across-the-board spending cuts. You will be       pleased to know that Speaker Paul Ryan and I issued the       following joint statement earlier today:        ``Critics of tax reform are claiming the legislation would       lead to massive, across-the-board spending cuts in vital       programs--including a 4-percent reduction in Medicare--due to       the Pay-Go law enacted in 2010. This will not happen.       Congress has readily available methods to waive this law,       which has never been enforced since its enactment. There is       no reason to believe that Congress would not act again to       prevent a sequester, and we will work to ensure these       spending cuts are prevented.''        Again, thank you.            Sincerely,                                                   Mitch McConnell,                                                   Majority Leader.     Madam President, I thank Senator Nelson. I say, through  the Chair, that is very gracious of the Senator. I have completed my  statement. Thank you.  [[Page S8061]]     Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague from  Illinois, Senator Duckworth, in introducing the Promoting Women in the  Aviation Workforce Act of 2017. Our bill seeks to encourage and support  women pursuing careers in the field of aviation.   As Chairman of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee,  I believe it is important to help women achieve their professional  aspirations across all transportation sectors. Although women make up  over 50 percent of our Nation's workforce, they are significantly  underrepresented in the aviation industry, representing only two  percent of airline mechanics, four percent of flight engineers, five  percent of repairmen, six percent of pilots, 18 percent of flight  dispatchers, and 26 percent of air traffic controllers.   Our bill expresses the sense of Congress that the aviation industry  should explore the possibility of offering opportunities, such as pilot  training, STEM education, and mentorship programs, which would help to  encourage women to pursue aviation careers from a young age.   In addition, our bill would direct the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) to create and manage a Women in Aviation Advisory  Board to hold the industry accountable for providing education,  training, mentorship, outreach, and recruitment programs that are aimed  at women.   Finally, in another effort to improve the availability and quality of  educational opportunities for women pursuing careers in aviation, this  legislation would require that the FAA submit a report to Congress on  current trends concerning women in aviation and the potential for  expanding related programming.   Mr. President, I believe this bill will have a positive impact on the  workforce supporting one of our country's leading industries. I want to  thank Senator Duckworth for partnering with me on this effort, and urge  my colleagues to support this legislation.
