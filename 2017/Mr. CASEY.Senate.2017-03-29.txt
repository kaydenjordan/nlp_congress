 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted  to speak as in morning business.    Mr. President, I rise to express my grave concern about  Russian aggression and interference in our political system. My  concerns have been compounded over the last several weeks by the  response to these allegations by President Trump and his  administration.   First, let's step back for a moment. We know that the Russian  Federation is an adversary of the United States. That is without  question. Vladimir Putin is what I would like to call a 24-hour bad  guy. There are a lot of other ways to express it, but that is one way.  There is not a moment of the day when he isn't using his power to  undermine our Nation's interests and the interests of freedom and  democracy across the globe.   We know that the Russian regime kills journalists, jails and silences  their critics, and commits war crimes in places like Syria and Ukraine.  Russia meddles in elections throughout the Western world.   Mr. Putin has a warped world view. His view is that the freedom and  democratic rights of tens of millions of people in Europe should be  subject to the interests of a few in the Kremlin because those  countries lie within Russia's supposed sphere of influence.   The work done by our intelligence agencies indicates that Russia  meddled in our election with the intent of aiding President Trump. We  know that now. In January, our intelligence agencies concluded:         We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an       influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential       election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in       the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and       harm her electability and potential presidency. We further       assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear       preference for President-elect Trump.    That is what our intelligence agencies tell us, and I am quoting  verbatim from that basic finding.   President Trump's refusal to accept the assessment of our  intelligence agencies was deeply concerning--and that is an  understatement. My concerns were compounded by the fact that President  Trump ran on the most pro-Russian platform in modern history. Since  President Trump has taken  [[Page S2093]]  office, he has harshly criticized our allies, from Australia to Mexico,  yet when it comes to Russia's provocations and war crimes, President  Trump is silent.   This deference that President Trump shows to Mr. Putin is troubling  and, when combined with Russia's meddling in our election, it raises  profound questions that need answers. That is why I strongly support  the establishment of an independent commission to investigate Russia's  interference in our political system, and I believe that the Justice  Department must appoint a special counsel to investigate this matter as  well.   What the American people need to know, once and for all, is at least  three things: No. 1, what specific actions Russia took to aid President  Trump during the election; No. 2, whether U.S. persons had knowledge of  or were involved in these actions; and, finally, No. 3, whether  President Trump has financial entanglements with Russians associated  with the Putin regime.   You could probably add other questions, but I think they are the  three basic questions we have to answer.   So this is a grave problem with substantial national security  implications. My constituents agree, as I am sure is the case in every  other State. Just since January 1, more than 80,000 Pennsylvanians have  written to my office about Russia. That is 80,000 Pennsylvanians. These  are thoughtful letters from Pennsylvanians who are so concerned about  this issue that they took the time to write.   A constituent from Cumberland County, right in the middle of our  State, wrote:         I am bothered by the reports of Russia trying to interfere       with our democracy. I am particularly bothered by a lack of       transparency in the administration with news reports of AG       Sessions' undisclosed contact with Russia. Russia is having       the effect they wanted by shaking confidence in our system.    That is a constituent from Cumberland County.   Another constituent from Northampton County, along the eastern side  of our State, just north of Philadelphia, wrote this:         All politics aside, the investigation about Russia's       actions is a concern to our republic. . . . Ultimately, it       does not matter whether our elected officials are democrats       or republicans, but it does matter that we all always put       America's best interests first.    If the warnings from the U.S. intelligence community and the pleas  from 80,000-plus Pennsylvanians aren't enough, then let's look at the  numerous credible reports of contact between Russian officials and the  Trump team. This body of reporting grows every day.   On January 18, McClatchy reported that ``The FBI and five other law  enforcement and intelligence agencies have collaborated for months in  an investigation into Russian attempts to influence the November  election, including whether money from the Kremlin covertly aided  President-elect Donald Trump, two people familiar with the matter  said.''   On January 19, the Washington Post reported, ``U.S.  counterintelligence officials are sifting through intercepted  communications and financial data as part of a wider look at possible  ties between the Russian government and associates of President-elect  Donald Trump, officials said.''   Then again on January 19, the New York Times reported, ``American law  enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted  communications and financial transactions as part of a broad  investigation into possible links between Russian officials and  associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump, including his former  campaign chairman Paul Manafort, current and former senior American  officials said.''   We know that Mr. Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort,  previously worked for the Russian-backed President of Ukraine, Victor  Yanukovych. According to an August 2016 report by the New York Times,  ``Handwritten ledgers show $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments  designated for Mr. Manafort from Mr. Yanukovych's pro-Russian political  party from 2007 to 2012, according to Ukraine's newly formed National  Anti-Corruption Bureau.''   In February 2017, when confronted by the New York Times about reports  that Trump associates may have been in contact with Russian officials  during the election, Mr. Manafort said, ``It's not like these people  wear badges that say, `I'm a Russian intelligence officer.' ''   Then there is the case of a former member President Trump's foreign  policy advisory committee, Carter Page. In September of 2016, Yahoo's  Michael Isikoff reported, ``U.S. intelligence officials are seeking to  determine whether an American businessman identified by Donald Trump as  one of his foreign policy advisers has opened up private communications  with senior Russian officials--including talks about the possible  lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes  president, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the  issue.''   In an interview with PBS's Judy Woodruff, Mr. Page was asked whether  he met with Russian officials while he was on the Trump campaign. Ms.  Woodruff asked, ``Did you have any meetings--I will ask again--did you  have any meetings last year with Russian officials in Russia, outside  Russia, anywhere?'' Mr. Page answered, ``I had no meetings, no  meetings. I might have said hello to a few people as they were walking  by me at my graduation--the graduation speech that I gave in July, but  no meetings.''   Yet after USA Today reported that Mr. Page met with Russian  Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at the Republican National Convention, Mr.  Page told MSNBC's Chris Hayes that he would ``not deny'' meeting with  the Russian Ambassador.   Furthermore, reporting by both USA Today and CNN helped get to the  bottom of one of the enduring mysteries of this summer's Republican  National Convention: why was the effort to insert a provision into the  party's platform supporting lethal aid for Ukraine defeated? Last  summer, Mr. Manafort said that the decision to defeat the provision  supporting lethal aid ``absolutely did not come from the Trump  campaign.''   In January of 2017, the Washington Post's David Ignatius reported  that President Trump's National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn,  engaged in discussions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during  the transition as then-President Obama was applying sanctions against  Russia for its meddling in the U.S. elections. After the Russian  Foreign Ministry vowed retaliation for the Obama administration  sanctions, it was reported that several calls between Mr. Flynn and  Ambassador Kislyak took place. The next day, President Putin announced  he would not retaliate against the U.S. for the sanctions. The Nation  was told by the Vice President that Mr. Flynn's contact with the  Russian Ambassador was logistical in nature. Then it was revealed that  the issue of sanctions may have been discussed. Subsequently, General  Flynn resigned his position.   Then, there is the issue of President Trump's associate, Roger Stone,  who demonstrated in tweets last summer that he may have had advance  knowledge of some of the hacked material. In October 2016, Mr. Stone  admitted to a Miami TV station that he had ``back-channel  communications with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.'' Mr. Assange is  the founder of Wikileaks, the website that Russian hackers appear to  have used to deposit hacked documents during the 2016 campaign.   These revelations give credence to a February report by CNN: ``High- level advisers close to then-presidential nominee Donald Trump were in  constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to US  intelligence, multiple current and former intelligence, law enforcement  and administration officials tell CNN.''   This summary is an illustrative list of many of the credible reports  that are out there. Let's review just a few of the reports that have  come to light since our intelligence agencies released their  assessment.   In November of 2016, the President's spokesman at that time said:  ``The campaign had no contact with Russian officials,'' yet the Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister had stated that ``there were contacts during  the campaign.'' On January 19, the New York Times reported that the  communications of President Trump's former campaign manager, Paul  Manafort, his former foreign policy adviser, Carter Page, and his  longtime associate, Roger Stone, were under investigation for contacts  [[Page S2094]]  with the Russians. Yet despite that, President Trump continued to say  for weeks that all of these reports about an investigation and contacts  with Russian officials were so-called fake news.   We have learned that the Trump administration's dismissals of these  investigations and reports do not align with the facts. It seems that  the administration has a strategy for all of these allegations--dodge  and deceive, dodge and deceive.   After all the dodging and deceiving, sometimes we finally get  admissions of the truth. Again, the facts are disturbing and have  meaningful national security implications.   Here is an example of how these contacts may have actually changed  policy. This past summer, ABC's George Stephanopoulos asked President  Trump:         Then why did you soften the GOP platform on Ukraine?    Candidate Donald Trump responded:         I wasn't involved in that. Honestly, I was not involved.    In early March, USA Today reported that then-Trump advisers Carter  Page and J.D. Gordon met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at the  Republican Convention. In an interview with CNN, Mr. Gordon said that  the effort to remove support for lethal security assistance to Ukraine  from the Republican Party platform was done expressly to fulfill the  wishes of then-Candidate Trump.   Now it is not uncommon for foreign officials to attend conventions.  It is uncommon and completely, totally inappropriate for them to use  that platform to shape our Nation's policies by a change in a party  platform.   The dodging and deception continues. After insisting during his  confirmation hearing that he had no contacts with Russian officials, it  was reported that Attorney General Sessions, who was a top leader in  President Trump's campaign, did indeed meet with the Russian  Ambassador. There is nothing to hide about meeting with a foreign  ambassador. That is part of our job as Senators, and Attorney General  Sessions was a Member of the U.S. Senate. For example, in 2013, I met  with the Russian Ambassador to advocate for Pennsylvania families torn  apart by the Russian Government's ban on international adoptions. I was  there with a significant group of other Senators from both parties. But  why would Mr. Sessions provide incorrect information to the Judiciary  Committee, and why wouldn't he immediately correct the record? That is  a question that we have to ask, and that is a question that deserves an  answer.   Finally, there is the issue of President Trump himself. We know that  for many years he has expressed an interest in doing business in  Russia. In 2008, Mr. Trump's executive vice president for acquisitions  and development in his business said:         Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of       a lot of our assets; say, in Dubai, and certainly with our       project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of       money pouring in from Russia.    So if one takes all of these reports together, plus the ones I have  entered into the Record, one has to ask: What is going on? What is  going on with all this information?   That is why my constituents and I have questions. That is why we need  an independent commission and a special counsel appointed by the  Justice Department. The administration owes the American people  answers.   We cannot allow my constituent Pam's warning to come to fruition. We  cannot allow Russia to exploit political differences to shake  confidence in our democratic system. The United States has a proud  tradition of rule of law and checks and balances. These are things that  distinguish us from the autocratic and corrupt regimes around the  world.   The longer it takes to get to the bottom of these questions, the  longer it will be until we can get back to advancing meaningful  policies to resist Russian aggression and stand with our European  allies. We need to make a commitment to maintaining and expanding  sanctions on Russia for a variety of malign activities: No. 1, the  cyber attack on our elections; No. 2, their--the Russians'-- indiscriminate bombing of civilians in support of the Assad regime in  Syria; No. 3, their unabated support for separatists in eastern  Ukraine; No. 4, the Russians' continued illegal annexation of Crimea.   The American people and the people of Pennsylvania, as well, have had  enough of dodge and deceive on these issues. They want answers, and the  only way to get them is by way of an independent commission and a  special counsel.   The President and every Republican and every Democrat in the House  and the Senate in all of Congress need to say once and for all,  clearly, definitively, unequivocally: We will never allow this to  happen again, and then work together to make that a reality.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
