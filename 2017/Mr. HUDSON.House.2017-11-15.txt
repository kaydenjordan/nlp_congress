 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 3369, a bill recognizing the life and legacy of Howard B.  Pate, Jr., by naming the Spring Lake, North Carolina, Post Office in  his honor.   Born in Bladen County, North Carolina, in 1925, Mr. Pate first moved  to Spring Lake, a town in the Eighth Congressional District I am proud  to represent, where his father was stationed at Fort Bragg.   Being from a military family, when the United States entered World  War II, Mr. Pate answered the call to serve his country and continued  his service as a member of the North Carolina National Guard until  1952.   After finishing his military service, Mr. Pate assumed the position  of Spring Lake's postmaster. He served in this position for 30 years,  until his retirement in 1982.   After retiring, Mr. Pate remained active in the community as a member  of many civic organizations, including being named town historian in  1994, a post he held for more than two decades. For all his efforts,  the local Chamber of Commerce named their Volunteer of the Year award  after Mr. Pate.   The town of Spring Lake unanimously adopted a resolution to dedicate  their post office in honor of Mr.  [[Page H9292]]  Howard Pate, Jr., because there was never a person who embodied the  spirit of the community more than he.   Sadly, Mr. Pate passed away 1 year ago yesterday, on November 14,  2016. On the first anniversary of his passing, I can think of no better  way to honor his respected life than to name the post office after him  in a town he loved and where he lived and served most of his life.   As any Spring Lake resident will tell you, Mr. Pate was not only a  pillar of our community, but also a cherished friend. He worked  tirelessly to ensure we kept a strong grip on our past while making  Spring Lake a better place for future generations.   It is my honor to make sure he will always be a part of our legacy in  the future by naming the Spring Lake Post Office in his honor.
