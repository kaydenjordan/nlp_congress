 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4368, which  has been weaponized to further limit Americans' access to reproductive  healthcare. Hidden in this bill is an attempt to reinstate medically  unnecessary and outdated FDA policies that restrict access to  mifepristone, a safe, effective drug used in medication abortion and  miscarriage management care.   From the courts to Congress, my colleagues in the majority are  continuing their efforts to force burdensome restrictions that attack  our fundamental freedoms to make our own decisions about our own  bodies.                                time  2115    This funding bill is yet another example of political interference  into the scientific review process entrusted to the FDA by Congress. It  is a draconian attempt to strip away people's fundamental freedom to  make their own decisions, make their own medical decisions, rejecting  years of scientific and medical expertise and an extensive evidence- based review that showed mifepristone to be incredibly safe.   Mifepristone is safe and effective, and it is not the business of  Congress to substitute political judgments for the judgments of the  scientific and medical experts who determine FDA policy governing this  medication.   What is even more unfortunate is that this is just one of many  problematic aspects of this bill. As a member of the House Committee on  Agriculture, I could spend hours walking my colleagues through how  cutting funding to 2003 levels leaves our farmers and working families  behind.   I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who sit on the  Agriculture Committee with me do not view this to be a serious  proposal. I challenge them to think long and hard about how they will  communicate this to farmers back home before voting ``yes'' on this  bill.   For these reasons, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to  recommit this bill back to committee.   If the House rules permitted, I would have offered the motion with an  important amendment to this bill. My amendment would strike the  provisions rolling back FDA's guidance.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of my amendment, and I  hope my colleagues will join me in voting for the motion to recommit.         Ms. Budzinski moves to recommit the bill H.R. 4368 to the       Committee on Appropriations with the following amendment:        Page 109, beginning on line 1, strike section 761.
