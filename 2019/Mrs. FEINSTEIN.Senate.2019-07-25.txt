 Mr. President, I would like to speak about the  Prevention of Foreign Interference with Elections Act, which I  introduced in June.   The bill is cosponsored by all 10 Democratic members of the Judiciary  Committee, plus Senators Markey and Smith. This bill is necessary  because we know foreign actors are working to influence our elections.  The Mueller report showed us how Russia interfered in 2016, and we can  expect it to happen again in 2020. The bill's goal is to provide  enhanced criminal penalties to prevent foreign interference in our  elections. The bill makes five changes to current law in order to  accomplish that.   First, it explicitly makes it a crime to work with foreign nationals  to interfere in U.S. elections.   Second, the bill prohibits Americans from helping foreign nationals  funnel illegal contributions or donations into U.S. elections.   Third, the bill expands restrictions on foreign-financed election  ads. Notably, it restricts foreign-financed issue ads and foreign- financed digital ads.   Fourth, the bill creates a civil action so that when the Attorney  General learns of foreign interference, the Justice Department can  immediately get an injunction.   And fifth, the bill modifies immigration law so if a non-U.S. citizen  is convicted of interfering in our elections, they would be  inadmissible into the United States.   Unless we take action, Russia or another foreign power will interfere  with our elections. It is not a question of if, it is a question of  when.   We need to make clear that such interference will result in criminal  punishment, and we must update our election laws to combat these new  cyber attacks.   This bill accomplishes both. Thank you.                            ____________________
