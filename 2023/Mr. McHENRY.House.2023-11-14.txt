 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Ed Skala, who  this month celebrates 25 years of service to this august institution,  the United States House of Representatives.   For those of us who have had the privilege to work with Ed, one word  stands out above the rest, and that is dedication. His tireless  commitment to his craft and to our Financial Services Committee is  immediately noticed by all those who have been graced with his company.   His dedication is topped perhaps only by his wit and ability to  remember the smallest of details from 20 years ago.   I have always said about this institution that it would not run and  lawmakers would not be able to do their job without the dedication and  professionalism of the staff here. The staff make this place work, and  Ed stands out as a shining example of that.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all of us, I thank Ed for all he has done  and continues to do for the Financial Services Committee, for the  institution as a whole, and for the United States Government.   I congratulate Ed, and I hope he and Hera have a nice time.                            ____________________
