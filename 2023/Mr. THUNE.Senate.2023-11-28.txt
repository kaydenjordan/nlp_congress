 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, artificial intelligence--or what is  referred to as AI--has been with us for quite some time now. And  whether it is the chatbot providing help on Amazon, or personalized  recommendations on Netflix, or the algorithms that are curating your  social media feeds, these days, most of us interact with artificial  intelligence on a daily basis. But as the release of ChatGPT to the  public last year demonstrated, artificial intelligence is about to take  a giant step forward.   The AI applications I have mentioned, like chatbots and personalized  recommendations, are examples of so-called narrow AI, which is AI  trained to perform specific tasks. But ChatGPT is an example of the  next generation of AI--artificial intelligence systems set up to  imitate the human brain and produce original content based on the  assimilation of vast sets of data.   This next generation of AI--so-called foundation models which  underpin systems like ChatGPT--offers tremendous possibilities:  advances in medicine, in farming, in manufacturing, the automation of  routine tasks, new ways to manage infrastructure, better and more  resilient supply chains, advances in national defense. And the list,  literally, goes on and on.   But as with any sophisticated technology, this next generation of AI  presents risks as well. And those risks are heightened by the enormous  capabilities of AI and the potential for this technology to pervade  every corner of our society. And our goal needs to be encouraging the  promise of AI while putting safeguards in place to minimize potential  dangers.   The light-touch approach the United States has taken to internet  regulation is a good model to follow as we approach AI regulation. The  explosive growth of internet innovation in the United States is, in  large part, a result of the fact that the government has not weighed  down this sector of the economy with heavyhanded regulation. And we  should maintain a similarly light touch when it comes to AI to  encourage innovation and keep the United States at the forefront of the  next generation of artificial intelligence.   Leadership in AI will benefit our economy. And there are also serious  security reasons why staying at the forefront of the AI revolution is  important. There is no question that AI will come to play an important  role in national defense, and falling behind adversaries--like the  Chinese Communist Party--could put our country at a serious  disadvantage when it comes to our national security. So we need to  start establishing some basic rules of the road that will allow AI  innovation to flourish, while at the same time minimizing the dangers  that it presents.   The race to regulate AI has already started. President Biden has  released a sweeping Executive order that empowers multiple government  Agencies and Departments to regulate all AI systems, and even the  algorithms that recommend our next movie on Netflix or remind us that  we need to order more paper towels.   And internationally, the European Union has continued to press  forward with a heavyhanded regulatory regime. It is time for Congress  to ensure that innovation in the United States continues. Regulating AI  by Executive order is not the way to go about things.   Even if the President's Executive order on AI weren't overly broad  and heavyhanded, Executive orders are, by their very nature, not  permanent, since they have the potential to be reversed or amended at  any time--and stand a good chance of being reversed or amended when a  new administration comes into office. This creates uncertainty for  companies, which can stunt expansion and innovation.   The right way to approach AI regulation is to pursue a bipartisan,  nationwide approach in Congress that will protect innovation while  putting in place the necessary safeguards for the riskiest applications  of this technology.   To that end, shortly before Thanksgiving, I introduced bipartisan AI  legislation with Senator Klobuchar and several of our Commerce  Committee colleagues from both parties. Our bill is intended to  establish some basic rules of the road for artificial intelligence  while protecting the ability of companies to innovate and advance this  technology.   Our bill focuses on two things: transparency for consumers and a  tiered, risk-based framework for oversight of the highest impact  applications of AI. On the transparency front, our bill would require  any large-scale internet platform that uses generative AI to create  content to clearly inform consumers of that fact. One of the risks  presented by generative AI is the difficulty distinguishing AI-produced  content from human-produced content.   Now, that may not be a huge issue if the content we are talking about  is an amusing meme, but it is a real issue if a consumer is trying to  figure out whether information or an image is real or whether it has  been generated by AI. So requiring transparency about whether content  is being produced--or at least partially produced--by generative AI  needs to be a priority.   The second part of our bill deals with high-impact and critical- impact AI, that is, AI applications used to make significant  applications in particularly high-risk sectors. Our bill establishes a  two-tiered system for overseeing these applications.  [[Page S5621]]    Critical-impact AI applications--for example, like those used to make  significant decisions in the operation of critical infrastructure-- would be required to self-certified compliance with testing evaluation,  validation, and verification standards.   What does all that mean? High-impact AI applications will be subject  solely to transparency reporting requirements. Importantly, this part  of the bill is carefully tailored to apply only to AI applications  making complex decisions in high-risk sectors and is meant to respond  directly and narrowly to the recent leap in capabilities of foundation  models that power them.   I believe that the bill Senator Klobuchar and I have introduced is  the right first step when it comes to AI technology. Unlike the White  House's Executive order, our bill doesn't instantly assume that  artificial technology is bad and that it should be subject to  heavyhanded government intervention, nor does our legislation rush us  into regulations before we have a clear idea of what aspects of this  technology need to be regulated and in what way.   Instead, our bill puts in place guardrails to mitigate the dangers  posed by the highest-impact AI application, while leaving American  innovators and entrepreneurs free to move forward with innovation.   I am grateful to Senator Klobuchar and our other cosponsors for  working with me on this bill, and we will continue to welcome ideas to  further improve our legislation. Legislation on this issue of this  magnitude calls for the deliberation of the committee process and  regular order consideration, and I will work to ensure that we take it  up in the Commerce Committee in the coming months.   This bill will probably not be the last bill that Congress needs to  consider when it comes to AI, but I believe it is the right place for  us to begin. And I look forward to working with colleagues from both  parties to getting this bill through Congress and across the finish  line.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
