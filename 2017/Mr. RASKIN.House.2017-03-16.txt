 Mr. Speaker, we are so proud of the leadership  Congresswoman Jayapal is showing in both Washington State and  Washington, D.C., in resisting these terrible cuts to the domestic  budget of the people of the United States, in showing leadership, also  especially in defending American values when it comes to immigration  and affording a refuge to people fleeing political and religious  repression all over the world.    She is a true leader and we are very proud of her. I am grateful that  she is sharing a couple of minutes with me tonight to talk about the  astonishing news of the day, which is the most dramatic and draconian  budget cuts offered perhaps in our lifetime to the domestic budget of  the United States.   It is going to take us many days--many weeks, indeed--to fully  analyze what exactly will be axed with these budget proposals, but I  wanted to start with a little exchange that took place today with Mick  Mulvaney, who is leading the budget effort for the President.   He had a press conference and he was asked about the implications of  these billions of dollars of cuts to Meals on Wheels. He was asked  about one specific program, and he had no problem basically casting  Meals on Wheels to the curbside, saying: ``It's just not showing any  results.'' Which is why the Trump administration apparently feels good  about slashing the domestic budget, including the community development  block grants which help support Meals on Wheels across the country.   Well, let's just take this one tiny little example, then. Meals on  Wheels actually serves 2.4 million Americans between the ages of 60 and  100. These are people who, for reasons of illness or physical infirmity  or simply poverty, cannot go grocery shopping for themselves or prepare  meals for themselves.   Why don't we take a moment to praise the people at Meals on Wheels  who actually do something constructive and patriotic for their country.  They bring food to older people who might otherwise go without.   You might say: Well, that is just kind of mushy-headed and soft- hearted. We are in the age of the budget ax. We need to destroy these  domestic programs that are a terrible burden on the taxpayers.   Check out a 2013 review of studies on the issue of home-delivered  meal programs like Meals on Wheels. The study says that these programs  ``significantly improve diet quality, increase nutrient intake, and  reduce food insecurity and nutritional risk among participants. Other  beneficial outcomes include increased socialization opportunities,  improvement in dietary adherence, and higher quality of life.''   Well, maybe you don't care about any of those things. Maybe you just  consider about the bottom line.   Consider this finding. These programs are aligned with the Federal  cost-containment policy to rebalance long-term care away from nursing  homes to home and community-based services by helping older adults  maintain independence and remain in their homes and communities as  their health and functioning decline.   You see, for Mr. Mulvaney and President Trump and the Cabinet of  billionaires and CEOs and ethically challenged Russian-influenced  corporate titans, they don't care about how the program is actually  working right here in American communities.   They don't care about facts. We know they have contempt for facts,  which is why they give us their alternative facts. They don't care  about studies and books because we know the President is their leader  and he doesn't read books.   They definitely don't care about the elderly people who can't make it  to the grocery store or who can't afford nutritious meals on their own.  These are the same people, after all, that they propose to throw to the  curb on Medicaid, with their proposal released last week in the cloak  of darkness to repeal the Affordable Care Act and gut Medicaid and  replace it with a monstrosity of a program which even their own Members  can't support. Under their plan, 14 million would lose their healthcare  insurance. Millions of elderly people would lose their insurance.   Now, with this mean-spirited little proposal to take a relative crumb  away from the community development block grant and from Meals on  Wheels, they would deprive a lot of people even of a wholesome dinner  delivered to their home.   Why do they want to slash all of these programs across the board: the  EPA, the State Department, the Agriculture Department, the Labor  Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Commerce  Department, the Education Department, HUD, Transportation, Interior,  and so on? Why?   Well, the President has announced he wants to take $54 billion out of  that slice of the pie for nondefense discretionary spending, which  accounts for only 16 percent of the overall budget, and put that $54  billion directly into the Pentagon.   Just to repeat, they want to take $54 billion out of the domestic  budget, nondefense discretionary spending, and put it into the Pentagon  for a military buildup.   But for what?   The world's second largest military power is Russia. We outspend them  10 to 1. We are a giant and they are a dwarf.   Vladimir Putin, in any event, is Donald Trump's best friend, his BFF,  his bosom buddy. The Trump-Putin relationship may be the President's  most successful long-term relationship, at least politically speaking.   All that money that goes to the Pentagon, why? What is it for? Is it  possible that Mr. Bannon and Mr. Trump are thinking about a war drive?   The President has tweeted about World War III in a very cavalier and  flippant way.   It is disturbing. Nobody really knows. But one thing we do know is  that all of that money that goes over to the Pentagon, if history is  any record, will be available for the beltway bandits, the inside  players with political influence and the mega corporations to go and  make a buck off of the American taxpayer.   We will strip it from the EPA, and we will strip it from the  Department of State, and we will strip it from education and we will  put it in the Pentagon, and that is where we know a lot of people are  going to get rich.                                time  1900    They are going from Meals on Wheels to deals on wheels. That is the  name of the game. No more Meals on Wheels. It is all about deals on  wheels. You have got to know the President, you have got to know the  inside players in the  [[Page H2142]]  billionaire Cabinet, and then you can make some money.   Who are they going to sacrifice for this operation announced this  week?   Well, it would take us all night to go through all of the domestic  programs and projects that the American people depend on that are going  to be sliced and diced because of this budget proposal, at least if it  goes through.   But let's start with the National Institutes of Health, the NIH. The  administration proposes to cut nearly $6 billion from the NIH--$5.8  billion they want to get rid of.   Now, what is the NIH, which happens to be in my congressional  district in Rockville--and I am so proud of that--where we have got  doctors and nurses and researchers and scientists who are working every  day as part of the institutional world leader in biomedical research?   This is an entity that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs. These  cuts would devastate the NIH and their ability to research lifesaving  cures and treatments for diseases.   What kinds of diseases are being treated there?   I am not going to be able to go through all of them because there are  hundreds of them that are being researched, where treatments are being  developed, where patients are being seen, where progress is being made.  Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Agent Orange and dioxin, aging,  alcoholism, Alzheimer's disease, ALS, anorexia, anthrax, antimicrobial  resistance, anxiety disorders, aphasia, arthritis, assistive  technology, asthma, attention deficit disorder, autism, autoimmune  disease. That is just the A's.   Let's keep going a little bit. Batten disease, biodefense,  bioengineering, biotechnology, bipolar disorder, brain cancer, brain  disorders, breast cancer, cancer, cannabinoid research, cardiovascular,  cerebral palsy, cervical cancer, child abuse and neglect research,  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, childhood leukemia, chronic fatigue  syndrome, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease, climate change, climate-related exposures and  conditions, colorectal cancer, and on and on. That is just the A's, the  B's, and the C's.   They want to cut $6 billion from the NIH, which is working to cure,  address, study, and manage the diseases and the sicknesses that our  people are dealing with; and just cavalierly they say they want to  slash it so they can pour all of this money over to the military side  for a reason unknown.   When they came down with their executive orders, which have now been  struck down by multiple Federal District Courts as unconstitutional, as  a violation of the Establishment Clause, as a violation likely of due  process and equal protection and so on, what they cited was 9/11  multiple times. They cited 9/11. The odd thing, though, was that the  three source countries for the 9/11 hijackers--Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and  the United Arab Emirates--were left off their executive orders, even  right up until today.   Why?   Some people say it is because Donald Trump has extensive business  dealings with corporations and governments in those three countries.  Nobody really knows. But they developed those orders, which the GOP  proudly once called the Muslim ban, in response allegedly to 9/11. Even  if you could blame an entire people for the acts of individual  terrorists, they didn't do it. They turned to some other countries  because that didn't interfere with the President's business interests.   So we have got this huge military buildup and we have got the  siphoning away of tens of billions of dollars of the American people's  hard-earned money away from medical research and diseases and  environmental protection all into the Pentagon. For what reason, nobody  knows, and they haven't told us.   What a dangerous moment this is in the life of the American Republic.  What a perilous time this is for a nation built on the principle that  that great Republican President Abraham Lincoln called government of  the people, by the people, and for the people.   Their budget proposal is a job killer. It is going to kill hundreds  of thousands of jobs. It devastates and ruins the search for cures, the  progress we are making in diseases like cystic fibrosis and diabetes.  Diseases that afflict hundreds of thousands, millions of our people,  they are just going to pull the plug on that. They are ransacking our  children's education. They are hollowing out the rural communities.  They are making urban life far more dangerous. They are weakening our  leadership overseas. And, of course, because they don't believe in  climate change, they are undermining our ability to respond to the  great peril that faces us as a people.   Just like the proposal to trash the Affordable Care Act cannot go  through this body because there must be a majority of responsible  Members of this body who will not accept that terrible proposal that  will throw 24 million of our people off their insurance, this body also  cannot accept this terrible budget. It must have arrived here DOA.   If a foreign government, a rival to America, an enemy of America, had  come up with this budget, we would regard it as an act of aggression  against the American people. You could view it as a declaration of war  against the prosperity, the health, and the welfare of our own people.  But, alas, it didn't come from abroad. At least it was addressed that  it came from the White House. It appears to have come from the  administration, yet it threatens our way of life.   I would urge all of my colleagues to very carefully study this budget  proposal over the next week or two and make clear that these are not  the priorities of the American people, make clear that these are not  the values of the American people, and this is not the future of the  American people. We must continue to make progress. That means we must  reject the Trump budget.
