 Mr. Speaker, the current debt ceiling showdown is  jeopardizing not just the United States' economy but that of the  Commonwealth of Virginia.   Yesterday, the Virginia Senate Finance Committee presented an  analysis of what a debt default would mean to our Commonwealth. In a  word, it would be catastrophic.   An extended debt ceiling battle would cost our Commonwealth nearly  200,000 jobs and slash payrolls by 4.7 percent, and it would inevitably  throw our economy into a recession.   Even a brief default could cost Virginia an estimated 34,500 jobs and  slash payroll by 0.83 percent, not to mention the impact on Federal  grant reimbursements, federally funded State employees, and the  millions of Virginians who receive monthly payments and depend on  Federal healthcare programs.   The United States is not a deadbeat nation. For the sake of  hardworking Virginians and Americans across the United States, we must  raise the debt ceiling without delay.                            ____________________
