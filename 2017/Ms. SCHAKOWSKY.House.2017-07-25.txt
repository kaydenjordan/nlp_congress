 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in support of today's sanction legislation, which I am so  happy to find has complied with the Iran nuclear agreement, something I  worked very hard on, as did many here.   Experts, the international community, and even some of President  Trump's own advisers agree that the Iran nuclear agreement is working.  In June, the International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran is  within the limits set by this historic deal. There are serious issues  left to be addressed with Iran, especially in regards to human rights  violations and ballistic missiles, which this bill covers.   The Iran deal took Iran's nuclear weapons off the table and allowed  us to deal with these remaining challenges. Withdrawing or violating  the agreement would be an enormous mistake. This bill upholds our  agreement with Iran while also holding Russia and North Korea  accountable for their actions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.
