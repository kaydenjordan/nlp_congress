 Mr. President, I wish to voice my concern over the  passage of the FIRST STEP Act, a bill that would reduce prison  sentences for some Federal offenders, and to explain to the public why  I did not vote for the bill.   First, I want to say that I agree with some of the provisions of the  act.   For too long, we have been putting low-level drug offenders behind  bars for exorbitant periods of time, without a focus on rehabilitation.  This has ruined lives, irrevocably damaged our communities, and cost  the taxpayer dearly.   I support data-driven antirecidivism programs. I support helping  people who have served their time to lead productive lives. I support  using our prisons as a place to punish violent perpetrators and serious  drug offenders.   But this bill simply goes too far for the people of my State. What is  happening currently in Alaska should serve as an example of the  negative consequences resulting from a far-reaching criminal justice  reform bill.   Let me spend a few minutes talking about Alaska's experience with  criminal justice reform.   In 2016, then Governor Walker signed into a law a criminal reform  bill, known in Alaska as SB91. The bill was similar to many similar  bills passed in 30 States across the country.   It was more sweeping than the Federal bill we are debating today, but  it has served as a model for this Federal bill in front of us.  [[Page S7918]]    Its main focus was on antirecidivism measures and reserving prison  space for the truly dangerous criminals while showing leniency for  certain ``low-risk offenders,'' just as the FIRST STEP Act does.   In some States, it has worked well, and I hope that the FIRST STEP  Act works as those who supported it believe it will, but I am not  convinced because, in my State, it hasn't.   Our criminal reform law hit Alaska right as we were going through a  recession caused by low oil prices and the fact that the Obama  administration locked up Alaska lands which hurt thousands of working  men and women and their families.   It was also during this time that the opioid and drug crisis hit our  State. Like many States across our country, my State has been hit hard,  and we have been laser focused on it here in this body.   This trifecta--the passage of the State's criminal reform bill, a  persistent recession, and the drug crisis--have resulted in mayhem in  some of our communities in Alaska.   In Alaska, all crime is up 6 percent from last year and up 26 percent  from 5 years ago. Let me give you some troubling statistics from  Alaska's Uniform Crime Report: violent crime; up 6 percent from last  year and up 35 percent from 5 years ago; property crime; up 5 percent  from last year and up 23 percent from 5 years ago; and vehicle theft up  39 percent from 2016 to 2017.   According Kyle Hopkins from the Anchorage Daily News, who has done a  great job reporting on this; car thieves, burglars, and shoplifters  stole a staggering $45.3 million worth of property across Anchorage in  2017. Remember, Anchorage is a city of a population of less than  300,000--the number of cars stolen in Anchorage: 3,104 in 2017; the  number of vehicle break-ins: 3,837 in 2017.   Much of this crime is fueled by the drug epidemic.   Like many States across the country, Alaska has been reeling from the  opioid crisis and drug epidemic. Tragically, lives are being lost  because of this epidemic. Opioid-related deaths doubled in Alaska in  2017. Fentanyl related deaths rose by 450 percent.   The amount of heroin seized in Alaska more than doubled in 2017,  while the number of arrests actually decreased.   Law enforcement has been tracking lower 48 traffickers who continue  to import increasing amounts of these drugs to take advantage of our  unique enforcement challenges, especially in our rural communities.   Given the crime wave in my State, in many cases fueled by addictions,  and our high rates of sexual assault and domestic violence, many of the  provisions in this bill are deeply troublesome.   In the FIRST STEP Act, certain sexual and drug criminals could be  eligible for expanded good time credits, meaning that they can get out  of prison early. Criminals who are serving prison time for trafficking  cocaine, heroin, or meth could get out early, so could those who  assaulted a law enforcement officer and those who have committed  certain violent assaults.   Perhaps most troubling, this bill would reduce enhanced sentencing  for repeat drug offenders, including for methamphetamine, heroin, and  fentanyl, three drugs that are more prevalent in my State.   The recent statistics in Alaska on drug seizures paint a grim picture  about our drug crisis in my State. I cannot risk allowing these  perpetrators, some of whom might make their way to Alaska, such  leniency.   As I have said, we have been laser-focused on this drug issue here in  the Senate. We have passed numerous bills to bring more resources to  our States, billions of dollars of resources.   Back home, I have held numerous summits relating to this issue.   In August 2016, I convened the Alaska Wellness Summit: Conquering the  Opioid Crisis, an important gathering of Federal, State, and local  community leaders dedicated to tackling the many challenges associated  with the growing opioid and heroin epidemic. That summit, which largely  focused on issues of addiction, recovery, and community, was very  productive, with hundreds of Alaskans gathering to listen, gain  inspiration, learn and exchange ideas. Federal officials from several  different agencies attended to hear the many obstacles Alaskans face  when in recovery, as well as witness the indomitable spirit of Alaskans  who have overcome those obstacles.   In August 2018, I held another wellness summit, this time focused not  only on Alaska's addiction epidemic, but on drug trafficking and the  associated crime wave that is victimizing so many Alaskans. The summit  once again feature a prominent group of Federal, State, and local  leaders and stakeholders to build public awareness, identify  opportunities for coordination and cooperation, and highlight Alaska's  unique public safety challenges with Federal officials.   We have grassroots, peer-to-peer networks across the State that are  really beginning to make a difference.   We also have very active community members who are banding together  to try to fight crime in their neighborhoods.   But we need a strong criminal justice system that continues to mete  out punishments that fit the crime. We need, fair, strong deterrence.   We need the full strength of both the Federal and the State  governments, working in tandem, to get drug dealers off the streets and  punish violent reoffenders who are wreaking havoc in our communities.   Although I respect that motives of my colleagues--and I do believe  that some reform is necessary--this bill goes too far.   When evaluating this bill, I could not ignore the realities of my  State's current situation: spiking crime rates and an ongoing opioid  and drug crisis. Voting to lessen prison time for any contributing  offenders could compound the problem. I could not take that risk.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that my office  says goodbye to Kerry Garland, who has been such an asset to my team  this past year.   Kerry has lived in Alaska for 18 years. She went to high school at  Bartlett High School in Anchorage and graduated from the University of  Alaska in Anchorage with communication and a second degree, a  bachelor's of science in nutrition.   After graduating, she worked for the University of Alaska Anchorage.  Then we got her. She started as an intern. Her title now is a  constituent relations representative, but truly she runs the place. She  manages mail. She coordinates the interns. She does so much, and she  always does it with the utmost professionalism.   Kerry is headed off to better things. In a few weeks, she will be one  of the few and the proud. She is headed off to Quantico, VA, to for the  rigorous and very competitive marine officer candidate school and then  to the Basic School.   Kerry says that pursuing a career as a commissioned officer in the  U.S. Marine Corps, the hardest branch of the military for women to make  a career out of, especially as an officer, has been a long-held dream.  The child of marine parents, she decided that she was going to go into  the Marines when she was 6 years old. It was ``Bring Your Mother to  School'' day, and Kerry's mother showed up in uniform. She thought  then, ``I want to be like her.'' There is no doubt in my mind that she  will be.   She plans on becoming a public affairs officer, where she will work  to build understanding, credibility and trust. She will also work her  hardest to protect the image of the Marine Corps both at home and  abroad.   It is young people like Kerry--people with drive, discipline and a  servant's heart--that made me so optimistic for our country's future,  and the future of my beloved Marine Corps.   She is one of those people who everyone truly likes and who everyone  who has ever worked with her trusts her to get the job done and to get  it done right.   Kerry, we will truly miss you. You will always have a place in our  hearts and will always be part of the Sullivan team.   Semper Fi.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is coming up on the end of the  week, time when I get to do one of the things I love to do best here on  the Senate floor: recognizing an Alaskan or a group of Alaskans who  help make my State so special. I call them our Alaskan of the Week.   Last time I spoke, I recognized all Alaskans who were impacted by the  massive earthquake, a 7.0-magnitude earthquake centered about 7 miles  north of Anchorage, that we experienced on Friday, November 30.   The earthquake was the second largest that Alaska had experienced.  The extent of the damage is still being evaluated, but the best guess  is that it caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to homes,  schools, roads--infrastructure throughout the area.   Aftershocks continue, at least 4,000 of them, and at least two dozen  have been larger than 4.0. magnitude.   Residents of Anchorage and the Mat-Su--Southcentral we call the  area--are still rattled, but Alaskans are generous, strong, and  resilient, and they are skilled. They know what to do during an  emergency.   Today I want to recognize a group of Alaskans who, under immense  pressure, did their jobs and served our State with cool heads, smart  minds, and the upmost courage: the air traffic controllers who were on  duty in both the Anchorage International Airport and at Merrill Field  at the time the earthquake hit.   Before I talk about the extraordinary actions they performed to keep  air traffic running smoothly through the earthquake and the lengths  they went through to make sure passengers were safe, let me spend a few  minutes talking about how important aviation is and air traffic  controllers are to my State.   So you know that my State is the biggest State in the country, more  than twice the size of Texas. If you want to get a sense of how big it  is, come up to my office where I have a map in the front room and  cutouts of all the other States, to scale.   Many of those States that make up our great country are basically  dots on the map.   We are big, but most of Alaska is only accessible by air. In fact, 82  percent of our communities--251--are not accessible by road. You have  to fly to get there.   The airspace serves as our highways. Alaska's people travel by air  eight times more often per capita than those in rural areas of the  Lower 48 and ship 39 times more freight per capita, nearly one ton per  person per year.   Not only that, Anchorage is the crossroads to the Asia Pacific--we  have one of the world's best cargo hubs--and the air traffic  controllers working the towers guide passengers and goods to the Far  East, Iceland, and across the globe.  [[Page S7924]]    All of that air traffic demands the best air traffic controllers,  about 180 in the Anchorage area alone, working day and night to guide  the planes in and guide them out. They are highly trained, skilled, and  know what to do in case of an emergency.   When the earth shook in Anchorage, it was an emergency, and our air  traffic controllers both at Merrill Field, a general aviation airport,  and at the busier Ted Stevens International Airport, acted fast.   Let me first talk about what happened at the Ted Stevens  International Airport during the earthquake.   According to a reporter, when the earthquake hit, one of the managers  said the tower that they were in swayed 3 or 4 feet and described  watching transformers blow out around town from the tower.   A FedEx plane was coming in, and they got on their radios. ``FedEx,  go around, FedEx, go around!'' they told the plane, averting a  potential accident.   Once they realized how severe the earthquake was, the controllers  evacuated, carrying their radios.   So they chose another option: The three guided the airplanes in from  the cab of a pickup truck.   They had what they needed--radios, phones, and a window--and they had  the support of dozens of FAA employees at other locations.   This is what is amazing; Because of their quick thinking, the  airport's three runways were closed for less than 10 minutes after a 7- magnitude earthquake struck.   On the other side of town, at Merrill Field control tower, a similar  story was unfolding.   Again, the controllers and all on the team evacuated, and again, the  controllers took their private vehicles out to the ramp and powered up  FAA portable radios.   The initial lull in general aviation and flight school traffic was  quickly replaced by public safety helicopter and Medevac flights, Civil  Air Patrol aircraft on disaster relief and reconnaissance missions, and  airborne observers checking critical pipeline and roadway  infrastructure.   I am so proud of how everyone in Southcentral reacted to the  earthquake. Kids immediately dove under desks. Our first responders  jumped into action. Neighbors helped neighbors. And they are still  doing so.   Not one person died as a result of the earthquake.   I am so proud of our air traffic controllers who, under immense  pressure, improvised and did what needed to be done to keep everyone  safe and make sure that flights weren't disrupted.   Thank you for all you did during that very frightening time, and  thank you for all you do for all of us every day. Congratulations for  being our Alaskans of the Week.                            ____________________
