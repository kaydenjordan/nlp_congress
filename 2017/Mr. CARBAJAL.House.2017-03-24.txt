 Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress, I worked in  local government as a county supervisor. One of my proudest  achievements during that time was working in a bipartisan way to create  a program that reduced the rate of uninsured children in our county by  over 90 percent--all before the Affordable Care Act was signed into  law. Since the Affordable Care Act, I saw firsthand the direct and  positive impact of this legislation over the past 7 years to  communities and families across the central coast.   The Affordable Care Act meant Sarah, from Lompoc, could open her  small business and afford insurance coverage for her two children.   It meant that Kathleen, in San Luis Obispo, who was diagnosed with  ovarian and breast cancer, that her $500,000 medical bill was covered  by her healthcare plan.   It meant that Adrienne, from Buellton, now could afford to pay for  her husband's nursing facility, as his debilitating disease prevents  her from being able to physically care for him.   Repealing legislation that has improved the quality of life not only  for Sarah, Kathleen, and Adrienne, but for the over 20 million  Americans who have gained health insurance under the Affordable Care  Act, would be callous, cruel, and irresponsible.   Instead of taking away health care from 24 million Americans, let's  work together to create a more equitable, affordable, and accessible  healthcare system for all.                                time  1215
