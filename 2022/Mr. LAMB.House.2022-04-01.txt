 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress, I was a Federal prosecutor in  my hometown of Pittsburgh, and the biggest law enforcement challenges  that we had then, and really still have today, are opioids and gun  violence. Marijuana just didn't register in terms of the risks that it  posed to people on a day-to-day basis compared to those two things.   Yet, because of the way the Federal criminal laws are written and the  way that cannabis is placed in schedule I, it is very easy for a  marijuana offense to actually get someone a worse sentence than an  opioid offense like overprescribing Oxycontin, selling fentanyl, or a  firearms offense like possession of a firearm or shooting at someone.  Our Federal laws are out of place.   It is in the spirit of wanting to make sure that our law enforcement  priorities are focused on the most serious crimes and the most violent  crimes that I can support the removal of cannabis from schedule I.   This bill came up once before in the previous Congress under a closed  rule in which there were not opportunities for amendment, so I want to  thank the leadership and the chairman this time around for allowing  Members under an open rule to make some amendments.   While I do support the removal of cannabis from schedule I, I think,  as we have heard in the debate today, there are many questions about  what happens the day after that and are we being careful enough to  ensure that the public gets the best possible balance of the benefits  of taxing and regulating cannabis while still protecting children and  making sure that we have safe and efficient workplaces.   The amendment that I am offering here today aims to answer a couple  of questions. Essential workers--firefighters, people who operate heavy  equipment on infrastructure projects, people who work in public safety  and national security--what are we willing to tolerate as far as those  workers on the job site potentially with cannabis in their system?   We need to know how to test for it. We need to know what the rules  are to keep people safe on that job site and, most importantly, keep  the public safe so these people can continue working.   The same question for schools: What are the best practices for  schools in a world where cannabis is no longer in schedule I of the  Controlled Substances Act; in a world where cannabis could be in corner  stores that children walk past on their way home; in a world where  school bus drivers or teachers may be legally authorized to use  cannabis in their off time?   All we are trying to do is answer these questions.   There are some who see problems with a change in the law. They see  challenges, and they shrink from them. They say: Let's keep the status  quo the same. Let's not tackle problems.   What we are trying to do here is do the public one better than that.   There is an ironclad case for removing cannabis from schedule I and  focusing our law enforcement priorities where they should be, but we  have to take steps to make sure that we do this in a careful, cautious,  and correct manner.   That is what my amendment offers, Mr. Speaker, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1045     Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Mr. Speaker, I want to address one point from my colleague from  Oregon's side of the debate.   Today, after the passage of this bill--hopefully, with my amendment-- we will be sending a letter to both departments addressed by this  amendment to ask them to begin these studies right away. I agree that  it is important that the public needs this information and knowledge.  Employers, workplaces, and schools need it as quickly as possible.   What I am not sure our colleagues on the other side really realize at  this moment is that people are already using cannabis. It is very  common in all segments of society and all people with all different  types of jobs. The place that the public has been left in is an overly  harsh criminal penalty, with very little specific guidance to  workplaces, employers, and schools of what they are supposed to do in  this new world.   What many of them do is react as harshly as possible, matching the  criminal sanction of our Federal Government. They do drug tests and  have strict bans, basically, on this substance that many Americans feel  is actually safe and part of the lifestyle that they want to live.   Our study will allow a better answer than that. In a world where  people are going to be using this drug, this substance, and where it  is, in fact, much less harsh than prescription drugs that are regulated  lower on the scale than that, we need to get the answer out there to  these workplaces and schools as quickly as possible. That is all that  we are aiming to do here.   We are making policy for the real world with this amendment, and I  encourage all of my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
