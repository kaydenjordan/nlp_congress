 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Steven  Berger, a loving son, brother, and father of three. Growing up in  Wisconsin, Steven was active in many sports. At 6'6", Steven was a  standout basketball player in high school and later played in college.   Steven lived in Minnesota where he worked as a financial adviser and  was a loving father to his three children. His friends and family  describe him as charismatic, full of energy, and larger than life--the  type of man who breathed life into every room.   He was also an avid fisherman and loved talking about stocks and  competitive sports.   Steven traveled to the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas  with friends to celebrate his 44th birthday.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my condolences to Steven Berger's  family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State  of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
