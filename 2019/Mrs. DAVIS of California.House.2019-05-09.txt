 ``On Saturday, June 17, 2017, the President  called McGahn and directed him to have the special counsel removed . .  . In interviews with the Special Counsel's Office, McGahn recalled that  the President called him at home twice and on both occasions directed  him to call Rosenstein and say that Mueller had conflicts that  precluded him from serving as special counsel. On the first call,  McGahn recalled that the President said something like, `You gotta do  this. You gotta call Rod.' '' Volume II, page 85.
