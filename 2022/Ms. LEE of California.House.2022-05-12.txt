 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one  of my constituents, Reign Free, founder and CEO of Red Door Catering in  Oakland.   Reign founded Red Door in 2006 as a socially conscious company,  aiming to bring communities together over delicious food with a special  clientele focused on minority-owned businesses and youth development- focused organizations.   It is worth noting that Red Door also has an annual grant budget of  $10,000 to help nonprofit clients defray some of their catering costs.   In recent years, Red Door has become a fixture in my East Bay  community, having catered events for former President Barack Obama and  Vice President Kamala Harris at their commercial kitchen in West  Oakland.   In line with her commitment to advancing equity, Reign provides  opportunities for other Black entrepreneurs via the Black Culinary  Collective, through which Red Door shares a 5,000-square foot culinary  space in West Oakland with 10 other Black food entrepreneurs.   Furthermore, as the pandemic raged on, Red Door partnered with  several local organizations to feed those most deeply impacted by  COVID-19. Altogether, this effort fed about 80,000 community members.   On behalf of California's 13th Congressional District, I thank Reign  for working tirelessly to create a closer-knit, more equitable  community.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Chairwoman  Maloney for her tremendous leadership. Also, I just have to thank her  for her encouragement for myself, Congresswoman Jayapal, and  Congresswoman Bush to really step out and talk about something that I  personally have never talked about ever because it was my own personal  business.   As my mother told me, that is a decision that I made between her and  myself, and now, it looks like that liberty could be taken away.   But even in the day--and this was way before Roe v. Wade, I had an  abortion. The gentlewoman gave me a chance to talk about it, which is  something I would not do because of what I just said. It was a private  decision. But once these draconian laws started passing in the States,  and once these trigger laws were put into place, and once I saw what  was taking place, I was compelled to talk about it because once we tell  these stories, what I learned was that there are so many people who  have similar stories, men and women who came to me. People I have known  for 30, 40 years came to me, whispered to me: I had the same  experience. I was afraid to talk about it.   What I am finding now is that more people are beginning to share  their experiences. I tell you one thing: In addition to the privacy  issue, it was about stigma.   I was raised in a Catholic school, in the Catholic Church. Of course,  this is a huge decision anyone has to make. Nobody wants to have to go  through this trauma. But I did, and so many others have.   I thank the gentlewoman for giving us a chance because that helped me  personally. Now, we have come to such a time as this to really help  others and to really highlight why the end of Roe could poise us to see  the abandonment of 50 years of precedent and the first time a  constitutional right has ever been taken away. That is unbelievable. It  would deny millions of Americans access to abortions.   We need to, however, reassure Americans tonight that Roe is still the  law of the land. Abortion is still legal. But the threat of this draft  opinion highlights why Congress preemptively should enshrine Roe into  Federal law by abolishing the filibuster, yes, and by passing the  Women's Health Protection Act. This really is about our personal  liberty and our reproductive freedom. Nothing less, quite frankly, can  be tolerated in a democracy.   There is a whole generation of people who do not know life before  Roe. Again, going back to the day when I was in the 11th grade, I know  a life before Roe.   My mother, fortunately, had a friend. I was born and raised in El  Paso, Texas, and we moved to California. She flew me to Texas because  once I made that decision, her friend knew a clinic in Mexico.   Let me tell you, I was fortunate enough to survive the procedure,  Chairwoman Maloney, but it is not lost on me that so many women who  look like me were dying. Afterward, I thank God that I survived because  I knew so many people haven't.                                time  1715    Abortion bans affect everyone, but their impacts fall the hardest on  people of color, people working to make ends meet, young people, the  LGBTQ community, people in rural communities, people who just don't  have enough money to travel to go to another State.   Study after study has shown that denying people access to abortion  has devastating and long-lasting implications for their lives. I  reiterate: people with money will have access to abortions. We are here  tonight because everyone, no matter where they live or how much money  they make or their background or their race or their gender identity,  everyone should be able to make their own decisions about their bodies,  their lives, and their futures.   Finally, another part of this that is just outrageous is the fact  that these decisions about our own healthcare could be criminalized.  Can you imagine if that would happen? The thought of this is chilling.  It is chilling.   Even though it is a terrifying moment, it is an urgent moment. The  public supports Roe v. Wade. Now is the time to rise up--yes--to  galvanize and to raise our voices about our constitutional rights that  are about to be taken away if we don't do what we need to do.   Also, it is a slippery slope because, as I have been saying: If they  come for me today, they are coming for you tomorrow. This is the  beginning of the erosion of rights, such as voting rights, disability  rights, LGBTQ rights, you just name it.   That is not going to happen because I have a lot of hope in the  American people. This may be a time when we have to regroup and fight  harder. That is exactly what we are doing. I want to applaud all of our  organizations out there who have been so adamant and so vigilant and  prepared for this day.   We couldn't be here tonight talking about what next if it weren't for  them. I just have to take a moment to salute all of our grassroots  groups who have been working day and night helping people, providing  access, raising money, doing everything they can do to make sure that  everyone who decides to have an abortion has access to safe and legal  abortions.   I thank the chairwoman for holding this Special Order. This is a  moment that we all have to speak truth, we have to tell the truth about  what is at stake. Also, it gives us a chance to tell the truth about  who we are. As Members of Congress, we are people who have been through  many of the same  [[Page H4907]]  challenges that everyone has been through.
