 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week the Senate conveyor belt of  President Trump's judicial nominees grinds on. So far, the President  and the Senate leader have an unprecedented pace in confirming Federal  judges, especially powerful Federal appellate judges. They seem to have  no higher priority.   What is a little weird about this is that nearly 90 percent of  Trump's appellate judges and both of his Supreme Court Justices are  members of the so-called Federalist Society. On the Supreme Court,  Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, Alito, and Thomas all are members. Now, that is a  little weird.   What is really weird is that through this Federalist Society vehicle,  big, special interests are picking Federal judges.   In effect, there are three Federalist Societies. The first one most  lawyers know from law school. It is, for the most part, a debating  society made up of like-minded aspiring lawyers drawn to conservative  ideas and judicial doctrine. They organize seminars and invite  academics, judges, and attorneys to speak. That is terrific--no problem  there.   The second Federalist Society is the parent organization of the  campus debating society--a sort of highbrow think tank seeking to  further conservative and libertarian judicial principles. It convenes  fancy forums with conservative legal luminaries, from Supreme Court  Justices to big-name politicians, to renowned legal scholars. It issues  newsletters and produces podcasts and policy recommendations. Through  this, they hope to ``reorder priorities within the legal system'' and  create a network of members ``that extends to all levels of the legal  community.''   I disagree pretty strongly with the system of law they are trying  impose, and their funding is suspiciously obscure, but this debate is a  fine thing to have--so no objection there either.   Then there is the third Federalist Society. This one doesn't have  much in common with the law school debating society, and it certainly  doesn't operate like your run-of-the-mill Washington think tank. This  Federalist Society is the nerve center for a complicated apparatus that  does not care much about conservative principles like judicial  restraint or originalism or textualism.   This Federalist Society is the vehicle for powerful, commercial, and  industrial interests that seek not simply to ``reorder'' the judiciary  but to acquire control of the judiciary to benefit their interests.  This third Federalist Society understands the fundamental power of the  Federal judiciary to rig the system in favor of its donor interests  and, as the Kavanaugh confirmation so clearly illustrated, is willing  to go to drastic lengths to secure that power.   I am here today to talk about that third Federalist Society.   The story of the third Federalist Society is partly the story of a  man named Leonard Leo, the society's executive vice president.   Mr. Leo is now the most influential person shaping America's Federal  judiciary. Don't be surprised if you are listening and you have never  heard of him. He has never been elected. He is not accountable to any  voter. Instead, he is the front man for interests that want to use the  Federalist Society and its surrounding network of front groups and PR  shops and think tanks to acquire control over our courts.   Renowned court watcher Jeffrey Toobin describes Mr. Leo as ``Trump's  subcontractor on the selection of Supreme Court Justices.'' More  accurately, Mr. Leo is the subcontractor for a network of big corporate  interests and front groups.   In the summer of 2016, it was Leo who delivered the list of potential  nominees to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and  the blocking of Merrick Garland. It was Mr. Leo who was involved in the  Trump transition, helping to conduct outreach to potential Supreme  Court picks, including Neil Gorsuch.   Mr. Leo even orchestrated a $1 million donation to Trump's  inauguration.   The role of the Federalist Society has been confirmed by President  Trump's own legal counsel, Don McGahn.   McGahn told a Federalist Society gathering in 2017:   [[Page S2034]]              Our opponents of judicial nominees frequently claim the       President has outsourced his selection of judges. That is       completely false. I have been a member of the Federalist       Society since law school, still am, so, frankly, it seems       like it's been in-sourced.    Ha-ha, so funny.   The Federalist Society does more than pick the judges. They prepare  them. They study the prospective nominees and the Senators who will ask  them questions. They gather murder boards for nominees to practice for  confirmation hearings.   Mr. Leo is proud of this operation. During the confirmation hearing  for Justice Neil Gorsuch, Leo told Toobin, with considerable  satisfaction:         You know, the hearings matter so much less than they once       did. We have the tools now to do all the research. We know       everything they have written. We know what they've said.       There are no surprises.    In the Judiciary Committee, we see the result over and over-- meaningless committee hearings where nominees parrot empty words about  applying law to fact and respecting precedent. Then, once confirmed and  on the bench, those nominees deliver dependably for the partisan and  corporate donors behind this Federalist Society operation.   It is bad enough that judicial selection has been outsourced--or  insourced--to a partisan private entity. Worse is how nontransparent  this all is. It is hard to find out who is behind it. It is a very  nontransparent problem, but here is what we have been able to piece  together. The evidence is that the Federalist Society is funded by  massive, secret contributions from corporate rightwing groups that have  big agendas before the courts.   In 2017 the Federalist Society took $5.5 million via an entity called  DonorsTrust. DonorsTrust has as its sole purpose to launder the  identities of donors to other groups so that Americans don't know who  the real backers are of the groups. It is an identity removal machine  for big donors. Through the hard work of investigators, journalists,  and researchers, we have learned that the Koch brothers are among the  largest--if not the largest--contributors to DonorsTrust. The  Federalist Society's total annual budget is about $20 million. So this  $5.5 million in funding, laundered through DonorsTrust, provides more  than a quarter of its entire budget.   Other shadowy corporate and rightwing organizations also donate  millions to the Federalist Society. In 1 year, the Lynde and Harry  Bradley Foundation, a rightwing trust, gave over $3 million to the  Federalist Society. Koch Industries, several other Koch-network  foundations and trusts, and nearly a dozen wholly anonymous donors have  given over $100,000 each to the Federalist Society. Tax documents from  2014, uncovered by the New York Times, show a donation of more than $2  million from the Mercer family, the secretive donors who helped start  Breitbart News and bankrolled the Trump campaign.   How do we know that these groups have a big agenda before the courts?  We know that because they also fund a fleet of front groups that file  so-called amicus briefs before courts signaling what results the big  donors want. The Kochs, the Bradleys, the Mercers, and their ilk spend  millions to pursue an anti-regulation, anti-union, and anti-environment  agenda, and they use the Federalist Society to stock the judiciary with  judges who will rule their way.   The Federalist Society, as a 501(c)(3) organization, is supposed to  stay out of politics. The Judicial Crisis Network is a 501(c)(4)  organization which can, and does, get involved in politics. The  Judicial Crisis Network is led by a disciple of Leonard Leo's, a former  clerk for ultraconservative Justice Clarence Thomas. The Judicial  Crisis Network has been described in conservative circles as ``Leonard  Leo's PR organization--nothing more and nothing less.'' When it comes  time to muscle a judicial nominee through Senate confirmation, the  Judicial Crisis Network swings into action. Media campaigns, attack  ads, and big spending--that is the Judicial Crisis Network's world.   Like its Federalist Society partner, the Judicial Crisis Network gets  massive sums of dark money, and it spends massively too. It spent $7  million on campaigns to block Merrick Garland from getting a hearing on  his nomination to the Supreme Court, and it spent $10 million to  support the nomination--blockade enabled--of Neil Gorsuch--and $7  million and $10 million--and it received one anonymous donation of  $17.9 million. One donor gave $17.9 million to this operation to  influence our judiciary. I will say that we need to know who that donor  was. Because we are in the minority, we are going to be spurned and  rejected if we try to get that information. On the House side, where  they have the power of subpoena, we need to pursue that. It ought to be  public information when one donor can spend nearly $18 million to  influence the selection of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice.   Judicial Crisis Network then got $23 million from something called  the Wellspring Committee. You will have to forgive some of this because  it is very obscure. These are peculiar groups that aren't involved in  any ordinary business or regular activity. The Wellspring Committee is  a Virginia-based entity with ties to--you guessed it--Leonard Leo, and  the Judicial Crisis Network then promised to spend as much on the  Kavanaugh nomination as they had for Gorsuch.   Add to this mix of peculiarly funded and obscure organizations the BH  Group, a shell corporation that gave $1 million to Donald Trump's  inaugural. The BH Group received over $1 million in something called  consulting fees in 2017 from something else called the Judicial  Education Project. Who is Judicial Education Project? The Judicial  Education Project is--guess what--the 501(c)(3) side of the Judicial  Crisis Network. Why does a shell corporation give money to the Trump  inaugural and also serve as a consultant to a legal organization  fighting for the confirmation of specific Justices? What consulting did  they do? Was there any consulting done at all? Great questions. Leonard  Leo probably knows the answer. In 2018, he told the Federal  Elections Commission that the BH Group was his employer.    While this apparatus may be complex and difficult to track, its goal  is simple. Don McGahn explained it succinctly: ``Regulatory reform and  judicial selection are . . . deeply connected.'' Translated, that means  that the Federalist Society's goal is to pack the judiciary through  judicial selection with judges who will deliver what is called  regulatory reform, an extreme anti-regulation, anti-union, anti- environment agenda for those corporatist Federalist Society funders.   Let me give you two examples.   The Senate just confirmed Neomi Rao to the DC Circuit Court of  Appeals. Rao comes right out of the deep bog of special interest dark  money. Her bio appears on the Federalist Society website, along with  the list of 26 times she has been featured at Federalist Society  events--26 auditions, as one might describe them.   This is a person confirmed for the DC Court of Appeals who has never  been a judge. She has never even tried a case. What has she done? She  served as the Trump administration's point person for tearing down  Federal regulations as head of the White House's Office of Information  and Regulatory Affairs. Among her greatest hits was taking one of Scott  Pruitt's proposed regulatory rollbacks for the climate-change driving- gas methane from the oil and gas industry and tipping that regulation  even further in favor of fossil fuel polluters. Out-Pruitting Scott  Pruitt for the fossil fuel industry is hard to do. That may have been  another audition for the court.   Rao also funded the so-called Center for the Study of the  Administrative State at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law  School, which is devoted to conjuring ways to roll back as many  regulations affecting these corporations as possible and is funded by  these same secretive groups.   I asked Ms. Rao about the funders of her center at the Scalia Law  School. She claimed in her answers--and, by the way, I will add that  these were questions for the record--written questions that she had  time to consider, review, and respond to. This was not a surprise  attack of an unprepared witness at a hearing. She had weeks to answer.  She claimed in her answers that, to the best of her knowledge, her  organization had not received any money from the Federalist Society,  from Koch Family Foundations, or from anonymous funders.   Well, that was simply not true. A Virginia open records request  revealed  [[Page S2035]]  that an anonymous donor and the Charles Koch Foundation donated $30  million earmarked specially for her organization. Guess whose interests  she has been conveyed onto the DC Circuit Court of Appeals to protect.   Now consider the case of Kisor v. Wilkie, a case currently before the  Supreme Court. It hasn't gotten much attention. On its face, it is  about an obscure administrative law doctrine, but Kisor has been  described as a ``stalking horse for much larger game''--whether  administrative agencies can continue to have the independence they need  to regulate in the public interests. At stake could be the power of the  EPA to protect our air and water, of the Department of Labor to  continue to protect workers in the workplace, and of the Securities and  Exchange Commission to protect investors against financial fraud.   Many corporations hate regulation. The problem is regulations are  pretty popular. Politicians may talk about cutting redtape, but their  constituents really like clean air and clean water. They want safe  workplaces and the peace of mind that their investments are sound.   That is where judges like Neomi Rao and cases like Kisor come in. For  decades we have operated in a system where Congress passes laws and  administrative Agencies fill in the details and implement those laws  using their regulatory power and their time, patience, and expertise to  deal with complex problems. It has worked extremely well. Cases like  Kisor, however, slowly chip away at that system, shifting more and more  power from expert regulatory agencies to courts and to courts filled  with more and more judges like Neomi Rao.    The Daily Beast influence reporter Jay Michaelson wrote:         Sometimes thought of as a legal association, the Federalist       Society is actually a large right-wing network that grooms       conservative law students still in law school (sponsoring       everything from free burrito lunches to conferences,       speakers, and journals), links them together, mentors them,       finds them jobs, and eventually places them in courts and in       government.    Within this Federalist Society is this operation I have described,  funded by dark money and designed to remake our judiciary on behalf of  a distinct group of very wealthy and powerful, anonymous funders. Add  to that the dark money funding the so-called Judicial Crisis Network.  Add to that the dark money funding the amicus briefs telling these  judges what to do. Then look at the outcomes when the Federalist  Society-selected appointees get a majority on the court. It is not a  pretty sight.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
