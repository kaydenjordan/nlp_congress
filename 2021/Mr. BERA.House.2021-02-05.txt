 Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of this budget  resolution, and I speak as a doctor. This virus doesn't know whether  you are Democrat or Republican. This virus doesn't know the color of  your skin, the religion that you worship towards.   I commend the Biden administration for wanting to go big and wanting  to go fast, because we have to get ahead of the virus, defeat the  virus. But then we have to do the efforts to vaccinate the population  that are out, to address the food insecurity that we see all across  this country.   Madam Speaker, I am particularly pleased that this package will have  funding in it, as we put it together to address vaccine hesitancy and  misinformation, particularly in hard-hit communities of color--Black  and Brown communities. We have to get into those communities, work with  community health centers, work with folks in those communities to make  sure they get vaccinated. And I am pleased that we have been working  with the Biden administration to get this done.   Madam Speaker, I fully support going big and fully support this  budget resolution.
