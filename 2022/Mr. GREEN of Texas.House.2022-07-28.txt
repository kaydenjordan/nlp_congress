 Madam Speaker, and still I rise. I rise today  some 400 years after slavery was introduced to the United States in  1619. I rise today proud of this House of Representatives because on  yesterday, the House approved a historic Slavery Remembrance Day  resolution.   Madam Speaker, in the out years, this resolution is going to prove to  be very beneficial to our country. You will find slavery remembrance  commemorations going on across the length and breadth of the country.  This is because we never want to repeat the horrors of slavery.   So, I thank every Member of this House who voted for this resolution.  Each of you will receive from me a personal thank you as well as a  commemorative booklet so that you can place this prominently some place  in your home or your office because it was a historic occasion, and it  will make a difference in the lives of people across the length and  breadth of this country.   I am so proud of you, and I thank you. God bless you.                            ____________________
