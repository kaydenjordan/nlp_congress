 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Bishop for his work on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, in the wake of a global pandemic unlike anything we have  seen in our lifetime, we have spent unprecedented amounts of money this  year. We have already saddled the next generation with unthinkable  debt. Digging our way out of this hole is going to take time and  targeted effort. We cannot continue to spend as if our debts don't  exist.   This legislation needlessly increases the deficit. The Land and Water  Conservation Fund, which is already incredibly well-funded, does not  need an additional $900 million a year in perpetuity. With immediate  health needs and economic recovery our top priorities, increasing the  Federal real estate holding shouldn't be on anyone's to-do list.   A recent report showed that 40 percent of LWCF funds went to projects  that failed to advance any agency objectives. The oversight and  accountability of the fund is laughable, but this bill seeks to  exacerbate the lack of transparency by removing elected officials from  the situation altogether and handing unilateral power to political  appointees and unelected bureaucrats.   There are more productive ways that we should spend our time this  week, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.
