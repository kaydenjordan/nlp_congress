 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose yet another  Democrat witch hunt. We should take Democrats at their word when they  say: Never let a good crisis go to waste.   While section 4 of the 25th Amendment has never been used, a plain  reading of the text, coupled with the context of its ratification,  contemplates a very different scenario from the one we are currently  in.                                time  2200    It envisions a President's disability resulting from serious illness  or injury. To suggest it should be used in a different context violates  the very intent of the 25th Amendment.   To be clear, this resolution is a divisive political stunt which  would have no force of law and is a waste of our time.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution is a clear overreach, as invoking the  25th Amendment is not something Congress can initiate, and this must be  initiated by the executive branch.   Democrats talk about unity, but clearly that is just talk, as their  actions only further divide us. Their hypocrisy is on full display this  week with this 25th Amendment stunt, Articles of Impeachment, censure  bills, and other efforts to try to punish Republicans for false  accusations of inciting the type of violence they have so frequently  and transparently supported in the past.   Throughout 2020, we witnessed Democrats welcome, encourage, and even  normalize violence. For them, violent riots were effective in advancing  their agenda.
