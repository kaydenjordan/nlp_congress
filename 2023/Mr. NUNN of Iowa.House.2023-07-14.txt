 Mr. Chairman, as a nearly 20-year combat veteran  and head of counterintelligence for cybersecurity, I know firsthand the  millions of threats that are leveraged against our country on a daily  basis.   As we look to strengthen our security with this bill offered by the  chair and the amendments going forward, I thank those who have worked  so diligently on our joint effort to create a National Digital Reserve  Corps to buttress our country against this threat.   Additionally, I will speak about another win for our military,  military parents. As both an Air Force officer, Reservist, and National  Guard member, we have worked on bipartisan legislation, the Reserve  Component Parental Leave Parity Act, that I helped lead with  Representative Jeff Jackson from North Carolina.   Our servicemen and -women deserve time with their new children, and  this policy will expand parental leave for drilling Reserve and  National Guard members to match the leave policies of their Active-Duty  members.    Mr. Chair, this is a big, bipartisan win to improve  the lives of our members who are serving, including myself as a parent  of foster children.   Unfortunately, as a result of a backroom deal, we were not able to  serve those who needed help from suicide prevention. In my home State  of Iowa, we have almost four times the number of individuals who take  their life after coming back from combat.   We will not stop fighting for this, and what we can't include in this  amendment we will move forward with the chairman to make sure we are  able to protect those who have served overseas and take their own life  when coming back.
