 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate National  Cybersecurity Awareness Month, which begins October 1. As the cofounder  and co-chair of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus with my good  friend Chairman Mike McCaul, I firmly believe that cybersecurity is the  national and economic security challenge of the 21st century. I also  believe that each of us has a role to play in staying safe online.   During each of the 4 themed weeks of Cybersecurity Awareness Month,  the Department of Homeland Security and its partners across the  government and the private sector will highlight different aspects of  cybersecurity, from the challenges faced by our critical infrastructure  to the steps individuals can take to make their homes a safe haven for  online safety.   I encourage all my colleagues to take the opportunity to bring these  messages back to their home districts. From senior centers to local  chambers of commerce, the cybersecurity awareness events that I hold  with our State cybersecurity officer, Mike Steinmetz, and the great  team at the Rhode Island Joint Cyber Task Force have helped people  across the Ocean State better protect themselves online.   I look forward to another successful Cybersecurity Awareness Month.                            ____________________
