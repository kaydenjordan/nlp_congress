 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize  Victor Stekoll's seventh grade class at the Green Acres School. In the  class is my nephew Eric. Like Eric, his classmates work to earn  respect, which is one of the most important characteristics and  principles of the Green Acres School.   These students are challenged to live and learn with intellect and  curiosity, determination, and joy because they want to make a positive  impact on their school. These Green Acre students are off to a great  start.   In fact, Mr. Stekoll's class is touring the Capitol today in order to  learn more about our government and get an inside look at what it is  like to be a Member of Congress.   I applaud these middle school students for showing interest in the  important work of government. I expect, Mr. Speaker, that one day one  of these students will be standing right here addressing the Chamber.   I say: Go Grizzlies.                            ____________________
