 Madam Speaker, as the daughter of a public school  teacher, an essential and prized profession, I never expected to see a  shortage of 100,000 teachers. It is catastrophic, especially now when  children are being vaccinated and returning to in-person learning. The  teacher shortage adds urgency to President Biden's Build Back Better  agenda, which features teacher residences and grow-your-own programs to  improve outcomes and develop more teachers of color.   As a ranking member who helped write the pending infrastructure bill,  I particularly applaud the Build Back Better agenda's investments in  upgrading school infrastructure with resilient, energy-efficient  buildings enriched with technology and the labs students need for the  jobs of the future.                            ____________________
