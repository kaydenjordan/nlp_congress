 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, if there is one thing that has become  clear, it is that the ObamaCare status quo is not sustainable.   Prices continue to soar while choices are rapidly dwindling. Between  2016 and 2017, the average premium for a midlevel ObamaCare plan on the  Federal exchange went up 25 percent--25 percent for just 1 year. Let's  remember that this is on top of years--year after year--of premium  increases under ObamaCare.   How many families can easily absorb a 25-percent premium increase? I  would submit that not many. Again, that is just for 1 year. ObamaCare  rate hikes aren't going anywhere. Numbers for next year are starting to  emerge, and they are not looking good. Connecticut's ObamaCare insurers  are requesting average premium increases in the double digits. One  Connecticut insurer has requested an average rate hike of 33.8  percent--33.8 percent. In Virginia, one insurer has requested an  average rate increase of 38 percent. Another has requested an average  45-percent rate hike. In Maryland, average increases range anywhere  from 18 percent to almost 59 percent. One insurer has requested a  staggering 150-percent rate increase--150 percent.   Obviously, these kinds of price increases are unaffordable for most  families, but ObamaCare isn't leaving them any options. Along with  soaring prices, choices on the exchanges are rapidly dwindling. Roughly  one-third of U.S. counties have just one choice of health insurer on  their exchange for 2017. Several States--including Alabama, Oklahoma,  Alaska, and Wyoming--have just one choice of insurer for their entire  State, and things are only getting worse.   In 2018, a number of counties may lack an ObamaCare insurer at all.  In February, health insurer Humana announced its decision to completely  withdraw from the ObamaCare exchanges for 2018, and 2 weeks ago, Aetna,  which had already sharply reduced its participation in the exchanges  for 2017, announced its decision to fully exit and completely get out  of the market in 2018. That leaves the Nebraska and Delaware ObamaCare  exchanges with just one insurer for 2018.   UnitedHealthcare is leaving Virginia, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue  Shield is withdrawing from Iowa. In the wake of Aetna and Wellmark's  decision, Medica, the last ObamaCare insurer for most of Iowa,  announced it will likely leave the State in 2018. That would leave 94  out of 99 counties in Iowa with no ObamaCare insurer next year--all but  five counties in the State of Iowa with no ObamaCare insurer. Iowa  families with ObamaCare subsidies would have no place to spend them. As  my colleague Senator Alexander likes to point out, that is like having  a bus ticket in a town where there are no buses running.   Dwindling healthcare choices aren't limited to the ObamaCare  exchanges, either. Aetna is not only withdrawing from the exchanges. It  is also withdrawing from the non-ObamaCare individual health insurance  markets in several States. More than one insurance CEO has suggested  that ObamaCare is in a death spiral, and I would have to say it is  pretty hard to disagree. Combine soaring premiums with a steady insurer  exodus, and sooner or later you get a partial or complete exchange  collapse.   Then there are the other ObamaCare problems--like deductibles which  are sometimes so high people can't afford to actually use their  healthcare plans; or, narrow plan networks with few provider choices.   ObamaCare may have been well-intentioned, but good intentions don't  make up for a lack of good policy--and ObamaCare was not good policy.  ObamaCare took a healthcare system with problems and it made things  worse. It is time to repeal this fatally flawed law and replace it with  real healthcare reform.   Three weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed an ObamaCare  repeal and replacement bill. The House's legislation repeals  ObamaCare's tax increases, penalties, and mandates, and starts the  process of restoring control of healthcare to States and individuals.  My colleagues in the House have made a good start, and I am looking  forward to building on their bill here in the United States Senate. We  have a lot of Members with good healthcare ideas, and we are going to  work hard to produce a bill that will start the process of giving the  American people real healthcare reform.   ObamaCare is failing, and it is failing rapidly. Our Democrat  colleagues need to stop pretending this law is ever going to do what it  was supposed to do and come to the table to work with us on real  healthcare reform. There is no question our healthcare system has  problems, but ObamaCare is not, and it never has been, the solution.   Real reform is possible, though, and that is what we are focused on  now here in the United States Senate--the kind of reform that will  actually drive down prices, that will put patients and their doctors-- not the government--in charge of healthcare decisions, that will  empower States to embrace the solutions that are right for the citizens  in their States and will give Americans more choices and real  healthcare freedom.   That is the kind of healthcare reform Republicans are committed to  delivering for the American people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
