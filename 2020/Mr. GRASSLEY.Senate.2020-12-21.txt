 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, history will look back at 2020 and find  many lessons and even some silver linings to unpack.   The loss of more than 300,000 American lives so far will be mourned  for years to come. Operation Warp Speed, which President Trump  launched, turned out to be a historic public-private partnership. It  has delivered a lifesaving vaccine in record time, shattering  scientific benchmarks along the way. For the last 9 months, Americans  have pulled together in shared sacrifice to do their part.   As the COVID-19 vaccine makes its way into the communities across our  country as it is right now, I encourage my fellow Iowans to keep  pulling together. When public health officials say it is your turn to  get a vaccine, roll up your sleeve. I will be doing the same when my  turn arrives.   Getting immunized is the only way we will beat the virus and get back  to the normal way of American life. History will show Americans turned  the page on the pandemic when all of us roll up our sleeves.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a  colloquy with my colleague, Finance Committee Ranking Member Wyden, to  discuss a tax provision included in the omnibus appropriations bill  currently before the Senate. The tax title in this bill contains  important clarifications to, and expansions of, the Employee Retention  Tax Credit established under section 2301 of the CARES Act. This credit  has provided vital payroll support to struggling businesses in Iowa and  across the country. The enhancements included in this bill are  necessary to help more employers access the credit. Importantly, the  bill clarifies that businesses that received Paycheck Protection  Program loans, or PPP, are still eligible for the credit based on other  wages and benefits paid. Does Member Wyden agree that our intent is to  allow struggling small businesses to access the retention credit, even  if they have received a PPP loan?    Yes. That is why we are allowing these businesses, both  those with forgiven loans and those without, to claim credits for wages  paid in previous quarters that this bill makes eligible for the credit  on their fourth quarter 2020 payroll tax filings. This will prevent  small businesses from having to amend their previously filed payroll  tax returns, easing the paperwork burden for both taxpayers and the  Internal Revenue Service. I know Ranking Member Wyden will join me in  urging the IRS to do all they can to simplify and expedite the process  for eligible businesses retroactively claiming the retention credit.  The last thing these businesses need right now is additional, complex  payroll tax filings.   I thank the ranking member for engaging in this colloquy to discuss  this important issue and the clarification included in the pending  appropriations bill.
