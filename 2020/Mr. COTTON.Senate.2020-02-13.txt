 Mr. President, this is not about the Basque, and this is  not about the IRA. This resolution applies only to the Government of  Iran. This is, indeed, only about the Islamic Revolutionary Guard  Corps.   Let me tell you a story about the last 17 years in Iraq.   For 17 years, the most deadly weapon our troops have faced has been  something called an explosively formed penetrator. It takes a slug of  copper, superheats it into a ball of magma, and sends it hurtling  through the air at 6,000 feet per second at our troops. I will spare  you the graphic details of what a liquid ball of copper magma does when  it travels at 6,000 feet per second into the human body, but I will  tell you that those were smuggled into Iraq by, yes, the Islamic  Revolutionary Guard Corps.   The vote here is simple: Do you want to vote to stand with our  troops, hundreds of whom have died at the hands of Iran, or do you want  to vote to be a lawyer for Iranian terrorists?
