 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Hannah  Rosenthal's extraordinary career as she celebrates her retirement as  President and CEO of the Milwaukee Jewish Federation. Hannah has had a  long and distinguished career as an influential advocate of tolerance,  and her mark on the Jewish community is indelible. She is best known  for building bridges between disparate factions and believing that  everyone, no matter their background or perspective, deserves a seat at  the table.   Hannah transferred from Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts to the  University of Wisconsin-Madison after falling in love with the city and  the university during a Hebrew class she attended the summer after her  sophomore year. She received her bachelor of arts degree from UW- Madison and studied for the rabbinate in Jerusalem and California.   Hannah's father was a rabbi and Holocaust survivor who inspired her  to lead a life shaped by her Jewish faith. Rabbi Franz Rosenthal's  experiences as a prisoner at Buchenwald and a refugee in this country  helped forge his daughter's identity as an avid champion of human  rights.   Hannah's extensive career includes impressive experience at State,  local, national, and international levels. She served as the founding  executive director of the Wisconsin Women's Council and head of the  Jewish Council for Public Affairs. In 1995, she was appointed by  President Bill Clinton to serve as the midwest regional director of the  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.   Although I had the pleasure of working with Hannah at many points in  her remarkable career, I am especially grateful for all she taught me  about effective advocacy, particularly advocacy on behalf of women.  Early in my career, I worked with Hannah in her role leading the  Wisconsin Women's Council to organize support for State efforts to  guarantee equal pay for equal work.   Hannah is perhaps best known for her role as the U.S. Special Envoy  to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism. Appointed by President Barack  Obama in 2009, she used her role to build coalitions of sometimes  unlikely allies to denounce hatred around the world. She was not afraid  to confront bigotry head on. She personally took those who denied the  Holocaust on tours of concentration camps. In 2010, she switched her  speech on anti-Semitism at an international conference on tolerance  with the Special Representative to Muslim Communities so that she  condemned Islamophobia in the strongest possible terms while her Muslim  counterpart strongly denounced anti-Semitism. She summed up her  philosophy succinctly in an interview with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial  Museum by saying, ``This isn't just about the Jews, this is about  hatred, and that affects everyone.''   Hannah is bold, resolute, and fearless. She believes there is no room  in this world for intolerance toward others, and she has made it her  mission in life to speak out against hatred and bigotry in all forms.  It is the mindset that shaped her legacy at the Milwaukee Jewish  Federation and led her to challenge young people to volunteer at  organizations that serve people unlike them through the creation of the  Hours Against Hate global campaign.   Hannah deserves to be proud of her many national and international  accomplishments, but her heart remains rooted at home in Wisconsin with  her friends, family, and community. Hannah has made many close friends  along her journey who stuck by her through thick and thin. She also  takes much pride and delight in her two daughters and young grandson.   Public servant, activist, icon, and pioneer are words that only begin  to  [[Page S7236]]  describe the contributions Hannah has made in the fight for a more kind  and just world. Although Hannah's retirement marks the end of a  chapter, she will never stop fighting for what she believes to be  right. I will forever be grateful for Hannah's loyal advocacy and  forever honored to call her my friend.                            ____________________
