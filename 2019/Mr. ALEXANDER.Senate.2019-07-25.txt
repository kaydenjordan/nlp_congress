 Madam President, I have one message for my colleagues  in the Senate and those who might be watching. It is about this chart,  which is very simple. This is the line of what we call discretionary  spending. This is about 31 percent of the budget. That is the budget  agreement you have read about in the newspapers the last couple of  days. That is what we are talking about.   It is a blue line. It has to do with paying for our national defense,  so it is about half of the dollars; then for our national parks,  America's best idea; then for the National Institutes of Health, the  source of medical miracles ranging from restoring your heart to curing  Zika to the National Laboratories, which are the sources of our  competition with the rest of the world. That is what this money is for.   What the blue line recognizes is that for the last 10 years, the  growth in spending for national defense, national parks, the National  Institutes of Health, and National Labs has gone up at about the rate  of inflation, and for the next 10 years, including the budget agreement  that the President and the congressional leaders recommended this week,  it will go at about the rate of inflation.   The point is, for 20 years--2008 to 2029--the increase in spending  for the amount of money we are talking about and for the type of  spending in the budget agreement is not the source of the Federal  deficit. What is? Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and interest-- that is the red line that 10 years ago was $1.8 trillion. At the rate  we are going, it will be $5.4 trillion in 10 years. That is not the  type of spending we are talking about in the budget agreement.   My message today is in support of properly funding national defense,  national parks, National Institutes of Health, and National Labs and  not beating our chest and pretending that we are balancing the budget  on the backs of our soldiers, our medical miracles, and our national  parks when, in fact, it is the entitlements that the President and the  Democrats and the Republicans in Congress need to address.   I will talk about the blue line today. I have talked about the red  line plenty before. Former Senator Corker and I introduced legislation  a few years ago that would have reduced the growth of this red line by  $1 trillion over 10 years. The only problem was, we were the only two  cosponsors of the legislation.   The budget deficit is vitally damaging to our country, but the budget  agreement that President Trump recommended is not the source of the  budget deficit. That part of the budget is under control. That is 31  percent of all the dollars we spend in the United States. Just add to  that, if this continues for another 10 years, this blue line--national  defense, national parks, National Institutes of Health, National  Laboratories--is going to go from 31 percent of the budget to 22  percent of the budget, and mandatory spending is going up to 78  percent. This is the budget deficit. This is the budget agreement we  are going to be voting on next week. That part of the budget is under  control.   Here is what the budget agreement, which the President recommended  and our Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate have  recommended and which I strongly support, does. The first thing it does  is suspend the debt limit--the amount we can borrow. If we don't do  that, we have a global fiscal crisis. We all know that, so we need to  do it.   Second, it raises the defense and nondefense discretionary budget  caps. That is this blue line down here. That is the amount of money we  can spend, as I said, on national defense. That is about half of the  spending--and then our veterans, National Labs, biomedical research,  and national parks.   Let's talk about the military for just a minute. Former Secretary of  Defense James Mattis, who had enormous respect here in Congress, said  that ``no enemy in the field has done as much harm to the readiness of  the U.S. military than the combined impact of the Budget Control Act's  defense spending caps, worsened by operating for 10 of the last 11  years under continuing resolutions of varied and unpredictable  duration.''   In plain English, what that means is that because of the President's  leadership and the recommendations of our bipartisan leaders, we will  avoid what Secretary Mattis said has been so damaging to our military.   Here is what happened. Back in 2011, we passed the Budget Control Act  to try to limit this part of the budget. That came after a special  committee was appointed, which everyone hoped would deal with this part  of the budget--the problem part, the part that is causing the deficit.   The Budget Control Act came up with a formula that everybody thought  would work. They said: Well, if we put in there that we will have  dramatic reductions in military spending, Congress will never do that,  so they will be forced to finally do something we all should have had  the courage to do a long time ago, and that is deal with entitlements.    What happened? We didn't deal with the red line, and we cut the  military. We cut the military badly over the last 10 years, and we are  just now beginning to catch up. Last year, Congress avoided  sequestration and increased discretionary spending for fiscal years  2018 and 2019.   Let me say it again, because I am going to repeat it over and over  and over: We increased spending last year at about the rate of  inflation. That is not the cause of the Federal deficit. Reaching that  agreement, though, meant that for the first time in nearly a decade the  Department of Defense received its budget on time, and it received a  record funding level for research and development.   This new 2-year budget agreement that the President has recommended  will rebuild our military by providing $738 billion for defense  discretionary spending for 2020 and $740 billion for 2021.   It will also allow us to fulfill the commitment we made as a part of  the New START Treaty in 2010 in December. I voted for that, and part of  the deal with President Obama was that if we passed the treaty limiting  nuclear weapons, we would make sure that ours worked. President Trump  said the other day that Russia has 1,111 nuclear weapons, and they all  work. We don't want them to use them, and the best way to keep them  from using them is to make sure ours work.   We have reached a budget agreement so that we can get to work on the  appropriations bills and hopefully get many of them done before the end  of the fiscal year, which is the 30th of September. That is important  to the military especially.   When I met with Secretary of the Army Mark Esper, who was approved by  a big vote yesterday as Secretary of Defense, we talked about what it  meant to have an appropriations bill passed into law on time, instead  of a so-called continuing resolution, which is just a lazy way to go.  It just says to spend next year what you spent last year, which means  we don't spend for the things we need to spend, and we don't stop  spending on the things we shouldn't spend.   Here are some of the benefits of passing the appropriations bill on  time,  [[Page S5087]]  which would mean October 1. It keeps large projects on time and on  budget. That is true in the Defense Department, and it is also true  other places. We have a big project called the Uranium Processing  Facility at Oak Ridge, TN, which comes through the Energy and Water  Appropriations Committee, which I chair, and Senator Feinstein is the  ranking member. We made sure that is on time and on budget--$6.5  billion by 2025. But if we don't appropriate the money on time and on  budget, we can't finish the project on time and on budget, and who is  hurt by that? Our national defense and our taxpayers or the Chickamauga  Lock in Tennessee.   All of the Army Corps of Engineers leaders have told me: Don't start  these projects and then stop them. Don't stop and start and stop and  start. That wastes money and slows things down.   So, for the last several years, we have continued steady  reconstruction. We need to pass these on time and on budget.   Also, it keeps equipment maintenance at the Department of Defense on  schedule. That saves money. There is more research and development for  new technologies. It speeds up modernization of current equipment and  keeps military training on schedule. That means soldiers, sailors,  airmen, and marines are properly prepared for prompt combat, and it  prevents accidents.   This new 2-year agreement also helps our veterans. In 2018, President  Trump signed the VA MISSION Act, which the Senate passed by a vote of  92 to 5. The MISSION Act gave veterans the ability to seek medical care  outside the Department of Veterans Affairs and see a private doctor  closer to home. So if you are 60 miles away in the State of Nebraska or  Kansas or Tennessee and you need medical care and you can't be seen at  a VA facility, you can see a private doctor close to home. This budget  agreement makes sure we have enough money to support that, and I will  ask the staff here how much that is.   Senator Perdue said yesterday that 40 percent of the increase in the  spending in this budget agreement, on the discretionary side, is to  help veterans with the Choice Program. So it is not even in the  national defense part of the budget; it is in the nondefense part of  the budget. It helps veterans. So 40 percent of this increase is  helping veterans on top of what we spend for defense, and we still keep  the spending at about the rate of inflation. That is not the source of  our budget deficit.   It is important for the American people to know that the Republican  majority in Congress has worked together with Democrats to provide  record levels of funding for science, research, and technology. In the  Senate, Senator Blunt from Missouri and Senator Murray from Washington  State have provided the leadership for that in the Appropriations  Committee.   In April 2016, Francis Collins, Director of the National Institutes  of Health, told our Appropriations Committee--I am a member of that, as  are Senator Durbin and others; we worked on this together--that with  adequate and consistent funding, he can make 10 bold predictions about  some of the medical miracles he expects over the next several years. He  talked about regenerative medicine that would replace heart transplants  by restoring your heart from your own cells. He talked about vaccines  for Zika, for HIV/AIDS, and for the universal flu, which kills tens of  thousands. He talked about an artificial pancreas. He talked about  cures for Alzheimer's or at least medicines that would identify the  symptoms--that would identify Alzheimer's before the symptoms and do  something about it.   Since fiscal year 2015, the Appropriations Committee has increased  funding for the National Institutes of Health by $9 billion, or 30  percent. From $30.3 billion in 2015 to $39.34 billion in fiscal year  2019, Senator Blunt and Senator Murray did that by cutting some  programs and increasing the National Institutes of Health. They did it  all down here in the blue line that stays within the rate of  inflation--not up here in the red line. That is called good government.   I can't tell you the number of leaders of academic and research  institutions I meet who say that the young investigators in our country  are so encouraged by this new funding for biomedical research, and they  are busy working on the next miracles. That is what consistent funding  will do.    Dr. Collins came back to the committee this year, and I asked him if  he was ready to update those bold predictions. He said: We are close to  a cure for sickle cell anemia--sickle cell disease--and a new,  nonaddictive painkiller which in my view would be the holy grail in our  fight against opioids. With this new budget agreement, Congress could  increase funding for the National Institutes of Health for the sixth  consecutive year to continue this lifesaving research and do it all  within the blue line, which is not the cause of the Federal budget  deficit.   Let's go to the Office of Science. Last year, the Energy and Water  Development Appropriations Subcommittee that I chair with the Senator  from California, Mrs. Feinstein, the ranking Democrat, agreed, along  with Congress, for the fourth consecutive year--and President Trump  signed it--to provide record funding for the Department of Energy's  Office of Science. With this new budget, we can do it for 5 years. What  does this mean? This means funding for the 17 National Laboratories,  including the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which are America's secret  weapon. No other country has anything like our National Laboratories.  Many Americans worry about competition from China and other parts of  the world. How do we meet that competition? Through innovation.   Where does that innovation come from? It is hard to think of a major  initiative that has not come since World War II without some federally  sponsored research funding. Funding our Labs is important and helps  keep us first in the world in supercomputing. Why is supercomputing  important? Because it keeps our standard of living high and keeps our  national defense on its toes.   China knows that. Two years ago, China had the two top  supercomputers, but today the United States has the two fastest  supercomputers in the world and the Exascale computing project will  deliver the next generation system starting in 2021. This  accomplishment is not the result of 1 year of funding or one political  party but 10 years of bipartisan effort through the Bush, Obama, and  Trump administrations, Democratic and Republican, to try to make sure  America is first in the world of supercomputing. We did it all under  the blue line over the last 10 years. The funding went up at the rate  of inflation, not through the Moon like in entitlements which is the  source of the Federal budget deficit, not the money we spend to keep  ahead of China and Japan in supercomputing.   On national parks, Ken Burns and others say America's national parks  are our best idea. There are 417 of them. They have a badly deferred  maintenance backlog. Senators Portman, Warner, King, myself, and others  are working with President Trump, who supports our legislation, to try  to cut half of the deferred maintenance in the national park backlogs  in the next 5 years. We are going to use money from energy on Federal  lands to do that.   Americans are often shocked to find when they go to Federal parks  that bathrooms don't work, roofs leak, and campgrounds are closed  because there is not enough money for maintenance. This budget helps  make sure our national parks are something Americans can continue to  enjoy--all 418 of those parks--and we do that under the blue line that  goes up at the rate of inflation, not at the budget-busting rate of the  entitlements line.   I have said this over and over, and it needs to be said over and  over. The red line is mandatory spending. The blue line is  discretionary spending. The blue line will be $1.6 trillion at the end  of 10 more years. The red line will be $5.4 trillion at the end of 10  more years. Ten years ago, the blue line was 1.1 and the red line was  1.8. What do you think the problem is for the source of the Federal  budget? You don't need a Ph.D. in mathematics to figure this out. It is  not this line. It is not national defense; it is not biomedical  research; it is not supercomputing; it is not the Army Corps of  Engineers. It is this one line--entitlements. It is our fault for not  having dealt with it, but we shouldn't beat our chest and pretend to  balance the budget by decimating the work on that blue line.  Discretionary spending is only 31 percent of the money. Mandatory  spending is the rest of the funding. It will increase from 69 percent  of  [[Page S5088]]  total spending to 78 percent in 2029. The spending on national parks,  national defense, National Institutes of Health, and National Labs will  be reduced to 22 percent. I don't believe we can properly defend our  country, properly keep up our parks, stay first in the world in  supercomputing, and expect to continue biomedical research that  produces lifesaving miracles if we squeeze all the money out of the  blue line and let it go up in the air on the red line.   The United States is experiencing robust economic growth, and there  is a lot of political talk in this Chamber but no one really disputes  that. Our economy is growing and growing. We have not seen anything  like it in a long time. There have been 6 million new jobs created just  since President Trump was elected, with the lowest unemployment rate in  50 years, at 3.7 percent.   Before Congress passed the major tax reform in 31 years, our gross  domestic product was projected to be a little less than 2 percent over  the next 10 years. For the first quarter of 2019 this year, actual  gross domestic product was a little over 3 percent. Higher GDP and  lower unemployment leads to higher family incomes and more revenue for  the Federal Government. More revenue for the Federal Government reduces  the debt.   I urge my colleagues to support this 2-year budget agreement. To  those who are worried about the Federal debt, I am worried about it  too. That is why Senator Corker and I put our bill in to reduce by a  growth of $1 trillion over 10 years what is happening with this red  line. If we want to talk about the Federal budget deficit, let's talk  about where it really is. Let's talk about the red line, which has gone  from $1.8 trillion 10 years ago and is projected by the Congressional  Budget Office to go to $5.4 trillion 10 years from now.   Let's not pretend we are balancing the Federal budget by focusing on  the part of the Federal budget that is under control, the part that  funds our military, national parks, biomedical research, and National  Labs. For the last 10 years, it has gone up at about the rate of  inflation, and for the next 10 years, according to the Congressional  Budget Office--including this 2-year budget agreement which only  affects the blue line, not the red line--it goes up at the rate of  inflation. So I am proud to support it. I believe it is the right thing  to do, and when the House sends us a chance to vote for it next week, I  hope it gets a big vote from the U.S. Senate.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 8 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority leaders.
