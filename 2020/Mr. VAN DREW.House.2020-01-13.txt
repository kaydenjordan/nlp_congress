 Madam Speaker, today I want to acknowledge the  Millville-based production company, Glasstown Productions in south  Jersey.   Glasstown Productions is an exemplary company that has excelled in  telling their clients' stories through film. Their work has been  recognized by the Dog Film Festival, CinemaFest, and the International  Christian Film and Music Festival.   Under the leadership of CEO Robert Penza and Creative Director Jason  Penza, Glasstown has brought home multiple awards and recognitions to  the State of New Jersey and, most proudly, to south Jersey.   Last year Glasstown Productions was honored with a Gold Telly Award  for its film, ``Ask Seek Knock: The Story of Brianna Wittman.''   Glasstown Productions is just one example of the opportunities to  build something great in south Jersey. The coveted Gold Telly Award  speaks to the quality of work being produced in our district, and I  commend Glasstown Productions for their excellent accomplishments. We  are truly, sincerely and extremely proud of them and what they have  accomplished.                            ____________________
