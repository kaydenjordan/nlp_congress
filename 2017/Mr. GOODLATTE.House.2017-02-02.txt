 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 71, I call  up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 40) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Social Security Administration relating to  Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007,  [[Page H895]]  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 71, the joint  resolution is considered read.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 40         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves the rule submitted by the Social Security       Administration relating to Implementation of the NICS       Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (published at 81 Fed. Reg.       91702 (December 19, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force       or effect.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The joint resolution shall be debatable for  1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their designees.   The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Conyers) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials to H.J. Res. 40.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials to H.J. Res. 40.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 40, a joint  resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the rules  submitted by the Social Security Administration relating to  implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.   On December 19, 2016, in the waning days of the previous  administration, the Social Security Administration published a rule  finalizing the criteria for sending the names of certain Social  Security beneficiaries to the National Instant Criminal Background  Check System, NICS.   Under the rule, an individual's name will be sent to the NICS if they  receive disability insurance or supplemental security income benefits  based on having a mental disorder, the person is between age 18 and the  full retirement age, and the SSA determines that the person needs a  representative payee to manage their benefits. Individuals who meet  these criteria would be prohibited from exercising their Second  Amendment right to possess firearms.   This rule is a slap in the face of those in the disabled community  because it paints all those who suffer from mental disorders with the  same broad brush. It assumes that simply because an individual suffers  from a mental condition, that individual is unfit to exercise his or  her Second Amendment rights. No data exists to support such an  egregious assertion. In fact, studies show that those who suffer from  mental disorders are more likely to be victims of crime rather than  perpetrators of crime.   Furthermore, there is a total absence of any meaningful due process  protections under the rule. Currently, citizens lose their right to  possess a firearm when they have been convicted by a judge or jury of a  felony or misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, when they have been  dishonorably discharged after given a hearing, or when they have been  deemed a fugitive after being given an option to appear and avail  themselves of their due process rights, among other reasons.                                time  1345    All of these have one thing in common: they all provide due process  to the affected individual.   Under the SSA rule, the affected party has no ability to defend  himself or to even introduce evidence before the SSA denies his right  to possess a firearm. Additionally, at no time during the process  during which the SSA is seeking to deny someone his Second Amendment  rights must the Social Security Administration make a determination  that the individual poses a risk to himself or others. This is the  standard that has long been used to determine if the right to possess a  firearm should be prohibited.   Some may point to the rule's appeals process as providing a form of  due process. However, the appeals process is severely flawed because it  puts the burden on individuals to prove that restoring their Second  Amendment rights would not pose a danger to public safety or be  contrary to the public interest. In every other instance in which  someone is facing a loss of his ability to possess a firearm, the  burden is on the government to prove that the individual should have  his right taken away. Under this flawed system, the individual bears  the burden against the government. This is not what due process looks  like.   During debate on the rule for this joint resolution, I heard a number  of reasons from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle as to why  they opposed this joint resolution. Quite frankly, I am shocked at what  little regard they have for the disabled community. The gentleman from  Massachusetts claimed that this joint resolution was done at the  bidding of the National Rifle Association. Yes, the National Rifle  Association does support H.J. Res. 40. However, what my colleague from  Massachusetts failed to mention during the debate yesterday was who  else supports the joint resolution.   Supporters include the American Association of People with  Disabilities, the National Disability Rights Network, the Autistic Self  Advocacy Network, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the Arc of  the United States, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, the  Disability Law Center of Alaska, the National Council on Independent  Living, and the National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery. Even the  National Council on Disability--an independent Federal agency that  makes recommendations to the President and Congress to enhance the  quality of life for all Americans with disabilities and their  families--has called on Congress to utilize the Congressional Review  Act in order to repeal this rule.   It was also mentioned--and will, undoubtedly, be mentioned here later  today--that this rule received over 91,000 comments. What they didn't  tell you, and what I am guessing they won't tell you today, is that the  overwhelming majority of the comments opposed the rule. Opposition  wasn't based on small, technical issues. It was based on the  fundamentally flawed concept of the rule. Many of the organizations I  mentioned earlier provided comments to the agency. Rather than listen  to the organizations advocating for the rights of the disabled, the  previous administration decided to ignore them.   I thank the gentleman from the State of Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson) for  his hard work on this important issue that affects law-abiding citizens  in every congressional district in America.   I ask my colleagues to support this resolution--to stand with the  disabled community and to stand with the Constitution. Support H.J.  Res. 40.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous  consent to yield the control of the balance of my time to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson), the sponsor of this resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.
