 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, today I will introduce an  amendment that uses the Holman rule to slash the Secretary of Defense  Lloyd Austin's salary to no more than $1, and $1 is too much money.   Let's talk about the job description of the Secretary of Defense.  That role oversees the Defense Department and acts as the principal  defense policymaker and adviser to the President of the United States.   The Department of Defense's mission statement states: ``With our  military tracing its roots back to pre-Revolutionary times, the  Department has grown and evolved with our Nation. Our mission is to  provide the military forces needed to deter war and ensure our Nation's  security.''   Secretary Austin has not fulfilled his job duties. As matter of fact,  he is destroying our military.   During Secretary Austin's tenure, military recruitment has reached  crisis levels of low recruitment. The numbers show that the Army  expects to fall 15,000 recruits short of its annual recruiting goal  this year. The Navy is expecting to be short 10,000 recruits. The Air  Force is down another 3,000.   This cannot stand, especially with our government funding and fueling  a war in Ukraine that is leading us undoubtedly to world war III.   Secretary Lloyd Austin failed America with his withdrawal from  Afghanistan, making American forces leave in retreat and feeling like a  failure.   Secretary Austin also forced more than 8,000 troops to be kicked out  of  [[Page H4611]]  the military for refusing the COVID vaccine.   My amendment is a strong amendment, and many Americans agree. We do  not want the United States military led by failure causing us to be  weak. We need to pass my amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Van Orden), who has also proudly served in the United  States military.    Madam Chair, there is no excuse. You can't  blame President Trump for the failure in Afghanistan. That failure lies  on Secretary Lloyd Austin, Joe Biden, the President of the United  States, and his administration.   President Trump would have never led our troops to failure in  Afghanistan. He would have never abandoned $7 billion worth of military  equipment. President Trump would have never left the Afghan people in  complete ruin to be controlled by a terrorist government, the Taliban.   That is a complete excuse. Democrats need to stop blaming President  Trump and his administration for Joe Biden's failures.   I urge the House to adopt my amendment, Madam Chair, to take  Secretary Lloyd Austin's salary using the Holman rule, which is a rule  that allows us to fire failures that are serving our government and  serving our country.   Lloyd Austin is not serving the United States military.   Lloyd Austin is leading the United States into failure.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment will prohibit the  Department of Homeland Security from implementing any mask mandate for  the employees of the Department.   This is an extremely important amendment. Our current appropriation  bills completely stop the mandates for vaccines but do not stop the  mandates for any future mask mandates.   We need to recognize as a country what Americans have already  recognized, COVID is over. This is something that we even passed a  resolution on, and the President himself signed it, declaring COVID is  over.   We all know something to be very, very true: Masks don't work. They  did not stop the spread of COVID. They were really a violation of  people's rights. Even Dr. Anthony Fauci himself said that masks do not  prevent the spread of COVID, and he said so in a personal email to one  of his friends, advising her not to wear a mask when she flew on an  airplane.   However, the Biden administration forced our TSA agents, forced  everyone to be masked every single time they flew and every single time  TSA agents showed up to work.   This administration insisted that illegal aliens posed no threat to  spreading COVID, yet treated Border Patrol agents as if they were the  COVID superspreaders. We saw many migrants come up illegally invading  our country with no masks on, a constant, steady stream of thousands  and thousands of people coming into our country from countries all over  the world, bringing all kinds of diseases, but yet Homeland decided  that it was Border Patrol agents and ICE agents who had to be masked,  not the people coming into our country illegally, bringing all kinds of  diseases with them. They weren't worried about COVID. It was about  control.   Border Patrol agents and all DHS employees were required to wear  masks when fulfilling a number of official duties at a time when there  was almost no enforcement of these same mask requirements for these  same illegal aliens coming across the border.   In light of Democrats' attempts to manufacture the resurgence of  COVID, my amendment will protect employees of the Department of  Homeland Security against all tyrannical mask mandates.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2130     Mr. Chair, this is laughable. This is  absolutely pathetic. All the whining and complaining about shutdowns  coming from Democrats, who forced shutdowns on Americans by shutting  down their businesses, shutting down their freedom of speech, shutting  down their churches, shutting down their playgrounds, shutting down  beaches, shutting down every human right that Americans possessed,  shutting down their freedoms. Listen to Democrats whining and  complaining about working late at night.   Americans wanted to work late. They wanted to work all the time, but  Democrats forced shutdowns. Do you know how many small businesses  closed? We don't know the actual number, but it is a casualty to the  American Dream. Businesses were forced to shut down, and they went out  of business.   Children are behind in schooling because their schools shut down, and  they were forced to stay home doing virtual schooling. We have kids all  over America who can't read, can't do math, and this is all happening  under the Biden administration that wants to use all of our hard-earned  taxpayer resources to pay for migrant children in our taxpayer-funded  schools.   Yes, it is important to have an amendment in the Department of  Homeland Security appropriation bills forcing there to be no mask  mandates because we know the truth: Democrats will do everything they  can to bring COVID back, scare Americans, and convince them that a  piece of paper strapped on their ears with rubber bands is going to  protect them from the man-made COVID-19 virus that came from the Wuhan  lab.   This is outrageous. I can't listen to the pathetic whining. It really  is pathetic.   We remember last Congress. Last Congress, Democrats had us in here  late at night practically every night. I can remember many times  sitting on the House floor waiting for them to get all of their things  together and voting past midnight.   This is what hard work looks like. We don't want to hear government  employees getting a taxpayer-funded paycheck whining about a shutdown  when this comes from the very party that shut down America, and we  haven't recovered yet.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment will prohibit funding  for the Uniting for Ukraine program.   This is a streamlined, categorical parole process that allows an  unlimited number of illegal aliens into our country from Ukraine.   There have been over 9 million illegal aliens who have invaded our  country since Joe Biden took office. It is unprecedented.   Just last month, over 300,000 illegals invaded our country, the most  ever recorded in a single month. Over this past weekend, Border Patrol  reported there were over 11,000 illegal alien encounters in just a 24- hour period.   I deeply sympathize with the innocent people in Ukraine, especially  since our government is forcing a proxy war there by funding and  fueling the war instead of pushing peace in this country.   However, America is facing our own war at our southern border, and we  cannot stand to address every global crisis when our own house is not  in order, not safe.   We cannot afford to violate our own immigration laws on behalf of a  global crisis, especially a global crisis that the United States  Government is fueling and funding. The United States is fueling the war  in Ukraine by sending tanks, ammunition, F-16s, and over $113 billion  taxpayer dollars and counting, especially when the debate in Washington  and the argument is about more money for Ukraine.   The Uniting for Ukraine process grants mass categorical parole to  these individuals, which is a complete violation of our own immigration  laws. Parole is to be granted on a case-by-case basis, as required by  the law. Although many claim the specific process is granting parole on  a case-by-case basis, based on a proven track record, this  administration doesn't even know what case by case means. They just  know mass migration into the United States.   Joe Biden and Secretary Mayorkas continue to abuse our immigration  laws and create categorical parole for illegal aliens into our country.  Secretary Mayorkas has already granted temporary legal status to 75,000  Ukrainians under the temporary protected status designation, which  includes benefits such as work permits, Social Security numbers, and  driver's licenses.   This Uniting for Ukraine process has no numerical cap, which means an  unlimited number of illegal aliens from Ukraine can come and displace  American workers. Our country needs to put American citizens first for  once.   We need to win the war at the southern border that the Mexican  cartels are waging on our country before granting parole to an  unlimited number of individuals and allowing them to remain here for an  indefinite amount of time.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I will remind the House and the  American people watching at home that Democrats aren't worried about  shutdowns. They love shutdowns. They shut down America for almost 2  years.   People are still suffering from the Democratic, communist shutdowns.  I don't know why they keep complaining about it because they are the  party that forced it on the American people while they are complaining  about it for themselves. That is so pathetic.   Everyone here gets a taxpayer-funded paycheck, so don't whine about  shutdowns when you shut down America on the very people who pay your  salary.   Let's talk about allowing an unlimited number of Ukrainians into the  country on the American taxpayer dime. This war is not supported by  American taxpayers, not Americans. Over 55 percent of Americans do not  want to fund it anymore.   We want to talk about funding Border Patrol agents. Let's talk about  funding Border Patrol so they can secure our border, not be the  welcoming committee to the entire world for the United States of  America.   Mr. Chair, I ask the House to pass my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  2145     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment uses the Holman rule,  which is different from other amendments that have been introduced.  This uses the Holman rule to reduce the salary of Secretary Alejandro  Mayorkas to $1, and $1 is too much money.   Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has aided and abetted the complete  invasion of our country by deliberately flooding our Nation with drugs,  terrorists, and illegals from over 160 countries from around the world.   The mission of the Department of Homeland Security States right here:  ``With honor and integrity, we will safeguard the American people, our  homeland, and our values.''   Being that Secretary Mayorkas has direction, authority, and control  over the entire Department, he has failed in his duties to safeguard  the American people and our homeland, and he deserves to be fired and  impeached.   His job is to protect our homeland and strengthen the national  security of our country. Yet, his policies, directives, and statements  have created a national security crisis, and has tragically resulted in  the deaths of thousands of Americans each year.   Since assuming office, he has allowed approximately 7.5 million  illegal encounters at our border; over 250 people on the terrorist  watch list to be caught crossing our border, and those are the ones we  know of, approximately 1.6 million known got-aways to evade U.S.  authorities. Imagine how many we don't even know about.   Just this fiscal year alone, Border Patrol arrested over 32,000  illegals with criminal convictions and over 167 MS-13 gang members.   Remember, there are 1.6 million that got away.   Are these terrorists? Are these gang members?   I am sure they are. How many of them have criminal records?   Secretary Mayorkas has allowed fentanyl, the number one killer of  Americans between the ages of 18 and 45, to overwhelmingly flood into  our country and kill around 300 Americans every single day. This fiscal  year alone Border Patrol has seized approximately 24 pounds of fentanyl  attempting to be smuggled into the United States. That is enough  fentanyl to kill every single American 15 times over, but the fentanyl  keeps coming because 300 Americans are dying every single day.   His open border policies have allowed unaccompanied children to be  exploited, and now over 85,000 of them are unaccounted for. Where are  these children?   Tens of thousands of other children have been forced into slave  labor, and that is according to The New York Times.   He has provided copious amounts of baby formula to illegal aliens at  one of the largest processing centers in the country, while American  mothers and infants were intensely suffering from severe shortages and  couldn't find baby formula on the grocery store shelves.   He flooded hospital maternity units with illegal aliens, so much so  that American mothers were turned away and forced to delay inductions.  That was in Yuma, Arizona.   He canceled border wall construction contracts established under  President Trump that would have secured our Nation's border and was  securing our Nation's border, but now the materials lay rusting on the  ground.   He has repeatedly pulled border agents from actually securing our  border and has moved them to processing roles, welcoming committees,  leaving huge gaps for the Mexican cartels and drug smugglers to exploit  and gain control of our border, and they are controlling our border.   He has violated the law by directing DHS to mass-parole illegal  aliens into the U.S. when Federal law specifically prohibits this. He  has encouraged asylum fraud, abused the credible fear standard, and  exercised mass catch-and-release policies.    He has turned every single State into a border State. Veterans are  even being kicked out of their hotel rooms to make room for illegals.   He has even caused approximately a 1,700-percent increase in just one  sector of the northern border. He has not only enabled child  exploitation, sex and drug trafficking, and fentanyl overdoses, but he  has also done everything in his power to put Americans last.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
