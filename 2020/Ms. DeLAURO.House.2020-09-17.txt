 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bill, and I  submit for the Record this letter from the National Partnership for  Women & Families, a nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy organization  committed to improving the lives of women and families by achieving  equity for all women.                                                September 15, 2020.        The National Partnership for Women & Families is a non-      profit, non-partisan advocacy organization committed to       improving the lives of women and families by achieving equity       for all women. Since our creation as the Women's Legal       Defense Fund in 1971, we have fought for every significant       advance for equal opportunity in the workplace, including the       Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 and the Family and       Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). We write today in strong       support for H.R. 2694, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.       This bipartisan legislation will support pregnant workers on       the job, improving women's and families' economic security       and promoting healthier pregnancies.        More than 40 years ago, Congress passed the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act of 1978, outlawing discrimination on the       basis of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions.       Yet pregnancy discrimination is still widespread and impacts       pregnant workers across industry, race, ethnicity and       jurisdiction. Nearly 31,000 pregnancy discrimination charges       were filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity       Commission (EEOC) and state-level fair employment practice       agencies between 2010 and 2015, and the reality of pregnancy       discrimination is likely much worse than illustrated by EEOC       charges. As a result of this discrimination, too many women       must choose between their paychecks and a healthy pregnancy.       That's not a choice anyone should have to make.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would create a clear       policy standard requiring employers to provide reasonable       accommodations to pregnant workers. Support for a law like       the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is nearly universal and       bipartisan. Eighty-nine perfect of voters favor this bill,       including 69 percent of voters who strongly favor it. Just       this Congress, twenty-eight leading private sector employers       endorsed the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act in an open letter       to Congress.        More than 85 percent of women will become mothers at some       point in their working lives. And sometimes, an accommodation       is needed in order for a pregnant worker to continue       performing their job. Those accommodations are often small       changes to their work environment such as additional bathroom       breaks, a stool to sit on or the ability to have a water       bottle at their work station. Although minor, these       accommodations allow pregnant workers to stay in the       workforce and continue to provide for themselves and their       families. When pregnant workers are fired, demoted, or forced       into unpaid leave, they and their families lose critical       income, and they may struggle to re-enter a job market that       is particularly harsh for people who are currently or were       recently pregnant.        Pregnancy discrimination affects women across race and       ethnicity, but women of color and immigrants are at       particular risk. They are disproportionately likely to work       in jobs and industries where accommodations during pregnancy       are not often provided (such as home health aides, food       service workers, package handlers and cleaners). Black women       are much more likely than white women to file pregnancy       discrimination charges; they are also at a higher risk for       pregnancy-related complications like pre-term labor,       preeclampsia and hypertensive disorders, making reasonable       accommodations on the job even more important, and loss of       wages and health insurance due to pregnancy discrimination       especially challenging.        To date, thirty-one states including the District of       Columbia and four cities have passed laws requiring employers       to provide reasonable accommodations to pregnant workers. But       the ability to maintain a healthy pregnancy and keep a job       should not depend on where a pregnant person works. Women are       a crucial part of the workforce and their participation       matters for the growth of our economy and for the stability       and wellbeing of families nationwide. The Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act would strengthen existing federal protections,       ensure more equitable workplaces and allow women to remain in       the workforce and maintain their economic stability while       having the accommodations necessary for healthy pregnancies.       It is time to clarify and strengthen existing federal       protections for pregnant workers by passing the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act.            Sincerely,                                                  Debra L. Ness,                                 President, National Partnership for                                                  Women & Families.    The bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is vital  for women like Regina Scates, a firefighter in Connecticut. She was  placed on unrequested, unpaid leave when she got pregnant, even though  she was still capable of performing light duty work. She was left to  ask: ``How am I going to be able to feed my family?''   Today, 88 percent of first-time mothers work in the third trimester,  yet an estimated 250,000 requests for reasonable accommodations go  unheard and unapproved. And women of color are disproportionately  impacted, being overrepresented in low-wage jobs where accommodations  during pregnancy are not often provided, like healthcare aides and food  service workers.   So we seek to build on the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act, the  first social policy ever to be enacted into law to provide protection  to working mothers. And we must.   Decisions from the Supreme Court have made it exceedingly difficult  for women to get reasonable accommodations under current law even when  the adjustments could be as small as a chair and the stakes could be as  enormous as a miscarriage or preterm birth.   It is modeled after the Americans with Disabilities Act. It  establishes a clear-cut right to reasonable accommodations for all  public sector employees and all private sector employees at companies  with more than 15 workers.   This is not just an economic question. It is a moral question. Like  many of you, I was horrified by reports that doctors at ICE detention  centers performed hysterectomies on women without their consent. It is  unimaginable. It is inhumane and diminishes, dehumanizes and  disrespects women.   To all who preach a culture of life, to all who champion the dignity  of work, I say let us seize the opportunity before us to protect life.    Madam Speaker, to all who preach a culture of life, to  all who champion the dignity of work, I say, Let us seize this  opportunity before us to protect life, to respect women, to protect  pregnant women at work and to do so with the strength, not of just  words, but with the strength of the law. Let us pass this bipartisan  bill.
