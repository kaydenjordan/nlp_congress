 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, today I want to take a moment to recognize  the Tarleton State University Rodeo Team located in Stephenville,  Texas.   Now, if you have never been to a Texas rodeo, I can promise you, it  isn't like anything you have ever seen before. There is nothing quite  like it and, frankly, there is nothing more Texan.   Day in and day out, the young men and women on the Tarleton State  Rodeo Team are dedicated and give 100 percent, no matter what. In fact,  this summer, because of their hard work, the men's team finished second  at the College National Finals Rodeo.   However, this was not an isolated accomplishment. The Tarleton Rodeo  Association has been part of a winning tradition since 1947. They have  won seven national championship titles and 27 individual national  championships.   Mr. Speaker, because of all of this, the Tarleton State Rodeo Team is  the best in Texas and one of the best in the Nation.   I am proud to represent these champions in the 25th Congressional  District, and I look forward to watching them continue to dominate the  competition.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
