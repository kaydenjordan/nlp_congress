 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Ashley Kemmis and Brianna Page for their entrepreneurial  spirit in Valley County.   Ashley and Brianna saw a need in the community for more options for  women's clothing after Shopko closed in Glasgow in 2019.   They teamed up together to launch Thistle and Thread, an online  women's clothing boutique. Since they launched their website one year  ago, Ashley and Brianna's project flourished into a successful  operation out of Eastern Montana.   Women across the country can purchase the boutique's clothing online  and those in eastern Montana can visit their storefront in Glasgow.   It is my honor to recognize Ashley and Brianna for taking the  initiative to successfully launch Thistle and Thread. Thistle and  Thread is a now a proud part of the Glasgow community, and I am  grateful for Ashley and Brianna's entrepreneurship.                            ____________________
