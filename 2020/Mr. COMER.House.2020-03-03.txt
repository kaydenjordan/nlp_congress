 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my firm opposition to  the New Way Forward Act, a radical piece of legislation that would put  American lives at risk in numerous ways.   Under this bill, heinous crimes committed by illegal immigrants would  no longer result in immediate deportation, but, even worse, it would  allow  [[Page H1446]]  those who have been deported to come back to the United States legally  and on the taxpayer's dime--essentially allowing for the importation of  violent and dangerous illegal immigrants into our country. I have yet  to meet a single person who supports that idea.   The bill would also decriminalize illegal entry into the country,  including for criminals who have already been deported.   This measure is a dream for those who seek to abolish ICE, throw open  our national borders, and gut the rule of law in America.   I have heard from constituents who are outraged about this proposal-- and rightfully so. While sponsored by nearly a fifth of the House  Democratic Caucus, the legislation stands little chance of advancing  past President Trump or a Republican Senate. But it is, nonetheless,  important for the American people to know the priorities of some  Members of this body.    I will continue to stand strong against policies like the New Way  Forward Act and any other legislation which would encourage illegal  immigration and cripple the safety of American citizens.                             Honoring Bam Carney     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage the body to keep my  dear friend, Bam Carney, of Campbellsville, Kentucky, in their thoughts  and prayers as he continues to battle a serious illness.   Bam has been hospitalized for over 2 months and has a long journey  ahead. However, anyone who knows Bam knows that he is the ultimate  fighter.   As a father, educator, State representative, and Kentucky's house  majority leader, he has always fought strongly for what he believes in.  But, more importantly, he has always fought for his family and friends  above all else.   Bam's community has organized ``A Day of Prayer and Encouragement for  Bam,'' where people across Kentucky are joining together to lift him up  in prayer.   I ask for this body to join me in keeping my friend and golf buddy in  their thoughts and prayers. He means so much to so many people. I ask  everyone for their prayers as Bam continues his fight.                            ____________________
