 Mr. President, I object to the certificate from the  State of Georgia on the grounds that the electoral votes were not--   The VICE PRESIDENT. There is no debate. There is no debate.   Section 15 and 17 of title 3 of the United States Code requires that  any objection be presented in writing, signed by both a Member of the  House of Representatives and a Senator.   Is the objection in writing and not only signed by the Member, but by  a United States Senator?    Mr. President, even as people waited hours in Georgia--   The VICE PRESIDENT. There is no debate. There is no debate.   If there is not one signed by a Senator, the objection cannot be  entertained.    Mr. President, the objection is signed by a Member of  the House, but not yet by a Member of the Senate.   The VICE PRESIDENT. It is over.
