 Mr. Speaker, for weeks, people across the  country have been protesting in the streets, demanding justice for  George Floyd, for Breonna Taylor, and for a countless number of people  killed by police.   Sadly, incidents like these are something that our communities of  color know too well. This moment--this moment--begs us to act, to be  bold, to capture this opportunity for change.   I commit and I urge all of my colleagues to be allies in this fight  and amplify our voices, recognizing that, once again, it is the women  of color who will take the lead in ensuring justice for all. Vote  ``yes'' on this bill.
