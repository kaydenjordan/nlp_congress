 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, in a bipartisan landslide,  the Senate advanced legislation to get more arms and assistance to the  innocent people of Ukraine.   Senators Collins, Cornyn, Barrasso, and I just returned last night  from Europe. Our first stop was Kyiv. It was moving to feel some of the  impacts of Putin's aggression, to see a free and independent nation  made to literally fight for its life. But it was also inspiring to  witness the bravery and the determination that have united Ukrainians  in the face of this onslaught.   Ukraine has had more than its share of domestic political differences  in recent years. Putin must have thought some Ukrainians would  welcome--would actually welcome--invading Russian forces. Instead, both  Ukrainian-speaking and Russian-speaking Ukrainians have united in  defense of their sovereign nation. Some predicted Ukraine would fold in  a few days and Russia would stroll right to Kyiv. That was wrong too.  Ukraine is tough, and Kyiv remains in Ukrainian hands, with life moving  back toward normalcy despite the continued threat.    Our delegation was honored to meet with President Zelenskyy. He  expressed his gratitude to the United States for our leadership and  support on a bipartisan basis, as well as for other countries that have  stood by his people in their time of need. America is not the only free  country that has Ukraine's back. President Zelenskyy was moved by  certain European countries who have given Ukraine, in his words,  literally ``everything they had.'' Of course, other European countries  can and should do more to help Ukraine. And the administration should  lead an effort to ensure broad, sustained international support for  Ukraine.   America's support for Ukraine has highlighted the limits to our  stockpiles of certain munitions and shortcomings in our own defense  production capacity. A number of European countries have dipped even  deeper into their weapons inventories. They will need a refill as well.   As our European friends wake up from their ``holiday from history''  and increase defense spending, I hope the United States will be a  reliable supplier of advanced weaponry to our NATO allies, a textbook  win-win.   Our delegation reiterated to President Zelenskyy the bipartisan  consensus which the Senate demonstrated with last night's vote. The  United States of America has Ukraine's back and will stand with our  friends until they win.   Ukraine is not asking anybody to fight their fight for them. They are  only asking for help in getting the resources and tools they need to  defend themselves. And we and our friends and partners across the free  world will stand behind Ukraine until they achieve victory as they  define it. The outcome of this fight has major ramifications for the  West, and the Ukrainians should not be left to stand all alone.   As an overwhelming bipartisan majority of the Senate reaffirmed  yesterday, America's decision to support Ukraine is not some frivolous  act of  [[Page S2526]]  charity. It serves our own national security and strategic interests  for international borders to continue to actually mean something. It  serves our own security and interest to impose massive costs on Putin's  long-running campaign of violent imperialism. And it directly and  powerfully serves our national interest to deter potential future wars  of aggression before they start.   So, Madam President, I assure you that President Xi and the CCP are  watching Ukraine carefully. There is a concrete reason why democratic  Asian countries like Japan and Taiwan are rooting hard for Ukraine to  prevail. Moreover, if we are stuck in a long-term strategic competition  with China, we will want a stable, secure, and strong Europe on our  side.   Speaking of America's national interest, our delegation also visited  what we hope and expect will soon be the two newest members of the NATO  alliance. We arrived in Stockholm and Helsinki just as the leaders of  Sweden and Finland announced their nations will seek to join the  alliance that has secured peace in Europe for more than 73 years.   It was an honor to have robust discussions with Prime Minister  Andersson, Defense Minister Hultqvist, and key parliamentary leaders in  Stockholm; and President Niinisto, Prime Minister Marin, Defense  Minister Kaikkonen, and parliamentary leaders in Helsinki. I gave them  my assurance as Senate Republican leader that I fully support both  Finland's and Sweden's accession. I will do all I can to speed treaty  ratification through the Senate.   Finland and Sweden are impressive and capable countries, with  military capabilities that surpass many of our existing NATO allies. As  new members, they would more than pull their weight.   These two nations' geographic locations are strategic. They have  well-equipped and professional armed forces. Their military and high- tech industrial bases are robust. There is already significant  interoperability that connects their defenses and NATO's. I will have  more to say on this subject in the days and weeks ahead. Finland and  Sweden would make NATO even stronger than it stands today.   Finally, it must be noted that our delegation was not the most  important group of Americans shipping out to stand with our friends in  Europe--not by a longshot. There are 100,000 American soldiers  currently stationed in Europe to bolster the peace and shore up NATO.  This includes the Kentucky-based V Corps.   And we received word just last week that 4,700 members of the 101st  Airborne from Kentucky's Fort Campbell will also travel to Europe in  the coming months. The Screaming Eagles have a long history of  defending America's national security interests in Europe. I am proud  of these brave men and women for being ready to deploy at a moment's  notice. I am proud America can make this peaceful contribution to our  allies' sovereignty and strength in Europe, and I am proud of the  entire Fort Campbell community for keeping these men and women well- prepared for this mission.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on another matter, by early 2020,  before the pandemic, Republican policies had helped create one of the  best economic moments for working Americans literally in our lifetimes.  Unemployment was low, inflation was low, and real take-home pay was  rising steadily. In fact, we had wages rising faster for the bottom 25  percent of the wage scale than for the top 25 percent.   The incoming all-Democratic government was handed a reopening economy  and a million vaccines going into arms per day. The country was packed  with optimism and primed for a comeback. But through their far-left  policy choices, Washington Democrats have driven our economy right into  the ground. Inflation is setting 40-year records in consecutive months;  gas and diesel prices have set new all-time highs on consecutive days;  and sticker shock continues to cause headaches for Americans buying  household essentials.   One college student in California said that buying groceries has him  ``taking extra loans to pay for my expenses. I'm maxing out my credit  cards.'' A woman in Virginia reports she has taken to visiting three  different food stores in one trip to make sure she is getting the best  prices on everything she needs. A warehouse worker in New Jersey says  she and her husband are spending more time hunting for coupons.         It's not a lot, but I'm trying to buy healthy things that       also fill us up.    Overall grocery prices have jumped 10 percent in the past year, just  one part of why many Americans say the Biden economy is not working for  them. Fewer than one in four American consumers say the current  economic conditions are even somewhat good, and fewer than one in five  say the Biden administration's policies have done anything to help.   Democrats made runaway reckless spending their new normal here in  Washington. So historic, painful inflation has become the new normal  for working families everywhere else.                            ____________________
