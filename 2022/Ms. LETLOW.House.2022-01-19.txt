 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Councilman Harry  Silver, a truly distinguished public servant, as he marks his 100th  birthday.   Harry Silver served the people of Alexandria, Louisiana, on the city  council for more than 15 years before stepping down 11 months ago at  age 99. At an age where most people are slowing down and taking it a  bit easy, Harry stepped up to serve, wanting to give back to the  community that he called home.   After Harry's initial appointment in 2005, the people of Alexandria  reelected Harry to the council four times.   At the time of his retirement, Harry was both the oldest active  elected official in the United States and the oldest elected official  in Louisiana history.   In his farewell message to the city, Harry said: ``Whether you or  your parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents agreed with me or not  over the years, I hope everyone agrees that I acted only as I felt was  best for our mutual home.   Madam Speaker, that is all that we can ask of a public servant.   We are honored and proud to salute Harry Silver of Alexandria,  Louisiana, on his 100th birthday.                            ____________________
