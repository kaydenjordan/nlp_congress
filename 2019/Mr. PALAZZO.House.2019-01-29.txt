 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Clebern H. ``Bobby'' Shows, Jr. who passed away on January 20 of  this year at the age of 80. I send my condolences and prayers to  Bobby's wife of 42 years, Sandra, as well as his family and friends.   Born and raised in Mississippi, he was a graduate of USM. During his  life he worked as a cattle farmer, businessman, and public servant.   I had the distinct honor to serve alongside Bobby in the Mississippi  House and knew him as a friend. Bobby was first elected to the  Mississippi House of Representatives in 1992 and served the community  of Ellisville for 24 years. He was well-known by his colleagues in the  State legislature as a principled conservative and served as chairman  of the County Affairs Committee. Throughout his time in office,  Chairman Shows earned his reputation as a strong advocate for  Mississippi's rural residents.   Although we are sad to hear of his passing, we take comfort in his  example of a life well-lived and the legacy he leaves behind. On behalf  of the Fourth Congressional District of Mississippi, we honor the  memory of Bobby Shows, a loving husband, father, man of God, and a  dedicated civil servant.                            ____________________
