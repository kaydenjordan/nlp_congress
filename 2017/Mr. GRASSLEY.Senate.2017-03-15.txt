 Mr. President, this week is Sunshine Week, an annual  nationwide celebration of the good that comes from peeling back the  curtains on government. Sunshine Week coincides with the National  Freedom of Information Day and President James Madison's birthday, both  of which occur on March 16.   James Madison understood the value of an informed citizenry as a  necessary check against those in power. We shouldn't forget his call  for the people to ``arm themselves with the power which knowledge  gives.''   More recently in our Nation's history, Justice Brandeis declared,  ``sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.''   These sentiments hold true to this day. A government that operates in  darkness--and a public that's kept in the dark--sows the seeds of  waste, fraud, and abuse.   In the face of secrecy and obstruction, the public has a vital  weapon: the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA.   Over 50 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed FOIA into law,  establishing the public's judicially enforceable right to government  information.   Before FOIA, the people had to justify their need for information to  the government, but after FOIA, the government has to justify its  refusal to release information to the public. FOIA's enactment marked a  crucial step toward a government more accountable to the people.   No doubt, FOIA manifests Congress's recognition of the need to  carefully balance the public's right to know and the government's  interest in protecting certain information from disclosure, but  practice and history demonstrates this balance has all too often been  tilted away from transparency.   Many in government have continued to find ways to undermine citizens'  right to know under FOIA. Transparency should be the norm, not the  exception; yet, when it comes to FOIA requests, we have continued to  see a government culture of delay, deny, and defend. When this happens,  FOIA's effectiveness is undermined and the public becomes even more  skeptical of its government.   We have seen this in one way or another under every administration,  both Republican and Democratic, since FOIA's enactment, but the trend  toward secrecy and obstruction in recent years should alarm all of us.   According to a March 14 Associated Press report, ``The Obama  administration in its final year in office spent a record $36.2 million  on legal costs defending its refusal to turn over federal records under  [FOIA.]''  [[Page S1837]]    In 2016, the Obama administration set records for ``outright denial  of access to files, refusing to quickly consider requests described as  especially newsworthy, and forcing people to pay for records who had  asked the government to waive search and copy fees.''   To top it off, ``The government acknowledged when challenged that it  had been wrong to initially refuse to turn over all or parts of records  in more than one-third of such cases, the highest rate in at least six  years.''   We simply cannot continue down this path.   Fortunately, a truly bipartisan and bicameral effort last year  resulted in the enactment of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016. I was  proud to be a cosponsor of this important piece of legislation and to  have worked closely with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, as  well as the open government community, in ensuring its passage. It  achieves some of the most meaningful and necessary reforms to FOIA in  history.   We are already witnessing some of the positive impacts of these  reforms.   For example, the National Security Archive, a nonprofit open  government advocate, fought for years to achieve the public release of  certain historical documents about the Bay of Pigs invasion. But time  and again, they were met with legal hurdles put up by the Central  Intelligence Agency, CIA.   This past October, however, the CIA released these historically  significant documents. In doing so, the CIA's Chief Historian stated  that the Agency is ``releasing this draft volume today because recent  2016 changes in the [FOIA] requires us to release some drafts that are  responsive to FOIA requests if they are more than 25 years old.''   This is excellent news. It is just one example of the good that can  result from bipartisan work toward a common goal for the American  people. I look forward to hearing many other such stories of important  information finally being made publicly available under FOIA, thanks to  these recent reforms.   But we can't just rest on our laurels. No matter which party is in  control of Congress or the White House, continuing oversight of FOIA-- and the faithful implementation of its amendments--is essential to  ensure the law's effectiveness as a tool for the public good.   As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am proud during this  Sunshine Week to join Senators Feinstein, Cornyn, and Leahy in sending  letters to the Trump administration to learn more about specific steps  taken to carry out the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 and efforts  underway to improve the proactive disclosure of information.   Compliance with both the letter and spirit of FOIA should always be a  top priority of any administration, so I look forward to hearing back  about progress made.   Before President Trump took office, I stood on this floor and urged  him to reverse the secrecy and obstruction that defined the Obama  administration's FOIA track record. Today I reiterate that call.   A new administration provides a new opportunity to get it right.   This Sunshine Week, let's recommit to working together toward  improving open government, fulfilling FOIA's promise, and ensuring a  more informed citizenry.                            ____________________     Mr. President, affirming the public's right to know how  their government is run, Sunshine Week is an annual reminder of the  importance of transparency and accountability in a government of the  people, by the people, and for the people. In the spirit of government  transparency, I am pleased to join a bipartisan group of colleagues to  introduce the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act of 2017. This important  piece of legislation furthers the public's access to court proceedings  by permitting Federal judges at all Federal court levels to open their  courtrooms to television cameras and radio broadcasts.   For decades, and with great results, States such as my home State of  Iowa have allowed cameras in their courtrooms. In fact, all 50 States  and the District of Columbia now allow some news coverage of  proceedings, and it is time we join them. This openness in our courts  improves the public's understanding of the legal system and what  happens inside our courts.   However, our Federal judicial system unnecessarily remains a mystery  to many across the country. The bill I am introducing today, along with  Senator Klobuchar and a number of cosponsors from both sides of the  aisle, will greatly improve public access to Federal courts by letting  Federal judges open their courtrooms to television cameras and other  forms of electronic media. Letting the Sun shine in on our Federal  courtrooms will allow Americans to better understand the judicial  process.   The Sunshine in the Courtroom Act will ensure that the introduction  of cameras and other broadcasting devices into courtrooms goes as  smoothly as it has at the State level. This legislation leaves the  presence of the cameras in Federal trial and appellate courts to the  sole discretion of the judges--it is not mandatory. The bill also  provides a mechanism for Congress to study the effects of this  legislation on our judiciary before making this change permanent  through a 3-year sunset provision. The bill protects the privacy and  safety of nonparty witnesses by giving them the right to have their  faces and voices obscured. Additionally, the bill prohibits the  televising of jurors and includes a provision to protect the due  process rights of each party.   It is time to open the courthouse doors and let the light shine in on  the Federal judiciary. Granting the public greater access to an already  public proceeding will inspire greater faith in and appreciation for  our judges who pledge equal and impartial justice for all.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 643         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
