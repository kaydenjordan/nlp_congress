 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Blue  Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act that just unanimously passed the House.  I was proud to support it.   This bill recognizes the sacrificial service of the 7,000-plus  servicemen and -women who received a Purple Heart after being wounded  in battle and continue to serve on Active Duty. My bill, included in  this passage, takes the rightful step to waive the funding fee on all  VA home loans for Active-Duty Purple Heart recipients. With this bill,  we will save servicemembers thousands of dollars and help their  families achieve the dream of homeownership.   U.S. Marine Corps Major Byron Owen, who was wounded twice in Iraq and  once in Afghanistan, explained it best when he shared his experiences  with my office. He said: ``I was medevaced out of Iraq in 2006 and had  to undergo months of therapy to return to service. Why should I have to  pay 20 grand to get a VA loan when someone with a noncombat-related  disability gets to waive it? Some of my friends are amputees still  serving in uniform. They're paying the funding fee. Does that seem  right?''   Major Owen, I hear you--and, no, it is not right. That is why I am  proud to have introduced this bill and voted with my colleagues to  support Active-Duty Purple Heart recipients with the passage of H.R.  299.                            ____________________
