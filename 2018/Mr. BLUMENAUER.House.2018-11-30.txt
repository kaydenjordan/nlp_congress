 Mr. Speaker, no wonder Republicans are afraid to even  debate their latest tax bill. As their 8-year grip on tax policy comes  to an end, it is a story of failure, missed opportunities, and making a  broken tax system worse.  [[Page H9746]]    The Tax Code under the Republicans was made more complex and more  unfair every year they were in charge. They showered more tax breaks on  the wealthy and corporations, and enhanced income inequality.   They had an iron grip on the average taxpayer, denying even basic  customer service through the IRS. They exploded the deficits--a  trillion dollars a year for as far as the eye can see--and refused to  enforce the Tax Code on people who cheat, leaving hundreds of billions  of uncollected tax dollars unavailable to reduce the deficit or fund  government service.   For 8 years, they even refused to listen to the vast array of  infrastructure stakeholders on how to rebuild and renew America, a  sorry legacy I am confident we will improve upon as Democrats. We  couldn't do any worse.                            ____________________
