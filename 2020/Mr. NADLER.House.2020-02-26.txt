 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 35) to amend section 249 of title 18, United States Code, to  specify lynching as a hate crime act, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 35         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Emmett Till Antilynching       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the ultimate       expression of racism in the United States following       Reconstruction.        (2) Lynching was a widely acknowledged practice in the       United States until the middle of the 20th century.        (3) Lynching was a crime that occurred throughout the       United States, with documented incidents in all but 4 States.        (4) At least 4,742 people, predominantly African Americans,       were reported lynched in the United States between 1882 and       1968.        (5) Ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators of lynching       escaped from punishment by State or local officials.        (6) Lynching prompted African Americans to form the       National Association for the Advancement of Colored People       (referred to in this section as the ``NAACP'') and prompted       members of B'nai B'rith to found the Anti-Defamation League.        (7) Mr. Walter White, as a member of the NAACP and later as       the executive secretary of the NAACP from 1931 to 1955,       meticulously investigated lynchings in the United States and       worked tirelessly to end segregation and racialized terror.        (8) Nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in       Congress during the first half of the 20th century.        (9) Between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents petitioned Congress       to end lynching.        (10) Between 1920 and 1940, the House of Representatives       passed 3 strong anti-lynching measures.        (11) Protection against lynching was the minimum and most       basic of Federal responsibilities, and the Senate considered       but failed to enact anti-lynching legislation despite       repeated requests by civil rights groups, Presidents, and the       House of Representatives to do so.        (12) The publication of ``Without Sanctuary: Lynching       Photography in America'' helped bring greater awareness and       proper recognition of the victims of lynching.        (13) Only by coming to terms with history can the United       States effectively champion human rights abroad.        (14) An apology offered in the spirit of true repentance       moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become       central to a new understanding, on which improved racial       relations can be forged.        (15) Having concluded that a reckoning with our own history       is the only way the country can effectively champion human       rights abroad, 90 Members of the United States Senate agreed       to Senate Resolution 39, 109th Congress, on June 13, 2005, to       apologize to the victims of lynching and the descendants of       those victims for the failure of the Senate to enact anti-      lynching legislation.        (16) The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which       opened to the public in Montgomery, Alabama, on April 26,       2018, is the Nation's first memorial dedicated to the legacy       of enslaved Black people, people terrorized by lynching,       African Americans humiliated by racial segregation and Jim       Crow, and people of color burdened with contemporary       presumptions of guilt and police violence.        (17) Notwithstanding the Senate's apology and the       heightened awareness and education about the Nation's legacy       with lynching, it is wholly necessary and appropriate for the       Congress to enact legislation, after 100 years of       unsuccessful legislative efforts, finally to make lynching a       Federal crime.        (18) Further, it is the sense of Congress that criminal       action by a group increases the likelihood that the criminal       object of that group will be successfully attained and       decreases the probability that the individuals involved will       depart from their path of criminality. Therefore, it is       appropriate to specify criminal penalties for the crime of       lynching, or any attempt or conspiracy to commit lynching.        (19) The United States Senate agreed to unanimously Senate       Resolution 118, 115th Congress, on April 5, 2017,       ``[c]ondemning hate crime and any other form of racism,       religious or ethnic bias, discrimination, incitement to       violence, or animus targeting a minority in the United       States'' and taking notice specifically of Federal Bureau of       Investigation statistics demonstrating that ``among single-      bias hate crime incidents in the United States, 59.2 percent       of victims were targeted due to racial, ethnic, or ancestral       bias, and among those victims, 52.2 percent were victims of       crimes motivated by the offenders' anti-Black or anti-African       American bias''.        (20) On September 14, 2017, President Donald J. Trump       signed into law Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 115-      58; 131 Stat. 1149), wherein Congress ``condemn[ed] the       racist violence and domestic terrorist attack that took place       between August 11 and August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville,       Virginia'' and ``urg[ed] the President and his administration       to speak out against hate groups that espouse racism,       extremism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and White supremacy;       and use all resources available to the President and the       President's Cabinet to address the growing prevalence of       those hate groups in the United States''.        (21) Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 115-58; 131       Stat. 1149) specifically took notice of ``hundreds of torch-      bearing White nationalists, White supremacists, Klansmen, and       neo-Nazis [who] chanted racist, anti-Semitic, and anti-      immigrant slogans and violently engaged with counter-      demonstrators on and around the grounds of the University of       Virginia in Charlottesville'' and that these groups       ``reportedly are organizing similar events in other cities in       the United States and communities everywhere are concerned       about the growing and open display of hate and violence being       perpetrated by those groups''.        (22) Lynching was a pernicious and pervasive tool that was       used to interfere with multiple aspects of life--including       the exercise of Federally protected rights, as enumerated in       section 245 of title 18, United States Code, housing rights,       as enumerated in section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968       (42 U.S.C. 3631), and the free exercise of religion, as       enumerated in section 247 of title 18, United States Code.       Interference with these  [[Page H1198]]       rights was often effectuated by multiple offenders and       groups, rather than isolated individuals. Therefore,       prohibiting conspiracies to violate each of these rights       recognizes the history of lynching in the United States and       serves to prohibit its use in the future.       SEC. 3. LYNCHING.         (a) Offense.--Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code,       is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``Sec. 250. Lynching         ``Whoever conspires with another person to violate section       245, 247, or 249 of this title or section 901 of the Civil       Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3631) shall be punished in the       same manner as a completed violation of such section, except       that if the maximum term of imprisonment for such completed       violation is less than 10 years, the person may be imprisoned       for not more than 10 years.''.        (b) Table of Sections Amendment.--The table of sections for       chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 249 the       following:        ``250. Lynching.''.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 35, the Emmett Till Antilynching Act is long  overdue legislation that would criminalize lynching for the first time  under Federal law.   The term ``lynching'' generally refers to premeditated acts of  violence often resulting in death carried out by a mob in order to  punish an alleged transgressor or to strike fear among a targeted  group.   H.R. 35 is named in honor of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African  American youth from Chicago, who was lynched in particularly gruesome  fashion while visiting an uncle in Mississippi in 1955. His murder and  the antilynching movement that followed set the stage for the creation  of the civil rights movement that we recognize today.   Generally, they could not rely on law enforcement to protect them,  because they understood that the lynchings occurring throughout the  South were a very deliberate campaign to subjugate our Black  population. And this very deliberate campaign was started in the 1870s  by the Ku Klux Klan and carried on right up to the present day through  terrorism and forced Jim Crow.   Because they realized this, African Americans mobilized their own  efforts to combat the terror of lynching and the threat of racial  violence through grassroots activism and the founding of integrated  social justice organizations.   During the period between the Civil War and World War II, thousands  of African Americans were lynched in the United States, mostly in the  South, but not entirely, as a means of racial subordination and  enforcing white supremacy. These violent incidents were largely  tolerated by State and Federal officials, in fact, often promoted by  State and Federal officials. They profoundly impacted race relations  and shaped the geographic, political, social, and economic conditions  of African American communities in ways that are still evident today.   Although the civil rights conspiracy statute does not specify the  offense of lynching as a Federal crime, this section has been used by  the Department of Justice to prosecute civil rights-era crimes and hate  crimes that were described as lynching in public discourse.   It remains important, however, to enact Federal antilynching  legislation to acknowledge this shameful chapter in American history  and to send a clear message that such violations, such violent actions  motivated by hatred and bigotry will never again be tolerated in this  country.   The first Federal antilynching legislation was introduced in 1900,  almost 120 years ago, by Congressman George Henry White, the only  African American member of Congress at that time. Unfortunately,  neither his bill nor any other antilynching bills managed to pass the  Congress. Antilynching bills were routinely defeated on this floor.   Today, we act to correct this historical injustice that should rest  heavily on the conscience of Members of Congress. I thank the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Rush) for his leadership on this important issue and  for his attention to history. I also thank the gentleman from Nebraska  (Mr. Bacon) for his support of this legislation and the many cosponsors  of this bill who helped pave the way for its passage today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), the sponsor of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  [[Page H1200]]  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In his farewell address to Congress, Representative George Henry  White lamented the failure of his antilynching bill of 1900 to pass by  observing that: ``During the last session of this Congress, I took  occasion to address myself in detail to this particular measure, But  with all of my efforts, the bill still sweetly sleeps in the room of  the committee to which it was referred. The necessity of legislation  along this line is daily being demonstrated. The arena of the lyncher  no longer is confined to Southern climes, but is stretching its hydra  head over all parts of the Union.''   Lynching no longer terrorizes African American communities as it once  did, but we owe it to the memory of its thousands of victims to outlaw  this racist and gruesome practice once and for all.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman is talking too fast. I can't  understand him.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman  very much. I certainly agree with the distinguished ranking member, and  I appreciate his support for this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
