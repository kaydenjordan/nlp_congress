 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of Angie Wood. Angie was a leader in Illinois who touched  the lives of countless people. She was someone who empowered the people  around her and was an inspiration to everyone she met.   She was quick to invite new friends to dinner and was always there to  help someone in need. Angie embodied selfless devotion to her family,  her community, and her country.   Everyone knew Angie as a patriot because of her love for our  Constitution and her devotion to serving our country. She organized  women's constitutional luncheons to teach people about our history, our  rights, and our freedoms. She firmly believed that knowledge is power,  and she was devoted to our Founding Fathers' vision of self-government.   Angie's patriotism was not merely something she talked about. It was  something she lived out every day because of her love for God and  country.   At her core, Angie was a Christian whose faith in Christ was evident  to everyone around her, and she sought to carry the love of Jesus into  the world. She organized Bible studies and was always first to offer  prayer. She was sure to remind her friends about the peace and comfort  that comes from the Lord. Angie would remind people that the only hope  for our Nation and the world is Jesus Christ.   Angie's legacy will continue to inspire everyone who knew her. She  exemplified servant leadership, and her patriotism, optimism, and faith  will be lived out by the people whose lives she touched. No matter how  the future looked, Angie would always say that the best is yet to come.   Now, I want to read one of her favorite passages from Philippians:  Whatever happens, keep living your lives based on the reality of the  Gospel of Christ. Then, when I come to see you or hear good reports of  you, I will know that you stand united in one spirit and one passion,  celebrating together as conquerors in the faith of the gospel. Then you  will never be shaken or intimidated by the opposition that rises up  against us. Your courage will prove to be a true sign from God of their  coming destruction.   I pray that her memory will serve as an example to us all.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask for a moment of silence.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank Ms. Foxx for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Thompson and Chairwoman Foxx for  sponsoring this important legislation.   I rise in support of H.R. 1147, the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act.  This crucial legislation recognizes the nutritional benefits of whole  milk for our children.   As a result of the radical Obama Administration policies led by  Michelle Obama, only fat-free and low-fat milks can be served in school  meals.   H.R. 1147 would end this practice and allow schools to serve whole  milk. Whole milk is a rich source of essential nutrients, including  calcium and vitamin D, which are vital for developing strong bones and  a healthy immune system.   Studies have also shown that whole milk can contribute to healthier  weight in children. I raised my seven children on whole-fat milk, and  they are all within normal weights. I also have recognized that  children who have high-fat diets stay full longer.   I am proud to support this bill on behalf of parents, and I want to  thank America's dairy farmers for producing milk for our families.
