 Madam Speaker, as a former prosecutor, I  rise to state the obvious: President Trump committed obstruction of  justice.   We have direct evidence that the President asked the FBI Director for  loyalty. He demanded it. He asked the FBI Director to drop an  investigation into Michael Flynn.   The President fired the FBI Director. Then, on national TV, he said  he did it because of the Russian probe. Then he told the Russians in  the Oval Office that he did it to relieve great pressure because of the  FBI investigation. That is classic obstruction of justice.   The Washington Post today has a quote from one of the prosecutors of  Watergate. He says: ``I helped prosecute Watergate. Comey's statement  is sufficient evidence for an obstruction of justice case.''   I call on Special Counsel Mueller to investigate the President of the  United States for violating the obstruction of justice statute, which  is a felony.
