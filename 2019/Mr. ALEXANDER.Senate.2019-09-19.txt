 Mr. President, I am reserving the right to object.   The Senator from Alabama is a valued member of the Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee. Ensuring that historically Black  colleges and universities have continued funding is something we all  want to do. However, instead of the short-term patch, I favor a long- term solution.   I am ready to do this, along with a few other bipartisan higher  education proposals that also have bipartisan support. Such a package  could include permanent mandatory funding of $255 million for  historically Black colleges and universities and reduction of the  number of questions on the FAFSA that 20 million families fill out  every year for their Federal aid, as Senators Bennet and Jones have  proposed. I would like to see the Senate pass again the legislation  Senator Murray and I persuaded the Senate to pass that reduces the  current FAFSA to 22 questions. Senators Schatz, Lee, and Durbin have  proposed Pell grants for prisoners. There is a proposal by Senators  Portman and Kaine and many other bipartisan Senators on short-term Pell  grants for job training. We could expand Pell grant eligibility. We  could increase the maximum Pell grant award.   These are all things we should be able to agree on, including funding  for historically Black colleges and universities. I have been talking  with Senator Murray now for several years about reauthorizing the  Higher Education Act. I intend to discuss this all with her and with  our committee members next week.   We have the time to do it because, while the legislation expires at  the end of this month, the money doesn't for several more months. So,  in the meantime, I hope we can work together, as we often do in our  committee, to pass a smaller package of higher education proposals,  including a long-term proposal for historically Black colleges and  universities, while we continue to work on the reauthorization of the  Higher Education Act.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  150th anniversary of the University of Tennessee ``Pride of the  Southland'' marching band and congratulate this esteemed band on 150  years of success.   The ``Pride of the Southland'' marching band was founded in 1869 by  Gustavus Robert Knabe, from Germany. During the 150 years of the  marching band, there have been 10 directors, including the current  director, Dr. Donald Ryder, who was proceeded by both Dr. Gary Sousa  and Dr. W.J. Julian. It was Dr. Julian who created the now famous  ``Circle Drill.''   Since the band was formed after the close of the Civil War, it had a  military style with both uniforms and music. The marching band  maintained a military look until 1951, when the then-band director,  Walter M. Ryba, changed the look of the uniform and created a new look  on the field. When Dr. W.J. Julian became the director in 1961, the  marching band was moved from the military department and placed in the  music education curriculum. With this change, they received new  uniforms consisting of navy blue trousers and jackets with an orange  and white military-style vest overlay with braided shoulder straps and  a white plume with an orange and white shako. This is the uniform  currently still in use today.   Over the last 150 years, the marching band has grown dramatically  from 13 members to over 350 members. With such a deep and rich history,  it is no surprise that several families have had multiple generations  who have participated in the ``Pride.''   The ``Pride of the Southland'' marching band has been recognized  internationally for their unique marching style and music, including  the innovative ``Circle Drill,'' which has become a strong tradition  each fall, and ``Rocky Top,'' which started as the band's halftime show  in October 1972, during the Vols annual football game versus Alabama.   In 1982, the marching band opened the World's Fair in Knoxville and  has performed in 15 Presidential inauguration--a record unmatched by  any civilian organization--with the first being President Dwight  Eisenhower in 1953 and, most recently, President Donald Trump. The band  has appeared in over 50 bowl games, including the Rose Bowl, Cotton  Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Citrus Bowl, Peach Bowl, Sun Bowl, Hall  of Fame Bowl and the 1998 National Championship Fiesta Bowl. They have  also performed on the field with stars such as Charlie Daniels Band,  Kenny Rogers, Kenny Chesney, Lee Greenwood, Roy Acuff, the Osborne  Brothers, and many others.   At home in Neyland Stadium, the ``Pride of the Southland'' band has  impressed Vol fans with its pre-game show, which is considered one of  the finest ever performed. The band created the ``V-O-L-S'' chant, the  opening of the ``Power T,'' ``USA,'' and more.   I would like to recognize the ``Pride of the Southland'' marching  band for its 150 years of rich history and commend the University of  Tennessee and all band members, past and present, for the part they  have played to make the program such a storied success. When I was 14,  I sold programs at Neyland Stadium. There is nothing more exciting than  watching a football game in Neyland Stadium, and if your seats are by  the band, that is even better.   There are no other traditions in the University of Tennessee's  history that can surpass the astounding accomplishments and success  that the ``Pride of the Southland'' marching band has in its 150 years  of service to a great university.                            ____________________
