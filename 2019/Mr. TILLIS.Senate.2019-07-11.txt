 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Mr.  John Falkenbury, the president and chief operating officer for the  United Service Organizations, USO, of North Carolina, on his decades of  service to the great State of North Carolina.   For over a decade, since his initial appointment as president and COO  for the USO of North Carolina in 2009, John has been integral in  coordinating, planning, and leading the operations of the USO State  headquarters, five USO fixed centers, and mobile centers in locations  spanning the entire State. John's leadership skills were prominently  displayed in his ability to mobilize thousands of volunteers over the  years to support countless Active-Duty servicemembers, veterans, and  their families. John's extensive resume is a testament to his lifelong  commitment to public service, which includes his past role as president  and CEO of Five Oaks Nursing Center in Concord, NC, serving as the  managing partner of the Falkenbury Family LLC, and as the president of  the Stephen D. Falkenbury Jr. Foundation in Charlotte, NC. Prior to his  work for the USO, John served in the U.S. Army for 20 years, which  included numerous assignments across the United States and in Germany.   The USO centers across the State of North Carolina provide critical  resources and support to our men and women in uniform and their  families. These services include transition assistance, financial  literacy, child educational programs, deployment, and homecoming  operations, military and civilian outreach programs, Fallen and Wounded  Warrior escort services, and a focus on providing the entire community  with support and assistance. Through his leadership, dedication, and  passion for service, John Falkenbury has been a champion in ensuring  these programs are readily available for anyone who needs them.   The North Carolina USO has a strong track record of dedicated support  of servicemembers at military installations, including Fort Bragg, Camp  Lejeune, and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. In 2016, when the  devastating Hurricane Matthew flooded large portions of Eastern North  Carolina, John assisted in the delivery of 1,000 care packages via  Blackhawk helicopter to soldiers and civilians in afflicted areas. A  USO mobile center deployed near Lumberton, NC, for 5 days to provide  basic necessity items, a BBQ dinner, satellite access, and internet  service to over 400 servicemembers.   As a Senator, a member of the USO Congressional Caucus, and a North  Carolinian, I am pleased to congratulate John Falkenbury on his  retirement and for his impressive career of public service and  steadfast commitment to our country.                            ____________________
