Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Border  Security and Deferred Action Recipient Relief Act, which I am  introducing.   This bill offers solutions to the serious problems facing us with  regard to border security, while at the same time addressing the needs  for a legislative solution for those issues faced by the children who  were brought here through no fault of their own.   With respect to the border, this bill provides $1.6 billion in  funding for border security measures that the President requested and  the House has already approved in a bipartisan vote. As an Arizonan, I  am more than familiar with the steps we need to take to increase border  security. We have a better situation on the border than we have had in  a while, but there are still measures that need to be taken.   In addition to the appropriate barriers that will aid in preventing  illegal crossings, we need access roads that actually get to the  border. If there is one issue I hear from property owners, ranchers,  Border Patrol agents, and others near the border, it is that they need  better access. We have had an issue with regard to roads that are used  by the Border Control that are paid for by the county. It is a  situation that needs to be resolved, and it will benefit all of us who  travel near the border. This bill addresses that. The road issue was  also raised by the GAO. I requested a study on behalf of my  constituents,  [[Page S6363]]  along with my colleagues, to see what we could do with the roads and  access situation. GAO came back with recommendations, and this would  implement some of the recommendations.   The bill also aids law enforcement by ensuring the swift deportation  of individuals determined to be members of violent gangs and drug  cartels.   I would also like to thank Congresswoman Barbara Comstock for her  leadership on this issue by sponsoring the Criminal Alien Gang Member  Removal Act, which passed the House.   With respect to the children brought here through no fault of their  own, this bill takes a measure that has already earned bipartisan  support in the House of Representatives, the Recognizing America's  Children Act, which provides a solution for the DACA kids. These young  immigrants were brought here as children and simply know no other  country. For all intents and purposes, these young people consider  themselves Americans. If we can protect these DACA recipients and  provide solutions to better secure our borders at the same time, that  is a win-win.   The President and Congress both want to improve border security. We  both want to respond to the threat of dangerous gangs and drug cartels.  We both want to arrive at a legislative solution for the rescission of  the DACA Program that benefits those who want to contribute to their  communities and to the American dream. This bill is the best way to  thread the needle and deliver what the President has asked for, what  the Congress wants, and what my constituents in Arizona deserve. These  issues are far too important for us to delay.   To be clear, I will work with anyone to support any number of  proposals that accomplish these goals, but I believe that the  straightforward approach of the Border Security and Deferred Action  Recipient Relief Act, which I am introducing today, is the best chance  we have to put this bill on the President's desk.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HEITKAMP (for herself, Mr. Tester, Mr. Franken, Mr.          Heinrich, Mr. Merkley, and Ms. Warren):   S. 1942. A bill to direct the Attorney General to review, revise, and  develop law enforcement and justice protocols appropriate to address  missing and murdered Indians, and for other purposes; to the Committee  on Indian Affairs.
