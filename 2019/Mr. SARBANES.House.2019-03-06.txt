 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, last year, in the 2018 election, a powerful message was  sent to this Congress that the public wants us to clean up our  politics, fight corruption, unrig the system, and make sure that voting  rights are protected.   I think part of the reason the message was so strong is that, for the  last 8 years under a Republican Congress, there has been no progress  made on any of those priorities, so there is this pent-up demand out  there among the public. They want their voice back. H.R. 1 is our  opportunity to give them their voice back.   The message they are sending is very simple. The first message is:  Make it possible for us to get to the ballot box without running an  obstacle course.   It is inconceivable, it is incomprehensible, that more than 50 years  after   John Lewis, our colleague, was bloodied on the Edmund Pettus  Bridge protesting for voting rights, we still can't get it right in  America when it comes to voting.   That is ridiculous. We need to make it more possible to register and  vote in this country so that people can get to the ballot box and their  voices can be heard. That is one thing they are saying to us.   The other thing they are saying to us is, when you get to Washington,  if you are a lawmaker, if you serve in an office of public trust,  behave yourself, abide by ethics, be accountable to the people,  remember who sent you there, and be transparent. We have provisions in  H.R. 1 that strengthen ethics and accountability, as we should.   The third thing they said to us, loud and clear, was, when you get to  Washington, don't get tangled up in the money, don't let the special  interests and the insiders call the shots on priorities in Congress,  remember who sent you, and fight for us. So we have measures in here to  clean up the campaign finance system, create more disclosure,  transparency, so we know where that secret money is coming from,  building a new system of funding campaigns in America that is not owned  by the special interests and the big money.    Let's build a new system of funding campaigns in  America that is not owned by the special interests and the big money  and the insiders. Let's build a system that is owned by the American  people, where they call the shots, where small donors can have their  contributions matched so that their voice is amplified, so they are the  ones who run the show, so candidates go to them and listen to what they  have to say instead of hanging out with the lobbyists and the big-money  crowd.   That is what this bill offers.   My colleagues on the other side keep talking about how this is going  to be taxpayer money for this system. Find me the provision. There is  no provision in this bill that says that any taxpayer money is going to  go to this system, because it is not.   We have come up with an elegant solution where we go to the  lawbreakers, the people who are leaning on our system and breaking the  law, and we ask them, with a small surcharge, to contribute to this  fund. That is where the match will come from.   We are going to the people who aren't playing fair with our system,  and we are asking them to underwrite a clean election system. That is  how it should work.   Let's restore the voice of the people. Let's pass H.R. 1.                                time  1530     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for  all her hard work on this bill.   I am concerned that there is a collective delirium that seems to have  infected part of this Chamber. I keep hearing our colleagues on the  other side say that the public financing system, the 6-to-1 matching  system that we want to set up, is taxpayer funded.   Hear this: It is not taxpayer funded. It is not taxpayer funded. It  is not taxpayer funded.   It is lawbreaker funded.   We are setting up a fund, called the freedom from influence fund,  because we don't want the big money and the special interests to  exercise influence in our campaigns anymore.   The freedom from influence fund will be filled with dollars that come  from putting a surcharge, an assessment, on people who break the law:  corporations who have engaged in criminal activity or are subject to  civil penalties. Corporate malfeasance, that is where the dollars will  come from. The people who are breaking the law, they are going to fund  the freedom from influence account that will be there to match small  donations.   Now, let me tell you why it is so important that small donors be the  ones that have the power.   If you are a candidate and you have to raise money for your campaign,  right now, in order to raise the money you need, you have to go to the  deep pocket and the PACs and the lobbyists.   And here is what happens: You start to think like the company you  keep. So if you are hanging around with those folks because that is  where you are raising your money, you are going to start putting their  priorities first, not the public's priorities.   But if we have a 6-to-1 matching system funded by lawbreakers, not  taxpayers----    Mr. Chair, if we have a matching system that gives  power to small donors, now the candidate is going to say: If I want to  raise money from my campaign and power my campaign, I am going to go  spend time with real people in my district. I am going to go to a house  party where somebody can give $25 or $50, and then that 6-to-1 match  will come in and I can power my campaign.   So instead of hanging out with the lobbyists on K Street or with the  big money donors or with the PACs and super-PACs, I am going to spend  time with people in my district. They are going to tell me what their  priorities are, and then I am going to go to Washington and I am going  to fight for them.   That is why we are creating this system: to take power away from the  PACs and the big money and the insiders who are calling the shots now  and give it back to the people. That is why this bill is called the For  the People Act.   So let's restore their voice, give them back the power that they  deserve, and give them their rightful ownership of their own democracy.  [[Page H2405]]    Mr. Chair, let's support H.R. 1.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  want to thank him for his work on House Administration. I know, as  well, that Congressman Anthony Brown helped with this particular  amendment.   This is really critical. This is all about, and H.R. 1, in large  part, is about the journey to the ballot box, and how do we make that  journey easier for people; how do we make sure that they can get there  without too much of an undue burden; and that is what this would do for  rural voters.   This would require that States ensure that the polling places are  located in rural areas. So this idea that somebody in Washington is  going to be deciding where the location is, that is preposterous. We  are just saying make sure that the State figures it out; and so each  State can decide what makes the most sense in terms of placing these  voting places for rural voters.   So it is a very, very commonsense amendment. I want to thank the  gentleman for introducing it and, definitely, I support it.    Mr. Chairman, as you know from the discussion today, we  obviously feel very strongly that there needs to be as much disclosure  as possible and transparency and accountability when it comes to how  money flows into the political arena. I think the public has a  particular apprehension about how insidious spending can be when it has  to do with government contractors. The public deserves to know who is  spending in their politics and, particularly, if contractors--who are  the ones who are going to get these government contracts--are spending  in a way that could potentially influence the contracting decisions. In  a sense, what is happening is people are leaning on the government  potentially using money and influence in a way that cuts against what  the public interests might be.   That is why prohibiting the executive branch from even considering-- that is what this rider does. It actually prohibits the executive  branch from even sitting down and considering whether there should be  certain rules that should govern what happens in the contractor space  in terms of political spending. That doesn't make any sense. That  doesn't make common sense that the executive branch ought to be able to  figure out some rules so that that transparency is in place.   That is why we want to repeal it. That is why we have that in H.R. 1.  I oppose this amendment that would strike the repeal.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon) for yielding, and I thank her for her amendment.   I would just say very quickly, I think this is a good amendment that  actually improves the bill. And to the point of the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), it is because technology is changing quickly  all the time and one has to kind of keep ahead of the curve on that to  make sure the decisions are made in a sensible way, that having a  committee that can assemble the kind of expertise that you need to  bring to bear on a decision like this makes perfect sense. It can allow  the EAC to function better.   Evaluating these security grants, I think, makes a lot of sense, and  they can keep up-to-date on what the changing technology is so that the  EAC can benefit from that input.   So I think it is an outstanding amendment. I want to thank the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  [[Page H2487]]  Scanlon) for introducing it. I support it.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   The gentleman is right. There are examples of these systems across  the country. Actually, Maryland has, now, two jurisdictions that have  embraced public financing.   You are worried about the moderates being wiped out. In fact, what is  happening is the moderates are fleeing the political town square  because they feel like their vote doesn't matter and their engagement  doesn't matter because they support people who then go to places where  laws are made, and those folks are getting taken hostage by the big  money and the special interests.   So the smart moderate voter out there says: What is the point? I am  going to opt out of the political system.   And when they vacate the political town square, then the extremes run  in and they fill the vacuum.   So, actually, if you want to bring moderates back in, if you want to  bring citizens across the political spectrum back into our system,  create something that makes them feel empowered. That is what this  small donor matching system is all about. Then you will get these  people who have run up into the hills and have said: My democracy  doesn't respect me anymore.   By the way, these are the ballasts in the ship of state, those kind  of folks, engaged citizens who feel like the democracy should work for  them. But the evidence they get every day is that the big money is  running the show: Why don't I just save myself, you know, my dignity,  by stepping back, because why am I going to pretend that my voice  actually matters, that my involvement matters?   We create a system that makes them feel like they have power again,  and they will come out of the hills. They will come back down into the  political town square. They will help create that moderation that you  are talking about, because they are solid citizens who care about their  democracy.   So this is a very important amendment because it will give us a  retrospective on how the system is working. We can collect that data,  and then that will inform any improvements we want to make going  forward.   Mr. Chair, I congratulate the gentlewoman on her amendment, and I  support it.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  thank her for this amendment which is, as she says, a very commonsense  amendment. I don't really understand what the objection would be.   If you don't apply the same ethical standards to unpaid staff or  people who are working in the executive branch as you do to paid, what  you are left with is a gigantic loophole that could be taken advantage  of, and I don't think that the average person out there could  understand why you would make that kind of distinction. So this is a  very logical thing to do. Just because you are not paid doesn't mean  you might not have a conflict of interest.   So this is an amendment that simply directs the Office of Government  Ethics to come up with some rules to make sure that senior  administration officials, special governmental employees who draw no  salary, are still going to abide by the ethics laws.   Again, if the job here of all of us is to meet the expectations of  the public in terms of how things should function up here in  Washington, abiding ethical standards and observing conflicts of  interest rules, then this meets that expectation directly. I think it  is a good amendment.
