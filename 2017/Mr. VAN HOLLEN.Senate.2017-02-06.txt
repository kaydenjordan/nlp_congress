 Madam President, I wish to start by thanking Senator  Murray and the Members of the HELP Committee for the work they have  done to cast light on the record and the lack of record of Mrs. Betsy  DeVos, President Trump's nominee to be Secretary of Education.   As the Senator from Washington has told us, the more the American  people learn about the record of Betsy DeVos, the more concerned they  become. The American people are making their voices heard in every  Senate office. The switchboard has been essentially shut down, and I  can tell you that I have received over 14,000 calls from Maryland on  this nominee alone.   People are calling because the more they look at the record, the more  they realize this nominee's lack of commitment to the essential mission  of the Department of Education. That mission is to provide every child  in America with access to a quality public education. This concern  about the nominee is shared across political parties.   As Senator Susan Collins of Maine said on this floor, Mrs. DeVos's  concentration on vouchers ``raises the question about whether she fully  appreciates that the Secretary Of Education's primary focus must be on  helping States and communities, parents, teachers, school board  members, and administrators strengthen our public schools.''   Regardless of ZIP Code, our mission must be to provide every child  with access to a high-quality neighborhood public school. It is  absolutely true that in too many places around in country we are  failing to meet the goal, but the response to a troubled school should  not be to walk away from it in favor of sketchy voucher schemes.  Instead we must work together to provide the necessary resources and  interventions to help those schools and those students achieve success.  Over the last 2 years, I have spent a lot of time traveling over the  great State of Maryland. I visited schools, talked to college students,  and heard from parents. No matter where I went, in every part of our  State, everybody wanted the same thing: a good school, affordable  college, either community college or 4-year colleges, and a fair shot  at reaching their dreams.   The U.S. Department of Education is supposed to help them get that  opportunity. Let me take a moment to talk about what the Department of  Education means to some neighborhoods in my State of Maryland. Not long  ago, I visited a pair of community schools in Baltimore City, the  Historic Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Elementary School in Upton/Druid  Heights in West Baltimore and the Benjamin Franklin High School in  Brooklyn, South Baltimore. Upton/Druid Heights is a historic African- American community in Baltimore. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood  Marshall, jazz great Cab Calloway, and civil rights pioneer Lillie Mae  Carroll Jackson all walked its streets, but today it is a community in  distress. Most of its children live in poverty; 95 percent of the  students at Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Elementary are on free or reduced  lunch. Despite its challenges, it has a strong faith-based institution  and community groups. Mrs. DeVos's approach to schools such as Samuel  Coleridge-Taylor has been to give up on them, to abandon them, and to  divert resources to voucher programs.   Fortunately, the Department of Education did not abandon this  school. In 2012, it designated Upton/Druid Heights as a Promise  Neighborhood. The Department provided resources to support  comprehensive services for families. These include B'more for Healthy  Babies, which has dramatically reduced infant mortality rates in the  city; Parent University, to help educate parents of young children; and  financial literacy and education, to help with filling out income tax  forms and to help families manage their budgets.    In 2012, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor became a community school. It has a  community school coordinator, a position that can be filled using funds  under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which  provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers of children  from low-income families. The community school coordinator works with  parents, students, educators, and community residents to learn the  needs of the neighborhood and form partnerships to meet them. The  University of Maryland School of Social Work, which is located just  down the road, joined them to provide trauma training so that teachers  could recognize and respond to trauma among the children and go on home  visits to work with families. They received a grant to build a first- ever playground on campus--something that most schools take for  granted. Local churches provided safe spaces for kids. The Weinberg  Foundation donated a beautiful library. There is a jobs center, where  parents can look for employment, and a food bank, to send kids home  with something to eat over the weekend. The school was transformed into  a place where kids want to be, receiving the mayor's award for the  greatest drop in students at risk for chronic absenteeism. It has been  a success story.   In a little different part of town, Ben Franklin High School exists,  and it is isolated geographically in the Brooklyn neighborhood. It is  on a peninsula at the southern part of the city. Brooklyn is a historic  waterfront neighborhood with strong ties to manufacturing. The Brooklyn  community built ships for the United States in World War II. Many  families in Brooklyn have been there for generations. As manufacturing  left and Bethlehem Steel closed--Bethlehem Steel provided about 12,000  good-paying manufacturing jobs--times got tougher for those working  families.   In the year 2011, Benjamin Franklin was one of the bottom 5 percent  of schools in the State of Maryland--again, one of those schools that  this nominee would have walked away from in favor of vouchers. Again,  the good news is the Department of Education did not walk away. It  provided extra funding to help turn things around. Using the community  schools model, they assessed and responded to the needs of the  students.   Interns from the University of Maryland School of Social Work  provided mental health services. The United Way offers a workforce  development program and an onsite early childhood development center  that helps teen parents graduate, knowing their children have quality  care. A family stability program helps families avoid homelessness. CSX  is working with the school to build a football field.   Students worked together with their neighbors to take ownership of  their communities and protest the placement of an incinerator near  them. Some figured that this low-income neighborhood was a good target  to put an incinerator, but the community fought back and won. They have  put thousands of hours into community service, including the Chesapeake  Bay cleanup. The school's office of student service learning helps  connect students to internships and job-training programs.   In Brooklyn, the crime rate and the teen pregnancy rates have  dropped, and attendance at Ben Franklin is up. When I asked the  students what they liked about the school, they said: ``We feel like  someone cares now,'' and ``everyone is positive.''   At both of these schools, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and Ben Franklin,  the  [[Page S689]]  principals told me that the community schools model allowed them to  form partnerships to meet the needs of their students' lives so that  they could focus on delivering a high-quality education. Because the  students' needs are being met more comprehensively, the students can  focus on learning, and because we have a team outside of the teachers  who are helping provide some services to these kids, the teachers can  focus on teaching.   It is important for us to understand that every child who walks  through the doors of a school has a unique family circumstance and  their own individual needs.   The community school approach emphasizes the fact that no school is  an island onto itself. Every school is part of a neighborhood, and we  need to understand the special circumstances of the children and  families in those neighborhoods. It is not just for urban schools like  Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and Ben Franklin. Community schools have shown  success in rural areas of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Montana, and  all across the country.   This idea that every child should receive a good public education is  as old as our Republic itself. Our Nation's Founders knew the  contribution of education to the success of our democracy. They knew  that an educated population would be a strong safeguard against  tyranny. In a letter in 1786, Thomas Jefferson wrote:         I think by far the most important bill in our whole code is       that for the diffusion of knowledge among the people. No       other sure foundation can be devised for the preservation of       freedom and happiness.    As early as 1779, Jefferson was putting forward legislation to create  a public school system that would give children a fair start. Jefferson  later wrote to John Adams:         It was a bill for the more general diffusion of learning.       This proposed to divide every county into wards of five or       six miles square, like your townships; to establish in each       ward a free school for reading, writing and common       arithmetic; to provide for the annual selection of the best       subjects from these schools, who might receive, at the public       expense, a higher degree of public education at a district  school.    He went on to say:         Worth and genius would thus have been sought out from every       condition of life, and completely prepared by education for       defeating the competition and birth for public trusts.    Though America did not start the public education system at that  moment in time, those ideas and that philosophy of education as the  great equalizer and tool to develop the talents of Americans,  regardless of the circumstances of their birth, were the foundation of  the public school system that we have today.   President Trump gave remarkably little attention to education during  his campaign. He pretty much ignored the public school education system  in favor of his $20 billion voucher scheme that would drain huge  amounts of resources from neighborhood schools like the two in  Baltimore that I just discussed. With the President offering only vague  promises and pricey schemes, it is even more important that we have an  Education Secretary with a steady hand and a deep understanding of the  critical mission of the Department. It is clear that Mrs. Betsy DeVos  is not the right person for the job.   Mrs. DeVos advocates a concept of industrialized, privatized, and  for-profit schools. This thinking is too small and too cramped for our  kids. Our goal should not be vouchers for children to try to shop for a  school with no accountability for quality. Our goal should be a  neighborhood school for every child that meets their needs.   We cannot abandon the families who cannot afford to make up the  difference between the value of the voucher and the tuition at the  private school. What do we say to them? We cannot abandon the students  who cannot get accepted into private schools because many of these  private schools say yes to some and no to others. What do we say to  those who have the doors closed on them? We cannot abandon the schools  that a voucher program would drain the resources from, and $20 billion  is a huge amount of the resources that we currently provide for schools  like the two I mentioned in Baltimore City and schools in neighborhoods  throughout the country. So instead of a risky voucher program, we need  to make our schools better by giving them the flexibility to meet  student needs and the support to make sure that our children are all  ready to learn.   In her hearing and in the responses to the questions for the record,  Mrs. DeVos displayed an astonishing ignorance about the agency that she  intends to run and, indeed, about the role of public schools in our  country. All of us who have been part of this debate know that one of  the most fundamental discussions in K-12 policy has been over  accountability and how best to measure student knowledge and school  performance. There has been an intense discussion over whether to  measure school and student performance by student proficiency or by  student improvement and student growth. Mrs. DeVos seemed totally  confused about this discussion that is going to the heart of many of  the debates here in Congress.   Perhaps we should not be so surprised that she has such little  understanding of the public education system, as she has spent much of  her career attempting to dismantle it in favor of private, charter, and  for-profit schools. She has been referred to as the ``four-star general  of the voucher movement.'' She has forcefully worked to expand  vouchers, including spending millions on a failed ballot initiative to  bring vouchers to the State of Michigan. When that didn't work, she  created the Great Lakes Education Project to fund nonprofits and donate  to State legislators who would advance vouchers and charters. With  respect to the millions of dollars she and her family have spent trying  to influence lawmakers, she stated: ``We expect a return on our  investment.''   She received a return in Michigan, where she played a role in a 1993  law that created incentives for charters to come to Michigan. The for- profit industry, in particular, responded, and they operate nearly 80  percent of the charters in the State of Michigan. In 2011, she pushed  successfully for a law that allowed even low-performing charters to  expand and repealed the requirement that the State publish annual  reports on charter performance. I think we all believe that  transparency is important, and it is shocking that there would be an  effort to put the facts under the rug. After years of criticism, modest  accountability measures were introduced in 2015, although Mrs. DeVos  opposed and successfully stripped a provision from the bill that would  have established a commission to explore ways to improve Detroit public  schools.   Seventy percent of Detroit charter schools ranked in the bottom  quarter of Michigan schools. The nonprofit Education Trust calls their  poor performance a ``civil rights issue.'' In a report just last June,  the New York Times called the situation in Detroit ``a public education  fiasco that is perhaps unparalleled in the United States.'' It would be  a big mistake to impose that fiasco on the rest of the country.   Mrs. DeVos has also advocated for online charter schools, and she was  formerly an investor in the largest for-profit online school operator,  K-12, Inc. In her response to questions about this model, she cited  questionable statistics for the accomplishments of several virtual  academies. Those statistics were disproved in an article in Education  Week which compared them to the publicly reported figures used for  State accountability.   For example, Ms. DeVos wrote that Utah Virtual Academy has a 92- percent graduation rate. In fact, the most recently publicly reported  figure is 42 percent. The last thing we need is a Secretary of  Education coming up with alternative facts.   While I believe that nonprofit public charter schools are important  incubators for innovation, they have to play by the same rules as the  rest of our schools. But Mrs. DeVos has rejected that equal playing  field.   In an exchange with Senator Kaine from Virginia where he repeatedly  asked her whether or not the charter schools would have the same  standards applied to them as public schools that received Federal  funding, she refused to agree.   It is pretty extraordinary when we have a nominee saying that she  supports a taxpayer-funded blank check for some schools. Our Secretary  of Education must be a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars and  ensure that funds  [[Page S690]]  are delivering quality and results for students.   Another area where Mrs. DeVos raises serious concerns is that of  enforcement of equal rights, especially the rights of children with  disabilities. All of us know the Department of Education has the very  important job of enforcing civil rights laws and making sure we have  equal access to education throughout the Nation. Congress prohibited  discrimination in education on the basis of race, color, and national  origin in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title IX of the  Education Amendments of 1972 prohibited sex discrimination. Section 504  of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis  of disability.   But all of us know that as late of the mid-1970s, public schools  still accommodated only one of five children with disabilities, and  many States had laws that explicitly excluded children with certain  disabilities. When Congress addressed this with the passage of the IDEA  legislation, it was a big breakthrough for our country and for our  children. The IDEA was very straightforward and very simple: Every  child deserves a ``free appropriate public education'' in the ``least  restrictive environment.'' The law requires schools to design an  ``individualized education program'' for each child with a disability.   IDEA has been a lifesaver for children with disabilities and their  families. It has empowered them to get the quality education they could  not earlier receive, and the law gives them tools with which they can  fight to ensure that schools address their needs. This is why it was so  alarming at the hearing to hear Mrs. DeVos say that the application of  IDEA and the rights behind IDEA really was a State function--the same  States that historically discriminated against these very children.  That is not what the IDEA legislation is all about. It is a national  standard to make sure we do not have discrimination based on  disability. Yet, Mrs. DeVos in exchange concluded with: ``I think  that's an issue that's best left to the States.''   So whether it is her position with respect to vouchers and poaching  resources that otherwise would go to improve our public schools or lack  of support for the very idea behind IDEA, we have a nominee who the  overwhelming majority of the American people recognize is the wrong  choice to be the custodian of the Department that is responsible at the  Federal level for providing support and educational opportunities to  our children.   In closing, with respect to the issue of guns in schools--and Senator  Murray, the ranking member, has addressed this as well--it was pretty  shocking to hear Mrs. DeVos trivialize the issue of gun violence in  schools when she was asked about this by the Senator from Connecticut,  Mr. Murphy, quipping that guns might be necessary to kill grizzly  bears. We have had lots of debates in this Chamber, and obviously there  are strong feelings. But I think we would all agree that the safety of  our kids and our schools is not something that should be trivialized.   In conclusion, let us heed the words of the editorial board of the  Detroit Free Press. They have witnessed firsthand the experiments that  Mrs. DeVos has made about education and have written in an editorial:  ``Make no mistake: A vote to confirm Betsy DeVos as U.S. Secretary of  Education is a vote to end public education in this country as we know  it.''   In a speech in 2015, Betsy DeVos said bluntly: ``Government really  sucks.'' I suggest that she should not be leading the agency entrusted  at the Federal level with the education of our children, which, as our  Founder said, is really the root of equal opportunity and the  opportunity for every child to achieve their dreams.   I join with the distinguished Senator from Washington State in urging  my colleagues to vote no on Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education. We  can do better. We can do a lot better for our kids.    Mr. President, I will start by thanking my colleague,  the Senator from Connecticut, for his leadership on public education  issues and the fight against gun violence. He has been a voice calling  for commonsense measures to address gun violence and to make our  schools more safe, and I thank him for all he has done in that regard.   Yesterday I came to this floor to discuss the risk that Betsy DeVos  would pose to our public education system for students from  kindergarten through 12th grade. With her zealous focus on vouchers for  private schools, she has ignored accountability and the unique needs of  communities in Maryland and  [[Page S801]]  throughout the Nation. Education is a public trust, and we should not  contract it out to the highest bidders in various voucher schemes.   In addition to overseeing support for K-12 education, the Secretary  of Education is also responsible for Federal efforts in the area of  higher education. So this morning, I would like to talk a little bit  about higher education.   We know very little about the position the new President will take in  the area of higher education. However, what we do know about his track  record is very troubling. Based on the testimony of Ms. DeVos and her  responses to questions for the Record, we can have little confidence  that she will be a check on President Trump's worst instincts.   Here is what we know: We know that President Trump's main foray into  continuing education was the now-extinct Trump University. Make no  mistake about it, Trump University was a scam. It was a con game. It  promised students great wealth if they only paid thousands of dollars  for seminars on Mr. Trump's real estate ``secrets.''   As Senator Rubio once pointed out not that long ago, ``There are  people who borrowed $36,000 to go to Trump University, and they are  suing now--$36,000 to go to a university that is a fake school. And you  know what they got,'' Senator Rubio asked, ``They got to take a picture  with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump.''   Senator Rubio was absolutely right when he made that statement.   First of all, the word ``university'' in Trump University was totally  misleading. Trump University was not an accredited institution, but it  did promise to educate its students in the real estate industry so they  could become skilled investors.   An article in the conservative National Review entitled ``Yes, Trump  University Was a Massive Scam'' explained that prospective students  were offered a free seminar where they would be pressured to purchase a  class, where they would be ``mentored by hand-picked real estate  experts who would use President Trump's own real estate strategies.''   Of course, Mr. Trump was neither handpicking instructors nor  developing class materials, and instructors did not even necessarily  have a real estate background. In a deposition, Mr. Trump could not  identify a single instructor at Trump University.   Students were promised access to lenders, improved credit scores, and  longterm mentoring. The university did not deliver. According to a  former employee, Trump University ``preyed upon the elderly and  uneducated to separate them from their money.'' Employees were told to  rank students based on their liquid assets so they could target them to  sell more seminars. They took advantage of people.   Because of its fraudulent practices, Trump University was sued  multiple times. In February 2016, Mr. Trump dismissed those suits  saying: ``I could settle it right now for very little money, but I  don't want to do it out of principle.''   Right before the class action lawsuit in San Diego was scheduled to  be heard by a jury, those principles evaporated and Mr. Trump settled  all the lawsuits for a whopping $25 million, and about 7,000 former  students were granted a full or partial refund.   Now, because Trump University was a university in name only and not  accredited, students attending Trump University were not eligible to  use Federal student loans or grants--thank goodness. But there are many  accredited, for-profit colleges and universities that do take large  sums of money from students who obtain Federal student loans or Federal  grants, and it is the job of the Secretary of Education to make sure  that those for-profit colleges are good stewards of those taxpayer  dollars and that they are giving their students a good education.   For example, under President Obama's leadership, the Department of  Education took action against the for-profit Corinthian College for  fraudulently enticing students to enroll by lying about their job  placement rates. They told students: You enroll in our programs, and we  can get you a job. It wasn't true.   As California's attorney general, our colleague Senator Harris,  pointed out in her lawsuit, they got more than $1 billion in damages  and restitution from Corinthian College because they targeted  vulnerable, low-income populations, including the homeless. They  directed them to predatory lending and failed to deliver an education  that could really help them get a job. Their tactics were similar to  those of Trump University--callously targeting ``prospects they  perceived as having low self-esteem,'' who were ``unable to see and  plan well for the future, and those who had few people in their lives  who cared about them.''   In order to stop these kinds of abuses, the Department of Education,  under the Obama administration, put in place something called the  gainful employment rule, which requires for-profit colleges to  demonstrate real results for their students in order to continue to  enroll students who use Federal student loans and grants. We want to  make sure that students enrolling in those programs have a decent shot  at success and are not simply being separated from their money,  including Federal student loans.   This gainful employment rule is important for protecting both  students and taxpayers. That is why it was alarming that during her  hearing, Mrs. DeVos would not commit to enforcing the gainful  employment rule.   Our veterans have been among the students who have been most targeted  by these abusive practices. Just last week, I received a copy of a  letter that was sent to Senators Alexander and Murray and  Representatives Fox and Scott from a coalition of veterans  organizations. I have it here. It is a letter from the Paralyzed  Veterans of America, the Reserve Officers Association of the United  States, the National Military Family Association, AMVETS, Blue Star  Families, Vietnam Veterans of America, the Wounded Warrior Project, and  Student Veterans of America, all opposing any weakening of the gainful  employment rule and urging greater, not fewer, consumer protections.   As they note in this letter, a loophole in what is known as the 90-10  law, which caps the amount of funding for-profit schools can obtain  from Federal sources, exempts funds from the Departments of Defense and  Veterans Affairs. They write: As a result, our Nation's heroes are  targeted with the most deceptive and aggressive recruiting.    The letter quotes Holly Petraeus of the U.S. Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, who said that some for-profit colleges are motivated  to view veterans and their families as ``nothing more than dollar signs  in uniform.''   The letter further states that ``veterans express anger when they  discover that the government knew that a career education program had a  lousy record, but allowed them to waste their time and GI Bill benefits  enrolled in it.''   That should make all of us angry. It should make us angry because of  the service our veterans have performed for our country. It should make  us angry because it is a waste of taxpayer dollars to have these monies  spent in institutions that are not providing an education to our  veterans or other students in the way they advertise.   Yet Mrs. DeVos provided no assurance--none, none--that she would  enforce the gainful employment rule that these veterans groups are  calling to strengthen. She also provided no assurance that she would  pursue other protections to help our students and veterans. In fact,  when asked, she pointedly did not make that commitment.   Taxpayers and students should also be troubled by statements that  have been made by the Trump team regarding their plans for the Federal  student loan program. As many people know, the Department of Education  is responsible for managing a $1 trillion bank of student loans and $30  billion in Pell grants each year. It is very important that these funds  be managed in a way that protects the best interests of both students  and taxpayers, rather than simply fattening the bottom lines of the big  banks and big lenders.   In fact, 7 years ago, Congress--the House and the Senate--passed and  the President signed the bill that ``made important reforms to the  Federal student loan program.''   Under the old system, banks distributed Federally guaranteed loans in  exchange for a subsidy from the Federal Government. In effect, banks  were paid a premium to be the middleman and  [[Page S802]]  were also insured against most of the risks of the loan with the  Federal guarantee. In other words, they got a great return and took  very little risk. In fact, the old system was rigged to provide huge  returns to banks on certain loans.   Shortly after I came to Congress, I worked with my colleagues to  close what was then called the 9.5 percent loophole.   The way it worked was like this. Written right into the code, some  banks were able to make loans guaranteed by the government to give them  a 9.5 percent return, even though students receiving those loans were  paying a 3.5 percent interest rate. The difference--6 percent--was pure  profit paid by the taxpayers to the banks for zero risk.   We were able to close that loophole after a number of years, and then  in 2010 the Congress and President Obama agreed that we should stop  using banks as the middlemen in the student loan process. We shifted  entirely to the direct loan program through the Department of  Education. That move saved taxpayers $61 billion over a 10-year period,  and we were able to use the savings to increase support for students to  make college more affordable. By increasing funding for Pell grants and  indexing them to new inflation, we were able to expand the income-based  repayment program so more students could afford college, and we put $10  million toward deficit reduction.   The Republican Party platform under President Trump calls for rolling  back those important reforms and putting student loans back in the  hands of the big banks. When Senator Murray, the ranking member of the  Education Committee, asked Mrs. DeVos in a question for the record  about privatization of the student loan industry, Mrs. DeVos refused to  rule out a return to the days when the big banks reaped huge profits  off students and taxpayers while taking very little risk.   It turns out that Mrs. DeVos may herself have investments that  represent conflicts of interest for the job of Secretary of Education  or indicate a preference for privatization within higher education. For  example, according to her ethics forms, she has an investment in  Procurement Recovery, Inc., which had a contract with the Department of  Education for student loan debt collection. The court blocked that  contract last year and it is currently challenging the decision.   There is a common thread connecting the approach that both President  Trump and Mrs. DeVos have taken with respect to both K-12 education and  higher education; that is, the idea that we should put for-profit  private interests over the interests of students and taxpayers. As we  have heard, in Michigan Mrs. DeVos was very instrumental in changing  Michigan State law in a way that attracted for-profit charter schools  to the State of Michigan. Those schools have a very sorry record in  terms of the education they provided to students in Michigan. Now, when  it comes to higher education, in her hearing she refused to commit to  enforcing the gainful employment rule, which is designed to protect  students and taxpayers from the kind of predatory practices engaged in  by the likes of Trump University. She did not disavow proposals to turn  the student loan program back over to the big banks.   We need a Secretary of Education who understands that our education  system is a public trust and not simply a vehicle that allows for- profit schools and big banks to make a profit off of these important  taxpayer investments.   I wish to say a word, as well, about community colleges. I think all  of us recognize the really important role that community colleges play  in our education system. Just two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to  attend a meeting of the presidents of Maryland's community colleges. It  was organized by the Maryland Association of Community Colleges and  included folks from all over the State. We are fortunate in Maryland  and around the country to have some terrific community colleges that  provide associate's degrees and certifications for advanced careers, 2- year programs for those students who plan to go on to get a 4-year  education, and continuing education classes for people who want to go  back to school to learn new skills. Our community colleges are  particularly important because they are able to work closely with  employers to identify skills that are in demand and adjust programs to  prepare students to move directly into the workforce.   A number of years ago, I had the opportunity to work with my  colleague, Senator Mikulski, and others, to obtain a Federal grant for  a consortium of Maryland community colleges to train and prepare  students in the area of cyber security.   Cyber security is something that is important to all Americans. We  are realizing more and more the costs and dangers of hacking, both in  the government sector as well as the private sector. It is really  important we build a workforce which has those important skills, and I  am pleased that Maryland is home to the U.S. Cyber Command at Fort  Meade, alongside NSA. We need to make sure we have students who have  those important skills, and community colleges, along with other  institutions, can help fill that skills gap.   I also visited the Community College of Baltimore County, where they  are responding to the need for medical professionals by providing  training to nurses and other medical assistants. They use something  called SimMan technology--lifelike mannequins that can simulate medical  conditions--to help train nurses, emergency medical technicians, and  physician assistants. I think we would all agree these community  college programs are a really important block in our education system,  and we should be supporting those colleges and the students who want to  attend.   I was pleased that at the hearing, Mrs. DeVos acknowledged the  importance of community college. Unfortunately, she didn't put forward  any concrete recommendations about how we can help community colleges  succeed. That is particularly troubling in light of the fact that if we  look at previous Republican budgets, especially those coming out of the  House of Representatives but also those adopted in a Republican- controlled Senate, they would do great damage to students' ability to  access community college programs.   Let's just look at the last budget conference agreement that passed  from fiscal year 2016. It contains a whopping 35-percent cut to Pell  grants, which would eliminate all mandatory funding for Pell and  eliminate another almost $30 billion in discretionary funding.  Altogether, it is a $117 billion cut over 10 years.   Nearly 3 million community college students in Maryland and around  the country depend on Pell grants in order to afford an education.  Rather than making dramatic cuts to the program, we should listen to  our community colleges and expand the program to a year-round grant to  give students greater flexibility to finish their degrees in less time.  Those are the cuts the Republican budget would make to the Pell Grant  Program. At the same time, when it comes to the other components of the  Federal student loan program, the Republican budget would cut so much  that in order to compensate, we would have to raise student loan rates  to make up the difference.   Those troubling positions are on top of a proposal made by the Trump  team to require colleges to ``risk share'' by taking some  responsibility for nonrepayment of loans among their students, which  would have a particularly damaging impact for community colleges.  Community colleges already operate on very narrow margins. Any cut to  their budget from risk-sharing would require them to do one of two  things: increase tuition, making college less affordable, or cutting  programs, including the kind of program I just talked about that helps  students build the skills needed in the workforce of today.   Sam Clovis, a Trump campaign cochair, also said that Mr. Trump would  reject President Obama's plan for free community college for our  students. In an interview with the daily online publication Inside  Higher Ed, Mr. Clovis contended that community college is already  ``damn near free,'' and therefore did not require additional  assistance. I hope Mr. Clovis will come out to the State of Maryland  and talk to our students. We work very hard in the State of Maryland to  keep tuition low at community colleges, but for those who are just  trying to scrape by, I can assure him that it is not ``damn near  free.'' I certainly hope Mrs. DeVos does  [[Page S803]]  not share this gross misunderstanding of student needs.   We heard from Senator Blumenthal, we have heard from others on this  floor, about the incredible grassroots outpouring of opposition to the  nomination of Mrs. DeVos. She has drawn opposition from teachers,  parents, and civil rights organizations. We have seen that groundswell  overwhelm the phone system here in the United States Senate.   Maryland's schools, and schools throughout the country, deserve a  champion in their Secretary of Education. When President Trump and  congressional Republicans propose plans to cut and divert Federal  education funding, we need a Secretary of Education who is going to  fight for public education. Mrs. DeVos is clearly not that person.   Our Founders understood from the earliest days of this Republic that  a free public education is a fundamental American value. Free public  education at neighborhood schools throughout our land has helped make  America more productive, broaden opportunity, and sustain local  neighborhood schools and communities. I share my colleagues' deep  concern that Mrs. DeVos does not appear to share a commitment to that  American idea. She has devoted much of her adult life and career to  advancing private education plans that would divert resources from our  public schools. She has shown a lack of awareness and, in many  statements, alarming views about our Nation's commitment to equal  rights for children with disabilities. We cannot retreat from the  commitment we made as a country, and we cannot return to an era where  equal rights were just another concern for States to decide on their  own.   We also heard, as Senator Blumenthal discussed, flippant statements  about guns in schools and the safety of our children. We cannot retreat  from our determination to keep our schools safe and gun-free.   When President Trump has a history of promoting a sham, for-profit  Trump University, we need a Secretary of Education who will zealously  oversee for-profit colleges that receive students with Federal student  loans and grants. Nothing in her testimony, statements, or responses to  questions from Senator Murray or others gives me any comfort that Mrs.  DeVos can be that person.   Education holds the key to a more prosperous America, a better  informed electorate, and a society in which the Nation's bounty is more  fairly shared as more citizens have access to a good education. We  cannot advance those goals without a strong Secretary of Education. We  cannot leave this job to just happen on its own. We need somebody who  is going to fight for those ideals. Unfortunately, the record indicates  that Mrs. DeVos is not that person.   I join with my colleagues in opposing the nomination. I hope between  now and the time of the vote, other Senators will take another look at  the record because it is important we muster the votes to defeat this  nomination. We also must show very clearly that we will not accept a  Department of Education focused more on undermining our commitment to a  public education than one that is upholding that important American  tradition.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I wish to start by responding to my  new colleague.   I respect my colleague. We have worked together on many issues, the  Senator from Alaska and I. I think he would agree it is very important  that the American people, the public, have a thorough review of  candidates for a position in public office who are going to have  incredible influence over all aspects of their lives. That is why it is  so important we undertake this process. It is a fact that many of the  nominees put forward by President Trump had massive conflict-of- interest issues that need to be resolved. Many of them remain  unresolved. Many of them are still not proceeding through committees  because either their ethics report information has not been provided  yet or they haven't passed other clearances.   So it is absolutely fitting that we in the Senate do our job to make  sure the people who are placed in these positions of high office are  thoroughly vetted.   I also wish to take a moment to respond to the statements regarding  my good colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren.   Last night she was reading from a letter presented by Coretta Scott  King at the time of the 1986 hearings on the judicial appointment of  Senator Sessions. At the time he was a nominee to fill the vacancy.   As a new Member of the Senate, it is difficult to understand how  reading that letter--I have a copy of that letter right here--could be  a violation of the Senate rules, but I assume we will all have time to  investigate that question. I will say that the result has been a lot  more people around the country have had an opportunity to read that  important letter from Coretta Scott King.   Obviously, we are gathered here as we consider the nomination for  Attorney General. President Thomas Jefferson wrote: ``The most sacred  of the duties of government [is] to do equal and impartial justice to  all its citizens.'' This is the job of the Department of Justice, and I  think it is worth reviewing the mandate and purpose of the Department  of Justice to determine whether Senator Sessions is the right person  for this special and unique position in the U.S. Government.   The Judiciary Act of 1789, the same act in which the first Congress  created the Federal judiciary, Congress also created the Office of the  Attorney General. In years thereafter, Congress empowered the Justice  Department to handle all criminal and civil suits in which the United  States has an interest. The Department is the largest law office in the  world and the chief enforcer of our Nation's laws. The Attorney General  has to be the people's lawyer. Upon taking the office, the Attorney  General swears an oath to ``protect and defend the Constitution of the  United States.'' More than almost any other officer of the U.S.  Government, it is the job of the Attorney General to protect and carry  out the Constitution's plan of defending the rights and privileges of  those who most need that protection. There is a Latin motto on the seal  of the Department of Justice. It refers to the Attorney General as the  one ``who prosecutes on behalf of justice.'' In the paneling above the  door of the anteroom outside of the Attorney General's office are  inscribed the words: ``United States wins its point whenever justice is  done its citizens in the courts.''   As former Attorney General Loretta Lynch said after taking the oath  of office, the employees of the Department of Justice are ``the ones  who make real the promise of justice and redress for all Americans.''  She said they ``continue the core work of our mission--the protection  of the American people.''   She said: ``The challenge in that--for you, for me, for all of us  that love this Department and love the law--is to use the law to that  end. To not just represent the law and enforce it, but use it to make  real the promise of America, the promise of fairness and equality, of  `liberty and justice for all.'''   I think we all recognize--and I see we have been joined by many of  our colleagues from the other side of the Capitol from the House of  Representatives. It is great to see them here as part of this historic  debate. I see the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Mr.  Conyers, as well as many other colleagues because they know this is an  important moment.   Just as Loretta Lynch described the importance of the Office of  Attorney General, we all have to take heed because I think all of us  recognize that the story of America, the story of our country has been  the story of working to live up to that original promise. It has been a  long journey, and there have been a lot of broken promises along the  way, and it is an unfinished journey. We know there has been a lot of  blood and tears shed in order to try to make good on the ideas of equal  justice and equal opportunity, of equal rights. We have come a long  way--there is no denying that--but we also know we have a long way to  go to meet that full promise.   The role of the Justice Department is to be a fighter for living up  to that purpose, for living up to that promise, to be the champion of  the people, to be the defender of those who are too often undefended,  to be a fighter for those who do not have an advocate, to be the voice  for people who do not have high-priced and high-powered lobbyists. They  need to be the advocate for everybody, the Attorney General--someone to  whom those who are feeling like they are getting an unfair shake can  turn. It has to be a refuge for those who have been victimized by the  powerful, someone who can speak for all of the American people.   To fulfill this responsibility, the Attorney General overseas over  114,000 employees, 60 agencies, from the Antitrust Division, the Office  of Privacy and Civil Liberties, to the U.S. attorneys, and the Office  on Violence Against Women Act.   The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, created in 1957,  works to uphold the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans,  particularly the most vulnerable in our society. The division is  charged with enforcing Federal statutes, prohibiting discrimination on  the basis of race, color, sex, disability, religion, familial status,  and national origin.   The Justice Department's Disability Rights Section works to achieve  equal opportunity for people with disabilities by implementing the  Americans with Disabilities Act. Forty-nine million Americans with  disabilities rely on the Attorney General to protect their rights. The  Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review  adjudicates immigration cases by fairly, expeditiously, and uniformly  interpreting and administrating the Nation's immigration laws. That is  their charge. Under the supervision of the Attorney General, the office  conducts immigration court proceedings, appellate reviews, and  administrative hearings that determine the fate of millions of people-- and we have seen just how important that is in the last few weeks.   The Justice Department's voting section enforces Federal laws that  protect  [[Page S930]]  Americans' right to vote, including the Voting Rights Act, the  Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, the National Voter  Registration Act, the Help America Vote Act, and the Civil Rights Act.  That is their charge.   The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel provides legal  advice to the President and the executive branch. They are supposed to  give their best legal advice and call the balls and strikes without  political shadowing. The office reviews for legality all Executive  orders and proclamations proposed to be issued by the President of the  United States.   The Justice Department has played a vital role in advancing the  promise of America. You just have to look historically to how it was  not just a passive actor but made sure they did their job to be a  fighter for people who were disenfranchised.   In 1957, in Little Rock, AR, the Justice Department helped to force  the Governor of Arkansas to allow African-American children to attend  an all-White Central High School. That was a Justice Department action  under President Eisenhower.   In the years since the Supreme Court's 1999 decision in Olmstead v.  L.C., the Justice Department has fought to implement the goal of  integration under the Americans with Disabilities Act to provide people  with disabilities the opportunity to live their lives to their full  God-given potential.   In 2013, in Atlanta, GA, a Justice Department investigation and  prosecution in response to the beating of a 20-year-old gay Atlanta man  resulted in the first conviction in Georgia under the sexual  orientation provision of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate  Crimes Prevention Act.   Again, the Justice Department is not a passive actor, enforcing the  laws of the United States in order to advance equal justice in the  United States of America.   This is a really important legacy to uphold, and the question is, Is  Senator Sessions the right person to uphold that legacy?   Senator Sessions has represented the State of Alabama in the Senate  for 20 years. He has served as the ranking Republican member of the  Budget Committee, among other responsibilities here in the Senate.  There may be many other positions in the executive branch for which  that experience would provide an appropriate fit, but the role of the  Attorney General is different. As I have said, this is a sacred duty  and somebody in this position has to have a record not just of an  understanding of the law but a willingness to make sure that we  implement the law for all the American people.   I regret that as I examine the history of Senator Sessions'  statements and actions, I do not believe that he is well suited for the  position of Attorney General. Nothing in his history or record  indicates that he will be a fighter for those who are less powerful and  those who have been left out. Nothing indicates that he will be a  fighter for people of color, people with disabilities, or people in the  LGBT community. Nothing in his record suggests that he will be that  warrior for justice that we need in our Attorney General.   To the contrary, time and again, Senator Sessions has taken positions  that vary with those important traditions in our jurisprudence and in  our law and, indeed, are contrary, in many instances, to the very  mission of the Justice Department.   Many years ago, back in 1986, I was on the floor of this Senate in a  very different capacity. At that time, I was the legislative assistant  for national security and defense policy to a Maryland Republican  Senator by the name of Mac Mathias--a very independent Maryland  Republican Senator, a liberal Republican and a real statesman. Senator  Mathias was on the Judiciary Committee at the time. Strom Thurmond, the  Senator from South Carolina, was the chairman. In fact, Mac Mathias  probably should have been the chairman, but because of his independent  streak, the Republican caucus at that time worked really hard to make  sure that Senator Thurmond moved from being chairman of the Armed  Services Committee to exercise his seniority on the Senate Judiciary  Committee to become chairman so that Mac Mathias could not assume that  position.   Senator Mathias was somebody who always looked at the facts and  called the balls and strikes as he saw them--a good role model for me,  a good role model for everyone. I wasn't ever thinking--it was the last  thing on my mind--of running for office at that time, but as I look  back, he was a good role model for a U.S. Senator.   As I said, he was on the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time. He  was on the Senate Judiciary Committee during the time of the hearings  when now Senator Sessions, then U.S. Attorney Sessions, was up for his  nomination for a Federal judgeship. Senator Mathias listened very  carefully to the testimony. Senator Mathias, I am sure, would have read  the letter from Coretta Scott King. He always did his homework. He  always read everything and listened to everybody. After hearing all of  the testimony, Senator Mathias--and, again, the Republicans were the  majority in the Senate then, as they are today--and Senator Specter  from Pennsylvania, another Republican Member, cast their votes in  opposition to the nomination of then Attorney Sessions for a Federal  judgeship.   As I review the materials since that time--since the time that  Senator Mathias cast that vote exercising his independence as a  Republican Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee--I find that we  have received very little assurances that there has been a change in  the desire of Senator Sessions to be that advocate--that advocate--for  justice, because all of these many years later, we are now hearing from  those who have taken the time to update his record.   I have with me now a letter that many of us received--and I have  received many letters, as have my colleagues--from the Leadership  Conference on Civil and Human Rights. The letter reads:         In our democracy, the Attorney General is charged with       enforcing our Nation's laws without prejudice and with an eye       towards justice. And just as important, the Attorney General       has to be seen by the public--every member of the public from       every community--as a fair arbiter of justice.    They conclude:         Unfortunately, there is little in Senator Sessions' record       that demonstrates that he would meet such a standard.    They say that his 30-year record of racial insensitivity, bias  against immigrants, and hostility to the protection of civil rights are  among the reasons that they oppose his nomination.   The NAACP reached another and a similar conclusion, strongly urging  the Senate to vote no on Jeff Sessions' nomination for Attorney  General.   The letter reads, in part:         The Justice Department is a crucial enforcer of civil       rights laws and adviser to the President and Congress on what       can and should be done if those laws are threatened. Given       the disregard for issues which protect the rights and, in       some cases, the lives of our constituents, there is no way       the NAACP can be expected to sit by and support Senator       Sessions' nomination to support the U.S. Department of       Justice.    Another letter from the National Task Force to End Sexual and  Domestic Violence reads, in part:         The leadership organizations and individuals advocating on       behalf of victims of sexual assault, domestic violence,       dating violence, and stalking write to express our opposition       to Senator Jeff Sessions' nomination for Attorney General of       the United States of America. We have arrived at this       position based upon a review of his record as a State and       Federal prosecutor, during which he applied the law unevenly,       and as a U.S. Senator, during which he supported laws that       would afford only some members of our society equal       protection under the law.    There is another opinion letter from the Religious Action Center of  Reform Judaism, which has spent a lot of their time and energy over  decades focused on civil rights issues. I quote from their letter of  January 12, 2017:         The pursuit of civil rights has been the core of the reform       Jewish movement social justice work for over 50 years. Guided       by the fundamental principle that all people are created       equal in the divine image and words of Leviticus, 19:18, love       your neighbor as yourself, we have worked to pass landmark       legislation that advances fundamental rights of all people,       regardless of race, class, sex, gender identity, sexual       orientation, or national origin. As the chief law enforcement       officer in the country, the Attorney General has substantial       power over the administration of these policies.    They go on to write:         Senator Sessions' longstanding record of insufficient       commitment to voting rights, to LGBTQ equality, women's       rights, immigration reform, and religious freedom causes us  [[Page S931]]       to believe that he would stand in the way of the Justice       Department's mandate to ensure equal protection under the       law.    There are many other letters like this one from people who took a  thorough review of the record of the President's nominee to be Attorney  General.   I would like to discuss something that has received a little bit less  attention regarding Senator Sessions' record, and that is what I  believe and what those who pay close attention to these issues believe  has been a poor record in support for individuals with disabilities.  This is especially important given the debate we had just the other day  on the nomination of Mrs. DeVos to be the Secretary of Education,  because she indicated in her testimony before the HELP Committee that  she thought that it was a State obligation, not a Federal obligation,  to enforce the IDEA law--the Individuals with Disabilities Education  Act. So we should take a little time to look at the record of Senator  Sessions with respect to the rights of people with disabilities.   One such occasion was a big moment on the floor of this Senate. It is  when the Senate considered the ratification of the Convention on the  Rights of Persons with Disabilities, a treaty that had been negotiated  under President George W. Bush and later signed by President Obama.  Although I was serving in the House of Representatives at the time, I  got lots of urgent calls and letters from constituents and friends in  the disability community about the importance of the United States  ratifying that convention. But in his remarks on the floor of the  Senate, Senator Sessions not only opposed it, but he called the  convention on the rights of persons with disabilities ``dangerous.''   There have been few moments on this floor where Senators were more  eloquent about that convention than former Senator and former  presidential nominee Bob Dole, who appeared on the floor at the time,  and who is no longer a Senator. He did in committee testify in favor of  ratification of the convention that was before the Senate. He recalled  during his testimony his maiden speech, the very first speech here in  the U.S. Senate of Senator Dole. His first speech occurred on April 14,  1969. It was the anniversary of the day he was wounded in World War II.  He delivered his maiden speech on persons with disabilities, about the  importance of protecting and ensuring the rights of people with  disabilities. He, as we know, was disabled in action fighting for our  country.    In his testimony to the committee in 2012 on the convention, he said:         It was an exceptional group I joined during World War II,       which no one joins by personal choice. It is a group that       neither respects nor discriminates by age, sex, wealth,       education, skin color, religious beliefs, political party,       power, or prestige. That group, Americans with disabilities,       has grown in size ever since. So, therefore, has the       importance of maintaining access for people with disabilities       to mainstream American life, whether it's access to a job, an       education, or registering to vote.    Those were words of Senator Dole urging the Senate to ratify that  convention. He went on to point out U.S. leadership on advancing the  rights of persons with disabilities, particularly with the Americans  with Disabilities Act. He pointed out that current U.S. laws in place  in 2012 were already enough to make sure the United States satisfies  its obligations to the international Convention on the Rights of  Persons with Disabilities. Joining the treaty, Senator Dole said, would  ``reaffirm the common goals of equality, access, and inclusion for  Americans with disabilities--both when those affected are in the United  States and outside of our country's borders.''   Senator Dole believed so powerfully in the importance of this treaty  that, as I indicated earlier, he came to the floor of this Senate many,  many years after he served here and hoped that his presence on the  floor of the Senate would convince his Republican colleagues--and all  his colleagues--to support that convention. Unfortunately, when the  vote came down, it failed in getting the higher level of votes  necessary for ratification by only 5 votes. One of those votes was that  of Senator Sessions who, as I indicated, said that this convention on  disabilities was ``dangerous.'' He rejected an international treaty  that had been signed and supported by both Republican and Democratic  Presidents, negotiated by President Bush and signed by President Obama.  It imposed no additional obligations on the United States. It just said  that we stand with others in the international community to support the  billions of people around the globe who have a disability.   On that issue, Senator Sessions stood against nearly every veterans  organization in our country. He stood against a broad coalition of  disability rights groups, including the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy  Program. He advanced a theory that somehow U.S. sovereignty would be  called into question. Yet, as then-Senator Dick Lugar, the Republican  chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, pointed out, the  United States had already satisfied its obligations and to make that  clear, the declaration in the resolution of advice and consent stated  simply at the time: ``The Senate declares that, in the view of the  reservations to be included in the instrument of ratification, current  United States law fulfills or exceeds the obligations of the Convention  for the United States of America.''   Despite the presence of Senator Dole on the floor and the support of  the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar,  Senator Sessions opposed that.   If that were the only incident where Senator Sessions failed to  uphold the rights of people with disabilities--maybe, maybe, maybe--I  am not sure it would be understandable. But it is not the only  incident. Senator Sessions also made deeply concerning comments about  the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, which we have  heard so much about in the last couple of days during the debate on the  nomination of Mrs. DeVos. Senator Sessions referred to the IDEA, or  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, as perhaps ``the single  most irritating problem for teachers throughout America today'' and ``a  big factor in accelerating the decline of civility and discipline in  classrooms all over America.'' The most irritating problem was our  national commitment to try to make sure that every child--every child,  regardless of disability--had a chance to achieve his or her full God- given potential. That was apparently irritating.   Senator Sessions claimed that ``special treatment for certain  children'' created a distraction in the classroom. Special treatment.  That is not what IDEA is about. The idea of IDEA legislation was to  make sure all kids could get an appropriate and decent education. It  wasn't there to give kids with disabilities some kind of advantage,  just a chance, along with the other kids.   As to the so-called issue of special treatment, ``special treatment''  is a concerning trend in many of Senator Sessions' statements--not just  with respect to individuals with disabilities, but in many other cases.  In far too many circumstances, he appears to conflate steps to protect  the rights of a minority or disadvantaged group that has historically  faced persecution or discrimination as somehow an effort to give that  group an elevated status over everybody else instead of just an equal  chance with everybody else. The idea that the IDEA legislation to help  kids with disabilities get an education in school was somehow a big  advantage to them over other kids without disabilities is a striking  and revealing statement, and it is one that carries through and on to  other circumstances.   I am concerned that Senator Sessions fails to recognize that there  are communities in this Nation that truly have been subjected to  discrimination and that are disproportionately affected by certain  policies and need sustained civil rights protections--not to give them  an elevated status, but simply to give them an even playing field with  everybody else.    It is the job of the Attorney General of the United States to make  sure all of our citizens are treated equally under the law. The notion  that somehow protecting the rights of groups that have been  historically discriminated against is a bad thing and gives them an  advantage doesn't conform to the reality of our country. I think we all  know that.   This same issue came up with respect to Senator Sessions' position on  the Matthew Shepard hate crimes bill. He called it a ``special  protection'' for  [[Page S932]]  LGBT individuals rather than an acknowledgement that these individuals  had been historically discriminated against and put at risk of greater  violence. He criticized Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotamayor for her  decision that disenfranchising felons violated the Voting Rights Act,  saying that her analysis that the policy had a disproportionate impact  on African Americans was somehow ``a bridge too far.''   I am sure that if Mrs. Coretta Scott King were here today, she would  say that we need to continue to travel along our journey toward meeting  our promise of equal rights, equal justice, and equal opportunity, and  ensuring justice for groups that have been discriminated against  historically--whether on racial grounds or on grounds of gender or of  on sexual orientation. That is not somehow to give them an advantage  but to recognize that they have faced historic discrimination, and to  provide them with a chance.   Just yesterday in Maryland, following the efforts of my good friend  and our State attorney general Brian Frosh, a Maryland court overhauled  the cash bail system in our State. I think all of us who have seen the  way the criminal justice system operates know that far too often cash  bail ends up criminalizing poverty. According to the Pretrial Justice  Institute, ``47 percent of felony defendants with financial bonds can't  pay and stay in jail until their case is heard.'' In other words, they  simply can't afford to make bail, and so they stay in jail, sometimes  for years. Not only is it costly to hold people for an extended period  of time prior to trial, but we know it has sometimes incentivized  people--people who were innocent of the crimes they were charged with-- to strike plea deals simply because they can't afford to pay the bail  and they can't afford to spend months or years away from their homes or  families.   Like many people in organizations, I have looked at Senator Sessions  record with respect to the issue of criminal justice reform, and it is  lacking in the need to find a bipartisan solution to what is recognized  across party lines as an important effort that we need to make-- criminal justice reform--because we know we have too many people who  are currently locked up for nonviolent offenses, including many  substance abuse offenses.   It makes no sense within our system to have the kind of mass  incarceration we have seen in our country, where we have 5 percent of  the world's population but 25 percent of the world's prison population.  There is a bipartisan recognition that justice demands we change that.  Unfortunately, I have not seen that recognition in the record of  Senator Sessions.   In remarks on the Senate floor in 2002, Senator Sessions also  criticized a Supreme Court ruling about the execution of people with  intellectual disabilities. The Court found that people who had  incredibly diminished intellectual capacity should not be executed-- that it violated the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual  punishment because these are individuals who could not form a capacity,  an intent--and that we should not execute people who did not form that  criminal intent, the mens rea. That was an advance in our Federal  jurisprudence, yet that was severely criticized by Senator Sessions. So  that statement, along with his position on IDEA and his opposition to  the convention on peoples with disabilities raises many, many troubling  questions regarding his willingness to protect individuals who need  protection.   We also recognize that the Attorney General has to be somebody who is  independent, who is willing to stand up to a President if a President  is calling upon the Justice Department to take an unlawful action or an  action inappropriate or inconsistent with the interests of justice.   In 1904, in a letter to the Attorney General, President Theodore  Roosevelt said:         Of all the officers of the Government, those of the       Department of Justice should be kept most free from any       suspicion of improper action on partisan or factional       grounds, so there shall be gradually a growth, even though a       slow growth, in the knowledge that . . . the representatives       of the Federal Department of Justice insist on meting out       even-handed justice to all.    Senator Sessions himself made the point when he questioned then- nominee Sally Yates about her responsibilities in the Justice  Department of President Obama. Senator Sessions told Ms. Yates:         You have to watch out because people will be asking you to       do things and you need to say no. You think the attorney       general has the responsibility to say ``no'' to the President       if he asks for something that's improper? A lot of people       have defended the Lynch nomination, for example, by saying,       ``Well, he appoints somebody who's is going to execute his       views. What's wrong with that?'' But if the views the       President wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney       general or the deputy attorney general say no?    That was the question posed by Senator Sessions.   Ms. Yates answered:         Senator, I believe the attorney general or the deputy       attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and the       Constitution and to give their independent legal advice to       the President.    That is exactly what she did. That is exactly what Deputy Attorney  General Yates did just a few days ago when President Trump asked her to  take an action which in her opinion was inconsistent with the laws of  the United States. She did what Senator Sessions asked her to do at  that hearing, and she was fired.   Let's look at the record of Senator Sessions' willingness to stand up  in an independent way to some of the outrageous statements that have  been made by President Trump.   After the terrorist attack in San Bernadino, CA, Mr. Trump called for  a ``total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States  until our country's representatives can figure out what . . . is going  on.''   He went on to reiterate his plans for a Muslim ban in a March 2016  CNN interview and a later speech. What did Senator Sessions do at that  important moment? At that time, Senator Sessions was an early supporter  of not only Mr. Trump but his call for a Muslim ban. Just days after  Candidate Trump first made his Muslim ban proposal, Senator Sessions  told Steve Bannon on Breitbart's radio program:         We're in an age that's very dangerous and we're seeing more       and more persons enter. And a lot of them have done terrorist       acts and a lot of them believe it's commanded by their       religion. So I think it's appropriate to begin to discuss       this [Muslim ban].    We all want the greatest security for our country. We all want to  make sure bad people don't get here. But I think we also understand as  Americans that a religious test violates the principles of our Nation.   Senator Leahy pointed out at Senator Sessions' confirmation hearing  that Senator Sessions opposed a resolution saying the United States  should not use religious tests for immigration into the country, that  they were antithetical to our founding principles. Nevertheless, when  it was time to be counted and stand up, Senator Sessions did not do  that.   More recently, we heard President Trump criticize the Washington  State judge--and I see our leader, my friend Senator Murray, on the  floor. He criticized the decision of a Federal district judge, and he  did it, as we know, in a dismissive way, tweeting that he was a ``so- called judge.'' That is another moment when--whether you support  President Trump and his campaign or you support his actions as  President, it is a moment when, if you are going to being the chief law  enforcement leader in the country, you say: Mr. President, really, that  is not an appropriate thing to say.   Senator Sessions had another opportunity to challenge then-Candidate  Trump on an earlier occasion when Candidate Trump criticized the judge  who made a ruling against him in the Trump University case and  criticized him on the grounds of his heritage. That was an opportunity  when others in this country, even people who were supporting Candidate  Trump, said: You know what, that is out of line. That is out of bounds.   We did not hear from Senator Sessions. Maybe Senator Sessions was  being looked at for another executive agency where that question was  less important, where maybe it wouldn't carry so much weight. But for  the Attorney General of the United States, we need somebody there who  is going to be independent, somebody who is going to be willing to  challenge the President of the United States when he  [[Page S933]]  suggests unlawful actions or makes statements that are inconsistent  with the system of justice.   Finally, on the issue of voter fraud, I think all of us have heard  from President Trump about his claim that he really won the popular  vote. We shouldn't even be here talking about it, but he keeps talking  about it. He claims that he really won the popular vote, that it was  these 3 million people who cast fraudulent ballots--zero evidence, no  evidence, and yet when Senator Franken asked Senator Sessions about  these claims of voter fraud, these unsubstantiated claims of massive  voter fraud, Senator Sessions didn't take the opportunity to say: You  know what, I support President Trump, but he is out of line; he is  wrong to make these outrageous claims. He didn't say that. In fact,  President Trump at one point was talking about having the Justice  Department or the FBI look into this very question.   I am not satisfied at all that Senator Sessions would meet his own  test--the test he presented to Sally Yates when she was up for her  nomination for Deputy Attorney General about whether she would stand up  to what she considered an unlawful order by the President of the United  States. She did. She was fired. There is no evidence that Senator  Sessions would stand up under those circumstances, and we need an  Attorney General who will stand up for the law and for equal justice  and for every American.   I yield the floor.
