 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the anniversary  of the tragic loss of a 55th Wing RC-135 Cobra Ball aircraft on the  remote island of Shemya, Alaska.   Forty years ago last month, Cobra Ball tail number 2664 crashed on  approach to Shemya Air Force Base, a rugged outpost on the far western  tip of the Aleutian Islands. Six brave American airmen perished in the  fiery crash that day, an eternal reminder of the cost of the Cold War  and the price of vigilance we too often take for granted.   The RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft--designated Cobra Ball--is  designed to rapidly collect telemetry and special intelligence on  ballistic missiles in flight. Throughout the Cold War and to the  present day, reconnaissance crews from the 55th Wing are dispatched on  short notice around the world to fly the RC-135 to gather technical  intelligence on weapons tests that cannot be obtained by any other  method. This information is used to verify treaty compliance and to  support the continuous development of America's strategic and theater  missile defense capabilities.   Throughout the Cold War, the Strategic Air Command kept the Cobra  Ball on a continuous 24-hour alert status on Shemya Island in the  northern Pacific, affectionately known as The Rock. Their job was to  launch at a moment's notice to keep a watchful eye on Soviet ballistic  missile tests conducted from the Kamchatka Peninsula.   On March 15, 1981, the 24 crewmembers on board the RC-135 tail number  61-2664 were en route to Shemya  [[Page H1744]]  from Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, where they had been waiting for  the weather at Shemya to clear. Blizzard conditions and extreme  crosswinds were ravaging the small exposed island. This weather was not  uncommon, just another day at the office for 55th Wing aircrew.  However, after receiving clearance to land, weather conditions  deteriorated rapidly.                                time  1045    Firsthand accounts from crewmembers onboard describe the violent  buffeting they experienced on descent as like being on the end of a yo- yo. The belly of the aircraft struck the edge of a cliff on the  approach end of the runway, shearing off the landing gear. As the  damaged aircraft slammed into the runway, engines three and four  exploded and the fuselage broke in half. Flames engulfed the crew  compartment as the disintegrating aircraft slid 2,000 feet, eventually  careening off the runway and down a hill.   The scene was chaotic as crewmembers worked to free themselves and  their teammates from the burning wreckage while the blizzard raged.  Miraculously, 18 crewmembers escaped from the flames that day. Their  bodies burned and broken, they worked feverishly to extract their  fellow airmen from the fiery wreckage.   In the end, six men died on that lonely airfield that day. Their  names were:   Major William Bennett,   Captain Larry Mayfield,   First Lieutenant Loren Ginter,   Master Sergeant Stephen Kish,   Staff Sergeant Steven Balcer, and   Staff Sergeant Harry Parsons, III.   We honor their service and their sacrifice and commend their spirit  to the Creator. We pray for their families and loved ones who cherish  their memory. We also honor the survivors of this tragic crash who will  forever bear the scars of their service and the memory of that day. May  we never forget what they gave to the cause of freedom, and that it was  the dedication of warriors like these that won the Cold War. And may we  pledge to honor their sacrifice by recommitting ourselves to eternal  vigilance in the defense of freedom.                            ____________________
