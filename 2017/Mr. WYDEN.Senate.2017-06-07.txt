 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to bring two  baskets of hemp products onto the floor of this body.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                          National Hemp History Week     Mr. President, this is National Hemp History Week, a  chance to recognize a product that has deep roots going way back in  America but faces some of the most anti-farmer, anti-job, unjustifiable  policies that are on the American legal books today. Because of its  relation to marijuana, hemp can't legally be grown in American fields.   Now, hemp is harmless. Hemp grown for industrial use simply does not  have marijuana psychoactive properties. You are going to get as high  off hemp as you will off a bag of vegetables. But, still, farmers in  Oregon and across the country can't legally grow it. So if America is  serious about banning harmless products like hemp, just because they  are related to drugs, then I have bad news for fans of poppy seed  muffins.   This is the third year I have come to the floor during this time-- National Hemp History Week--to talk about the importance of industrial  hemp, its huge economic potential for hard-working farmers, and the  indefensible ban that keeps so many American farmers from growing it.  As was the case before, I am joined by Malcolm McGeary from Southern  Oregon, where a lot of farmers have an interest in this, to showcase a  variety of hemp products in these baskets on the floor because, despite  the ban on growing hemp, you can legally import it for use in products  sold in stores across the country.   What really changed my mind on this was when my wife was pregnant--we  are older parents--with our third child, and we went into a Costco  store. We went into a Costco store on a weekend at home in Oregon, and  there were these big bags of hemp hearts, and it said: healthy, good  for the blood pressure, fiber--everything that one would expect in  Pennsylvania or Oregon. I know the Presiding Officer is one of the most  physically fit members of the body. I see him in the gym all the time  so he obviously cares a lot about nutrition. So Nancy and I were  walking through Costco, and it said this giant bag of hemp hearts could  be purchased there. You say to yourself: Let me see if I get this  straight. The hemp comes from Canada, so the farmers must just be  laughing all the way to the bank because they are making money. I get  what we do is we put it in bags, and it is sold in Costco. That led me  to the really intellectual concept of saying that if you can sell it at  a Costco in Oregon, why can't our farmers grow it? It is not much more  complicated than that.   When you are shopping for hemp products, it is not just potato sacks  and rough fabric by the yard. There is clothing, lotions and food, hemp  milk, nutritional supplements--all these products Mr. McGeary has--used  to make soaps, cleaners, and even deck stain. I understand Mr. McGeary  may even be wearing a hemp tie. None of these products can be called  100 percent American because every bit of the hemp in these baskets had  to be grown someplace else, which is essentially what I described as  the Wydens toured Costco at home.   When it was imported, it wasn't an American farmer earning money off  that sale. Despite the consumer demand for hemp products and the  ingenuity of so many producers who find uses for it, American farmers  are cut out of the hemp equation.   The ban on hemp is not anti-drug policy. I think that is what has  been confusing with respect to this issue. The ban on hemp is not going  to advance the cause of being against drugs. It is not anti-drug  policy. It is anti-farmer policy, and it is anti-American jobs policy.   As I indicated, if you can buy it in a local supermarket, the  American farmer ought to be able to grow it. Yet year after year,  despite a lot of work from Members on both sides of the aisle in this  body and in the House, hemp remains on the controlled substance list.   Hemp is not a drug. It is a big opportunity for our farmers. So it is  long past time to end these statutory relics of history that cut  American farmers out of a valuable market.   Despite the fact that hemp continues to be stigmatized by Federal  laws, there is some good news and progress. The 2014 farm bill began to  chip away at the Federal ban. It OK'd hemp research projects led by  universities and agriculture departments in States like Oregon and  Kentucky that take a smarter approach to hemp. These projects are  showing significant success. Farmers are ready to grow hemp, and  States' agriculture departments are ready to regulate.   The first steps, in my view, don't go far enough, and even some of  these early projects remain tied up in redtape due to the Federal ban.   In my view, the only real solution is a legislative solution. So here  we have a bipartisan coalition, the kind of coalition you see in the  U.S. Senate when people really look into the facts and Members decide  to make common cause. We have the good fortune of having the majority  leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, as one of our principal  sponsors; Senator Paul, his colleague; Senator Merkley; and I  reintroducing the Hemp Farming Act. We pursued this for a number of  years. I introduced it every Congress since 2011.   Last year, our bipartisan bill had more than a dozen Senate  cosponsors. This year, the goal is to again find common ground to  remove hemp from the schedule I controlled substance list, give the go- ahead to farmers across the country who are ready to grow industrial  hemp, and, once again, make it a true American crop.   I hope my colleagues will join in the effort to celebrate National  Hemp History Week. I hope they will use it to learn more about a very  versatile crop, a safe crop, and one with really extraordinary  potential to boost jobs in the economy, in our agricultural sector, and  our domestic employment base.   This is commonsense legislation. Again, we have the good fortune to  be led by the majority leader, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky,  Mr. McConnell. We will be introducing this commonsense legislation very  shortly.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Countering Iran's  Destabilizing Activities Act of 2017. For too long, a myopic focus on  the Iran deal blinded the United States to Iran's persistent campaign  to destabilize the Middle East and undermine America's national  security interests. Iran has been given a free pass to detain U.S.  sailors in clear violation of international law, conduct ballistic  missile tests in violation of the United Nations resolutions, support  terrorist groups across the region, and prop up the murderous Assad  regime in Syria.   It is long past time for the United States and the international  community to hold Iran accountable, not just for its commitments under  the nuclear deal but for its destabilizing behavior across the Middle  East. This legislation begins to do just that by imposing new sanctions  on Iran's ballistic missile program, applying terrorism sanctions to  the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, imposing sanctions on Iranians  engaged in human rights abuses, and tightening enforcement on arms  embargoes on the Iranian regime.   I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations  Committee, Senators Corker and Cardin, for ringing this bill to the  floor. They recognize that the United States must not stand idly by  when hostile regimes undermine and attack our interests and that of our  allies. They recognize that regimes that aid and abet crimes against  humanity must be held accountable. They recognize that weakness in the  face of aggression is provocative.   These are the reasons we must pass this legislation, but these are  also the very same reasons this legislation must be amended to  strengthen and expand sanctions against Vladimir Putin's Russia.   In just the last 3 years under Vladimir Putin, Russia has invaded  Ukraine, annexed Crimea, threatened NATO allies, and intervened  militarily in Syria,  [[Page S3315]]  leaving a trail of death, destruction, and broken promises in its wake.   Last year, Russia attacked the foundations of American democracy with  a cyber and information campaign to interfere in America's 2016  election. It has been 8 months now since the U.S. intelligence  community publicly concluded that the Russian Government had attempted  to interfere in our last Presidential election.   On October 7, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the  Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated that the ``U.S.  intelligence community is confident that the Russian government  directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and  institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.'' The  statement concluded that ``only Russia's senior-most officials could  have authorized these activities.''   On January 6, 2017, the U.S. intelligence community went even  further, concluding:         Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence       campaign in 2016 aimed at the United States presidential       election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in       the United States democratic process, denigrate Secretary       Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.    The intelligence community ``did not make an assessment of the impact  that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election,'' but  they did warn that ``Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin- ordered campaign aimed at the U.S. Presidential election to future  influence efforts worldwide, including against U.S. allies and their  election processes.''   Since January, months of congressional hearings, testimony, and  investigative work have reinforced these conclusions: that Russia  deliberately interfered in our recent election with cyber attacks and a  disinformation campaign designed to weaken America and undermine faith  in our democracy and our values.   Vladimir Putin's brazen attack on our democracy is a flagrant  demonstration of his disdain and disrespect for our Nation. This should  not just outrage every American, it should compel us to action. But in  the last 8 months, what price has Russia paid for attacking American  democracy? Hardly any at all: modest sanctions against a few Russian  individuals and entities, some Russian diplomats and spies sent home to  Russia, two spy compounds have closed, at least for now--and all of  this reversible and at the discretion of the President.   What has Russia's reaction been to America's tepid response and  reaction to its aggressive behavior? More of the same. More aggression,  more meddling. Russia attempted to overthrow the democratically elected  Government of Montenegro and murder its Prime Minister. Russia  attempted to interfere in France's election. We have already seen  attempts to influence German public opinion ahead of the elections in  September, and there is every expectation that Russia will do the same  thing in the Czech Republic, Italy, and elsewhere in future elections.    Sooner or later, my friends, there will be another American election  that captures Russian attention and interest. The victim may be a  Republican or a Democrat. To Putin, it won't matter because his targets  are not Republicans or Democrats but Americans and all that we stand  for as a people. He seeks to sow dissent amongst us and divide us from  one another, to erode our resolve to resist his dark and dangerous view  of the world, and to undermine our confidence in ourselves and our  belief in our own values.   We must take our own side in this fight--not as Republicans, not as  Democrats, but as Americans. It is time to respond to Russia's attack  on American democracy with strength and resolve, with common purpose,  and with action. Together with Senator Graham and a number of other  Senators, I am prepared to offer an amendment to this legislation that  will begin to do just that. It incorporates some of the best ideas from  different pieces of legislation already introduced in the Senate, ideas  that have broad bipartisan support.   The amendment we are talking about would impose mandatory sanctions  on transactions with the Russian defense or intelligence sectors,  including the FSB and the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency  that was primarily responsible for Russia's attack on our election.   The amendment would impose mandatory visa bans and asset freezes on  any individual who undermines the cyber security of public or private  infrastructure and democratic institutions. It would impose mandatory  sanctions on those who assist or support such activities.   The amendment would codify existing sanctions on Russia by placing  into law five Executive orders signed by President Obama in response to  both Russian interference in the 2016 election and its illegal actions  in Ukraine, and it would take new steps to tighten those sanctions. For  example, Russia's ability to issue new sovereign debt essentially  allows Russia to borrow money from global capital markets to offset  pressure from existing U.S. and European sanctions. So this amendment  would impose mandatory sanctions on U.S. and third-party investment in  sales of Russian sovereign debt as well as in the privatization of  Russian state-owned assets.   The amendment would target the Russian energy sector, which is  controlled by Vladimir Putin's cronies, with sanctions on investments  in Russian petroleum and natural gas development as well as Russian  energy pipelines.   We also need to put additional pressure on the ability of Putin and  his cronies to move money they have looted from the Russian state. So  this amendment would mandate that the Secretary of the Treasury  establish a high-level task force within the Department's Financial  Crimes Enforcement Network that would focus on tracing, mapping, and  prosecuting illicit financial flows linked to Russia if such flows  interact with the U.S. financial system. The task force would also work  with liaison officers in key U.S. Embassies, especially in Europe, to  work with local authorities to uncover and prosecute the networks  responsible for the illicit Russian financial flows.   Finally, recognizing that Russia seeks to undermine not just American  democracy but Western democracy altogether, this amendment would  provide support to the State Department, the Global Engagement Center,  and USAID to help build the resilience of democratic institutions in  Europe against Russian aggression exerted through corruption,  propaganda, and other forms of political interference.   We need a strong Russia sanctions amendment. We need it now. We need  it on this piece of legislation. We need this amendment because we have  no time to waste. The United States of America needs to send a strong  message to Vladimir Putin and any other aggressor that we will not  tolerate attacks on our democracy. There is no greater threat to our  freedoms than attacks on our ability to choose our own leaders free  from foreign interference. So we must act accordingly, and we must act  now.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, Senator Merkley and I have come today  together to discuss our resolution honoring the heroes of the Portland  attack. On May 26 in Portland, our hometown, our community lost two  very brave people: Ricky Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche. They  stood up courageously against terrorism and for core American and  Oregon values of tolerance and freedom.   Along with Micah David-Cole Fletcher, who was seriously injured,  these three extraordinary Samaritans stepped in to protect two girls  who were being terrorized on public transit by a man menacing them  because he thought they were Muslim. These three Oregon heroes did not  run when they saw danger. Instead, these three advanced toward the  danger.   I paid my respects last week at the beautiful memorial that my fellow  Portlanders created at the transit station where this attack occurred.  I can assure my colleagues that the message of the memorial could not  be more clear: The heroes of Portland stood up to terror, and we ought  to be willing to call out the hate and the evil they confronted.   So today, I join with our friend and colleague Senator Merkley to  express  [[Page S3344]]  our deepest condolences to the families, the friends of the victims, so  that we can all make clear how much we appreciate them and how grateful  we are--and we all are--to be able to stand with the two girls who were  being terrorized and to support all community efforts to overcome  hatred and bigotry and violence.   As a son of parents who fled the Nazis, I know full well what hate  speech is all about. There must be zero tolerance for hate speech and  violence because otherwise you give it room to fester and grow. Hate  speech and violence must have no place in Oregon or anywhere else in  our great Nation.   With these three Oregon heroes forever in our memories, we must and  we will recommit to fighting hate, violence, and terrorism every chance  that we have. We urge adoption of this important resolution.   I yield to my friend and colleague Senator Merkley.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
