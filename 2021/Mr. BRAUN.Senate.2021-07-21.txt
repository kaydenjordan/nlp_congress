 Mr. President, I rise here today to give emphasis to  something I think is very important--it has been done basically  annually--and that is talking about our Pledge of Allegiance. It is an  expression of patriotism and commitment to our great Nation.   The United States is a symbol of freedom around the world. It is a  beacon for ``the land of opportunity.''   Today, let's reaffirm our allegiance to the United States. I urge my  colleagues to pass this annual resolution that simply expresses support  for our Pledge of Allegiance.   This resolution was first raised by Senator Tom Daschle back in 2002  and passed without objection. Now, nearly 20 years later, this  resolution is probably more important than ever.   We have seen countless attacks on our flag and the values it  represents. The American flag is a symbol of hope and perseverance  across the world. Whether in Cuba, Hong Kong, or Venezuela, those  suffering under tyrannical regimes proudly wave the American flag in  protest.   The U.S. Senate must stand in support of the Pledge of Allegiance,  one of our most powerful expressions of national unity.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 309, submitted  earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,  the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    I yield the floor.  [[Page S5006]]                                ____________________
