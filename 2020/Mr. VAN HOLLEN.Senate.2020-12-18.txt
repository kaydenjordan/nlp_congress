 I thank my colleague. First, section 702 references  how NASA should select multi-institution consortia and university  affiliated research centers, inserting Congress into an agency-specific  process that is broadly governed by existing authorities in title 5 and  title 41 of the U.S. Code, which make such selections based on  technical merit alone and not political influence. We are deeply  concerned about the committee's explicit delineation of this authority  for NASA, given that such authority already exists and NASA currently  does not have any university affiliated research centers so designated.  We believe that such language should never become law as it implies  that Congress is trying to force NASA to establish such a center or  consortia even though NASA does not see the need for one.   Second, sections 818 and 819 call for short order reports from NASA  on creating a Space Resources Institute and Center for Space Weather  Technology that could allow NASA to bypass extensive consultation with  the scientific and aerospace communities and without the benefit of  independent peer review under the auspices of the National Academy of  Sciences.   These are the concerns my colleague and I have.    Mr. President, I rise to honor my colleague and good  friend, Senator Tom Udall, who will be retiring from the Senate at the  end of this Congress. Tom has been a forceful advocate for the people  of New Mexico, a champion for all Americans, and a guardian of our  Nation's public lands and our democracy. It has been my privilege to  partner with him, both in the House and Senate, over the past 17 years.   Tom's family roots were grown from American history. Generations ago,  his ancestors traveled west and settled on the American frontier.  Although centuries have passed since those early pioneers, Tom's deep  connection to our country's rich history hasn't waned. He holds deep  respect for the communities that treasured the American landscape long  before his family arrived, and Tom has championed the cause of Tribal  sovereignty throughout his career. As vice chair of the Senate Indian  Affairs Committee, he fought to ensure that our country fulfills its  obligations to indigenous Tribes. His commitment to this cause reminds  us, as lawmakers, that the government has a responsibility to respect  the rights of all communities from coast to coast.   His personal link to the American experiment has also nourished a  passion for conserving our natural inheritance. In the House, I was  proud to work with him on bolstering our Nation's renewable energy  infrastructure. In the Senate, I have been privileged to serve with him  on the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior and Environment. He  has been an advocate for supporting the Chesapeake Bay in my home State  of Maryland and helped us secure a historic increase in funding to the  Chesapeake Bay Program. Senator Udall's pioneering work in these arenas  has rallied colleagues around the cause of protecting our environment,  culminating this August with the passage of the Great American Outdoors  Act. His tireless efforts to preserve America's natural heritage will  live on through the clean water and clean air that he helped safeguard  for generations to come. But Tom knew well that preserving our  environment must go hand-in-hand with defending our planet against  climate change. His landmark bill on renewable energy standards offers  a model for the type of rigorous approach we can take to cut carbon  emissions and address this global threat.   Senator Udall's commitment to keeping our planet healthy has been  equal in force to his mission of keeping our democracy healthy.  Throughout his career, Tom promoted the notion that we need structural  change in our institutions if we want to move our country forward. He  and I worked together on campaign finance reform to help insulate our  elections from the influence of special interests and big corporations  and have fought to reform financing for Presidential elections and the  FEC. In Washington, he has been a vocal critic of government inaction  and proposed rule fixes to remedy congressional paralysis, both while  in the minority and in the majority. His calls for change have  challenged this body to act on institutional adjustments that could  help us get more done for the American people.   But beyond these achievements, one of Tom's greatest contributions to  the Senate is the way in which he has made this Chamber a kinder place.  His warm temperament and humble nature exemplify the character of a  true public servant--someone who is here to do good work on behalf of  their constituents, not stroke their own ego. He has stayed grounded  and honored those whom he serves, always looking to move our country  forward. In his farewell address, Senator Udall reminded us that  disagreements in politics shouldn't get in the way of progress. Tom  lives and breathes this bedrock principle and has always extended a  hand to those across the aisle in order to deliver for the American  people. Although he is now headed back West to return to the place that  made him, he is leaving a lasting legacy of collaboration and success  that cannot be undone.   Thank you, Tom, for your dedication to this body and to our country,  and I wish you and your family the best in the years ahead.    Mr. President, today I rise to honor my dear friend  and colleague, Senator Doug Jones of Alabama.   Doug Jones is fearless. He cuts against the grain, shrugging off  critics to chart his own path rooted in deeply held principles of  justice, virtue, and equality. After law enforcement had failed to  prosecute civil rights cases for decades, Doug Jones successfully  brought a measure of justice to the families of the four girls killed  in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. When skeptics claimed there  was no chance of him winning a Senate race in Alabama, Doug Jones  stayed the course and clinched an upset victory. And despite having  seen some of his own colleagues shy away from addressing controversial  issues in this Chamber, Doug Jones stood up for what he knew was right,  from his very first speech in the Senate when he delivered a moving  address on the threat of gun violence.   But despite his tenacity, Senator Jones has never stopped leading  with compassion--compassion for his colleagues, compassion for the  people of Alabama, and compassion for all Americans. Like his personal  role model, Atticus Finch, Senator Jones abides by the principle that  in order to know someone else truly and fully, you need to ``climb in  his skin and walk around in it.'' And it is that empathy that has led  Senator Jones to champion unity over division. My seat is near Doug's  here on the Senate floor, and we sat together during the impeachment  trial. Even during one of the darkest moments in our country's history,  Doug maintained faith in our better angels. When the trial of the  President came to a close, Senator Jones issued a call for unity,  saying, ``We must find a way to come together, to set aside partisan  differences, and to focus on what we have in common as Americans.'' He  looked forward, past the tension consuming Washington and toward  brighter days ahead. That is Doug. That is how he works.   From the time I chaired the DSCC during then-Candidate Jones' run for  Senate in Alabama, to our years together in this Chamber, I have always  admired his desire to put country first, follow his conscience, and  value principle over politics. He is a man of enormous integrity-- someone who never forgot who sent him to the Senate, someone who always  worked to get results, and someone who achieved more in just a few  years than many Senators do in multiple terms.   I was proud to work with Senator Jones on the passage of the FUTURE  Act, which provided permanent funding for historically Black colleges  and universities. His commitment to that cause has directly benefitted  the four proud HBCUs in my State of Maryland, and the bill is a step  forward in the fight for equity in higher education. I am also grateful  for Senator Jones's work to end the military widow's tax, which  prevented military spouses from receiving the full benefits they  deserved. Senator Jones was a champion for the widows who had lived for  too long with broken promises. He was principled, persistent, and got  the job done.   Doug Jones is a model public servant, someone the American people can  look up to and admire. His absence will be deeply felt in the U.S.  Senate, but I know that just because he will depart the Nation's  Capital on January 3 doesn't mean his role in this fight is over.  Service is in his bones, plain and simple. It has been a profound honor  and privilege to serve alongside him. Thank you, Doug--thank you for  all you have done for our country, and I want to extend my warmest  thoughts and wishes to you, your wife Louise, your three children, and  your grandchildren on behalf of a deeply grateful nation.    Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my friends  and colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle who are departing  the Senate at the conclusion of this Congress. Although we might not  have always seen eye-to-eye on every issue, I am proud to have worked  with them on finding solutions to the many challenges facing the  American people.   On January 3, when the new Congress is sworn in, we will be missing  among our ranks a stalwart advocate for the people of Wyoming who has  valiantly served in the U.S. Senate for 23 years, Mike Enzi. Senator  Enzi's service to this body has been defined both by a commitment to  principle and a willingness to find common ground. Mike believed fully  that our focus in Washington must always be on crafting legislation,  not making headlines. He took a low-ego approach to lawmaking and  prized delivering results over fomenting conflict. On many occasions,  he extended a hand to those working on the other side of the aisle,  including the late great Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, with whom he  collaborated in crafting the bipartisan Sarbanes-Oxley Act. I was  privileged to serve with Senator Enzi on the Senate Budget Committee,  and despite our differences, he always made an effort to treat me and  others on the committee with kindness, as a true professional and a  gentleman. His infamous ``80 percent tool''--the notion that all of us  can agree on 80 percent of the issues 80 percent of the time--will  continue to remind us on Capitol Hill of the capacity for Congress to  come together on the issues that matter. I wish him the best in the  years to come.   I am also sad to say goodbye to my neighbor in the Senate Hart  Building and a veteran of this Chamber, Senator Pat Roberts, who is  retiring after four decades serving his home State of Kansas in the  U.S. Congress. Although Senator Roberts has had a storied career in  Washington, all of us know that his first love was the U.S. Marine  Corps. Pat Roberts took what he learned in the Armed Forces of  humility, friendship, and cooperation and brought those values with him  to Washington. As a lawmaker, Senator Roberts has led with good humor  and grace. I was honored to serve with him on the Senate Agriculture  Committee, where we worked together on the 2018 farm bill to enhance  provisions to help farmers clean up the Chesapeake Bay, correct an  inequity in how our 1890 HBCUs spend Federal funds, and support our  Nation's minority and veteran farmers. I was also pleased that he  joined me in introducing a bill that would fully fund the IDEA in order  to support our schools and ensure a first-rate education for children  with disabilities. His tireless commitment to promoting comity and  camaraderie in this body demonstrated that kindness often precedes  compromise. I salute the years of service he has given in the defense  of our Nation and the promotion of the common good. And I say directly  to my colleague and friend, Pat Roberts: semper fi and Godspeed.   But of those departing the Congress this year, few rival the  erudition, warmth, and spirit of Senator Lamar Alexander. He is a true  renaissance man, who excelled in the academy as president of the  University of Tennessee, served our country first as Governor, then as  Senator, and has entertained scores of captivated listeners with his  skills at a piano. Those of us in the U.S. Senate who have had the  distinct pleasure of working with Lamar Alexander recognize his talent  for building consensus and reaching across the aisle to hammer out real  solutions to the problems facing the American people. I am particularly  grateful for his work on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources, leading the charge to publish a report on our Nation's  competitiveness in science and technology. That report, ``Rising Above  the Gathering Storm,'' produced findings that have been vital to the  promotion of increased funding for science and STEM education in my  [[Page S7710]]  State of Maryland and across the country. And his leadership in  shepherding through the Great American Outdoors Act has allowed for  serious investments in our Nation's public lands, our conservation  efforts, and our outdoor economy. Senator Alexander's commitment to  bridge-building presents a model for how the U.S. Congress can come  together, despite the nature of these divisive times. He will be dearly  missed.   Lastly, I would like to extend a warm farewell to my colleague  Senator Cory Gardner from the great State of Colorado. Cory Gardner and  I first met in the House of Representatives in 2011. I had just started  my fifth term representing Maryland in the House, and then-Congressman  Gardner was being sworn in for the first time as the Member from  Colorado's fourth. We got to know each other even better in 2017, when  I joined the U.S. Senate and served as the chair of the Democratic  Senatorial Campaign Committee opposite Senator Gardner, who was  chairing the National Republican Senatorial Committee. We didn't always  agree on how best to move our country forward, but I have no doubt in  my mind that Senator Gardner has served our country with unceasing  optimism and love for his State. He possesses a profound and deep  respect for our Nation's history and institutions. I send my best to  him and his family.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to recognize an extraordinary  member of my staff who retired from the Senate earlier this year, Karen  Robb.   For 15 years, Karen Robb served as a critical senior member of my  staff, first in my House office and then in the Senate. Karen is a  trusted adviser, skilled leader, and wonderful friend. Over the years  she has been a key partner in many of our successful legislative  initiatives and was a tireless advocate for the people of Maryland. A  humble and committed public servant, Karen is driven by her deep-rooted  values and a strong commitment to public service and the institution of  the Congress.   Karen was already a seasoned pro on Capitol Hill when she joined my  team as chief of staff in the House of Representatives office 15 years  ago. She had previously served as Deputy Assistant to President Clinton  in the Office of Legislative Affairs, chief of staff to Senator John  Edwards, democratic staff director for the Senate Judiciary Committee  under then-Senator Joe Biden, and chief counsel to Senator Dennis  DeConcini. Her extensive experience in both the legislative and  executive branches helped us achieve significant victories for Maryland  and pass priorities important to the American people.   An attorney, Karen has always identified first as a policy wonk with  particularly deep knowledge of the judiciary, and I drafted her into  becoming an expert on campaign finance reform and election issues. She  worked with Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21 and other reformers to  change the political finance system through legislation and the courts.  Karen worked tirelessly to help draft the Lobbying Transparency Act,  legislation I introduced to shine a light on lobbyist bundling of  political contributions that ultimately became law as part of an ethics  reform package. Many Members of Congress opposed the effort, but it was  the right thing to do, and with the support of Speaker Pelosi, it  passed in the House, while Senators Obama and Feingold pushed it  through in the Senate.   After the Supreme Court's notorious decision in Citizens United v.  Federal Election Commission, we worked for  [[Page S7712]]  months to write and pass the DISCLOSE Act in the House of  Representatives. The DISCLOSE Act is based on the idea that voters have  a right to know what individuals and interests are financing the  political advertisements trying to influence their votes. It was  vigorously opposed by deep-pocketed special interests that prefer to  operate in the dark and hide behind front organizations, but Karen kept  at it. She spent countless hours negotiating every comma and  definition. With perseverance, we succeeded in eking out a victory of  219 to 206 in the House. The Senate version failed by one vote, and we  have been trying to pass it here ever since.   Karen helped us pass legislation protecting whistleblowers who put  their careers at risk to expose wrongdoing--an issue that has become  even more important in recent years. She recognized that the success of  our democracy depends on people's willingness to speak truth to power,  and it is our job to advance the truth for the public good.   During my time in the House, Karen served in a number of key roles,  including as policy director of my Assistant to the Speaker's Office,  where she accompanied me to all the House leadership meetings as well  as the House-Senate bicameral leadership meetings. She always had good  insights and was respected by all. Karen also served as counsel on the  House Budget Committee during the time I was the ranking member on the  committee and played an important role during my participation in the  bipartisan budget negotiations headed by then-Vice President Biden.  During our tenure on the House Budget Committee, House Democrats  proposed budgets to expand economic opportunity for all, strengthen  Medicare and Social Security, put our country on a path for strong jobs  and wage growth, and much more. She was at the center of these efforts  and understood that budgets are more than just lists of programs and  tabulations of dollars and cents--they represent the priorities and  values of the American people.   Upon arriving in the Senate, Karen's deep roots in the Upper Chamber  got us off to a quick start. She set up our office and had an insider's  knowledge of how to navigate many of the Senate's byzantine traditions  and processes. With her wise guidance, we were able to achieve much for  Marylanders in a short time.   Karen's love for the twists and turns of lawmaking and politics is  surpassed only by her love of children and animals--her first stop  after leaving our office was the Nyumbani AIDS orphanage in Kenya,  where she has served as a guardian angel for many years. She has helped  to raise funds for supplies for the orphanage while taking a direct  personal interest in the children who live there, sharing photos and  stories and delighting in their growth and progress. Karen's charitable  efforts have never been abstract--she has personally hauled supplies on  her trips to Nyumbani, and, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, she  jumped in her car and drove to New Orleans to help rescue and rehome  animals. While a loss to the Senate, Karen's retirement gives her more  time to spend on the many causes close to her heart, including to her  continued service on the Nyumbani board of directors.   Karen Robb was not a bystander to any project she embarked on. She  was hands-on, all in, and whatever it takes. From the smallest detail  to the biggest obstacle, she threw herself into her work and our lives.  She is a compassionate person who always puts others first. My family  and I will be forever grateful for Karen's friendship, many talents,  and loyal service. Our entire team will miss her and the wisdom she  brought to the often-hectic world of congressional offices. I wish her  the very best as she embarks on her new adventures.                            ____________________
