 Mr. Speaker, I am so very proud to announce that the  House Committee on Veterans' Affairs once again authorized the Women  Veterans Task Force, which has been instrumental in helping Congress  develop and pass impactful legislation that is greatly improving the  lives of women veterans across the country.   Since its establishment in 2019, the task force has built a powerful  women veterans outreach network through convening bipartisan meetings  with community advocates, veterans service organizations, stakeholders,  and individual veterans.   The Deborah Sampson Act, the task force's signature achievement and  one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation for women veterans  in our history, is the result of this direct insight.   The authorization of the task force will further advance our mission  to increase the visibility of women veterans and promote inclusivity  and true equity for the 2 million women who have served our Nation in  uniform.   As chair of the Women Veterans Task Force, I am proud to continue our  work to recognize the service and sacrifice of America's women  veterans.                            ____________________
