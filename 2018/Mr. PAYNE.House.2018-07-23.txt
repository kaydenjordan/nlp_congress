 Mr. Speaker, it is still going on. The Trump  administration is still holding thousands of little children in jails  across this country in cages, cyclone fencing, cages.   These are babies and toddlers, preschoolers and adolescents. Their  only crime is their desire to breathe free.   And just when you think the pit of the Trump administration's soul  could get no darker, heartbreaking reports emerge from inside these so- called detention facilities.   These children are prohibited from touching one another. No hugs, not  even from their siblings. They can't run around. They have to wake up  at unreasonably early hours, with their jailers banging and making  noise as if it is Alcatraz, for everyone to get out of bed.   Some of these children only get 1 hour to play outside a day. They  are being held in strip malls and abandoned motels.   Some are banned from sending mail to their siblings. Others have  scrubbed toilets or handled bags of unsanitary used toilet paper.   Mr. Speaker, these so-called detention facilities are nothing more  than jails for children, baby jails. Let's end this madness.                            ____________________
