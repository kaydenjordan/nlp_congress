 Mr. Speaker, well, I saw an extraordinary clip of  President Trump at a fundraising event where he is accusing the  intelligence agents who rightly reported his conduct of committing  treason.   Let's see. Russia has invaded Ukraine, Ukraine is dependent upon the  United States for military assistance to defend itself, Trump is  withholding the aid, at the same time asking them for dirt on his  political opponent.   He is jeopardizing the national security interests of the United  States.   If anybody is committing treason, and I believe that is an  impeachable offense, it is the President of the United States, Donald  Trump.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 591, I call up  the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 54) relating to a national emergency  declared by the President on February 15, 2019, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on S.J. Res. 54.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the President has declared a national emergency so that  he can divert funds from the Pentagon and other agencies to deal with  the national emergency on the border. The largest diversion of funds is  going into a wall.   The President says the emergency is mostly about the smuggling of  drugs. Interesting.   As we know from testimony when Carlos Guzman was tried and convicted  in New York, a big drug lord from Mexico, his hench-people and others  testified that the cartels don't use people with backpacks through  remote areas of the desert. That is too inefficient for a multibillion- dollar business.   What they do is send trucks, which they have modified, semis, through  our border control points, where we only inspect 6 percent of the  trucks, so they lose one every once in a while. So what? With tens of  millions of dollars, it doesn't matter to them. It is just the cost of  doing business, kind of like taxes.   What is the President doing about the border control points? Nothing.  We are not buying the new technology we need and reconfiguring them so  that we can inspect every truck that comes across the border.   They have another way of getting the drugs in, which they are using  more and more and more. That is that they use semi-submersibles and  other boats and ships to smuggle the drugs around, on the coasts of the  United States.   The Coast Guard is our prime line of defense against this. The  retired last Commandant of the Coast Guard said that we have actionable  intelligence on 80 percent of the drug shipments coming into the United  States, but the Coast Guard only has resources to intercept 20 percent.   Just last week, the Coast Guard intercepted a semi-submersible that  had 12,000 pounds of cocaine on it. That would be a heck of a lot of  people with backpacks coming across the border, as the President  alleges--no, that is not the way they do it--worth over $165 million.   What is the President doing? He is diverting money from the Coast  Guard to the physical, land-based border and saying that somehow this  is going to help us stop the drug shipments.   Here is the Coast Guard with a prior drug shipment that they  intercepted. Now, they just intercepted another.   We have all seen the videos of them jumping onto these semi- submersibles out in the middle of the Pacific, with 6- to 8-foot  swells, jumping on there and stopping and arresting these people.   What is the President doing? He is cutting the Coast Guard's  capability of doing this.   Back to the border. Again, there are a few things we could be doing.   Oh, look, there is something just like what the President wants, a  big, tall fence with slats. People seem to be climbing over it.   Here is the border control point. Six percent of these vehicles will  be inspected.   Here is a tunnel under it.   There is a drone over it.   Some of these people are really ingenious. They even are imitating  the Middle Ages, using catapults to throw drugs over where there is an  existing wall.   Here we are, cutting $6 billion from the Pentagon for critical needs  of the Pentagon for housing where troops are living in mold-infested  barracks, for training facilities for the National Guard, for  firefighting facilities on our military bases, and from daycare centers  for our troops' kids. And we don't pay these troops a heck of a lot of  money; they can't afford to send their kids off base to daycare.   The President says all that stuff is going to be cut because we have  to build his stupid wall, which isn't even targeting the way drugs are  really brought into the United States of America. This is just an  abysmally stupid waste of money, but he is delivering on a campaign  promise.   Oh, wait a minute. Mexico is going to pay. Who is going to pay?  Mexico. Who is going to pay? Mexico.   Then he had a phone call with the President of Mexico saying: I know  you are not going to pay it--we have this transcript, too--but you  can't say publicly you are not going to pay for it. We are going to pay  for it.   The taxpayers of the United States are going to pay for his stupid,  useless wall, cutting essential things from the Coast Guard, which does  real, dangerous work every day intercepting drugs; cutting funds from  the military, which needs these facilities for their troops, troop  morale, and the safety and security of our troops. All for a stupid  wall.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), the chair of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Brown), a member of the committee of jurisdiction.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just in quick response to the gentleman, as I pointed  out earlier, first off, the immigrants attempting to come to the United  States seeking asylum or otherwise are walking up to border control  points. They are not sneaking across the desert. Building a wall will  do nothing.   As I pointed out earlier, drugs are not being smuggled in backpacks  through the desert. We know they are coming by sea, and we know they  are coming through our border control points; and we know we don't have  the technology nor the personnel necessary to stop them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the remaining time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just in quick response to my colleague from North  Carolina, a member of the committee of jurisdiction, the Coast Guard  has interdicted more drugs than all of the other Federal agencies  combined, yet they say they are only acting on 20 percent of them. So  that is a pretty big hole.   But the second thing is, she is right. We are not interdicting very  many drugs at the points of entry because we only inspect 6 percent of  the semis with high technology. And Guzman's buddies said: That is how  we bring it in. We put fake floors in the semis, and we are bringing  tons of drugs across.   He is right. We are not intercepting them because we don't have the  personnel and we don't have the technology.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Castro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Brownley).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to again inquire as to the  time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I just would comment, the gentleman just  said it is insignificant--or whatever--because he just demeaned a  childcare center for the troops at Andrews, and he heard about the  conditions that those children are living under: sewage, mold, and  collapsed roof, but he doesn't think that is necessary for the troops  or the troops' kids.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   On his last rejoinder, my good friend and colleague said that the  President said something about declaring an emergency.   Well, the President says an awful lot of things that he doesn't do,  so I don't know how we were supposed to give credibility to that.   He said Mexico--he said, probably a hundred times, maybe more than a  hundred times: ``Mexico is going to pay for the wall.''   ``Who is going to pay for the wall?''   ``Mexico.''   I mean, he got cheers. He just would brighten up, this was so  wonderful.   But, of course, that is not happening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I believe I have the right to close. I have  no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, I have the right to  close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   Well, again, in response to my good friend, the President said  hundreds of times: Mexico is going to pay for the wall. They are not.   We have the transcript of the phone call where he called the new  President of Mexico and said: Look, I know you are not going to pay for  the wall, but you can't say that. We are going to pay for it.   So, that is one thing.   Also, he talked about moving the Embassy to Jerusalem. The President  was going to deliver a peace plan for the Middle East. Where is it?   There are a lot of things this President said he was going to do that  haven't happened.   Getting close to the President is sort of like being in the orbit of  a black hole, which sucks in everything. And that sucked in a lot of  things and a lot of people who have been, then, blown back out at some  point by the President.                                time  1030    His current Acting Chief of Staff--I don't know how long he has been  acting now; a year, a year and half, something like that. The President  likes them to be acting because he can get rid of them more easily, he  thinks.   When he had his own opinions, when he wasn't in the orbit of the  black hole of Donald Trump, he said about walls, Mick Mulvaney, the  President's acting Chief of Staff: ``You go under, you go around, you  go through. What they need is more manpower and more technology.''  Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said that August 25, 2015, when he  had his own opinions, when he worked here in the United States House of  Representatives. He can't have his own opinions anymore.   He thought a wall was stupid then and it wouldn't do anything. And he  said what we have been saying; we inspect six percent of the semi- tractor trailers that roll across the border, and we have testimony in  the conviction of a drug lord, Joaquin Guzman, in New York, we have  testimony in that trial. They are bringing the drugs in in just  boatloads, or truckloads, boatloads--we already talked about the Coast  Guard--and truckloads across the border because we only inspect a  fraction of them.   So what if they lose a few? Hundreds of millions of dollars; that is  the cost of doing business. This is a multi-billion-dollar business,  these cartels.   And as Mick Mulvaney said in an honest moment, we need manpower. We  already heard that they have only got four people at the border  crossing in Arizona.   Why do they only have four people? We have appropriated more money  for more Border Patrol people consistently, year in, year out. But they  are way behind in their numbers. They haven't been able to hire up to  the numbers we have authorized.   And technology, which is what I am talking about, they don't have  that either.   There is also--I mean, you know, people over there are pooh-poohing  child care centers for the troops in the military and things like that.  They don't need it. Their kids don't need it. Really?   And then also the President is taking hundreds of millions of dollars  out of the European defense initiative.   I have been to Poland recently, and I have seen the Suwalki Corridor.  That is the Russian invasion route into Europe. For years it was the  Fulda Gap, but now it is the Suwalki Corridor since Germany is  reunified.   And we are going to cancel projects in countries to defend that area  and give them better capability to defend themselves against the  Russian invasion.   But since Vlad--that is Mr. Putin, whatever dictators are called in  Russia--is buddies with the President; they have secret phone calls,  secret conversations that aren't transcribed, the President is  withholding money from Ukraine to defend itself.   And now we are going to cut money for our allies, the European  defense initiative, to build a stupid, useless wall on the border.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
