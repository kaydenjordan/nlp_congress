The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent the Fourth District of Kansas.  My hometown, Wichita, Kansas, is proud to be known as The Air Capital  of the World.   Over 100 years ago, Clyde Cessna began manufacturing planes outside  of Wichita. Since then, Wichita has grown to be the leading center for  aviation manufacturing around the world. In fact, 67 percent of the  world's embedded general aviation fleet is manufactured in Kansas. We  are proud of the work we do in Wichita, and general aviation has a good  home in Kansas.   I worked for many years in the general aviation industry as a process  improvement engineer. That is why I am putting forward this important  piece of legislation that will help ensure general aviation remains  safe and secure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3669, the Securing  General Aviation and Commercial Charter Air Carrier Service Act.   General aviation, which includes all noncommercial flights and  commercial charters, accounts for nearly two-thirds of all towered  operations in the United States. This does not account for the  thousands of untowered operations in the United States that are only  served by the general aviation community.   However, general aviation and commercial charter air service  represent a small fraction of TSA's stakeholder community, causing  their issues and concerns to fall to the bottom of the agency's  priorities. This bill seeks to elevate some of these important but  often overlooked security issues. The general aviation community has  important safety concerns that deserve to be heard and acted upon by  TSA.   Commercial charters are forced to use antiquated and unsecure systems  to ensure their passengers' safety. Currently, the software needed to  connect to TSA's Secure Flight system for vetting passengers costs tens  of thousands of dollars. Commercial airlines serving 2\1/2\ million  passengers a day can easily adopt the software; However, smaller  operators do not have the passenger volume to absorb the cost.   Currently, TSA emails commercial charter operators large datasets in  spreadsheet format that their operators must then check against  passenger manifests. This unsecure method presents a serious security  risk for this data, which could include sensitive personal information.   I have heard from commercial charter operators that access to the  Secure Flight system is a top priority so that they can ensure the  safety of the airspace and their passengers. TSA should explore  creating a web-based program that these operators could access that  would have realtime passenger vetting information and would prevent the  unintended distribution of sensitive security information.   Currently, private charter air carriers must use their own flight  crews or private screening companies to screen passengers. In certain  instances, these carriers would like to occasionally use on- or off- duty TSA agents to screen passengers due to the expertise and training  that these agents possess. However, when private charters are performed  on short notice, carriers are unable to bring off-duty TSA screeners  into their own program due to certain FAA regulations. Language in this  bill would allow private charters the flexibility to request and pay  for this service without cost to the taxpayer.   Additionally, the Aviation Security Advisory Committee has approved  several recommendations regarding improvements to security rules and  regulations for general aviation and commercial charter air carrier  programs. These important recommendations have yet to be implemented by  TSA. This legislation requires TSA to develop an implementation plan  and  [[Page H9770]]  timeline in which to execute these outstanding recommendations.   The final issue this bill addresses is a lack of a full-time subject  matter expert at TSA to interact with general aviation stakeholders and  handle general aviation security issues. The industry has been forced  to rely on individuals who are often given this portfolio temporarily  and struggles to find a reliable point of contact for matters that  arise. This bill authorizes the appointment of a full-time employee to  handle this portfolio, thus giving the industry a knowledgeable and  reliable liaison with TSA.   General aviation and the commercial air charter industry are  important components of the aviation community. I believe that their  important safety concerns deserve to be heard and acted upon by TSA.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his help and assistance. I urge  all Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Katko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Katko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Katko).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The question is on the  motion offered by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3669, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
