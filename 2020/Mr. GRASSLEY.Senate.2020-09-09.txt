 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, this year has been one of the most  challenging years for Iowa farmers during my 40 years in the Senate.  Farmers have had to confront coronavirus supply chain disruptions,  widespread drought, and a record windstorm that moved across our State.   During my 99 county meetings, I saw Iowa fields that were completely  destroyed--150 miles long and 40 miles wide. The images of mature crops  lying flat on the ground were heartbreaking. Iowans are a very  resilient people, but the hurt the farmers have endured this year will  be felt in our State for a few years to come.   Senator Ernst and I will keep fighting to strengthen Iowa's farm  economy despite this year's very challenging situations.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
