 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  cloture motion on Executive Calendar No. 718 be withdrawn and that  following disposition of the Young nomination, the Senate resume  legislative session and proceed to the consideration of Calendar No.  305, S.J. Res. 37, with Senator Paul or his designee in control of 30  minutes and the majority leader in control of the remaining time until  5:30 p.m., and that at 5:30 p.m., all remaining time on the joint  resolution be yielded back, the joint resolution be read a third time,  and the Senate vote on passage of the joint resolution without  intervening action or debate.    I yield the floor for a, I hope, happy event to my  colleague Senator Rubio.    Madam President, I am happy to bring the voice of the  Ocean State to the floor today as an original cosponsor of Senator  Rubio's bill to make daylight saving time permanent. I hope very much  that we can actually agree to this on the floor today and hope for  similar action in the House.   Pretty much everybody in Rhode Island experiences the same thing on  that unhappy day in early November. It is usually the 6th or the 7th,  when suddenly an hour of your day, an hour of your daylight, disappears  and dusk comes an hour earlier.   And it is a sad time. People are unhappy. It does darken our lives in  a very literal sense. And by the time you get from November, when we  fall back, to the shortest day of the year in December, the 21st, I  think it is, we have sunset in Rhode Island at 4:15--4:15. That means  everybody is driving home, if they work regular 9-to-5 hours--they are  driving home in the pitch dark, and there is no real need for it. So  let's make it 5:15 instead.   Now, granted, there are people who are up between 6:30 and 7:30 in  the morning who will lose their hour of daylight, but there are a lot  fewer people up and about between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning than  there are between 4:15 and 5:15 in the afternoon.   And particularly in that afternoon hour, that is when kids have come  home from school, and you would like to have them run around outside a  little bit more. That is when people are doing errands, and it would be  nice if there were some daylight for that.   So I am eager to be rid of ``fall back,'' and this would give us a  chance for Americans all across the country to be rid of ``fall back''  and make daylight saving time permanent and to add a little sunlight  into most people's lives.   With that, I will recognize the distinguished chairman of our Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Let me make it clear to anybody who is watching that  they just saw this measure pass. We have just passed the bill to end  the return to daylight saving time--to make daylight saving time  permanent.   I yield the floor.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, and that I be recognized for  up to 20 minutes.    Mr. President, I have nine requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.

If you have been following this series of speeches, you know that we  have gone over the Powell memo and the plan it laid out for the  corporate rightwing. We have gone over the technique of Agency capture,  regulatory capture, that has been applied to the Supreme Court. We have  gone over the turnstile, that big anonymous rightwing donor setup  within the Federalist Society to approve Republican nominees and the  dark money front groups that sped those nominees through Senate  confirmation. And we have discussed how the big rightwing donor  interests influence Justices while they are on the Bench, through fast  lanes for dark money litigation and flotillas--flotillas--of dark money  amici curiae, front group amici.   Well, if you set up a machine like that, you will pretty soon see  Justices auditioning for the role. To understand the origins of this  auditioning, you need to start with a little bit of history.   It is 1990, and President George H. W. Bush needs to fill a vacancy  left by the legendary Justice William Brennan. President Bush appoints  a recent First Circuit nominee named David Souter, who had spent most  of his career in New Hampshire State government.   At the time, Republicans thought Souter's short time on the Federal  bench was an asset. Without a long paper trail, there was less chance  that Souter's nomination would go down in flames, like Robert Bork's  had.   But Souter wasn't the conservative the rightwing hoped for. Indeed,  he could be down-right moderate. In their disappointment, they adopted  a new mantra: ``No More Souters.''   When rumors got around that George W. Bush might nominate his White  House Counsel, Alberto Gonzales, to the Court, he was not seen as  rightwing enough, and the scheme panicked and the mantra became ``Al  Gonzales is Spanish for `David Souter.' ''   John Paul Stevens was another rightwing disappointment. So ``No More  Souters'' as a mantra was joined by ``No More Stevenses.''   With these disappointments, the rightwing donors and their Federalist  Society accolades vowed to better groom and vet future candidates,  scouring Republican nominees' records for maximum adherence to scheme  orthodoxy.   Well, once that process was up and operating, the response was  predictable. Ambitious rightwing lawyers aspiring to the Federal Bench  aren't dumb. They will follow the path that guides them to their goal.  So the maximum adherence auditioning began. I have described the  circuit court judge who observed his colleagues taking cases and  issuing rulings that seemed to have the clear intent of sending a  signal. They strained to write decisions that were dressed to impress.  They were, in his word, ``auditioning''--auditioning for the Federalist  Society gatekeepers.   So how exactly does this auditioning work? There is a recipe:   One, you have got to understand what matters to the big donors: guns,  unbridled campaign spending, corporate political power, shrinking the  so-called administrative state, and rightwing social issues.   Two, fly solo. It can actually help if you go it alone. Write  opinions so extreme that they stand out and donors take notice.   And, three, of course, where you can, deliver the goods. If a case  allows you to score a win for a big donor interest, take it.   Three Justices who knew this recipe well were the trio nominated by  Donald Trump.   As a circuit court judge, Neil Gorsuch became a darling of the  rightwing donor elites for his commitment  [[Page S1183]]  to dismantling this so-called administrative state. To do that, he  deployed radical legal theories cooked up and propagated in the  scheme's legal theory hothouse, where they developed schemes, kind of  reverse-engineering them to give victories in cases.   In one instance, Gorsuch even wrote two opinions for the same case:  one, the majority opinion that his colleagues joined; and the other, an  out-there solo opinion displaying his scheme bona fides.   Gorsuch also displayed his fervor for what he called religious  freedom, which usually translates to dismantling the separation between  church and State, which is another scheme favorite.   Justice Amy Coney Barrett knew how to audition too. In one case,  Barrett's Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declined to hear a challenge  to an Indiana law on women's right to choose. Barrett bucked the  majority to stakeout an eyebrow-raising position on the right, joining  a dissent aimed directly at Supreme Court abortion precedent.   On guns, Judge Barrett authored an opinion in a Second Amendment case  called Kanter v. Barr that would have given a felon back his gun  because his felony wasn't violent. Constitutional scholars' jaws hit  the floor at that one.   Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment expert at UCLA Law School, told the  New Yorker that the opinion was ``Amy Coney Barrett's audition tape for  the Supreme Court.'' And it was her audition tape because her ``view of  the Second Amendment [was] outside of the mainstream'' and ``would  appeal . . . to the Federalist Society.''   Of course, the biggest auditioner of all was Brett Kavanaugh. On the  DC Circuit, Kavanaugh did so much auditioning it is hard to know where  to begin. He issued opinions on abortion, on guns, on the  administrative state, on campaign finance, and more. He was not  concerned with building consensus. He wanted to make a point.   Here is Washington Post editor Ruth Marcus in her book on Kavanaugh:         His more liberal appeals court colleagues found him affable       but unyielding. He would engage but rarely, if ever, change       his mind, [and he] displayed a propensity for filing separate       concurrences and dissents, actions that some colleagues took       as judicial grandstanding and, more to the point, an effort       to position himself for a Supreme Court seat.    Auditioning--in fact, Kavanaugh dissented more each year on the bench  than any of his DC Circuit colleagues, whether Republican or Democratic  appointees.   Kavanaugh made clear that he would be on the team if on the Court.  Kavanaugh pumped up the ``major questions'' doctrine--one of the  hothouse legal theories pushed by the far right. It says that courts  should ignore an Agency's authority to solve a problem if the court  thinks the problem is too big. Big regulated companies love having  regulatory Agencies hobbled. So this was catnip for scheme donors.   The majority in that case panned Kavanaugh's ``major questions''  idea, which hadn't even been raised by the parties, but Kavanaugh  wasn't out to win votes from his colleagues, and he wasn't out to do  justice in that case. He was firing an auditioning flare for scheme  operatives and donors to see from miles around.   Like Barrett, Kavanaugh did his own publicity. He spoke at 52--count  them, 52--Federalist Society events over his career. You almost  couldn't keep him out. And he wasn't the only one seeking an audience  with the Federalist Society donor elite. After Trump's election, 9 of  the 21 people on Trump's short list spoke at a 3-day Federalist Society  panel dedicated to remembering Justice Scalia, and almost all the  others were hanging out, mingling in the crowd. It was a judicial  beauty pageant, with some real beauties.   Kavanaugh had a little problem. He wasn't on Trump's first list of  potential Supreme Court picks, and he wasn't on the second list either.  But all that eager auditioning got him onto the third list, and the  rest is history.   I am not alone in noting all this auditioning. Here is how one writer  for Slate paraphrased former U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner about  scheme auditioning:   [C]onservative judges auditioning for SCOTUS--   Supreme Court of the United States--         go all out proving their Federalist Society bona fides:       Gorsuch used his judicial opinions on the appeals court to       advertise himself as an enemy of the administrative state and       a diehard proponent of religious freedom; Kavanaugh flaunted       his support of the unitary executive and hostility to       reproductive rights to earn a spot on President Donald       Trump's short list; Amy Coney Barrett brandished her Second       Amendment maximalism.    As the Slate writers note:         The conservative legal movement rewards this kind of       flagrantly ideological auditioning. Republicans demand       evidence that their justices will aggressively overturn       precedent and laws that conflict with their political goals.    As I said earlier, ``no more Souters,'' ``no more Stevenses.''   That is the auditioning by these sitting Justices.   I will close my remarks with an example of what happens when you  haven't auditioned for the scheme.   When Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement, George W.  Bush wanted to replace her with his friend and loyal White House  Counsel, Harriet Miers. Miers was a dyed-in-the-wool conservative. She  had served Bush and his inner circle faithfully. But she wasn't a  Federalist Society insider. She didn't have a record of auditioning for  the big donors behind the Federalist Society's turnstile. She couldn't  soothe those rightwing donors that she was ``no Souter,'' ``no  Stevens.'' Her sin wasn't anything in particular; she just wasn't part  of the club.   As Supreme Court scholar Amanda Hollis-Brusky put it:         The message Leonard [Leo] and others had sent was: If you       want to rise through the ranks, we need to know you. And       that's what they were all saying about Miers--``We don't know       her. She is not one of us.''    Leonard Leo, by the way, is sort of the spider at the center of the  web of donor interests that drive the turnstile at the Federalist  Society during Republican Presidencies.   We are now embarking on the confirmation process of someone who has  not auditioned to donor elites for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. No  dark money machine guided her selection. That is refreshing.   Still, the auditioning continues on the right for the next time a  Republican President holds office. Scheme donors expect standout  candidates who wear their commitment to their donor welfare on their  sleeves. Watch closely for more. To be continued.   I yield the floor.
