 Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate the comments of the  previous speaker on our side, the gentlewoman from Arizona. Mr. Woodall  has made great contributions to this body in the decade that he has  served here.   He happens to be a classmate of mine. We came together in 2010. That  was his first time as a Member of Congress. It was my second time  around, because I lost back in `08 after being here 14 years. So I have  seen Mr. Woodall in operation here for the last decade. He has done a  tremendous job on behalf of not only his constituents but for the  people of this great Nation. I want to thank him for his dedication and  hard work for the people that he represents and for the people of this  Nation overall.    Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, I spoke on this very floor urging action on  behalf of our Nation's 31 million small businesses, as the ranking  member of the House Small Business Committee, formerly the Chair of  that committee for two terms.   I said then that there was no better way to celebrate Small Business  Saturday than to deliver much-needed aid, again, to the small  restaurants and manufacturers and shops that are many of them just  hanging on by a thread.   That assistance could come in the form of the Paycheck Protection  Program, the PPP. That program has supported over 50 million jobs  across this great Nation. That is over 50 million people who didn't  have to worry about how they were going to pay their bills or how they  were going to support their families, because of this bipartisan  program that we passed here in this body.                                time  1445    Unfortunately, that program stopped accepting applications almost 4  months ago, back on August 8, but still has over $130 billion remaining  in its coffers. Millions of small firms across the country have  utilized the PPP program to keep their shops open, to keep paying their  employees, and to keep serving their communities.   To me, it seems like common sense to open the program back up. After  all, it was initially crafted, as I mentioned, in a bipartisan way,  Republicans and Democrats actually working together. It was bicameral,  the House and the Senate working together, and then the administration,  obviously, signing it into law. And that program has proven to be  overwhelmingly successful and saved so many jobs all over this Nation,  including in my district back in Cincinnati.   So I introduced a bill that would do just that and provide targeted  assistance to small businesses that truly still need help.  Unfortunately, the Democratic leadership in this body has blocked  efforts to even have a vote on this legislation, not just once or twice  or three times or a dozen times, but 40 times, 4-0. Forty times the  Democratic leadership has blocked consideration or having a vote on  this.   Because the Democrats would also support this. You would have  Democrats and Republicans, once again, working together and passing  this and helping small business people all across the country and, most  importantly, the people and families that are supported by them.   As we all know, many small businesses are still uncertain about their  future. Many are on the verge of closing their doors permanently. If  that continues to happen, communities all across our great Nation will  be absolutely devastated.   This should have been dealt with months ago. But apparently our  Democratic leadership feels it is more urgent to vote on legislation to  legalize pot and to deal with lions and tigers than they do to help  those small businesses that really need the help. That is just a shame.   Today, if we defeat the previous question, we make improvements to  the Paycheck Protection Program, and finally get additional targeted  relief to the small businesses all across this country that are  counting on us. Let's not let them down.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 7903, as amended. This is a bill to improve  and authorize the SBA's Community Advantage Loan Program for 5 years.   Mr. Speaker, before I get into the business of the day, I would like  to mention that, with the passage of these four bills today, our  committee has produced 35 individual bipartisan pieces of legislation  that have passed the House just this Congress. We have had similar  numbers the previous two Congresses, as well. That is an uncommon  occurrence in a time of divided government.   The reason we have been so successful in improving the programs that  benefit America's more than 30 million small businesses is the  leadership and the bipartisanship of our chairwoman, Nydia Velazquez.   Now, this is my swan song, so to speak, here as the ranking member of  the committee, as I am term-limited and, therefore, unable to continue  serving in that role. I have had the pleasure of being on the Small  Business Committee--I am on the Foreign Affairs Committee and Judiciary  Committee, as well--for 12 terms now, representing Ohio's First  Congressional District. I have also been fortunate to have been the  ranking member two of those terms and the chair of the committee two of  those terms, as well. Again, that is why I am term-limited.   In each of those terms that I have spent in a leadership position on  the committee, my counterpart was Chairwoman or Ranking Member  Velazquez. She has remained a valued  [[Page H6071]]  friend and a reliable partner to do the things that we needed to do to  help the Nation's small businesses. I sincerely thank her for the  partnership that we have forged over the years.   We share a common bond of wanting to do everything in our power to  help America's small businesses, and we have consistently been able to  put partisan politics aside and work together to support that goal. So,  again, I thank her for her willingness to work with my staff and me  over those years, and I hope and trust that they will be able to  continue that relationship with my replacement, and I think that will  happen.   Finally, I mentioned staff before. I want to thank the longtime  Democratic Small Business Committee staffers Melissa Jung, Justin  Pelletier, Naveen Parmar, and Ellen Harrington for their extraordinary  commitment to bipartisanship over the years, regardless of who was  chair or who was the ranking member. Again, on that committee, we have  worked together for many years now.   Now, to the business at hand. When traditional and conventional  lending is out of reach for the Nation's smallest businesses, they have  the opportunity to turn to a number of the SBA's government guaranteed  lending programs.    For approximately 10 years, the SBA has been operating a Community  Advantage pilot program that combines access to capital and technical  assistance. The legislation before us today makes structural changes  and improvements in the program and authorizes it for 5 years.   With oversight and reporting requirements in place, this program will  continue to provide access to capital and consistency to the Nation's  job creators who truly need assistance.   I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Spano) and the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Judy Chu) for working in a bipartisan manner on  behalf of the Nation's smallest firms. They have both worked together  on this and previous legislation, both of them, in the spirit of  bipartisanship on that committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 7903, which  was favorably reported out of the committee via voice vote, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Spano).   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his service in this body. He  has introduced and supported a number of pieces of legislation and has  worked very hard in his leadership position as ranking member of the  Oversight, Investigations and Regulations Subcommittee. I thank him for  his service here.    Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill that deserves our  support. The SBA's Community Advantage program provides both financial  and technical assistance to our Nation's smallest firms. It is a great  program that has proven results.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 8211, the 504 Modernization and Small  Manufacturer Enhancement Act of 2020.   Fortunately, many of the SBA's government guaranteed loan programs  have a strong track record of producing results. Included near the top  of that list is the 504 loan program.   The SBA's 504/CDC Loan Program provides the Nation's smallest  businesses with long-term and fixed-rate financing.   Importantly, for a project to qualify for this government guarantee  loan program, certain economic development goals must be met, including  job creation and job retention goals.   H.R. 8211 modernizes that program by expanding the public policy  goals to include businesses with 10 employees or less, as well as  enhancing the program for small manufacturers.   I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Craig) for  working with me in a bipartisan fashion to craft this piece of  legislation.   I would also like to thank the chairwoman, Ms. Velazquez, once again  for advancing this legislation that was favorably reported out of  committee unanimously; so both Republicans and Democrats supporting it.   I urge my colleagues to support this, which provides crucial updates  to the SBA's program, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers and I am prepared  to close, so I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation. As our Nation's small businesses continue to face numerous  capital access challenges, the SBA's existing government guarantee loan  programs must be prepared to provide assistance. This bill, H.R. 8211,  does just that by expanding the 504/CDC Loan Program's economic  development goals and enhancing the program for small manufacturers.   This program has a proven record of the success, and the improvements  that this legislation delivers will continue this track record into the  future.   I ask for my colleagues' support, and I yield back the balance of my  time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 8199, the 504 Credit Risk Management  Improvement Act of 2020.   The SBA's 504/CDC Loan Program provides lending assistance to  thousands of small businesses year in and year out. This assistance  translates into supporting tens of thousands of jobs on an annual  basis. This economic development program is and has been making a  difference in neighborhoods and communities all across this great  Nation.   With any successful government program, oversight must remain a  significant factor. H.R. 8199 places an important focus on oversight  and ensures the SBA has the appropriate capabilities to oversee the  504/CDC Loan Program.   Beyond oversight, H.R. 8199 also ensures that the 504/CDC Loan  Program participants have the rules and guidance to comply with the  National Environmental Policy Act and successfully operate within that  program.   I want to thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop) and  the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Craig) for their leadership and for  working together to craft this legislation, once again, in a bipartisan  manner.   I want to thank the chair, Ms. Velazquez also for encouraging that  cooperation between both sides.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop) and, again, thank him for  his leadership in working across party lines with the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Craig). I want to commend her as well.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on my side, so I  am happy to close.   Mr. Speaker, Congress must continue to work together to strengthen  the SBA's existing guaranteed loan programs. The SBA's programs must  work for the Nation's smallest firms and the Nation's taxpayers. H.R.  8199 meets both objectives by applying appropriate oversight  requirements to the SBA's 504/CDC loan program. Therefore, I urge my  colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I, once again, thank Ms. Craig and Mr. Bishop for their  leadership, and I thank the chairwoman for her leadership on this. I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8229, the Parity for HUBZone  Appeals Act of 2020.   As we have heard from the chairwoman, the current appeals process for  the HUBZone program raises several concerns, including questions of  conflict of interest, lack of transparency, and lack of responsibility.   The AA-GCBD plays a key leadership role within the organizational  structure of the SBA and is primarily responsible for the supervision  of all the SBA's various Federal contracting programs, including the  HUBZone program.   Unlike the AA-GCBD, the SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals is a  fully functioning independent organization unconnected to the SBA's  Federal contracting programs, and OHA administrative judges are trained  to hear exactly these types of matters.   By moving HUBZone appeals from the AA-GCBD's purview to OHA through  the passage of this bill, the AA-GCBD will be empowered to focus on its  primary supervisory responsibilities while HUBZone small businesses  will be able to receive impartial, fair, and knowledgeable treatment of  their cases by OHA.   H.R. 8229, this bill, makes a necessary correction in the way HUBZone  appeals are conducted.   I thank the gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen), our  vice ranking member, as well as the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Houlahan) for their bipartisan leadership on this legislation--again,  Republicans and Democrats working together on this committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on my side, and I  yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is good legislation. It moves the ball forward.  Moving the HUBZone appeals process to the OHA places small businesses  that have a complaint about the program on equal footing with other  appeals processes throughout the SBA, and that is a good thing.   I want to, again, thank Mrs. Radewagen for her leadership on this  particular legislation and Ms. Houlahan from Pennsylvania as well, and  the chairwoman, as always, for working in a bipartisan manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
