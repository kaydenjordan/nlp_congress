 Mr. Speaker, recently we saw yard signs across our Nation  proclaiming ``America First.''   To put America first should mean defending our people against all  enemies, foreign and domestic. That is a daunting task, indeed. No  nation, including ours, is an island in a world where nuclear weapons,  predatory armed submarines, cyber warfare, and space technologies  encircle our globe and are ever-present threats.   Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine reminds all of us that no  freedom-loving nation can fold its tent. Liberty threatened by known  expansionists and fervent regimes threaten world order. Russia is  testing the resolve of NATO and our free world.   I am old enough to have lived during an era in which Russia's  historic aggression into territory that was not its own extended as far  west as East Berlin, Germany.   Russia is repeating its brutal history yet again on the European  Continent, a continent in which our Nation's World War II war dead  reached 183,588 and globally over 416,800.   Our Nation cannot retreat from our alliances that protect us here at  home and the rule of law the world around. Victory to Ukraine.                            ____________________
