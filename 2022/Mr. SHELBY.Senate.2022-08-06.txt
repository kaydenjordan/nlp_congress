 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 5418 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, my amendment requires that the Secretary  of the Interior--requires that he complete, or she, pending coal lease  applications under the Bureau of Land Management.   I believe we cannot allow the Biden administration to block the  mining of our own essential energy resources and building materials.   I urge my colleagues to support our coal miners and vote ``yes'' on  this amendment.   Basically, the amendment would require that the Secretary of the  Interior to complete pending coal lease processes for both  metallurgical and thermal coal.   Currently, the administration has paused the Lease by Application  program for Federal coal leases at the Bureau of Land Management and so  forth.   It does not change the law. It simply seeks to raise revenue by  accelerating and ensuring approval of leases that are currently paused  by the Department of the Interior.   It makes a lot of sense to the American people, and it will put a lot  of people back to work.   I urge adoption. Amen.
