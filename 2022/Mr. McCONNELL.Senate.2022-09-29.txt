 Madam President, the whole country continues our vigil  for the people of Florida, who are hunkered down through Hurricane Ian.   The storm's landfall yesterday brought surging seas and sustained  winds over 150 miles an hour, and 2.5 million Florida families and  businesses are reportedly without power. Evacuation orders have been in  place for more than 2 million residents of the gulf coast.   The extent of the damage has barely even begun to come into focus.  Fortunately, the coordinated State and local response, led by Governor  DeSantis and supported by Federal Agencies, is ongoing.   Yesterday, our two colleagues from Florida led the State's entire  congressional delegation in asking President Biden to issue a major  disaster declaration and unlock further aid. I understand the President  agreed this morning.   The Senate will stand ready to provide further assistance if needed.  The government funding legislation before us will make sure the  Disaster Relief Fund is refilled.   Most immediately, Floridians remain at the forefront of the nation's  prayers.                                 The Economy    Madam President, now, on a completely different matter, families  across America have felt the brunt of this all-Democratic government's  failed energy policies. When gas prices were skyrocketing, the Biden  administration insisted up and down they had no control over them. When  the prices started to level off, the same politicians asked for a round  of applause--funny how that works.   Here is what working families in Kentucky know: that a gallon of gas  costs a full dollar more than when President Biden took office.  American families and small businesses know their electricity bills  skyrocketed this spring and this summer, and they know that heating  costs on Democrats' watch this fall and winter may well be  catastrophic.   Just like our overall 13.2 percent inflation since January 2021 is  directly--directly--traceable to Democrats' reckless spending, a lot of  our energy prices are traceable to Democrats' shortsighted policies.  Democrats have spent 20 years saying we shouldn't explore for American  energy, that our abundant fossil fuel resources should actually stay in  the ground.   Just in the last 2 years, Democrats overwhelmingly voted two separate  items to let the Biden EPA ban fracking. One analysis showed that the  kind of fracking ban Democrats want will quadruple household energy  bills.   Democrats supported President Biden's de facto bans on both offshore  and onshore oil and gas leasing. They backed President Biden's decision  to cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline. I guess it is better to import  Middle Eastern crude than safely transport oil from Canada.   They voted for reckless tax hikes, including a natural gas tax that  will directly drive up families' heating costs.   And this week marks the 6-month anniversary of when President Biden  began his reckless draining of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a  desperate attempt to buy up his poll numbers. President Biden has  already released more than 200 million barrels from the Reserve into  the international market, more than all the other Presidents in our  history combined. A few days ago, he promised to release an additional  10 million barrels in November.   Our country established the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a lifeline  for national security crises. Until now, Presidents had only ever  tapped it for armed conflicts or natural disasters. Now Democrats are  emptying out our emergency reserves in a desperate attempt to save  their political skins. Reckless and cynical does not even begin to  cover it.   Now the Reserve sits at its lowest point since 1984. If our country  were cut off from oil imports tomorrow, we would have less than 2  months' supply.   And, remember, 2 years ago, in the early COVID crisis, when markets  were temporarily crashing and oil was selling for bargain-basement  prices like we have never seen, Republicans tried to refill the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the top when the prices were low. It  would have been a win for economic stability, a win for national  security, and a huge win for taxpayers. Oil actually was on a clearance  sale, and we could have filled the Reserve right up to the top.   Oh, but Senate Democrats blocked it and bragged about blocking it.  Leader Schumer boasted in writing that he had blocked a ``bailout for  Big Oil''--a bailout for Big Oil, typical tired, old liberal rhetoric.  But what our Democrat colleagues blocked was an unbelievably good deal  for the American people. Now they are draining the Reserve they  wouldn't let us refill, and when they do need to refill it, you had  better believe taxpayers won't be paying March 2020 prices. I can tell  you that.    Shortsighted, ineffective, and bad economics--that is Democrats'  energy policy in microcosm. Working Americans pay the price every  single day.                                    Crime    Now, Madam President, on another matter, runaway inflation isn't the  only crisis keeping American families up at night. The last 2 years  have seen law and order deteriorate all across our country. Public  safety has eroded, violent crimes like murders and carjackings are  breaking records, and our southern border has turned into a turnstile.   We have seen the violence and chaos firsthand in Kentucky, especially  in my hometown of Louisville, but we aren't alone. This is a nationwide  phenomenon on Democrats' watch.   Philadelphia just saw their 1,000th carjacking this year. It is not  even October yet. Carjackings in Philly have quadrupled just since  2019.   In Phoenix, AZ, the first half of this year saw homicides jump up  more than 25 percent compared to 2021. One woman whose brother and  cousin were both shot and killed a few weeks ago said:         It's like the community has [actually] become accustomed to       it.    In 2021, Denver recorded more murders than they had seen in a single  year since 1981, and the pace was 23 percent higher still in the first  half of 2022.   Nationwide, robberies and thefts in big cities shot up 20 percent in  the first half of this year.   So it turns out that, when an entire political party builds its brand  around undermining the police, going easy on repeat offenders, and  putting criminals' interests ahead of innocent families', bad things  happen.   Bad things also happen when the same political party decides to stand  down on border security: over 2 million illegal immigrants apprehended  by the CBP this fiscal year alone, not even counting all of the people  who evaded capture; an avalanche--an avalanche--of illegal drugs coming  into our land.   These are massive concerns among the American people--concerns that  our Senate Democratic majority has intentionally spent all year doing  nothing whatsoever to address.                                  H.R. 6833    Madam President, on one final matter, when the Senate votes today to  [[Page S5512]]  fund the government, we will also approve further emergency aid for  Ukraine.   The Ukrainians have made remarkable progress in pushing back Russia's  unhinged aggression, but the fight is far from over. They need more of  the cutting-edge weapons that are helping them turn the tide.   Assisting Ukraine is not some feel-good, symbolic gesture; it is  literally an investment in our own national security and that of our  allies. Blunting Putin's offensive in Ukraine will diminish his  capacity to threaten other targets throughout the free world. It will  also help deter other authoritarian regimes like China.   Nobody is saying America should stand alone. Some of our European  allies, especially on NATO's eastern flank, have been incredibly  generous, digging deep into their inventories and welcoming hundreds of  thousands of refugees, but others can and must do more.   The Senate's consistent support for Ukraine at reasonable levels  plays a critical part in nudging our allies to step up. Ukraine needs  more tanks, more fighting vehicles, longer range rockets, artillery,  and air defense systems; more HIMARS, more drones, and preparatory  training in Western fighter aircraft. And they need these things as  soon as possible.   Yesterday, the Biden administration announced another tranche of  assistance, but the HIMARS rocket systems included in that announcement  won't arrive in Ukraine for years--years.   If the administration cannot move faster, it will be an indictment of  their persistent unwillingness to invest in our own military stockpiles  and our own defense industrial base.   Now that Congress is providing more funding, the Biden administration  must move more swiftly--more swiftly--to deliver it to the Ukrainian  forces on the frontlines soon. Now is not the time for hesitating,  hand-wringing, or self-deterring from the administration. It is not  true strength and resolve that provoke the bully; it is delay and  weakness.    Mr. President, the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame  recently announced its 42nd class of inductees, adding eight new  members to a list of distinguished journalists, including Pulitzer  Prize winners and broadcasters who have become household names. John B.  Gaines, the former publisher of the Bowling Green Daily News, was one  of this year's posthumous additions. Today, I ask my colleagues to join  me in honoring John's induction into the Hall of Fame and remembering  the deep mark he left on Kentucky print journalism.   John and I met through his role on the Bowling Green Daily News  editorial board, where he helped craft opinion pieces that shaped the  political outlook of generations of Kentuckians. During my earliest  runs for statewide office, I knew how important it was for me to meet  with John and his team of writers. Luckily, John and I tended to agree  on most issues and became fast friends.   John was a member of the Gaines family, one of Bowling Green's most  prominent and, until this year, the owners of the Daily News for five  generations. He understood the deep importance of his family to Bowling  Green's civic life, leveraging his role at the Daily News to bring  public attention to critical local issues and fostering homegrown  journalistic talent as President of the Kentucky Press Association. He  was also a fierce advocate for government transparency and helped open  the halls of Kentucky government more widely to reporters and, by  extension, to everyday Kentuckians.   To honor John Gaines' induction into the Journalism Hall of Fame, his  son Pipes Gaines delivered remarks at a reception in Lexington, KY.  Pipes remembered his father's ``love of facts'' and his pursuit of them  ``without fear or favor.'' I remember John's love for facts, as well,  and his earnest belief that unvarnished, unbiased coverage of political  issues would always illuminate Kentucky's government better than  slanted reporting.   I thank John and the entire Gaines family for their stewardship of  one of the Commonwealth's finest newspapers and for their service to  their Bowling Green readers. Even more than a decade after John's  passing, his legacy continues to reverberate around the Commonwealth.   The Bowling Green Daily News paid tribute to John Gaines' induction  into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame in a recent article. I ask  unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:          [From the Bowling Green Daily News, September 25, 2022]   ``The Late John B. Gaines, 7 Others Inducted into Journalism Hall of                                   Fame''    John B. Gaines, longtime publisher of the Bowling Green Daily News,  was posthumously inducted into the Kentucky Journalism hall of fame  Thursday evening in Lexington.   At a reception honoring the eight inductees of the 42nd Hall of Fame  class, Pipes Gaines spoke of his father's commitment to journalism,  specifically of the Daily News' duty to the community it served. ``One  characteristic which I believe made him an outstanding journalist was  his love of facts--printed facts in particular,'' Gaines said. ``He  expected the newsroom to pursue the facts and report them accurately  without fear or favor. This kind of journalism was not always popular  with people or groups with power and influence.''   Along with the late John B. Gaines, the Hall of Fame Class of 2022  includes J. Scott Applewhite of The Associated Press, Jerry Brewer of  The Washington Post. the late Melissa Forsythe of WHAS-TV, the late  Bill Mardis of the Somerset Commonwealth Journal, Mark Maynard of  Kentucky Today, writing coach and retired editor Stuart Warner and  Deborah Yetter of The Courier-Journal.   The reception was held in the Gatton Student Center's Grand Ballroom  on the University of Kentucky campus. The Kentucky Journalism Hall of  Fame, founded by the UK Journalism Alumni Association in 1981, honors  journalists who are Kentucky natives or have spent a significant  portion of their careers working for Kentucky news media organizations.   The late John B. Gaines, who died in 2007 at age 92, spent six  decades at the helm of the Daily News. He was influential in the  community, writing editorials in support of a countywide library tax,  creation of an airport and the banning of prohibition in Bowling Green  in 1958. It was later repealed in 1960.   The elder Gaines was ``extremely passionate about transparency in  government and a local champion of open meetings and open records,''  according to his son.   John B. Gaines was active in Kentucky journalism through his  leadership as a board member and later president of the Kentucky Press  Association. He served two terms on the board of the Southern Newspaper  Publishers Association, which merged with the Inland Press Association  in 2019, to create a new association--America's Newspapers.   He also supported young, aspiring reporters through a scholarship  fund for journalists at Western Kentucky University and was  instrumental in establishing the Gaines Family Lecture Series that  highlights speakers that have achieved distinction in journalism.   The professionalism and integrity of John B. Gaines was also  appreciated by one of Bowling Green's longest-serving politicians.   In an earlier story about John B. Gaines published in the Daily News  written by Don Sergent, Jody Richards, who spent 43 years representing  the Bowling Green area in the Kentucky General Assembly, called John B.  Gaines ``an excellent newspaperman and tremendous businessman.''   ``The thing I remember about him is that he fought hard for freedom  of the press and the people's right to know,'' said Richards, a former  journalism instructor at Western Kentucky University. ``That's an issue  that people always have to fight for.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Kentucky Broadcasters Association,  the Commonwealth's premier representative for our State's public and  commercial radio and television stations, recently announced their 2022  Hall of Fame inductees. My good friend Dave ``Buzz'' Baker, WKYT's  sports anchor, is one of those honored this year and joined the ranks  of some of Kentucky's finest broadcast journalists. Today, I ask my  colleagues to join me in honoring Dave for his service to our State and  congratulating him on achieving this high honor.   Dave came to Kentucky in 1978 to attend school at Georgetown College  and, after joining WKYT after graduating, has since called the  Bluegrass State home. He must have realized quickly that, for a career  in sports journalism, few places offer such enthusiastic fans or such  riveting rivalries. As a Lexington sports reporter, he reserved special  focus for the University of Kentucky Wildcats, tracking UK athletics  through their highs and lows over four decades of first-rate  journalism.   During his time at WKYT, Dave has had the opportunity to report from  five Final Four Championships and three National Championships,  following UK all across the country to keep fans updated. In March  2008, he found himself on the sidelines of the SEC Men's Basketball  Tournament when a tornado hit the Georgia Dome, certainly one of his  more harrowing experiences on the job. His broadcasting extends beyond  basketball, from UK football, to professional wrestling, including  interviews with Randy Savage and Hulk Hogan. He has had quite the  memorable career.   Today, as WKYT's sports anchor, he broadcasts to Lexington's sports- hungry audiences twice every weekday. He also hosts UK Sports Networks'  ``Countdown to Tip-Off Show'' on the school's radio network and his own  ``Sports Buzz'' podcast. In short, he is one of the most recognizable  faces and voices of UK sports. His four-decade legacy at WKYT is so  legendary that he earned a proclamation earlier this year from  Lexington's mayor on his  [[Page S5530]]  40th anniversary with the station, naming that day Dave ``Buzz'' Baker  Day in the city.   I also applaud Dave's work outside the television station. Using the  trust and affection he has earned from his viewers, he has worked with  Kentucky State government leaders to help promote safe, responsible  behavior at the Commonwealth's high schools and colleges.   I thank Dave for his strong reporting on Kentucky athletics and join  all of his viewers and listeners in congratulating him on his most  recent honor from the Kentucky Broadcasters Association.                            ____________________     Mr. President, my good friend C.B. Embry has worn many  hats during his long career in public life: as an elected official for  more than 50 years in positions including mayor, county judge- executive, State representative, and State senator; as the proprietor  of several businesses in and around Ohio County; as a journalist,  published author, and teacher; as a volunteer, political organizer,  church leader, and family man. C.B. recently submitted his resignation  from the Kentucky State Senate, marking the end of his long career in  government. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring C.B. and  thanking him for his lifelong service to Kentucky.   C.B. found a passion for public service at a young age, entering  journalism and teaching right after graduating from Western Kentucky  University. His love for his home State and his hometown propelled him  into elected office quickly, and, in 1970, he became the youngest ever  mayor of Beaver Dam in Ohio County. His strong leadership and steadfast  conservative credentials soon attracted national attention, and, in  1975, he was named the Outstanding Young Republican in the Nation by  future President George H. W. Bush.   He and I entered into Republican politics at similar times, back when  much of Kentucky was still blue. As young conservatives, we quickly  bonded over our shared love of the Commonwealth and our similar work to  help flip the State into the Republican column. Over the decades, our  collaboration has only grown, and, because of the work of organizers  like C.B., Kentuckians across our State have embraced conservative  values.   Not long after C.B. entered the public eye, Ohio County residents  recognized his expansive leadership potential, electing him county  judge-executive in 1982. In 2002, he was elected to serve as State  representative and, in 2014, became State senator. In all, he has been  elected to public office a dozen times, proof of the trust and  admiration he earned from his neighbors and constituents. He has also  worked with various Kentucky Governors, Federal agencies, and statewide  organizations to champion policies that improve Kentuckians' lives.   In his past 8 years in the State senate, C.B. earned recognition as a  senior legislator and statesman. His work was expansive in scope,  covering issues ranging from agriculture and energy policy to police  safety and military affairs. Perhaps his proudest achievement was  leading the passage of a so-called ``Right to Try'' bill that allows  medical patients facing debilitating illnesses to try experimental  treatments when all other options have been exhausted. State  governments all around the country have mimicked his work and passed  similar pieces of legislation.   More than anything, C.B. has always prioritized his family,  celebrating his 60th anniversary with his wife Wanda this past August.  As the father of three, grandfather of four, and great-grandfather of  two, he has passed on his legacy of public service and integrity to a  blossoming family. In business, church service, and government  leadership, his priority has always been to give other Kentuckians the  opportunity to build the same success he found in every aspect of his  life and career.   When C.B. retired from the State senate, he was the oldest serving  member of the body and received recognition from all his colleagues as  one of Kentucky's premier senior statesmen. Congratulations and  gratitude poured in from all over the Commonwealth, thanking C.B. for  his decades of service to our State. I am proud to add my voice to that  chorus of Kentuckians and give my deepest appreciation for his lifelong  work on behalf of all citizens of the Commonwealth.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for more than 30 years, Chuck Mraz  served communities in Eastern Kentucky as the ``Voice of the Eagles''  for Morehead State University athletics at Morehead State Public Radio.  During his long career, from which he retired 4 years ago, he earned  accolades from around the Commonwealth and region. This year, he  received another distinction and was one of several broadcast  journalists inducted into the Kentucky Broadcasters Association Hall of  Fame. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Chuck for his  service and congratulating him on achieving this high honor.   Chuck knew he wanted to be a sportscaster from the beginning of his  career, noting in an interview that sports had always been a part of  his life since he could pick up a bat and a ball. When he joined  Morehead State Public Radio in 1986, he relished the opportunity to  give commentary during Morehead State games. Even as his role at the  radio station expanded, he stayed on as the voice of Eagles athletics  and continues to serve as the play-by-play voice of Morehead State  football and men's basketball in his retirement.   I had the opportunity to join Chuck's program a number of times over  the years, enjoying our conversations that ranged from the important  policy issues facing Kentuckians to our shared passion for Kentucky  sports. His dedication to his career required many early mornings and  late nights, but he never wavered from his love for Morehead State  sports, staying dedicated to his beloved Eagles throughout his career.   Chuck's most recent recognition from the Kentucky Broadcasters  Association is just one more award in a long list of honors he has  received from local, State, and regional press associations. That  includes more than 40 Kentucky Associated Press awards, the Eastern  Kentucky Leadership Conference Award for Media and Technology, and the  Ohio Valley Conference Media Award. Upon his retirement, Chuck also  earned tributes and accolades from around Kentucky and the country.   I thank Chuck for his long career with Morehead State and  congratulate him on his well-deserved induction into the Kentucky  Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame. To all Kentuckians and Morehead  State fans, he will always be the ``Voice of the Eagles.''   Morehead State paid tribute to Chuck Mraz in a recent article. I ask  unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              [From Morehead State University, Aug. 11, 2022]   ``Voice of the Eagles Chuck Mraz Set to be Inducted Into KBA Hall of                                   Fame''         Longtime Morehead State Public Radio news director, and       voice of Morehead State football and men's basketball Chuck       Mraz has been chosen by The Kentucky Broadcaster's       Association as a 2022 recipient of the Kentucky Mic award.        The Kentucky Mic is presented to individuals who have made       outstanding personal contributions to the broadcasting       profession in Kentucky. Since this award is considered to be       the highest given by the KBA, recipients are immediately       inducted into the KBA Hall of Fame.        Mraz is a 1978 graduate of Southern Illinois University-      Carbondale, where he was a reporter with WSIU-FM, WSIU-TV,       WIDB Radio, and did two years play by play and color for SIU       football and men's basketball.        Between 1978 to 1986, he held various on air and sales       positions at WKRS (Waukegan, Illinois), WHCO (Sparta,       Illinois), WKZN (Zion, Illinois) and WXAN (Ava, Illinois).        In 1986, Mraz joined the Morehead State Public Radio news       and sports team, spending 23 years as assistant news director       and news director and 17 years as host of ``The Front Page''       talk show. Before retiring from WMKY in 2018, he had trained       more than 600 news student interns.        Although he has retired from full time broadcast duties, he       remains the play by play voice of MSU football and men's       basketball, a seat he has filled for 35 years. Since 2014, he       has been a big part of the KHSAA Girls' ``Sweet 16'' radio       network.        Prior to receiving the KBA Kentucky Mic Award, he received       more than 40 other broadcast awards Including ``Best       Sportscast'',  [[Page S5531]]       ``Best Newscast'' ``Best Radio Anchor'', and ``Best Play by       Play'' from the Associated Press, the 2016 East Kentucky       Leadership Foundation's Media and Technology award and the       2016-17 Ohio Valley Conference Media Award.        In addition to Mraz, the 2022 KBA Hall of Fame class       includes WKYT-TV sports anchor Dave Baker and WAVE-TV       meteorologist Dave Belski. All of the 2022 Legacy Awards       recipients will be celebrated during ``An Evening of       Broadcast Excellence'', Monday September 26th at the KBA's       Annual Conference in Owensboro.                            ____________________
