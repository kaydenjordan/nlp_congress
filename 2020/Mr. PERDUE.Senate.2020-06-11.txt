 Mr. President, the State of Georgia and truly the  entire world lost an exceptional beacon of goodness and faith when Ravi  Zacharias passed away on May 19, 2020. However, our loss is Heaven's  gain. Ravi was a man of deep faith, love, and service to others. He  embodied the command of Jesus in Mark 16:15 to ``Go into all the world  and preach the gospel to all creation.''   Ravi first came to know the teachings of Jesus Christ when he was 17  years old, when a nurse read the Word of God to him while he was  recovering from a suicide attempt. From that day forth, Ravi made it  his mission to share with others the joy and faith which had rescued  him from despair.   In 1971, when he was just 25 years old, Ravi traveled to war-torn  Vietnam, where he ministered in hospitals, military bases, and prison  camps. The trip nearly cost him his life. Yet he went on to travel to  every corner of the world sharing the Gospel.   In 1983, Reverend Billy Graham personally invited Ravi to speak at  the inaugural International Conference for Itinerant Evangelists in  Amsterdam. This helped Ravi develop a new passion for apologetics. Not  only did he want to spread the Gospel, he wanted to help train others  how to defend their faith in a rapidly secularizing world. A year  later, Ravi founded Ravi Zacharias International Ministries to carry  out this mission.   Over the years, Ravi continued sharing faith and love around the  world through speaking engagements, books, and radio appearances,  reaching untold numbers of people in need.   Ravi built incredible institutions for sharing the Christian faith.  He founded the Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics. He founded  Wellspring International, a humanitarian group helping women and  children around the world. In 2017, he founded the Zacharias Institute  to teach apologetics in Atlanta, Georgia.  [[Page S2931]]    Ravi spent the last 36 years of his life in Atlanta. He is remembered  as a man of kindness, joy, and steadfast devotion to his faith. He  leaves behind his beloved wife Margie and three children: Sarah, Naomi,  and Nathan, all of whom are carrying on his incredible legacy of faith  and service.                            ____________________
