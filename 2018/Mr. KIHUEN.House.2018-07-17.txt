 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Kurt  von Tillow.   Kurt attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1. Kurt  enjoyed owning his own trucking company in northern California. He  would often go to concerts and was happy to be going to the Route 91  festival with a number of his relatives.   Kurt and his wife loved to take golfing trips to Scotland and  Ireland, and they loved to boat. He was fun, friendly, and liked to  enjoy good beer. Kurt is remembered as being very patriotic and a big  family man.   I would like to extend my condolences to Kurt von Tillow's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieves with you.                            ____________________
