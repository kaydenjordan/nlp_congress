 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Limit, Save, Grow  Act, which addresses the current debt limit crisis while prioritizing  responsible spending practices.   Critically, this bill will lead to over $4.5 trillion, with a T, in  taxpayer savings over the next decade and reverse a dangerous trend of  reckless fiscal mismanagement on the part of the Democrats.   Americans and New Yorkers, where I hail from, are facing a fiscal  crisis due to persistently high inflation, rising interest rates, and  debt at unsustainable levels. This is a direct result of the trillions  upon trillions of dollars that the Democrats have spent since President  Biden took office in January 2021.   Mr. Speaker, my former colleague from the New York State Assembly,  now minority leader here, should know that 40 percent of our Nation's  debt was incurred under the leadership of the former Speaker, who the  minority leader described as the best Speaker of all time.   He should know. The State of New York has the highest taxes, the  highest spend rate, the highest corporate welfare, and the highest out- migration of people and jobs in the entire Nation.   Americans and New Yorkers are facing a fiscal crisis. Instead of  politicizing the impending debt limit predicament, Democrats should  prioritize responsible spending and work with House Republicans on a  solution to reduce reckless spending, save taxpayer money, and grow our  economy.   It is time for President Biden to come to the negotiating table and  work with House Republicans on a path forward to economic stability and  growth. Please don't mimic the model that New York has set, where we  once had 45 Representatives in the 1960s and are now down to 26.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.
