 Madam President, I yield back all time.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, this motion to commit is a red herring  and a complete distraction.   The Department of Agriculture already has strict rules that all  producers must meet before they can participate in USDA conservation  programs.   These dollars go to farmers who are American citizens or legal  permanent residents for conservation practices that help protect and  improve American soil and water. Farmers are only reimbursed after the  practices are in place.   This would add burdensome paperwork, unnecessary bureaucracy that  would really bog our farmers down. This is different than circumstances  that were just talked about with state-owned Chinese companies. This is  not the same thing. This amendment goes right at our farmers and the  conservation practices they are asking us to support for them.   Again, the only reason for this amendment is to stop us from passing  this bill, which, among other things, will cut prescription drug costs,  create jobs, and tackle the climate crisis.   I urge a ``no'' vote.
