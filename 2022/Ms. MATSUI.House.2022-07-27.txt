 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the  Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act, legislation to further extend  telehealth policies that have been critical to providing care during  the pandemic through the end of 2024.   Since long before the COVID pandemic, I worked closely with my Energy  and Commerce Committee colleague, Representative Bill Johnson, in  crafting legislation to remove barriers to telehealth and advancing  policies that expand access and improve the quality of care for  Medicare beneficiaries.   As a cosponsor of this bill, I am pleased to see some of that  important work make progress today. This legislation builds on  Congress' efforts to give patients and providers the certainty they  need that telehealth is here to stay.    While this bipartisan telehealth bill meets many of our shared  objectives, we also must recognize that our work on telehealth is not  done. There are vital telehealth priorities still demanding our  attention that will truly shape care delivery for the future, including  the need to extend the DEA in-person waiver for remote prescribing of  controlled substances after the public health emergency ends.   Likewise, while this bill continues a crucial delay of the in-person  telemental health requirement, we cannot allow an arbitrary and  clinically unsupported in-person requirement to act as a barrier to  mental health care when the pandemic extensions run out.   I look forward to continuing this work with my colleagues. This is a  really good bill, but we want to ensure that permanent Medicare policy  supports telehealth in ways that ensure beneficiaries can continue to  get the right care in the right place at the right time.
