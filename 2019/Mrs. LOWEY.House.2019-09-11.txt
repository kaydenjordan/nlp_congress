 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend and New  Yorker, my colleague, Carolyn Maloney, for organizing this evening so  that we can all remember.   Eighteen years have passed since the September 11 terrorist attacks,  but the memory of this unimaginable tragedy, unspeakable terror, and  profound grief remains.   When tragedy struck, men and women streamed from the Twin Towers and  the Pentagon as first responders ran in and risked their lives.  Volunteers sifted through debris for days and weeks, hoping for  miracles.   Between those horrific attacks and the crash of Flight 93 in  Shanksville, Pennsylvania, we lost nearly 3,000 family members,  friends, and neighbors. We promised to never forget those whose lives  were cut short.   The pain that we all feel from the loss of our relatives, friends,  and neighbors will never heal, but every day we must channel that pain  into remembrance and service. By participating in this day of service,  we help build a stronger, more unified community to honor the victims'  memories.   We are also called to care for those who remain with us but suffer as  a result of their bravery that day. In July, the Senate followed the  House's lead and passed the permanent renewal of the September 11th  Victim Compensation Fund, which was enacted on July 29, 2019. The long- overdue action provides financial security and care for first  responders and survivors who are ill from exposure to a mix of burning  chemicals and debris.   On this and every anniversary of the September 11 attacks, we are  reminded of our common purpose and solemn responsibilities: to care for  the survivors and first responders, to give our law enforcement the  resources to prevent and respond to attacks, and, last but not least,  to hold the victims and heroes of September 11 and their families  forever in our hearts.
