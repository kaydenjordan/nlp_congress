 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Kelsey  Meadows. Kelsey attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October  1.   Kelsey was known by her parents as a miracle child. She went into  heart failure at 6 weeks old, but survived. Growing up, Kelsey was a  tomboy who chose jeans, boots, fishing, and hunting over everything  else.   She was a gifted teacher who demonstrated a skill and passion for her  career. Kelsey had a sweet spirit and a love for children. She loved  country music and was a Denver Broncos fan. Her friends and family will  never forget the big smile she always had on her face.   I would like to extend my condolences to Kelsey Meadows' family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
