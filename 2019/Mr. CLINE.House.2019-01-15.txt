 Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R.  150, the Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements Transparency Act.   Madam Speaker, in 1788, Patrick Henry spoke at the Virginia  Constitutional Convention, where he said: ``The liberties of a people  never were, nor ever will be, secure when the transactions of their  rulers may be concealed from them.''   Transparency in government is an important principle for the  preservation of our Republic, and it has been a priority for me during  my tenure in the Virginia House of Delegates, where I was proud to  sponsor legislation to put the entire State budget in a searchable  online database.   In a similar vein, H.R. 150 would require that data on more than $600  billion in Federal grants be standardized and published on a single  online portal.   This is bipartisan legislation that would modernize the way the  Federal Government does business by simplifying grant reporting  information into a searchable, more manageable system.   Nonprofit, State and local governments, and small businesses will no  longer be forced to spend meaningful work hours on filling out  duplicative paperwork.   In return, this will not only make the grant reporting process more  transparent but will make it more efficient and accessible to everyday  Americans, thus saving taxpayer dollars and helping to fulfill the  vision of another Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, who in his first  inaugural said: ``A wise and frugal government, which shall restrain  men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to  regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not  take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum  of good government.''   Madam Speaker, I support this bill and urge its passage.
