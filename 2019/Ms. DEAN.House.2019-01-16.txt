 Madam Speaker, a concerned constituent recently sent me  this hand-written letter about President Trump's shutdown:   ``As an air traffic controller . . . I want you to know how the  partial government shutdown is affecting me. For the last 2 weeks, we  have remained on the job, dedicated to the safety of every flight. But  we don't know when we will receive our next paycheck. . . .   ``I was putting my 7-year-old daughter to bed and I could tell  something was bothering her. She had heard my wife and I . . . worrying  about our next mortgage payment and the credit card bills. . . . My  daughter looked me in the eye and told me she was scared and what would  happen if we couldn't pay for our home and our bills.   ``I have been teaching her the value of commitment and  responsibility. I have showed her that by hard work and excellence you  can make a good life for . . . your family. . . . My daughter should  not have to worry about bills when we have valuable jobs and are doing  our work.   ``Please, Representative Dean, help me teach my daughter about  commitment and responsibility and help end the government shutdown.''                            ____________________
