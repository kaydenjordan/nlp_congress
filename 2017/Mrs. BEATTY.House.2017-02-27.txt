 Mr. Speaker, some would conclude that Black History  Month comes to a close because we are at the end of February, but the  Congressional Black Caucus wants the Nation to know that we are  prepared to share our agenda all year long.   The Congressional Black Caucus comes to the House floor tonight to  commemorate those brave men and women who came before us to fight for  justice, equality, civil rights, and voting rights for all. These are  men and women who shaped our Nation in the hope it would one day become  a more perfect Union for all Americans, no matter their creed or color.                                time  2045    I want to thank our Congressional Black Caucus chairman, Congressman  Cedric Richmond, and our Special Order Hour coanchors, Congresswoman  Stacy Plaskett and Congressman Marc Veasey, my classmate, for hosting  tonight's important discussion.   Mr. Speaker, you see, I grew up reading about soldiers of justice  like Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Nat Turner,  Crispus Attucks, and so many more.   Then, Mr. Speaker, I lived through the legacy of legends and civil  rights leaders like Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and  Coretta Scott King, Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz, Congresswoman Shirley  Chisholm, Maya Angelou, James Baldwin, and Fannie Lou Hamer, all heroes  and sheroes that allowed me to stand on their shoulders, to stand with  them to continue to fight for justice and equality.   Today, we stand up during Black History Month, as 49 members of the  Congressional Black Caucus, 49 strong, making our place in American  history as African Americans, members like the iconic Assistant Leader  James Clyburn, who you will hear from tonight; Congressman John Lewis;  Chairman Cedric Richmond; Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who serves as  the ranking member on the prestigious Financial Services Committee;  Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, the 21st national president of Delta Sigma  Theta Sorority; Senator Kamala Harris, the second Black woman to serve  in the United States Senate; Congresswoman Robin Kelly, chairwoman of  our healthcare brain trust; and so many more who serve in Congress, and  who served as mayors of cities, mayors like Congressman Emanuel  Cleaver, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, and so many more.   You see, Mr. Speaker, we are a part of that history. We are fighting.  And so I tell you, I end with one of my favorite quotes by Martin  Luther King, Jr.: ``The ultimate measure of a man is not where he  stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at  times of challenge and controversy.''   Well, Mr. Speaker, it is clear that we are in a challenging time with  the new Trump administration, and so I say to you, we are fighting, we  are uniting in a movement to fight for our democracy.
