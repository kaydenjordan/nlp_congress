 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Engel for his friendship  and all his good work over the years, as well. Again, I also thank  Representative Smith, my good friend, for sponsoring this piece of  legislation.   As co-chair of the International Religious Freedom Caucus, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 221, the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat  Anti-Semitism Act.   The Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism was established  by the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act. The Special Envoy develops and  implements policies and projects to support efforts to combat anti- Semitism globally.   This bill elevates the position to the rank of ambassador, directly  reporting to the Secretary of State, sending a clear message to the  world regarding our commitment to combating anti-Semitism.   In addition to requiring the position be filled, the bill prevents  the appointee from holding any other office, making this a priority and  ensuring their sole focus is monitoring and combating the scourge of  anti-Semitism.   Throughout history, humanity has experienced tremendous evil, Mr.  Speaker. Our brightest moments as a Nation were those when we  recognized evil and worked together to swiftly and unapologetically  defeat it. Our darkest moments were those when we stood by and did  nothing while making excuses for our passivity.   Combating anti-Semitism and promoting human rights are pivotal  components of American diplomacy and foreign policy. Additionally,  dedicated U.S. leadership in this area is crucial, especially at a time  when anti-Semitism around the world is dangerously on the rise.   I urge my colleagues to support this good, bipartisan bill.
