 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2132, the Traveler Redress  Improvement Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, the American flying public has seen many changes in how  aviation security is handled since the devastating morning of September  11, 2001. Among the most prominent changes has been the screening of  passenger names against the so-called no-fly list that contains the  information on tens of thousands of people who are deemed by our  intelligence and law enforcement community as threats to aviation.   H.R. 2132 seeks to ensure a traveler, who has repeatedly received  enhanced security screening at Transportation Security Administration  checkpoints and believes they have wrongly been identified as posing a  threat to aviation security, can receive timely redress from the  Department of Homeland Security's Traveler Redress Inquiry Program, or  DHS TRIP program.   Specifically, this bill directs TSA to ensure that an individual who  has received enhanced screening from TSA more than three times in a 60- day period can access the Department's redress process.   This bipartisan bill, which was unanimously approved by the Homeland  Security Committee on May 3, is informed by the committee's oversight  finding. As such, I support the bill and urge my colleagues to join me  in passing this measure to increase transparency and accountability on  behalf of travelers.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 2132, the Traveler Redress Improvement  Act of 2017, would improve DHS redress processes for passengers who  have repeatedly been selected for enhanced security screening and feel  they have been wrongly identified as posing a threat to aviation  security.   While TSA has a duty to protect classified and sensitive information  from those who wish to do us harm, we must ensure TSA's operations are  transparent as they can be for the vast majority of passengers who are  simply trying to travel from point A to point B with as little stress  as possible.   Before I yield back, I thank Subcommittee Chairman Katko and Ranking  Member Watson Coleman for their long and enduring work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 625, the Reporting Efficiently  to Proper Officials in Response to Terrorism Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, the REPORT Act creates an important new congressional  oversight process with respect to incidents of terrorism on U.S. soil.  H.R. 625 requires the Department of Homeland Security, the Department  of Justice, the FBI, and, as appropriate, the National Counterterrorism  Center, to submit an unclassified report, which may be accompanied by a  classified annex, to Congress within a year of the completion of an  investigation of an act of terrorism.   The report to Congress must outline the facts and information related  to the terrorist act but may also discuss national security gaps that  come to light in the investigation that may be addressed by changes in  law enforcement practices or changes in the law.   The gentleman from California (Mr. Aguilar), introduced the REPORT  Act to ensure that this body has the benefit of learning, long after  the press attention has moved to other matters, the facts surrounding  terrorist incidents.   The legislation is informed by the gentleman's experience as the  representative for San Bernardino, California, which, of course, was  the target of a vicious December 2015 attack that resulted in the death  of 14 innocent victims.   I would note that, in order to protect any ongoing investigation or  prosecution, the congressional notification can be waived if doing so  presents a danger of interference to any ongoing terrorist  investigation.   As a cosponsor of H.R. 625, I strongly believe that this legislation  will enhance our ability as Members of Congress to help heal our  communities after an attack and help prevent future terrorist attacks  to keep Americans safe.   I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Aguilar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 625 is an important piece of  legislation that has strong support on both sides of the aisle.   Effective communication and unity of effort is critical immediately  following a terrorist attack. It is our duty as Members of Congress to  give law enforcement space to do their investigation but then, when the  facts are known, to get them and then use that knowledge to inform  policymaking. H.R. 625 seeks to do just that. As such,  [[Page H4978]]  I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 625.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2283, the Department of  Homeland Security Morale, Recognition, Learning and Engagement Act of  2017.   Mr. Speaker, since its inception in 2003, the Department of Homeland  Security has faced a number of challenges, one of the most prominent  being managing a workforce of more than 240,000 employees.   I am pleased to see that, after 6 straight years of decline, DHS  employee engagement and participation scores have improved by 3  percentage points each in the latest Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey.  However, DHS still ranks amongst the lowest of Federal agencies in  employee morale.   It has been a personal priority of mine to examine the root cause of  DHS's longstanding employee morale problems and find ways to move the  Department in a positive direction.   My legislation, the DHS MORALE Act, does just that by authorizing  DHS-wide employee engagement, leadership development, rotational  opportunities, as well as an employee engagement steering committee.   Additionally, H.R. 2283 authorizes an annual employee award program  to recognize employees who make significant contributions to the  Department's operations.   Finally, H.R. 2283 adds transparency and fairness to DHS's  disciplinary process by directing an independent, Department-wide  review of how discipline is applied by components.   This legislation, which is cosponsored by every Democratic member of  the committee, has received tremendous support from the labor  organization representing the DHS workforce.   I include these letters of support in the Record.            American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                                                        May 1, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland           Security, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bennie Thompson,      Ranking Member, House of Representatives, Committee on           Homeland Security, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson: On behalf       of the 80,000 employees at the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) represented by the American Federation of       Government Employees, AFL-CIO, I express our union's support       for the DHS Morale, Recognition, Learning and Engagement Act       of 2017, or the DHS MORALE Act. The DHS MORALE Act accurately       recognizes that the contributions of the DHS workers and       their unions are essential to addressing serious and       sustained morale issues.        Each year reports and surveys confirm the sad state of       morale among DHS employees who are on the front lines of       national security. Given the diversity in mission, duties,       and experience, their direct input is necessary to address       issues of importance to their colleagues, including fair       treatment and that their voices are heard by management.       Steps to resolve these issues will enable the workforce to       better serve the public.        The DHS MORALE Act is a good first step in resolving       institutional issues that hamper the workforce that protects       the homeland. AFGE supports these efforts.            Sincerely,                                                 J. David Cox, Sr.,      National President.                                   ____                                   National Border Patrol Council,                                                     April 17, 2017.      Hon. Bennie Thompson,      Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member Thompson: On behalf of the members of       the National Border Patrol Council, I write to support your       legislation, ``The Department of Homeland Security Morale,       Recognition, Learning, and Engagement Act of 2017.'' Your       bill is a step  [[Page H4982]]       forward to improve employee morale amongst Border Patrol       Agents.        We are especially pleased that the bill addresses two       issues requiring immediate attention, accountability and       mobility. An independent audit of DHS disciplinary processes       would end DHS's current penchant for punishing line agents       more severely than managers for the same offense. A uniform       and transparent system would hold those accountable for       violations of law and policy, while also ensuring due process       for employees and accountability from the top down.        The proposed Employee Engagement Steering Committee would       give line agents another tool to express limitations on       issues such as career progression and mobility to CBP       management. Too often, newly hired agents are promised they       will be able to move from a duty location to another after a       few years. Unfortunately, that just isn't the case. Many are       effectively stuck in a location and end up leaving the agency       altogether out of frustration. Simply put, the lack of       current employee engagement causes the Border Patrol to lose       good agents, and consequentially, threatens the security of       the border.        I appreciate your leadership to protect the rights of       federal employees and look forward to continuing to work with       you to find a solution. Thank you for your efforts and for       considering our comments.        With kindest regard I am,                                                    Brandon Judd,       President, National Border Patrol Council                                   ____                                               The National Treasury                                                 Employees Union,                                                     April 21, 2017.      Hon. Bennie Thompson,      Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representative, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member Thompson: On behalf of the 25,000       Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officers and trade       enforcement specialists at the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) who are stationed at 328 land, sea and air       ports of entry represented by the National Treasury Employees       Union (NTEU), I am writing to thank you for introducing the       ``Department of Homeland Security Morale, Recognition,       Learning and Engagement Act of 2017'' or the ``DHS MORALE       Act.''        Low morale has been a consistent challenge at DHS. Factors       that contribute to low morale are echoed in the 2016 Office       of Personnel Management's Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey.       Though DHS has made some gains in 2016, it remains the lowest       ranked large agency for employee engagement, global       satisfaction and inclusiveness.        The DHS MORALE Act proposes to improve morale within the       DHS workforce by conferring new responsibilities to the Chief       Human Capital Officer, establishing an employee engagement       steering committee, requiring action plans and authorizing an       annual employee award program.        Even though the major factors contributing to low morale at       CBP ports of entry are insufficient staffing and resources,       the provisions in the DHS MORALE Act will help address non-      staffing issues that affect employee morale by improving       frontline employee engagement and establishing an annual       awards program that emphasizes honoring non-supervisory       employees. Importantly, your bill ensures that the       perspective of frontline employees is considered by, and       fully integrated into the Department's workforce activities.        NTEU greatly appreciates your leadership on this important       issue and stands ready to work with you to pass this       legislation.            Sincerely,                                                Anthony M. Reardon,                                                National President.     My legislation sends a positive message  to the DHS workforce that their contributions to the DHS mission are  valued and they have not been forgotten as they endure new stresses and  challenges under the Trump administration.   My legislation is intended to advance greater employee engagement,  leadership development, and workforce planning at the Department of  Homeland Security. This legislation seeks to equip DHS leaders, such as  the Chief Human Capital Officer, with the necessary tools to promote  employee engagement, learning, and morale.   The MORALE Act was unanimously approved by the full committee on May  3, and for good reason. It has wide bipartisan support.   Given the criticality of the DHS mission and the increasingly scarce  availability of resources, it is essential that the DHS workforce be  prioritized, as they are responsible for carrying out a diverse range  of programs to make our country safe.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 2283.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2190, the Streamlining DHS  Overhead Act. Each year, the Department of Homeland Security spends  nearly one-fourth of its entire budget on acquisitions.   DHS has a vast and diversified portfolio of assets and real property.  Given the importance of these assets to DHS' mission, it is essential  that DHS manage its real property investments efficiently and  effectively. This legislation establishes a chief facilities and  logistics officer to not only oversee real property, but to seek  efficiencies in how the properties are managed.   H.R. 2190 also requires a 5-year regional real property strategy to  help decisionmakers pinpoint opportunities to reduce overhead costs  through co-location or consolidation efforts. This bipartisan bill was  approved unanimously by the Committee on Homeland Security on May 3.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge passage of H.R. 2190, Streamlining  DHS Overhead Act. Enactment of this legislation conveys our interest in  ensuring that the Department makes smart choices when it comes to  managing its vast real estate property portfolio.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
