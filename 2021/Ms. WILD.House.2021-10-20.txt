 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. It is an honor to  be part of the Special Order hour, it is an honor to be called feisty,  and it is an honor to follow my good friends and colleagues,  Representative Frankel and Representative Schakowsky as they talked  about different aspects of the care economy. Representative Frankel was  focused on childcare. She, of course, has grandchildren and is very  focused on the care that they are receiving.   Madam Speaker, I want to tell a personal story, because it is  something that I, frankly, having had this experience, this issue of  the care economy might not resonate as much with me as it does.   In 2014, my mother was diagnosed with brain cancer. She was an  incredibly independent woman, had always had a career until she  retired, lived alone, gardened, took care of her home, and was, in all  respects, somebody that, quite frankly, my sister and I thought was  going to live to be 100. She was 82 at the time. Everything changed on  a dime.   She was diagnosed with brain cancer in the summer of 2014. We, her  daughters, were told that she had a pretty short time left to live. And  it was a shock, nothing that we could in any way have planned for or  anticipated or made prior arrangements. But we knew that it was  incredibly important that we bring her to one of our homes for the  remaining weeks or months that she had to live. So she was transported  to my home where we had home hospice care for her.   I worked full-time as a lawyer at the time. My sister worked full- time. Obviously, our first concern was our mother, but both of us also  had careers and bills that had to be paid, that we had worked for for  so many years. And so what ended up happening was that we engaged home  healthcare workers to help us take care of our mother. It was only  because of those tireless home care workers that were with her at her  bedside during the night so that I could sleep, providing essential  care, and it was only because of them that my family and I could rest  somewhat easier knowing that mom had the help and the resources that  she needed around her.   I can tell you, quite honestly, that we would not have made it  through those months had we not had the benefit of home healthcare  workers. And I have to tell you, again firsthand, watching a parent or  a loved one suffer is hard enough, but those workers--and they were all  women, I might add--who came into our home, made it just a little bit  easier for me and for my sister and the rest of our family, knowing  that she had a team of hardworking caregivers by her side through her  sickness.   We know that home care workers have been on the front lines this past  year. We have heard a lot about it. Quite honestly, until the pandemic,  I don't know that we ever really heard much about home care workers,  but they cared for our most vulnerable population. They put themselves  and their families at risk. They did this while earning near poverty  wages.                                time  1800    We know that home care workers are three times as likely to be living  at or near the poverty line, with many of them struggling to afford  their own healthcare while they provide essential services to the  elderly and disabled Americans.   One home healthcare worker in my district who cares for a young man  who is disabled told me that she has not taken a single day of vacation  time in more than 10 years. She is a young woman, but she has been  working for a long time. She hasn't taken a single day off. This kind  of thing is completely unacceptable.   I stand with them in their call for a long-overdue raise, improved  worker benefits, and the opportunity to organize and collectively  bargain.   None of us are able to anticipate when we are going to need this kind  of care for somebody in our family. It happens, as it always does, when  you least expect it.   This is the smart thing to do. We have the opportunity now at a  pivotal time. By the way, as our Nation grows older, the need for this  critical workforce is only going to grow.   The commonsense investments that we are talking about as being part  of the Build Back Better Act are absolutely commonsense investments  that will create jobs but will also provide the necessary support both  in terms of healthcare support and emotional support for families that  our aging population is going to require.   For too long, this population of workers has been underpaid and  undervalued, and that has to end with the Build Back Better Act.    Madam Speaker, that is what we experienced. She was  hospitalized for a full month before we brought her home for hospice  care, during which she underwent all kinds of, frankly, unnecessary  interventions that the facility was required to do. She was in daily  physical therapy, which was almost ludicrous for a woman who had just  weeks left to live. Yes, the cost factor to Medicare is significant as  well.
