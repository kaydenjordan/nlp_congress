 Mr. Chairman, as a member of the subcommittee, I rise  today to discuss the importance of the Financial Services and General  Government bill, FSGG.   First, I would like to thank Chairman Quigley for his leadership on  the subcommittee and for his work on the bill. I would also like to  thank Ranking Member Graves for all that he has done to ensure this  bill receives its proper airing and reaches the floor and for his  support on several provisions in the bill.   The FSGG bill supports a broad range of functions and services in  both the executive and judicial branches that are essential to the  operation of our Federal Government. The FSGG bill supports programs  that assist and protect the public, such as shielding consumers from  defective and dangerous products, assisting small businesses, investing  in distressed communities, and ensuring the integrity of Federal  elections. This bill includes significant funding to support these  critical functions.                                time  1530    One especially important provision the workers in my district  appreciate is the increase in the Federal civilian pay by 3.1 percent  in FY 2020. This pay increase means so much to the hardworking men and  women in our Nation who struggle to make ends meet while serving our  Nation. For far too long, Federal workers have been shortchanged by the  work they do, and their wages have not kept up with the changes in our  country's cost of living.   Importantly, this FSGG bill is also about improving our economy. From  increased funding for the IRS to assist taxpayers and bolster  enforcement, to supporting the Small Business Administration to help  small businesses develop and expand throughout the country, this bill  will make our economy stronger for everyday Americans.   Mr. Chairman, another important program I would like to highlight in  the bill is the funding for the Office of National Drug Control Policy.  My home State of Pennsylvania, like so many others across the Nation,  has suffered severely from the effects of the opioid crisis. To help  combat this crisis, the ONDCP receives $100.5 million for the Drug-Free  Communities  [[Page H5109]]  program, along with $300 million for the High Intensity Drug  Trafficking Areas program in the bill.   Notably, these funding levels are a rejection of the administration's  proposed transfer or elimination of the ONDCP grant programs. It is  vital that we continue to support these programs, which help fight  addiction issues in communities across this Nation.   Finally, this FSGG bill takes an important step in improving election  security and integrity. In the last Presidential election, we saw  unprecedented interference with our election system, an issue that we,  as a Congress, must address in the strongest of terms in support and  defense of our national sovereignty. We cannot, and will not, allow any  foreign power to harm our democracy. It rests solely in the hands of  the American people.   To that end, the FSGG bill provides $600 million to the Election  Assistance Commission. This commission deals with issues that are  extraordinarily important to this Nation, conducting reliable, secure,  and accessible elections. The integrity of American elections should  not be a partisan matter.   Mr. Chairman, for these reasons, I am proud to support this bill as  it comes to the floor today, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
