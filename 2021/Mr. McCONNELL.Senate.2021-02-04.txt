 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Madam President, this pandemic hit our Nation with  compounding layers of crisis. American families have faced a health  crisis, a jobs crisis, a small business crisis, an education crisis,  and, frankly, a social  [[Page S415]]  and community crisis--all piled on top of one another.   In response, Congress has built the largest Federal response to any  crisis since World War II--by far. In the last 11 months, we have  passed five major bipartisan rescue packages that sent about $4  trillion to fight the virus and to help American families.   For context, total net spending by the entire Federal Government back  in 2019 was $4.4 trillion. We have borrowed and spent almost as much  fighting COVID-19 as the Federal Government spent on everything in  2019. Our national debt is now larger than the size of our entire  economy for the first time since World War II.   This crisis has been historic. So has the Federal response. The  American people deserve for the conversation about the next steps to  begin with them and their needs--not partisan rush jobs, not talking  points. We need to start with the needs of our country. The most recent  package, another $900 billion, was literally passed 6 weeks ago--just 6  weeks ago.   Let's talk about, then, where we are right now. On the health front,  we have come through a terrible year. We have lost more than 450,000  Americans and counting. But our healthcare heroes held the line. The  genius of science plus Operation Warp Speed produced vaccines in record  time. The science and Operation Warp Speed produced vaccines in record  time. This administration's stated goal of 1 million shots per day is  exactly the pace they inherited from the prior team.   As we speak, nearly half of the money Congress has sent for testing  and about two-thirds of our funding for vaccine distribution is still  in the pipeline. That money has yet to be spent.   Let's talk about jobs. Last year, States had to take one of the best  job markets in American history, with layoffs and firings at 20-year  lows, and literally slam on the brakes to protect public health.   We spent historic sums to soften that blow. Two waves of direct  payment hit families' bank accounts. Multiple rounds of the Paycheck  Protection Program have helped small business workers stay employed. We  passed and extended extra Federal jobless benefits. As a result, even  as economic production fell last year, total personal income actually  went up. We saw the largest annual increase in disposable income in  almost 40 years. Household savings have shot up. Things are even  looking up in the service sector, where literally yesterday a key  measure of optimism hit a 2-year high.   There is no doubt that some families are still struggling. This isn't  finished, but experts agree the remaining damage to our economy does  not require another multitrillion-dollar, nontargeted bandaid.   Then there is education. Temporary emergency measures have sadly  become an enduring new normal for our students, parents, and teachers  as well, but, again, the horizon looks bright. Mounting evidence  confirms that in-person schooling is remarkably safe with smart and  basic precautions.   Let me say that again. The Biden administration's own scientists say  school can be quite safe and kids should be back in person. Dr. Fauci  says:         We need to try and get the children back to school. It's       less likely for a child to get infected in the school setting       than if they were just in the community.    The new CDC Director, Dr. Walensky, says:         I . . . want to be clear that there is increasing data to       suggest that schools can safely reopen, and that safe       reopening does not suggest that teachers need to be       vaccinated . . . [as] . . . a prerequisite.    These experts are not looking at hypothetical data conditioned on  Congress pouring even more huge sums into schools. They are describing  the science right now. They are describing the science right now.   Just 6 weeks ago, Congress sent another huge sum to help schools. It  brought the total for K-12 to about $68 billion. As of the latest  update, only $4 billion of the 68 had been spent. Ninety-four percent  of the K-12 funding we have already provided is still in the pipeline,  unspent.   So our Nation stands at a turning point on all these fronts. A dark  year is in the rearview mirror. Brighter days are already starting to  dawn, and much of the groundwork for a strong recovery is already in  place.   It will not serve Americans to pile another huge mountain of debt on  our grandkids for policies that even liberal economists say are poorly  targeted to current needs. It will not serve Americans to ram through a  one-size-fits-all minimum-wage hike that CBO says would kill more than  a million jobs for the most vulnerable workers, affect States  unequally, and already has bipartisan opposition.   This is no time to send wheelbarrows of cash to State and local  governments that simply, factually, do not need it. Nonpartisan  economists say States and localities are already ``well positioned to  weather the storm,'' with ``additional needs that are far less than the  $500 billion . . . in the Biden [plan].''   By the way, State and local tax receipts already fully rebounded-- fully rebounded--in quarter three to their highest level in American  history.   This is no time to ignore the science on school safety in order to  chase moving goalposts from Big Labor and pour endless sums into school  districts that unions will not allow to reopen.   If you combine the Democrats' new proposal with what just became law  6 weeks ago, the Democratic law plus this new proposal would dwarf the  size of the CARES Act, which sustained the country through months of  lockdowns   This is not the time for trillions more dollars to make perpetual  lockdowns and economic decline a little more palatable. Let me say that  again. This is not the time for trillions more dollars to make  perpetual lockdowns and economic decline a little more palatable. This  is the time to focus on our smart, targeted bridge to the day when we  end this chapter and win this fight.   Notwithstanding the actual needs, notwithstanding all the talk about  bipartisan unity, Democrats in Congress are plowing ahead. They are  using this phony budget to set the table to ram through their $1.9  trillion rough draft.   Last year, the Democratic leader kept saying we need a true,  bipartisan bill. He said: ``Sitting in your own office, writing a bill,  and then demanding the other side support it is not anyone's idea of  bipartisanship.'' That was the Democratic leader last year. Well, that  was then; this is now. Now Democrats reject the bipartisan approach  that built all five of our historic COVID packages. All five of them  were bipartisan.   So let's hope President Biden remembers the governing approach he  promised and changes course. In the meantime, if we are to debate this  phony, partisan budget, we will create some clarity for the American  people. We are going to put Senators on the record.   Expect votes to stop Washington from actively killing jobs during a  recovery, like terminating the Keystone Pipeline; that job-killing,  one-size-fits-all minimum-wage hike; and whether to bar tax hikes on  small businesses for the duration of this emergency.   Expect votes that would help target this plan towards Americans'  needs, issues like stimulus checks for illegal immigrants, pouring  money into schools where unions are blocking reopening, and the  commonsense step of delaying new spending until existing funds have  actually gone out the door.   We will see what this resolution looks like on the other side and  what signals Democrats send to the American people along the way.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 889 and I  ask that it be reported by number.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk will report the amendment by number.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an       amendment numbered 889.    The amendment is as follows:   (Purpose: To improve the resolution.)   (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of  Amendments.'')    Colleagues, what they have done here is to reverse  three important amendments that were adopted on a bipartisan basis.  They, in effect, have taken out the proposal that prevented checks from  going to illegals, they have taken out support for fracking, and they  have taken out support for the Keystone Pipeline So they are trying to  reverse what they previously adopted along with us on a bipartisan  basis.    I would urge the adoption of my amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 889
