 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this  amendment, which I coauthored with my colleague from Washington.   A female pediatrician and female nurse working together to write  legislation, this has literally never happened before in this body.                                time  1915    Our amendment ensures that trauma and behavioral health specialists  are included as healthcare professionals in the section of this bill  intended to strengthen our healthcare system's response to domestic  violence.   Behavioral healthcare, of course, includes mental health as well as  treatment for substance abuse disorders. Both are particularly  important to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating  violence, and stalking. Mental healthcare can be lifesaving for  domestic violence survivors. Survivors  [[Page H3059]]  are three times more likely to meet criteria for post-traumatic stress  disorder. They are also more likely to have suicidal thoughts and to  attempt suicide. Mothers who experience domestic violence are nearly  twice as likely to develop post-partum depression than those who don't.   Access for treatment for substance abuse is also critical for  domestic violence survivors. Survivors experience substance abuse  disorders at rates two to six times higher than average.   Violence against women isn't just a women's issue. It is a children's  issue, it is a men's issue, it is a family issue, and it is an economic  issue. That is why it is so important that our healthcare system take a  comprehensive approach to its response.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support our amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the recent Federal Government shutdown  was the longest in our Nation's history. It was reckless, and it was  dangerous. It hurt our Nation's security, it hurt Federal workers, and  it hurt our most vulnerable populations, including survivors of  domestic violence and abuse.   My amendment would direct the Department of Justice to report to  Congress the effects of the shutdown on DOJ's efforts to disburse VAWA  and VOCA funding. This funding provides services to prevent and respond  to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.   This amendment is in direct response to months of conversations with  domestic violence shelters and agencies that serve my community in  Illinois's 14th District and to the urgent need in all of our  districts.   I am thankful to my colleagues from Illinois and Pennsylvania for  their support as cosponsors.   Over the past month, we have worked to understand how the shutdown  affected our ability to respond to domestic violence. Let's be clear.  Everyone wants domestic violence victims to get the support they need.  But that didn't happen during the shutdown, and we don't know why not.  We have been told there was about a 2-week period at the beginning of  the shutdown where DOJ employees who help process VAWA and VOCA grants  weren't able to work. We know grantees were warned about a delay in  processing their funding, and we have been told that those DOJ  employees were expected and allowed to return to work at some point  during the shutdown.   But that is not enough. We need to know what happened so that we can  make sure it doesn't happen again.   I want to share the stories that I am hearing from shelters in my  district about how the shutdown affected them, because their  experiences are unacceptable. Family Shelter Service, a domestic  violence agency, serves my constituents in DuPage County, Illinois.  During the shutdown, they had to turn away 138 members of my community  who were seeking safety at the shelter. Because of the shutdown, Family  Shelter Service had to hold off on filling four open positions for  employees that were funded by VAWA and VOCA. Three of these positions  were for child counselors. The shelter reports that this directly led  to a decrease in the number of children whom they were able to help.   I also represent McHenry County in Illinois. It is a big county, but  it only has one domestic violence agency called Turning Point. In 2018  alone, Turning Point served more than 1,700 people, and 170 of those  were children. Fifteen percent of Turning Point's funding comes from  VOCA. They shared with me that because of the shutdown, they had to  stop referring survivors for individual counseling because of the lack  of resources.   Now, Illinois has some supplemental sources of domestic violence  funding, but many States rely almost completely on Federal funding.  Failure to maintain and protect these Federal funding streams literally  puts lives at risk.   Resources for domestic violence survivors and the organizations that  help them are already stretched too far and too thin. It is our fiscal  and moral responsibility to ensure that their funding is not  interrupted again.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to support my amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
