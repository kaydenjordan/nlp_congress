 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a very  special day for a woman in my district, but I also want to say how  joyful it is to see people's faces and smiles now that we are following  the science and not fining the science.   I am rising today to celebrate a very special day for a woman in my  district. Last week on June 8, Clarissa Rozenboom of Oskaloosa, Iowa,  celebrated her 100th birthday. Clarissa was  [[Page H2756]]  born and raised on a farm in Mahaska County, Iowa, and is the oldest of  five siblings.   In the 1930s many children who were raised on farms elected not to  attend high school, but Clarissa was inspired by her aunt to not only  attend high school but to continue her education through courses at  William Penn University, which is still in Oskaloosa today.   In the early 1940s, her love for children and teaching led her to  pursue a career in education at Bryan County school, a small school  south of New Sharon.   On August 14, 1945, Clarissa married her husband, Gerald, and  together they had six children: Allan, Calvin, Norman, Kathleen, David,  and Ken, who is a State senator and my colleague in the State senate in  Iowa.   Clarissa, I wish you all the joy in the world as you celebrate this  with your loved ones.                            ____________________
