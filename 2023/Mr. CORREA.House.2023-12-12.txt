 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Monica Lee Silbas  and her successful career serving others. She is a Santa Ana girl, I am  proud to say, who made it big in Washington, D.C.   Mr. Speaker, we back home are very proud of Monica. Her passion for  advocacy has made her work a defining voice within the labor movement.  As part of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace  Workers, her labor leadership led to the development of their Spanish  leadership program.  [[Page H6822]]    She currently serves on the boards of the Labor Council for Latin  American Advancement and the IndustriALL Global Union where her voice  impacts the lives of millions of workers across the globe.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Monica for her dedication to the community and  to the global labor movement.   I congratulate Monica on her retirement, and I wish her the best of  luck. I know she is not done, and she will continue to work like all  good Santa Ana girls do.                    Honoring the Career of Guadalupe Gomez     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of  Guadalupe Gomez, my good friend and president of La Federacion de  Zacatecanos del Sur de California.   Lupe has spent 31 years working for the federation, as an organizer  in a group that aims to help people on both sides of the border, the  United States and Mexico, through economic development.   In the past 2 years as president of La Federacion, Lupe has renewed a  call for cooperation and mutual assistance across the border.   From establishing new outreach programs for young people to  strengthening programs like food banks to building up communities and  relationships here in the U.S., Lupe has been very impactful on both  sides of the border.   Lupe is my very good friend, and we thank her for her service and  dedication to the wonderful community of Zacatecanos, both in the  United States and in Mexico.   Let's keep that good work up.                            ____________________
