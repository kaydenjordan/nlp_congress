 Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for October 2019. This is my first scorekeeping  report since I filed the deemed budget resolution for fiscal year 2020  on September 9, 2019, as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019,  BBA19. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues  with the amounts agreed to in BBA19. In the Senate, this information is  used to determine whether budgetary points of order lie against pending  legislation. The Republican staff of the Budget Committee and the  Congressional Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to  section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, CBA. The information  included in this report is current through October 11, 2019.   Since I filed the deemed budget resolution, only one measure with  significant budgetary effects has been enacted. That measure, the  Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Health Extenders Act of 2019,  PL 116-59, provided continuing appropriations for discretionary  programs through November 21, 2019, Division A, and extended several  expiring health programs, Division B. Division A was charged to the  Senate Appropriations Committee, while Division B was charged to the  Senate Finance Committee. As the direct spending and revenue components  of the measure were offset over the 2020 to 2024 and 2020 to 2029  periods, a deficit neutral reserve fund was used to accommodate the  budgetary effects of this measure pursuant to section 3005 of H. Con.  Res. 71--115th Congress--the concurrent resolution on the budget for  fiscal year 2018, as updated by BBA19.   Budget Committee Republican staff prepared tables A-D.   Table A gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee  exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays  under the fiscal year 2020 deemed budget resolution. This information  is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of  the CBA. I am pleased to report that for this reporting period, all  authorizing committees have complied with their allowable spending  limits for each enforceable period.   Table B provides the amount by which the Senate Committee on  Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This  information is used to determine points of order related to the  spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. The table shows  that the Appropriations Committee is also compliant with spending  limits for current the fiscal year. Those limits for regular  discretionary spending are $666.5 billion for accounts in the defense  category and $621.5 billion for accounts in the nondefense category of  spending. As no full-year appropriations measures have been enacted for  fiscal year 2020, the amounts shown on the table reflect the budgetary  authority effects of advanced or permanent appropriations made  available in prior law.   The 2018 budget resolution contained points of order limiting the use  of changes in mandatory programs, CHIMPs, in appropriations bills.  Table C, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15 billion for 2020, shows  the Appropriations Committee has not yet enacted full-year CHIMPs for  this fiscal year.   Table D provides the amount of budget authority enacted for 2020 that  has been designated as either for an emergency or for overseas  contingency operations pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced  Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. Funding  that receives either of these designations results in cap adjustments  to enforceable discretionary spending limits. There is no limit on  either emergency or overseas contingency operations spending; however,  any Senator may challenge the designation with a point of order to  strike the designation on the floor pursuant to current budgetary  statute.   In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress.   CBO provided a spending and revenue report for 2020, which helps  enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA  section 311. In its report, CBO annualizes the temporary effects of the  latest continuing resolution, which provides funding through November  21, 2019. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the Budget  Committee excludes this temporary funding. As such, the committee views  current-law levels as being $1,181.3 billion and $668.8 billion below  budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays,  respectively. Details on 2020 levels can be found in CBO's second  table.   Current-law revenues are consistent with the levels assumed by the  budget resolution.   Social Security levels are consistent with the budget resolution's  figures for all enforceable periods.   CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate  pay-as-you-go--pay-go rule. This rule was established under section  4106 of the 2018 budget resolution. The Senate pay-go scorecard shows  that there is currently a zero balance.   This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget  enforcement activity on the floor since the enforcement filing on  September 9, 2019.  [[Page S5832]]  No budgetary points of order have been raised since that filing.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the tables be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   TABLE A.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE                    (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS                         [In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                        2020      2020-2024    2020-2029 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and  Forestry     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Armed Services     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Commerce, Science, and  Transportation     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Energy and Natural Resources     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Environment and Public Works     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Finance     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Foreign Relations     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Judiciary     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Rules and Administration     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Intelligence     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Veterans' Affairs     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Indian Affairs     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0 Small Business     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................            0            0            0                                   --------------------------------------     Total         Budget Authority.........            0            0            0         Outlays..................            0            0            0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ This table is current through October 11, 2019 This table tracks the   spending effects of legislation enacted compared to allowable levels.

Therefore, the amounts shown in this   report do not include $562 million in budget authority and $854   million in estimated outlays. \b\ For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget   Act in the Senate, the resolution, as unmoved by the Senate, does not   include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts.   As a result, amounts in this current level report do not include those   items. \c\ Section 204 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 requires the Chair   of the Senate Committee on the Budget to publish the aggregate   spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2020; those aggregate   levels were first published in the Congressional Record on September   9, 2019. The Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget has the   authority to revise the budgetary aggregates for the budgetary effects   of certain revenue and spending measures pursuant to the Congressional   Budget Act of 1974 and H.
