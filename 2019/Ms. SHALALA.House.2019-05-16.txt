 Mr. Chairman, this amendment expresses the sense of  Congress that the secretary should not do anything that prohibits State  insurance commissioners from allowing for so-called silver loading.  [[Page H3868]]    Let me walk you through how we got to this point. Because while  silver loading has worked to keep costs on the exchange lower for folks  who get subsidies, it has only been used because the President was  actively trying to kill the Affordable Care Act.   In 2017, the President decided to stop reimbursing health insurance  companies for what are called cost-sharing reductions, or CSRs.   CSRs are payments that health insurance companies are required to  make to help low- and moderate-income people afford healthcare.   Under the Affordable Care Act, the health insurance companies must  help people that have more affordable, and, possibly, no co-pays or  deductibles.   The Federal Government was supposed to reimburse insurance providers  for making these payments; however, in October of 2017, the  administration stopped making these payments.   This was a deliberate attempt to make health insurance on the  exchange unaffordable, and undermine, weaken, and attack the Affordable  Care Act.   In response to this, States let health insurance plans do what is now  called silver loading. State insurance regulators, in a desperate and  creative attempt to stabilize the insurance marketplaces, allowed  insurance companies to bill the unpaid CSR costs into their silver  plans on the exchange. This was a very creative attempt to stabilize  the insurance market.   This wasn't the solution that anyone wanted, but it is a solution  that has worked and has created some stability and predictability in  the insurance market in the face of an administration that seeks chaos.   Because the tax credits are benchmarked to the silver plan, silver  loading has meant that most who receive subsidies did not see an  increase in their health insurance premiums.   In fact, new data shows that 2.6 million healthcare.gov consumers are  now paying lower premiums as a result of silver loading.   States that allowed for silver loading as a way to cope with the  manufactured chaos that the administration tried to inflict on the  market, actually saw an increase in enrollment in the exchanges.    Mr. Chairman, the administration must stop trying to  sabotage the Affordable Care Act.   My amendment expresses that it is the sense of Congress that the  secretary of Health and Human Services shall not do anything to  prohibit the use of silver loading, a program designed by the States to  stabilize the health insurance marketplace.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
