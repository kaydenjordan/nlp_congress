 Mr. Speaker, 2 months ago on October 7, Hamas  launched an unprovoked attack on Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis,  subjecting women to barbaric sexual violence, taking hostages, and  upending the lives of so many innocent civilians. These attacks are  abhorrent.   The images, videos, and stories of the victims have rocked the world  and impacted each of us. We must be unequivocal in condemning Hamas.   That is why I led 87 colleagues in a bipartisan letter to U.N. Women  after they still have not publicly condemned Hamas for these attacks  and sexual violence against women.   They have since reversed course, but their silence for nearly 2  months leaves a stain on their mission as a leader on women's issues.   I will keep working to hold the Iranian regime accountable for their  backing of Hamas terrorists behind these attacks, and I stand with  Israel and our Jewish community always.                            ____________________
