 Mr. President, today I rise to speak on a couple of  topics, but first, I want to take this opportunity to thank really an  icon in our State, and that is West Virginia State Senate Pro Tempore  Donna Boley. She is a good friend of mine, and she is now in her 10th  term. She is the longest continuously serving member in our State's  State senate. At one point in history, Donna Boley was the only  Republican. She was the ranking member on every single committee and  the lead Republican, as she was the only one in the early nineties.   I want to thank her for her service, for her service to our State,  which began in 1985, and wish her all the best as she presides today-- she is presiding today--over the West Virginia State Senate.   So, Donna, way to go. Really proud of you. You are a role model for  every woman who is watching and certainly young girls as well
