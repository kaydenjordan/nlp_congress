 Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition. I am  opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment is an attempt by the  Democrats to rewrite private contracts and put private lenders out of  business, accomplishing their goal of socializing all student loan  debt.   This amendment authorizes between $45 and $50 billion of taxpayer  dollars to cancel or substantially lower private student loans. But it  does not require that a student borrower demonstrate a financial need  for such support, and the amendment does not credit students that have  already paid off their student loans as required. It picks winners and  losers at taxpayer expense.   The amendment directs Treasury to provide up to $10,000 for every  single private borrower to be used toward private education loans, even  if there is no demonstrated financial need for support. It wrongly  assumes all private student loan borrowers have been impacted by COVID- 19 and creates a situation that is ripe for waste, fraud, and abuse.   Every Member of Congress recognizes that student debt is an issue  that must be tackled. However, what is often not mentioned is that the  Federal Government is the largest consumer lender, owning or  guaranteeing $1.4 trillion out of a total of $1.5 trillion in student  debt.   In 2010, Democrats largely nationalized student debt by eliminating  the Federal Family Education Loan Program, where private lenders made  federally guaranteed student loans to parents and students. Now, the  Department of Education and the Direct Loan Program is basically the  only option in the student loan market.   Private student loans make up less than 8 percent of all outstanding  loans, and because student education loans are subject to strong  underwriting standards, those loans from the private sector have a  default rate of less than 3 percent, compared to 18 percent in the  Federal loan program.   I realize that the amendment is attempting to force regulators to  work with the borrowers, but private education lenders already have the  flexibility to work with borrowers to make accommodations, including  under the  [[Page H3377]]  pandemic-related guidance provided by the Federal financial regulators.   When the Federal Government, led by congressional Democrats, took  over the student loan market, costs skyrocketed. This amendment  continues the Democrats' government takeover of the student loan  industry, only making the crisis worse.   Democrats continue to push their socialist wish list, rather than  providing targeted relief for those most in need.   If this program was such a big priority for Democrats, you would  think they would fund it, but they didn't fund it in the FY21  appropriations bill, even though they added $250 billion of new  emergency spending.   I am disappointed to see Democrats pandering to the students for  election-year gains, rather than tackling the important issue of  college affordability.   I would also like to point out that this amendment has no place in  the NDAA. A defense authorization bill should be focused on national  security, the defense and the industrial base, troop levels and  readiness, and the health and safety of our men and women in uniform,  not student debt.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following documents.   The first is a July 15, 2020, letter from the Consumer Bankers  Association to Rules Committee Chairman McGovern, requesting that the  Dean amendment not be made in order in H.R. 6395.   The second is a document compiled by the Consumer Bankers Association  summarizing the steps taken by private student loan lenders to help  their customers, as of June 30, 2020.                                    Consumer Bankers Association,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2020.      Hon. Jim McGovern,      Chairman, Committee on Rules,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McGovern: On behalf of the Education Funding       Committee of the Consumer Bankers Association (CBA), we ask       that you oppose making in order Amendment 283 proposed by       Representative Dean to H.R. 6395, the William M. (Mac)       Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for       Fiscal Year 2021. This amendment to the CARES Act would make       major changes that would significantly impair the entire       private student loan market. It is clearly not related to       national defense programs and is not germane to the NDAA. The       proposal in modified form was considered and included in the       HEROES Act, H.R. 6800, as part of measures recommended by the       Financial Services Committee. In short, this amendment does       not belong in the NDAA.        The procedural and jurisdictional questions aside, the text       of the Dean Amendment 283 was considered and rejected in its       current form as part of the HEROES Act. We would like to       point out what we believe are serious flaws in the proposal.        First, I wish to note that the members of CBA appreciate       the accomplishments of this Congress in passing bi-partisan       legislation providing help to Americans suffering from the       health and economic effects of the COVID-19 Coronavirus,       including passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Response, and       Economic Security (CARES) Act.        Our members are doing their part with diligence and       compassion to help their customers who are impacted by the       effects of the pandemic. This includes major steps to assist       private student loan borrowers, with thousands helped to       date. However, we are concerned that the provisions of this       section would, if enacted, dramatically hinder our members'       ability to provide financing to our nation's students in the       future.        CBA is the voice of the retail banking industry whose       members operate in all 50 states, serve more than 150 million       Americans, and collectively hold two-thirds of the country's       total depository assets. CBA members are also the private       sector lenders that make the majority of private education       loans to help families finance a postsecondary education. At       this time of extreme uncertainty, our banks remain in strong       financial condition and are stepping up to serve the needs of       customers and employees.        The CBA Education Funding Committee includes the banks that       make most private student loans in order to help American       students finance their education. That process has been going       extraordinarily well for years, with the vast majority--98       percent--of borrowers successfully repaying their private       student loans. Our members are working with current students       and their families, many of whom have seen their educations       interrupted or transformed due to the pandemic. There is a       great deal of uncertainty as to when normal educational       processes can resume. Because of that uncertainty, we are       working closely with our customers to make sure they will       have the financing they need to start or continue their       higher educations.        Meanwhile, for borrowers who are in repayment on their       student loans, CBA member banks continue to offer many       options tailored to their needs to make sure they can get       through this period of tremendous uncertainty and turmoil.       Our members are offering special terms, including allowing       expanded forbearance--stopping loan repayment--and other       options that meet the needs of borrowers and co-signers. We       are also allowing borrowers more time to make decisions about       whether to borrow and how much, realizing that families need       to evaluate changing economic and individual family       conditions.        In sum, CBA member banks are doing their best to help our       customers through the crisis and emerge with their       educational plans intact and their financial situations       manageable. Banks are working, as they must, with prudential       regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection       Bureau, Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the       Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as       well as state regulatory agencies, on allowable steps that       can be taken to help borrowers now.        Given the steps being taken by the private sector, we wish       to alert you to the fact that some of the proposals contained       in the Dean Amendment number 283 would significantly disrupt       the private student loan market. We have offered to work with       all interested Members on substitute legislation that would       help student loan borrowers and avoid steps that will make it       impossible for banks and other private lenders to offer their       customers the private loan options they can access today.       Such proposals should be considered as part of COVID-19       relief legislation, not as part of the NDAA.        The Dean amendment would have the Secretary of the Treasury       make monthly payments for private education loan borrowers       totalling up to $10,000 until September 30, 2021. This step       would require extensive, complex coordination and across-the-      board servicing system changes at a time when financial       institutions, like other parts of the economy, are coping       with workplace challenges. However, CBA members would work       with their customers and the Treasury Department to implement       such a policy, should Congress decide to proceed, through an       appropriate legislative vehicle, and set up a process for the       payments to be made by the government to lenders on behalf of       borrowers.        The amendment in the fall of 2021 would give all private       student loan borrowers $10,000, less payments previously made       on their behalf. CBA is concerned that a lump sum payment       made more than a year from now will have little impact on       helping our country recover from the emergency. Moreover,       this minimum amount provision is untargeted since it would be       made after the emergency period and without regard to whether       the borrower is actually experiencing any repayment       difficulty. Therefore, we believe any relief should be       tailored to the government making monthly payments for those       in need during the emergency period. We agree that any such       payments made on behalf of a borrower should not be counted       as income for tax purposes.        Most importantly, the amendment includes an unworkable       provision that would require private lenders to change       millions of contracts with borrowers to include the Revised       Pay As You Earn option that the federal government offers       some federal loan borrowers. This proposal would require       private lenders to offer the same income derived repayment       (IDR) plans, including forgiveness after 20 years of payments       for undergraduates or 25 years for loans for graduate       studies, as are offered by the Department of Education. While       an IDR/loan forgiveness program is an appropriate safety net       for loans without any meaningful upfront consumer       protections, it is not suited to private loans made with the       most critical upfront consumer protection: evaluation of       ability to repay.        The federal government currently dominates student lending,       originating 92 percent of new loans made each year. These       loans provide access to higher education, but because there       is no consideration of ability to repay or credit       underwriting, they put some students into excessive       indebtedness with unaffordable monthly payments.        Private loans play an important role in providing access to       higher education, typically supplementing federal aid and       always involving a careful assessment of credit capacity and       ability to pay. That is why 98 percent of private loans are       being successfully repaid, while a quarter of federal loan       borrowers are not making any progress towards reducing their       loan balance. We strongly oppose applying repayment policies       that may address over-lending of federal loans but that are       not anchored to safety and soundness principles that       consistently assure responsibly underwritten private loans       that are being successfully repaid.        Importantly, private loan lenders, working closely with       their prudential regulators, have developed well-targeted       repayment relief options that effectively assist customers       experiencing repayment difficulty. Private loan lenders       provide short- and long-term forbearances, as well as loan       modifications that lead to affordable loan payments. These       solutions appropriately balance consumer protection and       safety/soundness principles in support of customer repayment       success. In this respect, the proposal to require a well-      functioning private loan market to function like the vastly       different federal loan market is nothing more than a solution       in search of a problem.        The government keeps non-performing loans--millions of       them--on its books for decades before giving up on       collection. Banks that engage in such practices would be       quickly ordered to stop by their federal  [[Page H3378]]       regulators and would likely face sanctions. If a loan isn't       being repaid, banks must account for it on their balance       sheets. Under federal IDR rules, a borrower can make no       payments but still be considered current, with their loan       cancelled after 20 or 25 years. That is not possible for any       private lender under the sensible safety and soundness       practices required by their prudential regulator.        In short, the proposal to apply repayment policies       developed to remediate the absence of an ability to repay       evaluation for federal loans to a market that leverages safe       and sound underwriting to consistently drive repayment       success would not only signifcantly disrupt exisitng       contracts with borrowers but would almost certainly force a       signficant reduction in access to private loan credit. CBA       members recognize the severity of the hardship many Americans       are facing in the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus       pandemic. All CBA members are working with their customers to       help those who are experiencing difficulties or delays in       making student loan payments. Banks since the start of the       crisis have been enhancing the options available to their       customers to help them manage their finances. For many       borrowers, it's financially better to keep making payments in       order to pay off their loans as soon as possible. Others need       more flexibility, and they are getting it.        We understand the desire of Congress to help student loan       borrowers and to take measures that will stimulate the       economic recovery once the emergency concludes. Banks are       doing their part in working with our customers individually       to help. Unfortunately, the Dean Amendment would force many       banks into an impossible position with their prudential       regulators and force banks to stop offering student loans to       their customers. This is a major change in the law that does       not belong as part of the NDAA.        Thank you for your consideration of our views. We would be       pleased to answer your questions and to work with you on ways       to assist our country recover from the effects of the       pandemic.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard Hunt,                                                  President and CEO,      Consumer Bankers Association.                                   ____    Summary of Steps Taken by Private Student Loan Lenders To Help Their                                 Customers                           [As of June 30, 2020]         Private student loan lenders have continued since the start       of the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis to work closely with their       customers to make sure they have the assistance they need to       handle any financial disruptions. It is in the mutual       interest of lenders and borrowers to work together to get       through the economic difficulties caused by the emergency.        Although very few private loan borrowers were having       trouble with their loan payments before the COVID-19       emergency, with less than 2 percent of loans charged off and       less than 3 percent 90 days delinquent, as soon as the       economic fallout from crisis became apparent, banks put plans       in place to help their customers. Those plans were activated       across the country so that borrowers can get the payment       relief they need. Banks are constantly reviewing the       situation and making changes as needed.        The following is based on a confidential survey of the       Consumer Bankers Association's Education Funding Committee,       which includes the banks that make most private student       loans. The survey was first conducted April 1-8, 2020, and       conducted again June 5-17, 2020. The second survey found that       policies in place in April remained in place, with some       additional measures added.        Banks are continuing to allow their borrowers to suspend       payments simply by asking. Documentation is not required. No       fees or penalties are being assessed. 90 days is the most       common length of time requested and granted. Extensions are       available if needed. Bank are instituting a policy to keep       loans that were past due when the emergency began from       becoming more delinquent.        Most private loans are co-signed, meaning the co-signer       becomes responsible for the loan if the borrower defaults,       but the banks are not attempting to collect from co-signers       of loans where payments have been suspended. In other words,       assistance given to the borrower is applied to the co-signer.        There were significantly more requests for help than normal       during March and mid-April, mainly from borrowers seeking       repayment relief. Banks granted them forbearance. Requests       have levelled off for most, with the main requests being for       a continuance of forbearance or other assistance previously       granted.        Some banks are following common forbearance practices and       continuing to charge interest while payments are deferred,       and some are not. Those that do charge interest during the       forbearance are not planning to capitalize it when payment       restarts.        It is common for automatic payment arrangements to stop       during a period of forbearance. Most banks are either       retaining the discount for paying via ACH or, if the discount       is stopped, will reinstate it after payments resume.        Tens of thousands of borrowers have been helped.        Lenders are not taking court action such as lawsuits to       collect overdue loans.        Lenders either offer loan modifications to distressed       borrowers or are developing or considering modification       options. The modifications being offered are mostly the same       as those usually available, but some banks are instituting or       are in the process of instituting additional modifications.        Examples of Modification options offered are:        Interest rate reductions to lower monthly payments;        Extending the loan term to lower monthly payments;        Additional forbearance beyond the 90 days initially offered       due to COVID-19.        Other COVID-19 related assistance examples:        Option to skip payments without penalty;        Allowing partial payments;        Waiving late fees;        Extending forbearance beyond 90 days if needed;        Suspending involuntary collection efforts.        All lenders offered forbearances retroactive to the start       of the national emergency.        Lenders are providing ongoing COVID-19 related information       to their customers via multiple channels, telling them to       contact their servicer or lender if they need assistance. A       variety of ways to contact the lender/servicer are available:       website, phone, IVR, messaging/chat, and email. Not all offer       all those options but all offer most of them.        Lenders are offering help to their communities. For       example, one bank donated $1 million to food banks in five       states.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just remind my  colleagues of the real purpose of this amendment. It is just to  socialize the entire student loan industry.   Rather than working to address the underlying causes of the student  loan crisis, my colleagues believe the Federal Government should take  over the entire program. This is the exact opposite of what we should  be doing. We should be analyzing the causes of rising tuition. We  should be strengthening the underwriting standards used by the Federal  Government. The private sector should be held out as a model, not as a  scapegoat.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
