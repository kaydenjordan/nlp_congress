 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we got some good news over the weekend with  the announcement that the President  [[Page S1815]]  and Speaker McCarthy had reached an agreement on debt ceiling  legislation. The bill they agreed on, the Fiscal Responsibility Act,  will increase the debt ceiling and finally--finally--after 2 years of  out-of-control spending, begin to rein in our Nation's budget.   I am tremendously grateful to Speaker McCarthy and to House  Republicans for their tireless work to make sure that any legislation  to raise the debt ceiling was paired with meaningful spending reforms.  The Fiscal Responsibility Act cuts discretionary spending next year and  then limits discretionary spending increases to 1 percent each year  over the subsequent 5 years. It claws back unspent COVID funds, repeals  excess IRS spending, and ends the student loan repayment moratorium,  which is currently costing taxpayers $5 billion a month.   In fact, the bill rescinds more unobligated government money than any  bill in American history. It also places into statute pay-go rules on  the executive branch which would require government Agencies to  accompany new spending proposals with proposals that would save  taxpayer dollars.   On top of all this, the Fiscal Responsibility Act makes a downpayment  on permitting reform to help get energy projects off the ground more  quickly, which will help encourage domestic energy production and drive  down energy prices for American families. It also strengthens work  requirements in Federal programs to help able-bodied Americans move  from welfare to work.   And while this legislation doesn't go as far as it should and as  Speaker McCarthy wanted, when it comes to funding for needed military  modernization and readiness, the bill does provide an increase in  defense funding and avoids a continuing resolution, while leaving open  the possibility of supplemental funding as needed. And it is worth  noting that this is the first time in recent history we have increased  defense spending while decreasing nondefense spending.   Perhaps just as important as what is in the bill is what is not in  the bill: tax increases. Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans held  the line and ensured that the debt ceiling increase was not used as a  vehicle to collect more taxpayer money, and they also ensured that the  bill did not contain any new government programs.   Now, is this a perfect bill? Does it have everything Republicans  would like included to get our Nation's fiscal house in order? No, it  doesn't. But perfect bills are rare, and they are even more rare in a  time of divided government. This is a good bill and, thanks to the  efforts of Speaker McCarthy, a better bill than we might have hoped  for. Let's not forget that Democrats wanted to pass a debt ceiling  increase without any spending reforms at all. This bill may not be  perfect, but it makes a real start at getting spending under control.   Now, our efforts can't end with this bill. Our national debt has  already exceeded the size of our economy, and the interest on our debt  is going to consume a greater and greater share of the Federal budget.  On our current trajectory, within a few short years, we are going to be  spending more just meeting the interest on our Nation's debt than we  will on national defense. By 2044, we will be spending more on interest  than on Medicare. And by 2050, we will be spending more on interest  than on Social Security.   Think about that for just a minute: more on interest than on Social  Security. Social Security is the largest line item in our Nation's  budget and consumes approximately one-fifth of total Federal spending  each and every year. The very fact that our national debt is on track  to grow to the point where we are paying more just on interest than on  Social Security should be a wake-up call to lawmakers in both parties  that spending reform has to be a top priority here in Washington.   And let's be very clear: We have a spending problem, not a revenue  problem. Tax revenues in 2022 reached a multidecade high of 19.6  percent of our gross domestic product, which is well above the  historical average. We are not suffering from a lack of revenue.  Federal spending, however, has soared to unsustainable levels. The  Federal budget for 2023 is up approximately 40 percent from 2019, the  last budget before the pandemic--a 40-percent increase going back to  2019. That is just not sustainable; it is not.   And whatever Democrats may say, we are not going to be able to fund  that kind of reckless spending by taxing better-off Americans. We just  flat have to get spending under control.   Now, any American who has ever found himself or herself mired in  credit card debt knows that serious debt has serious consequences. Our  national debt is already reducing the economic growth that we could  otherwise achieve, and if our debt continues along its current  trajectory, the consequences will be severe: diminished economic  opportunities and growth and increasing difficulty meeting our  government's most basic responsibilities, from national defense to  Social Security and Medicare.   The best thing that we can do for the future of our country and for  hard-working American families is to get our Nation's spending under  control. So I want to once again express my gratitude to Speaker  McCarthy and House Republicans for ensuring that the debt limit  increase that we will be voting on is matched with real spending  reforms. They have achieved an important victory, and I hope that the  Fiscal Responsibility Act will be just the first step in a larger  campaign to get our Nation's fiscal house in order and ensure a better  economic future for the American people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Tillis).   Further, if present and voting: the Senator from North Carolina (Mr.  Tillis) would have voted ``yea.''   The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 46, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 134 Leg.]                                  YEAS--51       Barrasso      Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Britt      Budd      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Manchin      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Mullin      Murkowski      Paul      Ricketts      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Sinema      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tuberville      Vance      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--46       Baldwin      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Fetterman      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Lujan      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Smith      Stabenow      Van Hollen      Warnock      Warren      Welch      Whitehouse      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--3       Bennet      Tillis      Warner   The motion was agreed to.                            ____________________
