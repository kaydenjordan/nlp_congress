 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am delighted that the Senate is  taking up four very important appropriations bills, one of them I  discussed at length last week; that is, the Transportation-HUD  appropriations bill, which I authored along with my ranking member,  Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. In forging that bill, we gathered  information from 75 of our fellow Senators, who had 950 requests. We  went through each of the requests very carefully, and we have built a  bill that is truly bipartisan, that reflects the priorities of this  body, and that I trust will be approved as part of this package later  this week.   I also want to take the opportunity today, as I am managing the four  bills in the unavoidable absence of the full committee chairman,  Senator Shelby, to talk about some of the other appropriations bills  that have been brought before us.   As the Presiding Officer is well aware, the Appropriations Committee  is a committee that makes a real effort to work together to put aside  petty partisanship and, instead, listen to one another and work for the  common good. We make an extraordinary effort to find common ground. How  I wish that could be done throughout Washington today. But the  Appropriations Committee remains a bastion of common sense, of  collegiality, and of working together to seek common ground. That is  why we have had such success in reporting so many of the appropriations  bills, and I am very proud that the T-HUD bill, as we call the  transportation and housing bill, was one of those that was reported  unanimously by a vote of 31 to 0.   For the next few moments, I would like to talk about another bill  that had unanimous support on the committee, and that is the CJS  appropriations bill--Commerce, Justice, and Science.   Let me begin by acknowledging the hard work of the chairman, Senator  Moran, and the ranking member, Senator Shaheen, for their work in  balancing the many priorities that are included in this bill. Once  again, we saw the chairman and the ranking member working together as a  team in a bipartisan--indeed, a nonpartisan--way in order to find  common ground.   I would like to comment on a few of the provisions of the bill that I  think are particularly important. First, I am encouraged that the bill  continues to provide strong support for the National Sea Grant College  Program, despite the administration's desire to eliminate this program.  The committee actually provided an increase of $7 million over last  year's funding level. The University of Maine Sea Grant Program is a  [[Page S6209]]  national leader in ocean research and, as you know, is very important  to the Presiding Officer from Florida as well.   (Mr. SCOTT of Florida assumed the Chair.)   Within the sea grant program, there is $2 million for critical  lobster research, building on the $2 million that was included last  year. The sea grant program recently announced seven research awards  supported by this funding, four of which were awarded to Maine entities  in recognition of their extraordinary expertise and research. These  investments will help us to better understand how the lobster stock is  reacting to changing environmental conditions and ensure that this  iconic industry--indeed, one of the very symbols of the State of  Maine--continues to thrive.   The problem is that we are seeing increasing warming of the Gulf of  Maine. In fact, it is warming the second fastest of any body of water  in the world. That has brought new kinds of sea life; for example,  there is an invasive green crab that has never existed in Maine waters.  So we are watching the impact very carefully, particularly on our  lobster industry.   I am also glad that the bill prioritizes the development of  technologies to better track the right whale population. The number of  right whales is problematic. While it is not as low as it was a few  years ago, it is still troublesome that the population continues to be  under stress.   NOAA Fisheries has targeted the Maine lobster industry with  potentially very onerous right whale regulations, despite the  government's inability to adequately monitor the movement of these  right whales.   We must better understand where the right whales are and where they  are not. This, too, is important in terms of our warming waters. The  major food supply for the right whales has moved to the north toward  Canada, and that is why the entanglements we have seen--which we all  deplore--have involved Canadian gear. I think that is very important to  recognize.   There have also been some Canadian ship strikes. Our lobster men and  women have been such careful stewards of the resource, and that has  been true for generations. Lobstering is often a family business,  passed on from generation to generation. The lobster men and women of  Maine care deeply about our lobster stocks and about ensuring that  lobsters are there for generations to come. They have been  extraordinary conservationists. They invented the V-notching of  lobsters, the sizing to make sure that lobsters that are big and  breeders are tossed overboard or those that are too small are returned  to the water. Unfortunately, our Canadian counterparts often do not  follow those same cooperative conservation measures, and there is an  area off the coast of Maine that is known as the gray zone, where it is  in dispute whose waters--whether it is the United States or Canada's-- the gray zone is.   We will find American and Canadian lobstermen, both in that area or  close by, with our lobster men and women following strict conservation  methods, such as throwing back the lobsters that are too small or the  big breeder lobsters, only to see their Canadian counterparts keep  those lobsters and, in some cases, they are undoubtedly the very  lobsters that have been thrown back into the sea by our lobster men and  women. So those conflicting conservation measures between American and  Canadian fisheries have caused Mainers to grow increasingly concerned  that their Canadian counterparts are threatening the sustainability of  critical fishing stocks, as well as that fragile right whale  population.   The bill that has been reported by the Appropriations Committee  encourages NOAA to work cooperatively with State, national, and  Canadian fishery officials on these important issues.   I also want to express my thanks to the subcommittee for rejecting  the President's proposed elimination of the Economic Development  Administration, known as the EDA, and instead providing a reasonable  increase. The investments made through the EDA provide vital financial  support for rural Mainers to boost economic growth and create more  jobs. It has been an essential partner with States, with local  governments, and with the private sector in boosting areas of Maine's  economy.   The bill also focuses attention on an issue that I know the Presiding  Officer is very aware of because of his membership on the Aging  Committee, which I am privileged to chair, and that is the serious  problem of financial fraud directed at our seniors. The GAO, a few  years ago, estimated that our seniors lose nearly $3 billion a year to  financial fraud. I think that is just the tip of the iceberg because  many seniors are too embarrassed to report the fraud they have  suffered. It is important. It is vital that the Justice Department  continue to fight financial fraud.   I am delighted that the former Attorney General, Jeff Sessions,  implemented my recommendation that every U.S. attorney's office should  have designated a financial fraud attorney who can bring cases and help  to protect our seniors. We need to aggressively prosecute illegal  robocallers and increase efforts to collect unpaid fines and penalties  imposed on them by Federal agencies. It is only our national efforts  that can go after a call center that is located in India, for example,  as some of them have been. While to the Justice Department, the  individual amounts may seem small, they are devastating to a senior who  has worked hard to save money for their retirement years. In addition,  when you aggregate all those losses, they result in literally billions  of dollars.   The bill also provides increased investments to law enforcement at  all levels--partnerships that are especially critical to preventing the  heroin and opioid epidemic that plagues my State of Maine and many  others. Naming just a few, the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Program and  the Drug and Veterans Treatment Courts are essential to the  multifaceted approach it will take to stem this epidemic.   I appreciate that the subcommittee has once again rejected cuts to  the COPS Anti-Heroin Task Force, a program that has helped Maine's Drug  Enforcement Agency target illegal opioid sales.   I want to finally highlight the increased funding for the Byrne-JAG  and COPS hiring programs, and for the Regional Information Sharing  Systems known as RISS. Many of Maine sheriffs have come and talked to  me about the importance of the RISS Program. It supports a cooperative  effort of information sharing to fight crimes at all levels and has  been particularly useful to Maine's rural counties. There are also  important investments supporting the FIRST STEP Act, which we passed  late last year. It will help implement the goals of the new law,  particularly with respect to rehabilitative programs at the Bureau of  Prisons. We need to make sure those who are being released from our  jails and prisons have the skills and tools they need to pursue a  lawful life and not resort to their previous habits that landed them in  jail. That is why the educational and job training programs we have in  Maine and elsewhere are so important and will be expanded by this bill.   Those are just a few of the terrific provisions that are in the CJS  appropriations bill. Again, I commend the chairman, the ranking member,  and the entire Appropriations Committee for their hard work.    Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that rather  than recessing at 12:30 p.m., we recess at 12:35 p.m.    Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the  comments that were just made by the Senator from Texas on the important  issue of lowering the cost of prescription drugs. Not only the Finance  Committee and the Judiciary Committee but also the Senate Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee have all reported good bills  that would help provide relief from the ever-escalating costs of  prescription drugs.   Like the Senator from Texas, I, too, have introduced a bipartisan  bill with Senator Tim Kaine to prevent the gaming of the patent system  in which a brand-name pharmaceutical company will wait until the last  moment and then erect a thicket of new patents precisely to prevent a  lower cost generic or biosimilar from coming to the market.   It is a shame that apparently the minority leader is blocking bills  from coming to the floor in this area despite their widespread  bipartisan support, according to what the Senator from Texas has just  said. This is an issue we should address. Ninety percent of our seniors  take at least 1 prescription drug, and 36 percent of them take 4 or  more in a month's time, and they are particularly burdened by the high  cost of prescription drugs.   I, too, have looked at the manufacture of HUMIRA, the best-selling  drug in the world--a drug that brings some $18 billion in profit to  AbbVie, the manufacturer. That is fine that AbbVie has been able to  recoup the considerable R&D that went into what truly is a miraculous  drug for people with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and some  inflammatory bowel diseases, but when the patent period has expired,  they should not be allowed to block a lower cost generic or in this  case biosimilar from coming to the market. Yet that is exactly what has  happened.                               Aviation Safety    Mr. President, let me turn to speak on another important issue that  is addressed in the Transportation appropriations bill that is on the  Senate floor right now, and that is aviation safety. I know the  Presiding Officer has done a great deal in this area, and the CEO of  Boeing is testifying on Capitol Hill today.   The importance of aviation safety in light of the crashes of the two  Boeing 737 MAX aircraft cannot be overstated. Last October, Lion  Airlines Flight 610 crashed shortly after takeoff in Indonesia, killing  all 189 passengers and crew on board. Just 5 months later, in March of  this year, an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed and killed 157  passengers and crew. It is simply unacceptable that both of these  crashes involved the same aircraft, the Boeing 737 MAX, and were likely  caused because of the new system known as MCAS, as well as the pilots'  unfamiliarity with the system and a lack of training. More egregious  was the fact that the changes that were made to MCAS sectors  certification for this system had already been delegated by the FAA to  Boeing. It is clear that Boeing did everything it could to avoid having  to provide additional training or make pilots even aware of the MCAS  system.    Like the Presiding Officer, I have met with some of the families of  the victims of these crashes, and their pain and grief are truly  heartbreaking. I am committed to ensuring that we never experience  anything like this ever again.   As chairman of the T-HUD Subcommittee, I have been working with my  ranking member, Senator Jack Reed, to do our part in improving aviation  safety. We need to hold accountable not only Boeing but also the FAA  and any other entities that may have played a role in these crashes.   In July, our T-HUD Subcommittee held an oversight hearing of the FAA  where we questioned the Acting Deputy Administrator and the Associate  Administrator for Aviation Safety on the agency's review of the MAX  aircraft, as well as the agency's aircraft certification processes.  Since that time, numerous recommendations have been issued by the  National Transportation Safety Board and the Joint Authorities  Technical Review, which consisted of technical experts from leading  international aviation regulators.   First and foremost, it is imperative that both Boeing and the FAA  admit the mistakes made with the MAX aircraft and remedy those serious  errors in order to gain the public's trust in the aircraft again. Just  today, Boeing's CEO testified before Congress and admitted that Boeing  ``made mistakes and got some things wrong.'' However, we have yet to  hear what specific changes the FAA will require from Boeing prior to  bringing the MAX back into service and what long-term changes they will  make to their aviation and aircraft certification process.   Ranking Member Jack Reed and I continue to send letters and inquiries  to the FAA for additional information regarding the agency's  Organization Designation Authorization Program, or the ODA Program, as  well as statements made by FAA officials at our July hearing, which  appeared to be incomplete at best and possibly outright wrong.   We need to make sure the FAA is a check on the delegation process--a  true check--and is not captured by the industry that it regulates.  Safety has to  [[Page S6219]]  be the No. 1 priority for FAA--way ahead of making sure that  manufacturers can meet their deadlines for aircraft delivery. Safety  has to come first.   As a result of the work we conducted on our T-HUD Subcommittee and  our oversight hearing, Ranking Member Reed and I have provided  increased funding for aviation safety and aircraft certification  activities. The need for additional staffing has been confirmed by the  Joint Authorities Technical Review report, which determined that FAA's  certification office for Boeing had inadequate staff involved in the  MAX certification program.   In addition, the Joint Authorities found that FAA needs to expand its  staffing for human factors and human system integration work as it  relates to aircraft certification. In other words, if there is a new  system, we cannot allow training on that system to be bypassed and  mention of that system to not be included in the manuals that accompany  the aircraft. Pilots have to know, going into that cockpit, exactly  what could happen, and they need training on simulators.   Clearly, a lot of work needs to be done on this issue. I believe we  have taken some important first steps in the T-HUD bill that is before  us.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation  with my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Tina Smith, to help prevent  drug shortages. Our legislation has the support of the American  Hospital Association, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the  American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Society of Health- Systems Pharmacists, Premier, and the Institute for Safe Medication  Practices.   I often hear from patients, pharmacists, and physicians who find  themselves caught in the middle of a drug shortage, with very little  certainty of when the problem might be resolved.   For example, Wayne is a kidney and bladder cancer patient who called  my Portland office about a shortage of BCG. Wayne received several  treatments, went into remission, and then was declined additional  preventive treatments that his doctor recommended due to this shortage.  Wayne sees his physician every 90 days, but he lives with the constant  fear that his bladder cancer could return, and the time and uncertainty  between his appointments weigh heavily on him.   I have also heard from patients living with a rare immunological  disorder called Mast Cell Activation Syndrome who were affected by an  IV Benadryl--diphenhydramine--shortage, as well as an Epi-pen shortage.  One of these patients, a former nurse, spoke about the helplessness her  family felt in trying to manage the shortage and was incredulous that  shortages like these could be happening in a country like ours. She  said, ``I am an in-charge kind of person, but I cannot fix this.''   Physicians and hospitals try their best to manage these shortages  behind the scenes but are understandably frustrated. Drug shortages add  $230 million a year to U.S. drug costs and $216 million a year in  increased labor costs. One of Maine's largest health systems reports  that they address approximately two new impactful shortages a week and  have had to commit 3.5 unbudgeted full time employees to address them.   Another health system was experiencing 11 critical shortages and 30  less critical, ongoing shortages. For one drug, the hospital pharmacist  was able to procure a supply of the drug in shortage but had to switch  to a more expensive product at ten times the cost.   Our legislation, the Mitigating Emergency Drug Shortages Act of 2019,  takes several steps to help FDA manage drug shortages. In the event of  a likely drug shortage, our legislation gives FDA the authority to  prioritize  [[Page S6246]]  review of abbreviated new drug applications and manufacturing  inspections. It also improves the timely and effective coordination  between those conducting manufacturing inspections and the FDA Office  of Drug Shortages.   Our bill strengthens reporting requirements for pharmaceutical  companies to disclose the root causes and expected duration of  shortages. It also requires manufacturers to have contingency and  redundancy plans to ensure the ongoing supply of essential medications.  This is critical as we learn the lessons from Hurricane Maria in 2017  in Puerto Rico. Approximately 10 percent of drugs prescribed in the  United States are manufactured in Puerto Rico.   Our bill also requires the Departments of Health and Human Services  and the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a risk assessment of  national security threats associated with the lack of adequate domestic  capacity and capability for the manufacturing and distribution of  certain critical drugs, their active pharmaceutical ingredients--APIs-- and associated medical devices used for preparation or administration.  Today, China and India are the world's largest suppliers of active  pharmaceutical ingredients.   Finally, our legislation requires the Secretary to develop  recommendations to incentivize manufacturers to enter the market for  shortages as well as improve consumer notification of drug shortages.   I thank Senator Smith for joining me in this effort to help combat  this stubborn and persistent problem for patients and physicians. I  encourage my colleagues to support its adoption.   Thank you,                                  ______                                         By Mr. INHOFE:   S. 2731.
