 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to this  underlying piece of legislation to ensure that it applies to  everything. I don't believe that we should be in the business of  exempting certain executive orders. I think they should apply across  the board.   My amendment would strike the exceptions to the bill's inflation  estimates for executive orders that provide emergency assistance or  relief or related to national security.   I don't believe that we should be pulling out of the calculation  those executive orders that touch on national security simply because,  frankly, often my colleagues on both sides of the aisle want to be able  to use ``emergency'' for all manner of sins, and they want to be able  to use the Defense Department to hide behind all manner of sins and  expenditures.   The underlying bill is actually an important piece of legislation,  despite what my colleague from Maryland is saying.   Why? Because the executive orders being offered by this  administration, and frankly by many administrations, do have an actual  and significant inflationary impact.                                time  0945    We are allowing the executive branch to run amuck. We are allowing  the executive branch to essentially legislate and make massive policies  that have an enormous impact on everyday, hardworking American people.   That is why this legislation is important. Unlike our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle who like to use the power of government to  be able to actually put gasoline on the fire of inflation by spending  more money, by engaging government into the business of the American  people, we want to be able to look at information about what government  is doing to cause the problem in the first place.   For example, the President's executive order on vaccine mandates. You  don't believe that had a massive inflationary impact to go around this  country, forcing people to stick a needle in their arm or lose their  job, causing all sorts of constraints in labor supply, making it  difficult for people to carry out their jobs?   You don't believe that the executive orders on minimum wage, the  executive orders on the Keystone pipeline, and other limitations on  Federal oil and gas leases, the executive orders with respect to WOTUS  and NEPA and all sorts of environmental rules and regulations that  restrict the ability of the American people to create wealth, create  jobs, create opportunities; you don't believe those create inflationary  impact?   Of course they do. Our job in Congress is to check the executive  branch. Our job in Congress is to stand up for the American people and  get the government out of their lives.  [[Page H981]]    This amendment is designed to make sure that we are going to apply it  equally to all manners of the executive orders produced by the  President, regardless of party. We believe that it is critically  important.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky  (Mr. Comer), my friend.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining?    Mr. Chair, the question seems to be about we have nothing  allegedly in the cupboard, nothing to offer. I think there is plenty to  offer.   How about stop spending money we don't have? How about stop dumping  trillions of dollars into the economy, jamming up inflation?   How about ending all of the subsidies and all of the Federal  expenditures that are undermining the American people's ability to  create wealth and create jobs?   The gentleman talks about the amount of debt that was increased under  President Trump. How about the 43 to 45 percent of our entire debt that  was increased under Nancy Pelosi as Speaker?    Because those are the actual facts, and this is the body that has the  power of the purse. This is the body that starts all the spending. We  know where the spending starts.   The fact of the matter is my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle like to talk about creating 12 million jobs.   First of all, this body doesn't create jobs. The government doesn't  create jobs. The American people create jobs.   The fact is our labor participation rate is still far behind pre- COVID levels. We are basically playing catch-up to the utter  destruction that was levied against the American people by government,  against the American people, shutting down this economy, locking our  kids in the corners, setting our kids back generations in terms of  their academic performance, and criticizing three-page bills.   I will tell you what. It is a far cry better than the 4,100-page,  $1.7 trillion omnibus bill jammed through by the Democrats in December,  destroying this economy.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise here on the floor of the  United States House of Representatives as we celebrate the 200th  anniversary of the Texas Rangers, Texas' oldest law enforcement agency.   I am proud to represent a number of Rangers personally. I am proud to  live in a county named after one of our most famous Texas Rangers. I am  proud to be the descendent of a Texas Ranger. I will have more to say  about all of that in a moment.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Moran), my  friend, to offer his thoughts on the Texas Rangers.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's remarks about the  Texas Rangers. They are such an important organization in the world of  law enforcement. I say that as someone who served in the Office of the  Attorney General of Texas as the first assistant attorney general where  I had a large number of law enforcement, including former Texas  Rangers, working for me.  [[Page H1007]]    I worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office in law enforcement. My  grandfather was the chief of police in a small Texas town, Sweetwater,  Texas, in the 1940s. My great-great-grandfather was a Texas Ranger.   As my colleague from Texas just discussed with respect to the  history, in 1821, Stephen F. Austin, the father of Texas, brought 300  families to settle land in modern-day Texas. There was no regular Army.  Austin assembled a fighting force to provide protection from Comanches  and eventually Mexican raiders, giving rise to the Texas Rangers.   Texans did what sovereign States have done throughout history,  stepping up and protecting our communities. We stood up for the rule of  law when there was none. Much of the action seen by the early Rangers  involved bloody conflicts with Comanche Tribes and gangs of bandits who  threatened the safety of Texans.   In years following, the Rangers proved indispensable during major  events such as the Mexican-American War; the pursuit of the criminals,  Bonnie and Clyde in 1934; and Hurricane Harvey rescue and recoveries  recently in 2017 and now currently today.    As local law enforcement slowly assumed much of the day-to-day  peacekeeping role that the Texas Rangers held before the turn of the  20th century, the Rangers now operate as a key investigative body for  the State of Texas.   Rangers were known for conducting major criminal investigations,  suppression of organized crime, border reconnaissance, SWAT, bomb  squad, Special Rapid Response, crisis negotiation, joint intelligence  center management, and investigation of unsolved crimes.   The impact of the Texas Rangers on the Lone Star State cannot be  understated. My home county, Hays County, is named for John Coffee  Hays, a renowned Ranger, appointed by Sam Houston, who fought one of  the most notorious battles against the Comanche near what is called  Enchanted Rock, in the district I represent a little west of Austin in  Gillespie County.   My great-great-grandfather, John Vaughn Roy, served as a Texas Ranger  in Hays, Travis, and Blanco counties--all three counties I represent  today, protecting my future home where I live now in Hays County, and  holding the line against lawlessness.   To the west, Captain Charles Schreiner of Kerr County, served with  distinction and went on to donate land for the Schreiner Institute  Military School in my district.   Today, I am honored to represent Ranger Ray Martinez, a living legend  in New Braunfels with a long history of heroism and service. The Ranger  spirit is alive and well today in my friend and long-time Texas Ranger  David Maxwell, who I worked with in the Office of the Attorney General  of Texas. He solved the over 35-year-old cold case in the unspeakable  murder of his own sister. That is the spirit of the Texas Rangers.                               time  (1415)    They were men who could not be stampeded. That is how former  Department of Public Safety Director Homer Garrison, Jr., described  them.   They have certainly lived up to that.   With so many other great figures of our history, some today wish to  rewrite the legacy of the Texas Rangers focusing only on the harshest  of narratives from the comfort of modern-day America--a comfort bought  by the sacrifice and the blood of Texas Rangers--all while ignoring  those sacrifices that they made to settle the West and establish the  rule of law.   The Scripture reminds us that greater love has no man than this, that  he lay down his life for his friends.   These heroes wake up every morning and put their lives on the line to  serve and protect their fellow Texans as did their predecessors.   The Texas Rangers are owed a debt of gratitude that cannot be fully  repaid, but today we do thank them, and we congratulate them on 200  years of selfless service.   Tomorrow will be March 2. That is Texas Independence Day.   On February 23, a Mexican force numbering in the thousands and led by  General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna began a siege of the fort. The  Texas forces held out for 13 days outgunned and outnumbered. They were  driven by the cause of liberty and their desire for a free Texas.   William Barret Travis wrote this about the siege:         I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under       Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual bombardment and       cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man.        The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion,       otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the       fort is taken. I have answered the demand with a cannon shot,       and our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall       never surrender or retreat.        Then I call on you in the name of liberty, of patriotism,       and everything dear to the American character to come to our       aid with all dispatch.        The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no       doubt increase to three or four thousand in 4 or 5 days.        If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain       myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never       forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his       country--victory or death.    This week also includes Texas Independence Day as I said. The Texas  Declaration of Independence reads:         When a government has ceased to protect the lives, liberty,       and property of the people, from whom its legitimate powers       are derived, and for the advancement of whose happiness it       was instituted. . . .    The Texas Declaration of Independence states that:         In such a crisis, the first law of nature, the right of       self-preservation, the inherent and inalienable rights of the       people to appeal to first principles and take their political       affairs into their own hands in extreme cases, enjoins it as       a right toward themselves and a sacred obligation to their       posterity to abolish such government and create another in       its stead calculated to rescue them from impending dangers       and to secure their future welfare and happiness.    But what did they declare independence for?   What did Travis and the rest of the Alamo sacrifice for?   A Federal Government that opens our borders to cartels?   A group of Republicans who campaign on securing the border but who  run away in abject surrender refusing to actually do it?   That is the question before us right now. That is the question for  every Member of the Republican Conference.   I am speaking to you: If you do not secure the border now--now--you  are giving up any argument you have for the American people to put  their faith in you.   Will Republicans honor their campaign commitments to secure the  border? Yes or no?   What I am seeing right now from my Republican colleagues does not  give me faith that they will stand up in the breach as did those men  who stood on the wall of the Alamo.   I am tired of words. Things are going to change in this body. If my  Republican colleagues believe that they are going to be moving through  relatively meaningless provisions doing precious damn little for the  very people who sent us here to change things and they think that some  of us are just going to go along for the ride, then they are sorely  mistaken. We will not.   There will be no more games as I saw unfold today on the floor of the  House of Representatives where lies and misrepresentations were made  about legislation, specifically for personal reasons, to take down an  amendment.   This amendment, by the way, was designed to ensure that the executive  orders that are driving up inflation that this majority said they  wanted to expose out of the current President and our Democratic  colleagues on the other side of the aisle would exempt emergency  executive orders and exempt national security-related executive orders,  which are the very kinds of emergency executive orders that have been  killing this country for as long as I can remember and specifically for  the last several years through the COVID pandemic and emergency  responses.   These executive orders force needles into the peoples' arms. They say  ``no'' but then they can't carry out their livelihoods.   This in turn will shrink the labor supply and drive up the cost of  goods and services by shutting down the greatest economy in the history  of the world.   My colleagues on this side of the aisle today ran away--ran away-- from actually holding the executive branch responsible.   Why?   For petty, personal, and political reasons. That ain't gonna fly.  That is not going to be the way this works.  [[Page H1008]]    Leadership is something that is observed and followed. It is not an  anointed position. We did not come to this Chamber to continue to allow  the executive branch to run over the American people.    Sitting today is a young man who served his country and is being  denied his commanding officer job and is being forced to try to pay  back student loans because he dared to say ``no'' to a vaccine mandate  that was politically driven.   What is this side of the aisle doing about it?   Not a damn thing.   What is this side of the aisle doing about open borders?   Nothing. Nothing.   What is this side of the aisle doing about an ATF rule about to make  felons out of 10 million Americans or more?   Nothing.   What is this side of the aisle going to do about spending?   Lip service.   We have a debt ceiling approaching, and we are running around like  chickens with their heads cut off. We should say something right now.  We should pass a bill off this floor saying that we will raise the debt  ceiling but only--only--if you end the disastrous student loans that  are going to cost $400 billion and drive up the cost of higher  education, only if you rescind the $91 billion of unobligated COVID  money, only if you go rescind the $80 billion designed to increase the  IRS to go after taxpayers--including, by the way, more often the  poorest among us and minorities--only if you will return spending to  2022 levels getting our spending back to preCOVID levels and make sure  that we cap spending so we stop funding the woke, weaponized  bureaucracy that is going after the American people.   Do that.   Send that over to the Senate. Send that over to the Senate and make  Chuck Schumer and the President of the United States choke on it  because the American people want us to cut spending right now. They  don't want us dillydallying around going out to focus groups and  talking to Frank Luntz and talking about what the hell we are going to  do with the American people. But that is too often what this body does  and particularly this side of the aisle.   We are not going to have 2 more years of the usual crap that this  body continually engages in.   No more spending money we don't have.   No more allowing lawlessness.   No more open borders.   No more mandates killing the American people.   No more mandates driving up the price of energy by subsidizing  unreliable energy and driving up the cost of that energy.   No more.   We are $32 trillion in debt.   Wide-open borders cause little girls to get sold into the sex  trafficking trade. The New York Times finally wakes up and writes a  story about it this week.   What do we do?   We pass a 3-page bill asking the Democrats to say that we will give  you reports on inflation but not if there is emergency spending,  because everybody has got to have their precious emergency spending.   Oh, gosh, there is a hurricane.   So who cares if it is inflationary?   So you dump $40 million.   Who cares if it is COVID and you dump $5 trillion out in the name of  an emergency crushing the greatest economy in the history of the world?   No, no. We can't have a report like that.   The American people are sick and tired of the same old same old. So  far, 2 months into the 118th Congress, I am not seeing it a hell of a  lot different than the same old same old.   The American people gave Republicans the majority. We ought to darn  well use it. It is time to stand up for the American people, and that  time is now. That time is not tomorrow. That time is not after another  retreat to go figure out how you are going to raise more money. That  time is not after another retreat to go look at poll testing.   Come down to the floor of the House of Representatives, stand up for  the American people who sent you here, and stop playing games with the  election certificate you were given to represent them.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 2 o'clock and 25 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Friday,  March 3, 2023, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
