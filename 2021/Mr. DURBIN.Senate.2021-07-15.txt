 Madam President, I just heard the Republican leader refer  to the American Rescue Plan as a grand socialist experiment. Remember  that plan? That was President Biden's response to the COVID-19  pandemic. How many Republicans voted for it? Not one. Not a House  Member nor a Senate Member of the Republican Member supported it.   So what was in this socialist experiment? Well, the premiere piece  was to make sure we distributed the COVID-19 vaccine to every American.  Obviously, some people think that is socialism. I think it is common  sense. And the more and more Americans who are immunized, the more we  escape the grasp of this pandemic; 99.5 percent of those who are  admitted to the hospital today with serious COVID-19 symptoms are  unvaccinated.   So this was socialism? I don't think so. How about the aid we gave to  small businesses to stay open or reopen? That was in the American  Rescue Plan. That was Biden's plan. There was not a single Republican  vote for it.   Money to help businesses to reopen is socialism? Is that what the  Senator from Kentucky is suggesting? Or how about the fact that today  we are going to see across the United States of America help to  families, middle-income families, working families, low-income families  to raise their children?   So when Donald Trump writes a check for $2,000 to every American  family, that is just fine, but when the Democrats and Biden want to  give money to families raising children, particularly those who are  struggling to raise children, that is socialism? I think not. It is  common sense.   If we really value families, we are going to invest in their future.  And the money that is being sent starting today to these families will  lift half of the children in poverty in America out of poverty for the  first time. That is a dramatic achievement. It should be a bipartisan  achievement. Sadly, it is a Democratic achievement because the  Republicans boycotted the vote over and over.   There is one thing that the Senator from Kentucky fails to mention  when he talks about the budget resolution--maybe two things are worth  saying. First is this budget resolution, which we are going to bring to  the floor next week, according to the leader, is going to do dramatic  things across America in terms of pre-K education, 2 years of community  college and the like. And in this circumstance, it is paid for. It is  all paid for.   So to say it is inflationary is to suggest that it is not paid for as  adding to the debt. Who pays for it? Those making over $400,000 a year  in income and corporations. That is who pays for it. And the net result  of it: The biggest tax cut in the history of the United States for  middle-income and working families. That is the reality.   I am going to yield the floor. I see the Senator from South Dakota  has come to the floor and I know he wanted to speak. We have a few  minutes left. I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, this week the Senate is going to consider  Tiffany Cunningham's nomination to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit.   This is truly historic. Once confirmed, Ms. Cunningham will be the  first--the very first--African-American judge to serve on the Federal  Circuit.   She will not only bring diversity but an amazing set of credentials  to the job. You see, the Federal Circuit is unique among Federal  appeals courts. The jurisdiction of other appeals courts is based on  geography--in other words, where the case arises. The Federal Circuit  is a specialized court, with jurisdiction over particular legal issues,  especially patent law.   This court plays a critical role in ensuring that our innovation  economy can continue to flourish. It requires judges who understand the  complicated law that governs this area and who understand the  experiences of Americans from all walks of life. Ms. Cunningham is that  person. She received her undergraduate degree in chemical engineering  from MIT and her law degree from Harvard Law School. After graduating  law school, she clerked for the Federal Circuit.   Ms. Cunningham boasts years of experience that will serve her well.  For almost two decades, she worked as an intellectual property  litigator in my home State of Illinois.   In that role, Ms. Cunningham cultivated an in-depth understanding of  every aspect of patent litigation, from the filing of the case, through  discovery, trial, and appeal.   She has also represented clients across a number of the fields,  including mechanical engineering, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotech,  computer science, and the automobile industry. Ms. Cunningham's clients  include high-tech and Fortune 500 companies.   Given her experience representing plaintiffs and defendants, she  understands the importance of applying the law evenhandedly.   Her technical expertise, her deep knowledge of patent law, and 20  years of experience as an intellectual property litigator earned her a  unanimous--unanimous--rating of ``well qualified'' from the American  Bar Association.   She received broad bipartisan support in my committee, with five  Republicans joining all Democrats in voting to advance her.   As a judge in the Federal Circuit, Ms. Cunningham will offer a  perspective shaped by personal and professional experience that reflect  the diversity of our Nation.  [[Page S4921]]    Given her years of experience working on issues germane to the  Federal Circuit, she will be ready upon confirmation to hit the ground  running.   Mr. President, at the end of her hearing, I said to her say: ``Why  did you want to do this? Why would you go into public life? It seems  like things are going pretty well for you as a lawyer.''   She said: ``It has always been my dream to serve on this bench.''   Well, I hope her dream comes true and the Senate helps her reach it.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of Ms. Cunningham's  nomination   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the other day I read an article in the  Chicago Sun Times about an incredible Chicagoan named Edith Renfrow  Smith.   Yesterday, Edith celebrated her 107th--let me say that again--107th  birthday. And learning about her life story, it occurred to me that it  is really the story of America. Edith is the grandchild of two people  who were born into slavery. When she was 23, she became the first Black  woman to graduate from Grinnell College in Iowa.   Think about that. In just two generations, her family went from  enduring bondage to earning a bachelor's degree.   After she graduated, Edith traveled east to Chicago in search of job  opportunities. She spent a few years working for the University of  Chicago, and she even served as a secretary for the first Black  Congressman to represent a district north of the Mason-Dixon Line:  Oscar DePriest.   Eventually, Edith found her calling as a public school teacher. She  devoted more than two decades of her life educating our city's  children. One of her colleagues described her as a ``master teacher.''   As a resident of Hyde Park, where she raised a family with her  husband Henry, Edith became close friends with Jazz legend Herbie  Hancock. And in recent years, she has become something of a living  legend herself. In 2019, her alma mater, Grinnell College, opened a new  library named in Edith's honor: the Edith Renfrow Smith `37 Black  Women's Library.   Edith is a humble person. She doesn't claim to know all the secrets  to a long, happy life, like the one she has lived, but she does have a  few suggestions.   She says, ``You have to have respect for yourself.''   ``Don't let anyone disrespect you.''   ``Listen to what people say to each other.''   That advice is worth keeping in mind as we work together in this  Senate to solve the most pressing challenges facing America, like  rebuilding our infrastructure. This body has a once-in-a-generation  opportunity to transform our roadways and public transit systems, to  secure a sustainable future for our children and grandchildren, and to  bring broadband connectivity and clean drinking water to every  community in America.   And while we have a lot of work ahead of us, I am confident that if  we take Edith's advice--if we listen to one another--we can make real  progress for the American people.   Edith, thank you for sharing your inspiring story, and thank you for  choosing Chicago as your home.   I wish you the best on your 107th birthday.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
