 Mr. President, I welcome back my self-described,  hardheaded Republican leader in the Senate.   It is good to see you, Mitch. I'm glad you are back.   I want to welcome Senator McConnell as well as Senator Fetterman, who  will be here today as well.   I spoke to him by Zoom several weeks ago, and I was really heartened  by his message. He had the courage to step up and ask for help when he  faced depression, to seek professional and medical advice, and I could  tell by his responses and the tone of his voice that that decision had  already made a difference in his life for the better.   I told him at the time I was so happy to speak to him personally,  that what he had done publicly to address the issue of his own personal  depression and the overall issue of mental health would save lives  across America. I believe people will be inspired to follow his example  and seek help.   We are, fortunately, living in a time and an age and a generation  where the attitude toward mental health is much different than it was  many years ago.   There was a time when mental illness was considered not just an  illness but a curse, and people didn't speak about it. I know I had  similar examples in my own family of people who were just speaking in  whispers about the issues that related to my relatives.   That is changing for the better. Our honesty and openness in dealing  with mental health makes us a better nation, and people will have  better lives as a result of it.   I thank my colleague Senator Fetterman for stepping up and making the  right decision in his life, and I am looking forward to his return.    I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Ms. Cortez  Masto), the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), the Senator from  New York (Mrs. Gillibrand), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Heinrich),  the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator from Hawaii  (Mr. Schatz), and the Senator from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) are necessarily  absent.
