 Madam Speaker, I rise today to strongly oppose Democrats'  cruel efforts to repeal the Hyde amendment.   My wife, Cathy, and I are proud parents because of two women in  difficult situations who chose life and, through adoption, gave us two  loving sons.   Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has saved the lives of nearly two and  a half million innocent babies, and whether you are pro-abortion or  pro-life, as I am, Americans have always agreed, Washington should not  use their taxpayer dollars to pay for and encourage abortion.   Unfortunately, that is what President Biden is trying to do, repeal  this important humanitarian protection of the innocent unborn.   This is an affront to the majority of Americans who do not want their  tax dollars to fund abortion.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration on the House floor.
