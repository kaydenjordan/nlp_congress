 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, after 7 years of campaigning against the Affordable Care  Act, congressional Republicans have finally produced what they  cynically describe as a replacement plan.   Sadly, however, this bill will unravel all of the progress we made  under the ACA, including expanding access to health insurance to 22  million Americans and improving the quality of coverage and care for  tens of millions more.   It nearly doubles the amount of uninsured people in this country,  guts Medicaid by almost $900 billion, and weakens the Medicare trust  fund.                                time  1130    That was bad enough. But the last-minute changes to this bill are  astonishing and appalling. This legislation now allows insurers to end  coverage for prescription drugs, mental health, maternity and newborn  care, preventive care, emergency room visits, hospitalizations,  outpatient care, rehab visits, lab services, and pediatric care. That  is not progress. That is not a fix. That is a potential health crisis  for every American.   My Republican colleagues are well aware of this. Why else would they  have drafted this bill and these last-minute changes in secret? Why  else would complicated legislation affecting the lives of millions be  sent to the floor just 2 weeks after it was introduced with no  congressional hearings, not a single one, on a bill that impacts the  health care of nearly every American family? Why else would they rush  the bill to the floor without an updated Congressional Budget Office  estimate of how much coverage and care will be lost by their backroom  deal that ends consumer protections?   I get it. I wouldn't want to, nor would I know how to justify giving  nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy paid for  by threatening the health and well-being of millions of American  families.   Who is getting these huge windfalls?   Companies like Amgen, with annual profits of more than $3 million;  Medtronic, with annual profits of more than $6 billion; and Gilead  Sciences, with $13 billion in profits in 2016 alone.   When the CBO released its report last week showing that 24 million  hardworking Americans will be left without healthcare coverage by 2026  if we pass this bill, that premiums will rise 15 to 20 percent next  year, that people will pay thousands of dollars more in deductibles and  out-of-pocket costs, and that older Americans will be priced out of the  market by an age tax, I thought for sure it was dead on arrival, that  there was no way my Republican colleagues would walk this plank. But  here they are, and they are trying to take millions of American  families with them.   Fourteen million Americans will lose health coverage next year if  this bill is approved. Twenty-one million Americans will lose coverage  in the next 3 years alone, wiping out all of the coverage gains from  the ACA in just 3 years. For pretty much everyone else in the  individual market, deductibles and other costs will be higher. And for  lower-income individuals, out-of-pocket costs will be much higher.   Insurance companies will again be able to sell plans that offer much  less financial protection, and we will return to the days when millions  of people in this country will live in fear that they are always one  serious illness or accident away from bankruptcy.   This bill will result in the largest transfer of wealth from  struggling families to the well-off in our Nation's history, giving $1  trillion in tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and corporations.  It is Robin Hood in reverse, but this is far worse because access to  lifesaving care is being stolen.   I don't say that casually. I have met people, constituents of mine,  whose lives have been saved because of the Affordable Care Act.   This is from one of my constituents:   ``My name is Kevin Schweitzer. I am 62 years old and I'm a lifelong  resident of Louisville, Kentucky.   ``I worked hard, took risks and built a successful small business  that I sold at age 59. My wife and I were excited about our prospects  as we headed into early retirement. As a retiree too young for  Medicare, I purchased health insurance on the open market. Less than a  year later, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I have undergone multiple  scans and 2 cycles of chemo. I am winning the battle so far, but since  this disease is in my blood I will be fighting it for the rest of my  life.  [[Page H2407]]    ``A cancer diagnosis is a life-changing event that not only attacks  the body, but the mental stress is just as tough to deal with. Thanks  to ObamaCare, I've been able to rest easier knowing that my illness  wouldn't bankrupt my family and that I'll be able to provide for my  wife even after I'm gone.''   I also heard from a young woman named Sarah Adkins. She suffers from  chronic kidney disease. Sarah was able to get health insurance because  of the ACA. On January 9, 2011, it saved her life. One of her kidneys  shut down and almost went septic. If she didn't have coverage, she  would have waited or not gone to the hospital at all. The doctor told  her that if she had arrived at the ER an hour later, she would have  died.   Mr. Speaker, the health of my constituents Kevin Schweitzer and Sarah  Adkins is at stake in this debate. They, and the hundreds of other  constituents I have heard from who have serious and chronic health  conditions, will need high-quality, affordable health coverage for the  rest of their lives. Under this bill, they will get less coverage, it  will cost more, and eventually they will be priced out of the market,  leaving them nowhere to turn for the care they need.   And that is not all. Because of the last-minute changes to this bill,  insurers will be able to sell stripped-down coverage to weed out people  with preexisting conditions. They will be able to refuse, for example,  to offer coverage for chemotherapy drugs and cancer treatments, insulin  pumps, hospital stays, and prescription drugs that treat chronic  conditions across the board. Basically, if you have a serious health  problem, the care you need may not be available to you at all.   When the American people were promised by President Trump and  Republican congressional leadership that their existing coverage would  be preserved and that everybody would have insurance and it would be  less expensive and much better, they, understandably, believed they  would be treated much better than this. None of those promises are in  this bill. In fact, the opposite of every one of those promises is what  is in this bill. Those were promises made to every family in our  congressional districts, and this bill fails them at every turn.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 38,200 people from his congressional district  in California losing health care and coverage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 40,500 people from his congressional district  in Ohio losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 50,200 people from his congressional district  in Minnesota losing health coverage and care.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries),  a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 60,400 people from his congressional district  in Texas losing health coverage and care.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins), a  distinguished member of the Budget Committee and the Ways and Means  Committee.   Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, this never needed to be an  ideological fist fight. Democrats were always willing to take into  account serious and constructive alternatives to the law that we have  today that make it better, to make it affordable, more affordable for  the American people.   But this bill is a blatant takeaway from the American people of money  and protection. If you are 50 to 64 years old, you get clobbered. If  you are 64 years old, you make $26,000 a year, according to the  Republican-led Congressional Budget Office, your premiums go from  $1,700 a year to $14,000 a year.   Fact: UnitedHealthcare is one of the largest private health insurers  in America.   Fact: UnitedHealthcare will have $200 billion in revenues this year,  and they paid their chief executive officer $66 million in compensation  in 2014.    Fact: UnitedHealthcare is under investigation today by the Department  of Justice for stealing billions of dollars from the Medicare program.  [[Page H2409]]    Fact: The Republican health bill, on page 67, in 7 words, gives  UnitedHealthcare, their high-paid executives, and all of their cronies,  a massive tax cut to continue to screw the American people.   Mr. Speaker, we can do much better. We are prepared to do much  better. But this is a financial assault on good, hardworking Americans  who want to do one thing at the end of the day, after paying too much  money for health care throughout the year, and that is, when they need  their health care, it is available to them and their family.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 65,800 people from his congressional district  in New York losing health coverage and care.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene), a  distinguished member of the Budget Committee and the Ways and Means  Committee.   Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, if Republicans crafted legislation that  lived up to the promise of insurance for everybody, they would have  broad bipartisan support. But that is not what they did.   This bill threatens massive disruption and chaos, not only to our  healthcare system, but to middle class families, families who sit at  their kitchen table trying to figure out how to pay their mortgage, buy  groceries, and also get health coverage for their kids. This Republican  bill does nothing to help them.   In their rush to check a political box, Republicans have crafted  legislation that does nothing but hurt working Americans, and, in the  last 24 hours, it has gone from bad to worse.   Make no mistake, the changes made in the 11th hour to appease the  most extreme Members of Congress have put lifesaving care even further  out of reach.   Some may use alternative facts, but this is reality, and the reality  is that their bill robs $75 billion from Medicare, forces older  Americans to pay five times more than others, and shifts $312 billion  in out-of-pocket costs onto middle class families.   But this is about more than numbers. It is about people like Rachel,  from Kirkland, Washington, who suffered a heart attack and blood clot  at the age of 35. She now depends on frequent tests, medications and  doctors' visits to stay healthy. Thankfully, it is all covered by her  insurance.   Rachel told me: ``I'm horrified by the talking point that equates  repealing the Affordable Care Act with getting freedom back. For me,  the loss of the ACA gives me nothing but the freedom to die sooner and  worry more.''   I am not voting against this bill because it is a Republican bill. I  am voting ``no'' for families like Rachel's.   Health care doesn't need to be a partisan issue, and I stand ready  and willing to work on commonsense solutions that expand coverage and  reduce costs. But I was sent here to make my constituents' lives  better. This bill does not do that. I encourage my colleagues to vote  ``no.''    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 56,000 people from his congressional district  in Florida losing health coverage and care.   I yield 1\3/4\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman  Schultz), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.                                time  1200    Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I stand in opposition to the  Republican pay more for less care act, under which Americans will  suffer from higher healthcare costs, less coverage, a crushing age tax,  and a ransacking of the Medicare trust fund, which our seniors depend  on for long-term care.   Under the age tax, Americans aged 50 to 64 will be forced to pay five  times higher premiums than others, no matter how healthy they are.  Under TrumpCare, a 64-year-old with an income of $26,500 in the  individual market will pay $12,900 more in their premiums every year  under this bill.   In addition, TrumpCare will take away health care from 24 million  hardworking Americans and will force families to pay higher premiums  and deductibles. In fact, for families enrolled in the ACA marketplace,  premiums are expected to increase by 15 to 20 percent.   It will also punish millions of people who experience a lapse in  coverage by forcing them to pay a 30 percent higher premium each month  in order to receive care.  [[Page H2410]]    Tell that to Suzanne Boyd from Sunrise, Florida, who, with two  daughters heading to college, lost her husband to lung cancer and then  lost the insurance coverage she had through her employer. Thankfully,  she was able to obtain coverage under the ACA for $192 a month with  subsidies rather than a 30 percent Republican sick tax for getting a  life-threatening illness.   Yet this bill apparently isn't harmful enough for the far-right  extremists in the Republican Party, whom Republican leadership has  tried to appease by cutting the ACA essential health benefits like  mental health, maternity, and emergency services.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is like taking a sledgehammer to a clock that  is moving a little slow rather than working on precision fine tuning  instead. It is an immoral piece of legislation. As a breast cancer  survivor, I urge every Member to stand with my sister survivors all  across the country, who number in the millions, to make sure that you  don't devastate our health and make sure that we don't have our lives  threatened.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my friend from Indiana that his  vote for this bill will result in 37,900 people from his congressional  district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), who is a distinguished member of  the Budget Committee.   Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  opposition to TrumpCare, the Republican plan to cut Medicare and  Medicaid, increase healthcare costs, and take health care away from  tens of millions of Americans, all while providing the largest transfer  of wealth from working families to our Nation's richest, and all of  this in the name of choice and freedom. But we all know that, under  this bill, that is just code for survival of the fittest, economic  Darwinism.   Mr. Speaker, let me bring this a little closer to home for me. Thanks  to TrumpCare, 36,700 of my constituents covered by the ACA's Medicaid  expansion now stand to lose this lifesaving coverage. Here is one of  them, constituent Maura McGrath, a 17-year-old with Down syndrome.   Maura's parents, Joe and Rita, know firsthand why Medicaid is so  important. Medicaid has been critical to keeping their daughter alive  and saving their family from bankruptcy. Even though Joe and Rita both  work, the cost of Maura's care is too expensive to afford on their own,  not to mention that Rita is a breast cancer survivor and Joe suffers  from Parkinson's disease. Medicaid provides the McGraths peace of mind  knowing Maura will receive the care that she needs and they aren't  alone to fend for themselves, given the tough hand they have been  dealt.   Mr. Speaker, for Maura and everyone in my district, say ``no'' to  TrumpCare.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that the gentleman's  vote for this bill will result in 50,100 people from his congressional  district in Louisiana losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal), who is the distinguished vice ranking member  of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 38,200 people from his congressional district  in California losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Carbajal), who is a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I mention to my colleague that his vote  against this bill will result in 56,600 people from his congressional  district in South Carolina losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\3/4\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman of  the Budget Committee for his leadership.   Our mothers and our doctors have warned us about poison pills. Well,  let me say that, this morning, the Republicans are giving to the  American people a poison meal that would affect my friend, the senior  citizen, with $175 billion being taken away from Medicare; a poison  meal that will affect a young child who is being seen by a doctor.   The Children's Hospital Association, including the Texas Children's  Hospital, has said to vote ``no'' on this bill because 30 million  children will have no health insurance.   This will impact working families making $31,000 a year. They will  have to pay $4,000 more out of pocket. In 2026, under pay more for  less, $52 million Americans will be uninsured.   This poison meal is getting worse and worse.   Then, in the dark of night, what did they do?   They took away hospitalization. They took away pregnancy, maternity,  and newborn care. They took away mental health and substance abuse  care.   Those States that are experiencing the opioid abuse and epidemic,  what are they going to do?   They have threatened community health centers. They are closing rural  hospitals.   What is this disaster of TrumpCare?   It is injuring my good friend who is sitting there in the hospital  room. It is injuring Anna Nunez. It is injuring small businesses who  say that they can live better under the Affordable Care Act, and the  youngster that is a junior in college who said she would not be alive  had it not been for the Affordable Care Act.   More than half of the American people--and it is growing--are against  this bill done in the dark of night. It is the poison meal that is  keeping those who need health insurance away from health insurance.   I ask my colleagues to vote ``no.'' Don't feed the American people a  poison meal.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee and the  representative of a congressional district that has benefited  enormously from the Affordable Care Act, I rise in strong and  unyielding opposition to H.R. 1628, the so-called ``American Health  Care Act,'' which more accurately should be called ``Trumpcare, the Pay  More For Less Act.''   Seven years ago yesterday, March 23, 2010, President Barack Obama  signed into law the landmark Affordable Care Act passed by the  Democratic controlled 111th Congress.   Seven years later, the verdict is in on the Affordable Care Act; the  American people have judged it a success and are adamantly opposed to  any effort to repeal a law that has brought to more than 20 million  Americans the peace of mind and security that comes with  [[Page H2412]]  knowing they have access to affordable, high quality health care.   Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 17.1 of Americans  lacked health insurance; today nearly nine of ten (89.1%) are insured,  which is the highest rate since Gallup began tracking insurance  coverage in 2008.   Because of the Affordable Healthcare Act:   1. insurance companies are banned from discriminating against anyone,  including 17 million children, with a preexisting condition, or  charging higher rates based on gender or health status;   2. 6.6 million young-adults up to age 26 can stay on their parents'  health insurance plans;   3. 100 million Americans no longer have annual or life-time limits on  healthcare coverage;   4. 6.3 million seniors in the ``donut hole'' have saved $6.1 billion  on their prescription drugs;   5. 3.2 million seniors now get free annual wellness visits under  Medicare, and   6. 360,000 Small Businesses are using the Health Care Tax Credit to  help them provide health insurance to their workers;   7. Pregnancy is no longer a pre-existing condition and women can no  longer be charged a higher rate just because they are women.   We are becoming a nation of equals when it comes to access to  affordable healthcare insurance.   The President and congressional Republicans call this enviable record  of success a ``disaster.''   The American people do not agree and that is why they reject  overwhelmingly (56%-17%) this Republican attempt to repeal the  Affordable Care Act according to the latest Quinnipiac poll.   Americans know a disaster when they see one and they see one in the  making: it is called ``Trumpcare,'' masquerading as the ``American  Health Care Act,'' which will force Americans to ``pay more for less.''   And they are right to be alarmed at what they see.   This ``Pay-More-For-Less'' bill is a massive $900 billion tax cut for  the wealthy, paid for on the backs of America's seniors, the  vulnerable, the poor, and working class households.   This ``Robin Hood in reverse'' bill is unprecedented and breathtaking  in its audacity--no bill ever tried to give so much to the rich while  taking so much from the poor and working class.   Trumpcare represents the largest transfer of wealth from the bottom  99% to the top 1% in American history.   This callous Republican scheme gives gigantic tax cuts to the rich,  and pays for it by taking insurance away from 24 million people,  leaving 52 million uninsured, and raising costs for the poor and middle  class.   In addition, Republicans are giving the pharmaceutical industry a big  tax repeal, worth nearly $25 billion over a decade without demanding in  return any reduction in the cost of prescription and brand-name drugs.   To paraphrase Winston Churchill, of this bill, it can truly be said  that ``never has so much been taken from so many to benefit so few.''   The Pay-More-For-Less plan destroys the Medicaid program under the  cover of repealing the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion.   CBO estimates 14 million Americans will lose Medicaid coverage by  2026 under the Republican plan.   In addition to terminating the ACA Medicaid expansion, the bill  converts Medicaid to a per-capita cap that is not guaranteed to keep  pace with health costs starting in 2020.   The combined effect of these policies is to slash $880 billion in  federal Medicaid funding over the next decade.   The cuts get deeper with each passing year, reaching 25% of Medicaid  spending in 2026.   These steep cuts will force states to drop people from Medicaid  entirely or ration care for those who most need access to comprehensive  coverage.   The Pay-More-For-Less plan undermines the health care safety net for  vulnerable populations.   Currently, Medicaid provides coverage to more than 70 million  Americans, including children, pregnant women, seniors in Medicare,  people who are too disabled to work, and parents struggling to get by  on poverty-level wages.   In addition to doctor and hospital visits, Medicaid covers long-term  services like nursing homes and home and community-based services that  allow people with chronic health conditions and disabilities to live  independently.   To date, 31 states and D.C. have expanded Medicaid eligibility to  low-income adults, which, when combined with the ACA's other coverage  provisions, has helped to reduce the nation's uninsured rate to the  lowest in history.   Trumpcare throws 24 million Americans off their health insurance by  2026 according to the Congressional Budget Office.   Low-income people will be hit especially hard because 14 million  people will lose access to Medicaid by 2026 according to CBO.   Trumpcare massively shifts who gets insured in the nongroup market.   According to CBO, ``fewer lower-income people would obtain coverage  through the nongroup market under the legislation than current law,''  and, ``a larger share of enrollees in the nongroup market would be  younger people and a smaller share would be older people.''   The projected 10% reduction in premiums is not the result of better  care or efficiency--it is in large part the result of higher-cost and  older people being pushed out of a market that is also selling plans  that provide less financial protection.   People with low incomes suffer the greatest losses in coverage.   CBO projects the uninsured rate for people in their 30s and 40s with  incomes below 200% of poverty will reach 38% in 2026 under this bill,  nearly twice the rate projected under current law.   Among people aged 50-64, CBO projects 30% of those with incomes below  200% of poverty will be uninsured in 2026.   Under current law, CBO projects the uninsured rate would only be 12  percent.   Being uninsured is not about ``freedom.''   Speaker Ryan has argued that people will happily forgo insurance  coverage because this bill gives them that ``freedom.''   The argument makes as much sense as the foolish claim that slaves  came to America as ``immigrants'' seeking a better life.   The freedom to be uninsured is no freedom at all to people in their  50s and 60s with modest incomes who simply cannot afford to pay  thousands of dollars toward premiums.   They do not really have a choice.   The claim of our Republican friends that Trumpcare provides more  freedom to all Americans calls to mind the words of Anatole France:   ``The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the  poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread  from the market.''   Trumpcare raises costs for Americans nearing retirement, essentially  imposing an ``Age Tax.''   The bill allows insurance companies to charge older enrollees higher  premiums than allowed under current law, while reducing the size of  premium tax credits provided.   Again, these changes hit low-income older persons the hardest.   A 64-year-old with an income of $26,500 buying coverage in the  individual market will pay $12,900 more toward their premiums in 2026,  on average.   Trumpcare raises costs for individuals and families with modest  incomes, particularly older Americans.   A recent analysis found that in 2020, individuals with incomes of  about $31,000 would pay on average $4,000 more out of pocket for health  care--which is like getting a 13% pay cut.   And the older you are, the worse it gets.   An analysis by the Urban Institute estimates that for Americans in  their 50s and 60s, the tax credits alone would only be sufficient to  buy plans with major holes in them, such as a $30,000 deductible for  family coverage and no coverage at all of brand-name drugs or many  therapy services.   Another reason I oppose the Trumpcare bill before us is because its  draconian cuts in Medicaid funding and phase-out of Medicaid expansion  put community health centers at risk.   Community health centers are consumer-driven and patient-centered  organizations that serve as a comprehensive and cost effective primary  health care option for America's most underserved communities.   Community health centers serve as the health care home for more than  25 million patients in nearly 10,000 communities across the country.   Across the country, 550 new clinics have opened to receive 5 million  new patients since 2009.   Community health centers serve everyone regardless of ability to pay  or insurance status:   1. 71% of health center patients have incomes at or below 100% of  poverty and 92% have incomes less than 200% of poverty;   2. 49% of health center patients are on Medicaid; and   3. 24% are uninsured;   4. Community health centers annually serve on average 1.2 million  homeless patients and more than 300,000 veterans.   Community health centers reduce health care costs and produce  savings--on average, health centers save 24% per Medicaid patient when  compared to other providers.   Community health centers integrate critical medical and social  services such as oral health, mental health, substance abuse, case  management, and translation, under one roof.  [[Page H2413]]    Community health centers employ nearly 190,000 people and generate  over $45 billion in total economic activity in some of the nation's  most distressed communities.   Community health centers serve on the front lines of public health  crises such as the Zika virus and the opioid epidemic.   Mr. Speaker, community health centers are on the front lines of every  major health crisis our country faces, from providing access to care  (and employment) to veterans to addressing the opioid epidemic to  responding to public health threats like the Zika virus.   We should be providing more support and funding to community health  centers, not making it more difficult for them to serve the communities  that desperately need them by slashing Medicaid funding.   Trumpcare Republican plan leaves rural Americans worse off.   Mr. Speaker, health insurance has historically been more expensive in  rural areas because services cost more and it is hard to have a stable  individual market with a small population.   Under the Affordable Care Act, premium subsidies are tied to local  costs, which helps keeps premium costs down.   But they are not under the Republican plan.   So, under the Republican plan residents in rural areas, who tend to  be older and poorer, will pay much more and get much less health  insurance.   At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, the powerful and compelling  reasons to reject Trumpcare lies in the real world experiences of the  American people.   Let me briefly share with you the positive, life affirming difference  made by the Affordable Care Act in the lives of just three of the  millions of Americans it has helped.   Joan Fanwick: ``If Obamacare is repealed, I don't know if I'll live  to see the next President''   ``After nearly a decade of mysterious health scares, I was diagnosed  with an autoimmune disorder called Sjogren's Syndrome last year, when I  was a junior at Temple University.   ``It's a chronic illness with no known cause or cure, and without  close medical surveillance and care, it can lead to life-threatening  complications (like the blood infections I frequently experience).   ``For me, having this disorder means waking up every morning and  taking 10 different medications.   ``It also means a nurse visiting my apartment every Saturday to  insert a needle into the port in my chest, so I can give myself IV  fluids throughout the week.   ``Without insurance, my medical expenses would cost me about $1,000  per week--more than $50,000 per year. And that doesn't even include  hospitalizations.   ``My medical bills aren't cheap under Obamacare, but I can afford  them.   ``Under Obamacare, insurance companies aren't allowed to cut you off  when your costs climb so right now, the most I personally have to pay  out of pocket is $1,000 per year.''   Brian Norgaard: ``I am a small business owner and leadership trainer  who Obamacare has helped tremendously.''   Brian Norgaard, a Dallas, Texas resident, called my office to express  his opposition to Trumpcare and to offer share how the Affordable Care  Act has helped small business owners like himself:   ``I am a small business owner and leadership trainer who Obamacare  has helped tremendously.   ``My wife and I both own small businesses in the Dallas, Texas area  and as a result of the huge savings we received after paying lower  [healthcare] premiums under Obamacare, we were able to reinvest those  saving into both of our businesses and the community.   ``And the healthcare we received was quality, at that.''   Ashley Walton: ``For cancer survivors, we literally live and die by  insurance''   Ashley Walton was 25 when a mole on her back turned out to be  melanoma.   She had it removed, but three years later she discovered a lump in  her abdomen.   She was then unemployed and uninsured, and so she put off going to a  doctor.   She tried to buy health insurance. Every company rejected her.   Ashley eventually became eligible for California's Medicaid program,  which had been expanded under the Affordable Care Act.   The 32-year-old Oakland resident credits her survival to the ACA.   Without it, ``I would likely be dead, and my family would likely be  bankrupt from trying to save me.''   Before any of our Republican colleagues supporting this bill cast  their vote, I urge them to reflect on the testimony of Joan, Brian, and  Ashley, and to on this question posed by a constituent to Sen. Cotton  of Arkansas at a recent town hall:   ``I've got a husband dying and we can't afford--let me tell you  something.   ``If you can get us better coverage than this [Obamacare], go for it.   ``Let me tell you what we have, plus a lot of benefits that we need.   ``We have $29 per month for my husband. Can you beat that? Can you?   With all the congestive heart failures, and open heart surgeries,  we're trying. $29 per month. And he's a hard worker.   $39 for me.''   I urge all Members to reject Trumpcare, one of the most monstrously  cruel and morally bankrupt legislative proposals ever to be considered  in this chamber.   To paraphrase a famous former reality television personality,  ``believe me, Trumpcare is a disaster.''   We should reject it and keep instead ``something terrific'' and that  is the Affordable Care Act, regarded lovingly by millions of Americans  as ``Obamacare.''                                                     March 24, 2017.      Re Changes to the Affordable Healthcare Act.       The President of the United States of America,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Greetings Mr. President: Today is a very crucial and       important day for the residents of the City of Houston's       District D, where I serve as the elected City Council Member,       which also falls under Congressional Districts 18 and 7. As a       local elected official whose mother is on a fixed income,       this will not only impact her but many other senior citizens       who I represent.        In the news, we see how the Affordable Healthcare Act is       proposed to be changed. Under the new revisions to the       healthcare bill, which is called The American Health Care       Act, about $337 Billion will be cut from the current plan       over a 10 year period causing 24 million Americans, including       Democrats, Republicans, Independents, poor and the middle       class, to lose their healthcare. This proposed health care       bill is receiving criticism from the health care providers,       some conservatives and a united Democratic Party. The       Congressional Budget Office even showed how this current       proposed plan will negatively impact everyone. What is most       concerning to me in regards to this program is the impact       that it will have on our senior citizens.        52% of my District is made up of Senior Citizens who are on       fixed incomes. These senior's will have to pay more for their       health care under this proposed American Health Care Act. In       no way is this acceptable. I am an advocate for my seniors       and I refuse to quietly sit back while this is being       considered.        I have encouraged everyone to reach out to their Members of       Congress to let them know that this isn't something that we       stand for and to work on their behalf to vote this item down       today.            Sincerely,                                                 Dwight Boykins,                                               Houston City Counsel,                                                        District D.     Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 44,600 people from his congressional district  in Wisconsin losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee and the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 50,000 people from his congressional district  in Kansas losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, in concluding the presentation from the Budget  Committee, I just have to say that the bill we are considering today is  a mess. It is not a healthcare bill at all.   This bill is driven by a desire to cut taxes for the wealthiest  Americans and many wealthy corporations by nearly $1 trillion in all.  It is paid for by making health care unaffordable for millions of  people.   This is irresponsible. It is not what the American people want, it is  not what they deserve, and it is certainly not what they can afford.   We are not the only ones opposing this legislation. It is opposed by  an amazing array of American organizations and individuals, including  the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association,  the American Nurses Association, the National Rural Health Association,  AARP, the National Disability Rights Network, the American Diabetes  Association, American Cancer Society, and Easterseals, virtually every  healthcare and consumer advocacy group, Governors from both sides of  the aisle, and a growing list of our Republican colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Budget Committee staff for the incredible  job they have done throughout this process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous  consent that the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), chairman of  the Energy and Commerce Committee, control the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.
