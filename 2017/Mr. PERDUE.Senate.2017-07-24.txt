 Mr. President, it is nice to see you here at 11 p.m. on  Monday night. One of the privileges we have of being in the majority is  that we get to preside over the U.S. Senate, so we can listen to all of  our colleagues talk to this august body.   I have been in that chair for the last couple of hours. I can't go to  bed tonight without putting the record straight in this body. I don't  think there is a Member of the U.S. Senate who doesn't want America to  have the best healthcare in the world. The problem is, we have a  campaign of disinformation that is underway right now, and it is  outrageous. I cannot let it stand.   My mission tonight, very briefly, will be to put some facts on the  table, on the record, because we have a lot of innuendo right now, a  lot disinformation: Oh, my God, people are going to die.   Let me remind everybody, we are sitting here with a healthcare system  that is collapsing. There is no other way to describe it.   Why are we here tonight at 11 p.m.? Before I get to healthcare, I  want to remind the American public of why the U.S. Senate is open  tonight. We also did this earlier in the spring because something  historic is underway right now in the United States of America and that  is this: For the first time in our history, the minority party has not  waived a Senate rule that would bypass the time requirements when  confirming a nominee by the President of the United States. Because of  that, we today have confirmed only around 29 percent of this  President's nominees. The prior President, at this very point in time,  had over 70 percent--over 70 percent--almost 300 people. I think the  number today is under 50 for this President. It wasn't until a month or  so ago that he could even have a full staff meeting.   By the way, who is running America today? Holdovers from the last  administration because we haven't been able to confirm the new  nominees. Over 200 people right now stand in line, waiting to be  confirmed by this body. It is outrageous.   The American people ought to be upset. They ought to be more than  upset. Let's define who is doing that. It is not the majority. The  minority party is dragging their feet because it slows down everything  else.   Guess what doesn't get done this year if we continue with this  schedule. Unless we are here every night, as we are tonight, we will  not have time to get to taxes this year. We will not have time to get  to what the American people are assuming we are going to get to.  Consumer confidence is at a 13-year high  [[Page S4162]]  because they are anticipating that we are going to clean up some of  this mess.   Let me quickly move on to healthcare and put a few facts on the  record tonight before we close. There are five healthcare systems in  America. We forget this. We talk only about ObamaCare right now, but  there are five healthcare systems in America.   First, we have group policies. This is where almost the majority--the  vast majority are in this. Anyone who works in a company or in a large  organization has a group policy.   Then there is the individual market. The individual market is what  ObamaCare addresses. It is only 13 percent of the entire healthcare  system.   Then there is the VA.   Then there are Medicare and Medicaid.   There are five different systems of healthcare in the United States.  What we are dealing with is the individual market and Medicaid--mostly  the individual market.   Let me try to describe the situation as we see it today. In 2008,  before the ACA, there were 48 million people in America who did not  have insurance. That is a catastrophe by anyone's measure. In the  richest country in the history of the world, we had 48 million people  who did not have insurance. You could be precluded from having  insurance because of a preexisting condition. You could lose your  insurance. You couldn't transfer across State lines. If you changed  companies, even in group policies, you could be denied coverage under  the next employer's policy.   There were real problems. Both sides had responsibility for that, but  today after the ACA, 28 million people, as we stand here tonight, still  do not have insurance in America--28 million. Of the 20 million who got  it, 16 got it only because of the expansion of Medicaid, not because of  ObamaCare's work in the individual market; 16 million got it because of  the expansion of Medicaid.   All that was, was bribery from the Federal Government to certain  States that decided to take the money and run. They didn't do their  citizens a full justice. What we see of the remaining 4 million of the  20 million who got insurance during ObamaCare--remember, 16 million got  it because of the expansion of Medicaid; of the remaining 4 million, 2  million are like my wife and me.   Do you remember the day when President Obama said that if you like  your insurance, you can keep your insurance and if you like your  doctor, you can keep your doctor? Like most Democrats in the Senate and  the House who voted on ObamaCare without reading it, he obviously  didn't know what was in the bill because neither of those things were  true.   I was canceled. In an individual policy before I ran for the U.S.  Senate, my individual policy as a retiree was canceled, and the only  policy we could get under the exchange in ObamaCare included things  like vision, hearing, drug rehabilitation. I have never had a problem  with that. My wife hasn't either.   By the way, maternity--I met my wife in first grade. We are not  having babies at this age. What is that? My rate is almost double  because we had to take things in policies that we did not need.   Of the remaining 2 million, 1 million are the most destitute, low- income people who really do need our help, but we have disrupted the  entire healthcare system because the Democrats thought that the bigger  government approach would work.   How has that worked out in places like the VA? I hear talk now about  single payer; I will get to that in a second. If you like the VA, you  are going to love a single-payer system because that is exactly what it  is.   Let me go on. I have heard a lot of talk in this Chamber tonight  about, oh my God, the Republicans are going to hurt people in America-- hurt people in America.   Let me talk about who is hurting people in America today. This is a  travesty in itself. We cannot get the information from the IRS. We have  just now gotten the information from the IRS. In 2014, the IRS, under  the rules of ObamaCare, fined 8 million people $1.8 billion.   Mr. President, I don't know about you, but I am outraged. I know you  are too.   The irony of that is that 85 percent of the people who were fined in  2014--$1.8 billion--85 percent made less than $50,000, and less than  half of them made $25,000.   What our Democratic friends did was cram down the throats of  Americans this thing called ObamaCare, and then they put fines on  people who couldn't afford insurance, and they are the poorest people  in our country.   Who is standing for those guys today--the Democrats? Don't you bet.  They want a Big Government solution that gives them more power, and  they could not care less about the very poor people they claim to  champion. I have had enough of it. This is outrageous.   Twenty-two million people are going to lose insurance. That is what  they tell us. Let's clean this up right now. The CBO's own estimate  says that once you remove the mandate--forget about what else is  available. If you just remove the mandate, because the policies are so  expensive, 15 million are going to give it up. That is happening today.   By the way, do you know that CBO is using a March 2016 baseline to  compare these numbers to? It is outrageous. In business, you would  never accept this. Yet today they are determined to be the ``holy  grail'' up here. I haven't seen a number come out of the CBO that I  would depend on yet. In fact, in 2010, they overestimated the number of  people who would sign up for ObamaCare by 12 million people. They  missed the estimate by more than 50 percent. This isn't a rounding  error. They don't know what they are doing.   Right now, today, we have the same problem. Fifteen million people  say they will give up their insurance voluntarily because it is too  expensive. That has nothing to do with the new plan. That is because  ObamaCare is too expensive.   They also say that 4 million people will give up Medicaid. Medicaid  is free. Why would somebody give up Medicaid?   They say ObamaCare is so good and so affordable that they are going  to add 5 million people to it. There is no evidence today that would  back that claim up. That is not a quantified model outcome. It is the  estimate of a person who sits over there and makes this up. The other  side is acting like, oh my goodness, this is the ``holy grail.''   Let's talk about this. The premiums under ObamaCare prior to this  year, over the last 2 years, are up over 105 percent in America. They  say that the reason premiums are going up is because of uncertainty  coming out of the White House. This year's rates were determined last  year, before we even knew this President was going to be a nominee.  That is more disinformation.   What I am fed up with is that it sounds like a good story until you  see the facts. The premiums in my State alone going into next year are  going up 42 percent.   Here is the untold truth: In my State, 96 of 159 counties have only  one carrier. That is a monopoly. They can do pretty much whatever they  want. That is under ObamaCare, not anything else we are talking about.  That is the reality today.   By the way, here is the real comeuppance. Today in my State--and you  have the same problem in your State--300,000 people who make less than  the poverty rate in my State cannot get insurance today under  ObamaCare. Forget about what we are talking about to fix this mess.  Today under ObamaCare, they can't get insurance--300,000 people in my  State. That is true in every State in our country. That is the untold  ugliness of ObamaCare.   ObamaCare is hurting people right now. I am tired of hearing the  other side talk about how they care for people--they care for people-- and then they fine the poorest people in America $1.8 billion. Then  they deny 300,000 people in my State access to healthcare. Enough  already.   What are we doing about it? Six months ago, this President said that  there were four objectives that any healthcare system in America and  the individual market had to meet. The first was access. We have  already talked about how ObamaCare is failing people who need access to  it. The lowest income people in America are being denied insurance  under ObamaCare. We fixed that. People who want insurance are going to  get insurance.   By the way, premiums were the second thing we had to do to try to get  costs down because it is becoming too  [[Page S4163]]  prohibitive. I have sons in the middle of their careers. They can't  really afford the insurance they are being offered today. I feel it  firsthand in my own life.   Premiums right now, though--if we put into place the suggestions we  have on the table right now, the HHS Department has estimated just last  week with a very credible model that rates could come down as much as  78 percent in the next 4 years. Has anybody heard the other side remind  us of that data point? No. Why do those rates come down? Because the  free-market system gets to act again, instead of being shackled in  choices being removed. All of a sudden, now we move into it.   By the way, they talk about these made-up fantasy policies. Wait a  minute. I had one of those made-up fantasy policies that you can't get  today under ObamaCare. It is called catastrophic coverage. For some  people with a high deductible, catastrophic coverage--that works. They  are denied that today because Big Government knows more about what you  need in your personal life.   The third thing we had to do--and this was very important. The second  part of this problem is that Medicaid was not on a sustainable path. I  am sorry. They have overpromised, and they cannot deliver. There is no  way over the next 30 years that we can sustain Medicaid. Just as  Medicare and Social Security are going bankrupt, we cannot afford to do  what they are promising people we are going to do. They know that. They  already know that.   Just like the Great Society, these Big Government programs that they  promise all the time are going to work have never worked. The Great  Society, the War on Poverty was going to remove poverty from America. I  remember that.   I sit at a desk where that bill was signed by the then-Democratic  leader of the Senate, Richard Russell, before it went to the White  House. I am reminded every day of how Big Government has failed the  American people. That war on poverty has spent trillions of dollars  trying to reduce poverty in America. Yet, today, the poverty rate is  fundamentally the same as it was in 1965 when that was signed into law.   Big Government does not work in situations like this. I lived under a  single payer. My son lived under a single payer. This is the  alternative they are after. I have heard it mentioned three times on  the floor of the Senate tonight. We cannot go there. It bifurcates  delivery. It would add $3.2 trillion. That is more than we spend on all  of our mandatory expenses today--$3.2 trillion every single year. That  is impossible. If you think that would work, imagine this. Go home and  look at your tax bill. Whatever you paid the Federal Government last  year, double it. That is what that would mean. It is not workable.    The fourth thing we had to do was make sure preexisting conditions  were protected. I worried about that through my entire career. If I  changed jobs, if I had been sick or my family had been sick, I might  have been denied insurance. We can't allow that. This bill doesn't  allow that. We protected preexisting conditions. We put Medicaid on a  sustainable path for the long term. We also bring premiums down. That  was a major priority here. And we give everybody in America access to  healthcare--period, end of the conversation.   That is not good enough. The other side is not going to be happy  until this Federal Government steps in and takes over 18 percent of our  economy called healthcare. They tried to do it in 1992 to 1994, under  HillaryCare. They tried to do it here. I remember the Speaker of the  House saying: If you want to know what is in this bill, you have to  vote for the bill. We are not doing that today. This cloud of innuendo  that the other side has perpetrated on the American people is just not  true.   In 2010, not one Republican voted for ObamaCare. Not one amendment  got to the floor of this Senate. Yet they want to talk about this great  open policy. They had 7 years to fix this mess. People in my State have  been hurt by it. It is unforgivable, and we can do something about it  this week.   Senator John McCain is very sick. He is a fighter. He will take care  of this. I hope he will be back this week to help us. If he can, I  think he will. We are going to vote on it this week. We have to do this  for the American people.   I want to remind everybody what is at stake here. If we don't pass  this tomorrow, then we end up moving toward a single-payer system. Let  me remind everybody of the other Big Government failures we talk about:  the VA and the Postal Service. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are bankrupt.  We talk about the ObamaCare failures. Then there is the Great Society  of rural poverty. I want to remind everybody.   Let me close with this. I heard tonight that this is a reckless  action, the new policy. I heard New Testament examples about how to  take care of your brethren. It is shocking to me that somebody on the  other side would say that when they know these statistics of what they  have done--8 million of the poorest people in America have been fined  $1.8 billion. Half of them make under $25,000 a year. That is taking  care of your brethren all right. I am embarrassed. We can fix that.   I believe we heard the rain of devastation: No one is helped by this  bill; it is a reckless act. Here is the one I love: We want to work  with you. We want to work with you to help fix this thing. Just a year  ago, I didn't hear any speeches in here--I don't think you did from  that Chair--where anybody on that side acknowledged that there was  anything wrong with ObamaCare. You hear today: We want to work with you  to help fix ObamaCare. It is 7 years too late, in my opinion. It would  have been nice to have been included in the conversation in 2009 and  2010 when it was crammed down the throats of Republicans.   I believe this is a historic moment in America, not just for  healthcare. Healthcare is very important, but it is bigger than that.  This is about the direction of our country. Are we going to try to  trust Big Government again and again until we can't afford it? We are  already well down that rabbit hole. We cannot afford this chance again.  We have already proven it doesn't work.   I hope that this week colleagues on our side will get together and we  will vote this thing in. I welcome any Democratic support as well. I  know we are not going to get it. This is a time to stand. I hope we  will have that vote. I fully encourage my colleagues here to support  that. Let's get on with business.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand adjourned under the previous order.
