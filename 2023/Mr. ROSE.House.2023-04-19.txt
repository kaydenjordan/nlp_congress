 Mr. Chairman, today I rise as a Christian, a husband, and a  father in support of H.R. 734, the Protection of Women and Girls in  Sports Act, a bill that I am proud to cosponsor.   Tennessee is well-known for its iconic and legendary women's  basketball program, the Lady Volunteers.   Thankfully, our State has taken action to protect the Lady Vols from  ever being threatened to have to compete against biological males.  Whether it is for scholarships or national championships, biological  males ought to compete against biological males, and biological females  ought to compete against biological females.   Most Tennesseans consider this to be common sense.   That is why I am very thankful the House is considering the  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act today, and I am extremely  proud to support its passage.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on this  legislation.
