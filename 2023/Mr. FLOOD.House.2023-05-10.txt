 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of Nebraska's  finest elementary educators, Mrs. Jane Jessen of Norfolk, Nebraska.  Mrs. Jessen has taught at Sacred Heart Elementary School and Norfolk  Catholic School since 1984.   Every single day in the classroom, she worked hard to inspire each  student to find their own path and to celebrate what makes them a very  important person.   Jane has lived her life to help others. She has touched the lives of  so many not only in the classroom, but she has also touched the lives  of those who have witnessed her resilience by living her faith during  times of tragedy and sorrow.   Norfolk Catholic School won the lottery of teachers when Mrs. Jane  Jessen went to work for the students.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of everybody in the First Congressional  District, I thank my fifth grade teacher, Sacred Heart School, and  Norfolk Catholic, Jane Jessen, for everything she has done for our  State and our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Mrs. Jessen a happy retirement.                            ____________________
