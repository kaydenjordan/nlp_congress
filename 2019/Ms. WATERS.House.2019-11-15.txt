 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for offering this  thoughtful amendment.   This amendment strengthens the bill's emphasis on small business.  While we have a lot in this bill for small businesses, the  gentlewoman's amendment further strengthens these efforts by requiring  that the agency emphasize outreach to small businesses in sectors that  have been impacted by retaliatory tariffs.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the gentlewoman's amendment to  further help small businesses that have been caught up in this tariff  war.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for offering this  thoughtful amendment.   This amendment prohibits the Bank from providing financing to a  person involved in sanctionable activity relating to human rights  abuses, specifically human trafficking, including sex trafficking.   I strongly support the gentlewoman's amendment to strengthen this  bill with respect to combating human trafficking, including sex  trafficking, and, of course, I urge all of my colleagues to do so.   This makes our bill stronger. This is the most important piece of  legislation, and the Export-Import Bank is significant in the fact that  it has provided 1.5 million jobs over the past 10 years, supported  businesses to the tune of $255 billion, and made money for our Treasury  to the tune of about $3.4 million.    Every amendment that has come before us today has made this a  stronger and stronger piece of legislation.    I am sorry that the gentleman from North Carolina is  still bemoaning the fact that the first bill that we negotiated is not  before us.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
