 Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Harvey exposed how unprepared our  infrastructure and flood mitigation efforts were for one of the most  strategically important regions in the Nation.   Aside from the emotional and psychological toll Harvey inflicted on  my community, it is estimated that Harvey cost $125 billion in damages.   Instead of continually spending money on the back end of tragedies  that experts agree cost infinitely more, I am proud the Federal  Government is authorizing investments in flood mitigation and  prevention that will help deter another Harvey-like scenario.   I am also pleased that language in section 325 authorizes the  Secretary to provide technical assistance related to non-Federal  interests and the removal of sediment obstructing inflow channels to  Addicks and Barker Reservoirs.   In addition to the statutory changes for sediment removal, I am proud  to support the authorization of $19.2 billion for the Texas coastal  protection and restoration project.   The Port of Houston is home to the largest petrochemical  manufacturing complex in the Americas; 42 percent of the specialty  chemical feedstocks, 27 percent of the gas, and 60 percent of the jet  aviation fuel are all produced in the region. It is good to see  government working for the people.
