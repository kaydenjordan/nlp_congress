 Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my colleague from  Nevada.   I would like to just take a moment to weigh in on the amendment that  my colleague, Mr. Amodei, and I introduced that would maintain the  NCUA's current funding structure.   The NCUA is funded, as he said, through fees paid by credit unions.  Subjecting them to the annual appropriations process unnecessarily  involves Congress in a process that functions fine the way it is.   The NCUA is not synonymous with big, for-profit institutions. The  NCUA is a not-for-profit structure and plays a critical role in  communities throughout this country. If they are forced to go through  the appropriations process, then local buy-in is trumped by the Federal  Government. If anything, this would further complicate the funding  process and decrease, not increase, transparency.   Forcing the NCUA into this process is an attempt to fix a problem  that doesn't exist. They are one of the only regulatory bodies that is  both an insurer and regulator, and its unique  [[Page H7359]]  structure should be reflected in the way that the operations are  funded.
