 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, May is National Foster Care Month. I  thank my colleagues for unanimously supporting the resolution  recognizing May as National Foster Care Month.   National Foster Care Month has been recognized for over 20 years as a  time we all celebrate the voices of foster youth and bring awareness to  the challenges these young people face. During this month,  organizations in Iowa--and, for that matter, all across the country-- have been working to support and to recognize the young people who are  in foster care.   Nationally, there are over 425,000 children in foster care. In Iowa  alone, almost 4,000 kids entered foster care in 2015, the last year for  statistics. I salute all of those who work tirelessly to support these  children. This includes a lot of different groups but particularly  foster parents, who open their hearts and homes to children who need  this vital support. The group also includes social workers, advocates,  and alumni of the foster care system who, as young people, have gone  through a lot. They are there to inform lawmakers and the public, and  they are there to fight to secure better outcomes for kids in care.   As stated in our resolution, Congress must continue to work toward  real solutions for these children, who often face trauma, abuse, and  neglect, both before and after they are removed from their parents'  care. We must work to ensure that all children, no matter their  circumstances, have a permanent, loving home and consistent, caring  adults in their lives.   With legislation such as the Fostering Connections Act, passed in  2008, and the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act,  passed in 2011, we have made some progress. These laws provided new  investments and new services to improve the outcomes for children in  the foster care system.   Even after all that, our work is not done. Over 20,000 young people  aged out of the foster care system in 2015, with no legal permanent  connection to any family. This impacts their ability to pursue higher  education, to find employment and stable housing, and, most  importantly, to prepare for the future.   While in care, children experience an average of three different  placements; 65 percent of the kids in foster care change schools seven  or more times. We see a great amount of instability and resulting  insecurity when this is what happens in the life of somebody in foster  care. This constant uncertainty compounds the trauma of neglect and of  abuse and makes it hard for these kids to make connections to their  communities.   Through my work in the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, I have had the  opportunity to hear firsthand what these young people in foster care  need. They need love, they need support, they need safety and  permanency, and they need a family. Those last two are the first words  I ever heard from kids in foster care when I first took time 25 years  ago to listen to some of them. They had been shunted from one home to  another home over a period of time. They said: We would like to have a  mom and dad; we would like to have a home. That is what this movement  is all about.   Moving forward, Congress must continue to work to find better  solutions and secure better outcomes for our young people in foster  care.   Once again, I thank all of my colleagues for supporting this  resolution. It is important that this month--and, for that matter, all  year long--we continue to support the goals of National Foster Care  Month.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to address the issue of the  healthcare debate that has been going on since the first of the year.  Now that it has passed the House of Representatives, it comes to the  Senate. The Senate is working on its own bill, not working from the  House bill. This is still evolving, and I hope it will evolve very,  very quickly.  [[Page S3180]]    One of the things we face is to make sure we have accessible,  affordable care for anyone who wants to buy health insurance.   I rise today, as I have in the past, to share real stories from real  Iowans who have been harmed--not helped--by the Affordable Care Act. I  know there are plenty of examples we can give of people who have not  benefited from the Affordable Care Act. As we have found so many times,  the Affordable Care Act has become the un-Affordable Care Act. The  other side often talks about the benefits of ACA without mentioning the  reality I am trying to bring to this debate.   There is a reason Republicans are acting to protect Americans from  the loss of access to medical care. ObamaCare has broken its promises.  All these promises, made over and over again, have not stood the test  of time, so I would like to remind everyone of some of these promises.   The promise: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.   The reality: This promise was even scrubbed from the ObamaCare  website after everyone knew it was a farce.   The promise: You will be able to keep your insurance plan.   What is the reality? In the fall of 2013, between 7 and 12 million  people had health insurance cancelled. ObamaCare's mandates resulted in  fewer choices for people to buy affordable insurance. People were  kicked off plans they liked and plans that, until ObamaCare, they could  afford. This promise was dubbed the ``Lie of the Year.''   Another promise was made: Your premiums will go down by $2,500.   That is not even close. I have been quoting for a long period of time  that they had gone up at least $3,500. Now, more recently, I have seen  a figure of an average of $4,300. So, in reality, that $2,500 promise  that premiums would go down wasn't even close.   In Iowa, premiums increased up to 43 percent in just 1 year. One  farmer told me that his insurance went up from $20,000 to $32,000 in 1  year. He was able to get the premium down to $25,000 by taking  advantage of an HMO, but the deductible for that plan was $15,000. You  have an insurance policy, but you may never use it.   The biggest promise: You were promised access to affordable health  care. The law is called the Affordable Care Act. That is the most  concerning of all--the situation created by ObamaCare is far from  affordable.   What is the reality? Premiums in 2017 have doubled for a majority of  States using ObamaCare exchanges. In three States, premiums have  tripled during ObamaCare. One Iowan from Pomeroy, IA, wrote to me and  said she shopped for an ObamaCare plan and found that she would have to  pay $9,000 out-of-pocket before her insurance kicks in. She told me she  doesn't know where that money would come from, and of course that makes  that policy too expensive to use.   For the past 7 years, ObamaCare has not been working, and it will  never work for the American people. Republicans are not going to accept  failure. That is why we are working so hard to put together what we  have promised the people of this country for the last 7 years--to  repeal and replace. Pointing out the shortcomings of affordable care,  we aim for better, and that is what guides us as we continue to work on  repealing and replacing this failed law.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to  remind my colleagues that today is National Missing Children's Day.   President Reagan highlighted the importance of making child safety a  priority when he established May 25 as National Missing Children's Day  for the first time in 1983. On this day, we pause to remember those  children who have gone missing and honor those who are dedicated to  their rescue.   According to the FBI, hundreds of thousands of children are reported  missing each year. Most of these cases are closed within hours, thanks  to the quick actions of families, communities, and law enforcement  personnel, but there also are children, like Lyric Cook and Elizabeth  Collins, who never make it home safely.   Ten-year-old Lyric and 8-year-old Elizabeth disappeared in 2012 while  taking a bike ride near their grandmother's house in Evansdale, IA.  Their bodies were found in the woods nearby later that year. Almost 5  years have passed since their lives were cut short, but the perpetrator  has yet to be identified.   My heart goes out to their grieving families and the families of all  the other children who have lost their lives in similar tragedies.  These child abduction and murder cases are a reminder of the need to  promptly pass legislation to extend the key programs authorized by the  Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. The Senate passed such a  bill by a vote of 89 to 0 in the 114th Congress. Another measure that  would make a difference in the lives of missing children is Kevin and  Avonte's Law. Last year, the Senate unanimously passed this  legislation, which is named in honor of two boys with autism who died  after wandering from safety. This bill, which I cosponsored, promotes  the use of technology to help locate children with autism and related  conditions who may be susceptible to wandering away from safety. It  also supports training for first responders and other community  officials to help prevent and respond to these cases.   A related bill passed the other Chamber by a wide margin late last  year. I am currently working with the sponsor of that companion bill,  Congressman Chris Smith, to resolve the differences between our two  bills. Congressman Smith and I intend to reintroduce an updated version  of Kevin and Avonte's Law in each Chamber in the coming weeks.   Finally, I would also like to take this opportunity to announce that  I will soon introduce legislation, known as the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act of 2017. The bill I am developing includes several  provisions to help in the fight against child exploitation. First, it  promotes training of school resource officers, to ensure that they can  better detect and respond to child trafficking cases. Second, it  updates the authorization for the National Center for Missing and  Exploited Children. Third, it extends and updates some of the key  programs that were established under the Trafficking Victims Protection  Act.   In closing, the feeling of dread and helplessness that families must  feel when a child goes missing is unimaginable. To help prevent similar  tragedies in the future, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  these important pieces of legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1237         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with  Senator Franken, the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of  2017. I thank Senator Franken for supporting and working with me, since  the 112th Congress, on this important bill to help our Nation's family  farmers.   This bipartisan bill addresses the 2012 United States Supreme Court  case Hall v. United States. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled  a provision that I authored in the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and  Consumer Protection Act did not accomplish what we in Congress  intended. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2017  corrects this unfortunate result and restores Congress's original  intent. The bill clarifies that bankrupt family farmers reorganizing  their debts, under chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code, may treat capital  gains taxes owed to the government, arising from the sale of farm  assets during the bankruptcy, as general unsecured claims. This bill  will give family farmers a chance to reorganize successfully and remove  the Internal Revenue Service's veto power over a plan's confirmation.   Congress created chapter 12 in 1986 as a temporary measure to provide  a specialized bankruptcy process for family farmers. In 2005, Congress  made chapter 12 a permanent part of the bankruptcy code. Between 1986  and 2005, we learned what worked and did not work for family farmers  reorganizing under chapter 12. In particular, family farmers faced  serious problems when they needed to sell land to fund their  reorganization plan. For example, a family farmer might sell portions  of the farm in order to generate cash and pay creditors. Unfortunately,  in most of these cases, the family farmer is selling land with a low  cost basis, because it has likely been held in the family for a very  long time. As a result, the family farmer gets hit with a substantial  capital gains tax, which is owed to the Internal Revenue Service.   Under the bankruptcy code's priorities structure for claims, taxes  owed to the IRS must be paid in full, unless the IRS agrees otherwise.  This creates problems for the family farmer who needs cash to pay  creditors and reorganize. Since the IRS has the ability to require full  payment, it essentially holds veto power over the confirmation of a  family farmer's chapter 12 plan. In many instances, the effect is that  a family farmer will not be able to have a plan confirmed. This is a  harsh result and does not make sense if the goal is to give family  farmers a fresh start. Recognizing this problem, Congress amended the  bankruptcy code in 2005 to provide that in these limited and particular  situations, the taxes owed to the IRS would be stripped of their  priority and treated as general unsecured debt. This removed the  government's veto power over plan confirmation and paved the way for  family farmers to reorganize under chapter 12.   Unfortunately, in Hall v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that  despite Congress's express goal of helping family farmers, the language  we used failed to accomplish the intended result. To be clear, the Hall  case was about statutory interpretation. There is no question about  what Congress was trying to do; rather, the question is, ``Did Congress  use the correct language?'' My goal, along with others at the time, was  to relieve family farmers from having their reorganization plans fail  because of certain tax liabilities owed to the government. Justice  Breyer noted this point in his dissent: ``Congress was concerned about  the effect on the farmer of collecting capital gains tax debts that  arose during (and were connected with) the Chapter 12 proceedings  themselves. . . . The majority does not deny the importance of  Congress' objective. Rather, it feels compelled to hold that Congress  put the Amendment in the wrong place.'' Hall v. United States, 132  S.Ct. 1882, 1897 (2012) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (internal citations  and quotations omitted).   As a result of the Hall case, family farmers facing bankruptcy now  find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place. The rules have  changed and must be corrected in order to provide certainty and clarity  in the law. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2017 does  this and provides the help needed for family farmers.   This bill adds a new section 1232 to the bankruptcy code. This new  section, along with other conforming changes, gives guidance and  certainty to debtors, practitioners, and courts as to how these claims  are to be treated during bankruptcy. I'm pleased that the bill we're  introducing today will help family farmers who are facing hard times.   In the wake of the Hall decision, this bill ensures that what  Congress sought to do in 2005 actually occurs. The Family Farmer  Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2017 provides the help that may one day  be needed for the hard working family farmers across our great Nation.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Schumer, Mr.          Blumenthal, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Rounds, and Mr. Merkley):   S. 1238.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with  Senator Franken, the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of  2017. I thank Senator Franken for supporting and working with me, since  the 112th Congress, on this important bill to help our Nation's family  farmers.   This bipartisan bill addresses the 2012 United States Supreme Court  case Hall v. United States. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled  a provision that I authored in the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and  Consumer Protection Act did not accomplish what we in Congress  intended. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2017  corrects this unfortunate result and restores Congress's original  intent. The bill clarifies that bankrupt family farmers reorganizing  their debts, under chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code, may treat capital  gains taxes owed to the government, arising from the sale of farm  assets during the bankruptcy, as general unsecured claims. This bill  will give family farmers a chance to reorganize successfully and remove  the Internal Revenue Service's veto power over a plan's confirmation.   Congress created chapter 12 in 1986 as a temporary measure to provide  a specialized bankruptcy process for family farmers. In 2005, Congress  made chapter 12 a permanent part of the bankruptcy code. Between 1986  and 2005, we learned what worked and did not work for family farmers  reorganizing under chapter 12. In particular, family farmers faced  serious problems when they needed to sell land to fund their  reorganization plan. For example, a family farmer might sell portions  of the farm in order to generate cash and pay creditors. Unfortunately,  in most of these cases, the family farmer is selling land with a low  cost basis, because it has likely been held in the family for a very  long time. As a result, the family farmer gets hit with a substantial  capital gains tax, which is owed to the Internal Revenue Service.   Under the bankruptcy code's priorities structure for claims, taxes  owed to the IRS must be paid in full, unless the IRS agrees otherwise.  This creates problems for the family farmer who needs cash to pay  creditors and reorganize. Since the IRS has the ability to require full  payment, it essentially holds veto power over the confirmation of a  family farmer's chapter 12 plan. In many instances, the effect is that  a family farmer will not be able to have a plan confirmed. This is a  harsh result and does not make sense if the goal is to give family  farmers a fresh start. Recognizing this problem, Congress amended the  bankruptcy code in 2005 to provide that in these limited and particular  situations, the taxes owed to the IRS would be stripped of their  priority and treated as general unsecured debt. This removed the  government's veto power over plan confirmation and paved the way for  family farmers to reorganize under chapter 12.   Unfortunately, in Hall v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that  despite Congress's express goal of helping family farmers, the language  we used failed to accomplish the intended result. To be clear, the Hall  case was about statutory interpretation. There is no question about  what Congress was trying to do; rather, the question is, ``Did Congress  use the correct language?'' My goal, along with others at the time, was  to relieve family farmers from having their reorganization plans fail  because of certain tax liabilities owed to the government. Justice  Breyer noted this point in his dissent: ``Congress was concerned about  the effect on the farmer of collecting capital gains tax debts that  arose during (and were connected with) the Chapter 12 proceedings  themselves. . . . The majority does not deny the importance of  Congress' objective. Rather, it feels compelled to hold that Congress  put the Amendment in the wrong place.'' Hall v. United States, 132  S.Ct. 1882, 1897 (2012) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (internal citations  and quotations omitted).   As a result of the Hall case, family farmers facing bankruptcy now  find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place. The rules have  changed and must be corrected in order to provide certainty and clarity  in the law. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2017 does  this and provides the help needed for family farmers.   This bill adds a new section 1232 to the bankruptcy code. This new  section, along with other conforming changes, gives guidance and  certainty to debtors, practitioners, and courts as to how these claims  are to be treated during bankruptcy. I'm pleased that the bill we're  introducing today will help family farmers who are facing hard times.   In the wake of the Hall decision, this bill ensures that what  Congress sought to do in 2005 actually occurs. The Family Farmer  Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2017 provides the help that may one day  be needed for the hard working family farmers across our great Nation.                                  ______
