 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lt. Gen.  Samuel A. Greaves, Director of the Missile Defense Agency, on the  advent of his retirement from the U.S. Air Force after 37 years of  military service to this great country.   General Greaves' long and storied career began when he was  commissioned in 1982 through the Air Force Reserve Officer Training  Corps Program after he graduated from Cornell University. Throughout  his service, he has held a variety of assignments in operational,  acquisition, and staff units, including assignments at Headquarters Air  Combat Command; the National Reconnaissance Office; and on the Air  Staff. He commanded the 45th Launch Group at Patrick AFB, Florida, the  Launch and Range Systems Wing, the Military Satellite Communications  Systems Wing, also served as vice commander, Space and Missile Systems  Center at Los Angeles AFB. He later served as the director, strategic  plans, programs and analyses, Headquarters Air Force Space Command,  Peterson AFB, Colorado, and then was assigned as the deputy director,  Missile Defense Agency, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. Prior to his current  assignment, he was the commander, Space and Missile Systems Center, Air  Force Space Command, Los Angeles Air Force Base, California.   His operational experience is exceptional and includes work on the  space shuttle, Titan, Atlas and Delta space-launch systems. He  currently wears the Command Space Badge, a joint Air Force and Army  award for training, experience, and assignments in space warning,  satellite command and control, missile operations, space surveillance,  and/or space lift.   During his tour, the Agency and the Department of Defense made  significant progress in addressing current and emerging ballistic  missile threats by fielding, upgrading, and improving missile defenses  to provide U.S. military commanders a highly effective ballistic  missile defense capability to defend the United States and its deployed  troops, U.S. allies, and friends around the world. He also laid the  groundwork for the Agency's pursuit of technologies and systems to  track and defeat hypersonic glide vehicle threats. General Greaves  implemented a clear strategy focusing on maintaining the reliability of  the Ballistic Missile Defense System, BMDS, to build warfighter  confidence, increasing capability and capacity of fielded missile  defense systems, and making measured investments to address the  advanced threat.   While serving as the director, Missile Defense Agency, General  Greaves demonstrated superior leadership, extraordinary dedication, and  exceptional professionalism as the key interface between MDA and the  Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Combatant Commands,  Services and Military Departments, the Department of State, and  international partners. He also  [[Page S3051]]  worked very closely with the administration and Congress to support  significant improvements to the Nation's missile defense programs and  plans in 2017, known as the missile defeat and defense enhancements,  that resulted in Congress increasing the Missile Defense Agency's  budget request for fiscal year 2018 from $7.8 billion to over $11.5  billion, which represents both the largest single year increase and  total budget in MDA's history.   General Greaves placed a high priority on increasing the ground-based  midcourse defense's, GMD, fleet reliability and confidence by upgrading  fielded GBIs, implementing improvements in new production GBIs, and  incorporating reliability, producibility and sustainability  improvements in future GBI designs. General Greaves oversaw GMD ground  system modernization, to include delivery of Ground System 7A, which  removed obsolete equipment from the kill chain, eliminated cyber  defense vulnerabilities, and improved redundancy for the warfighter. He  also pressed forward with key reliability improvements, including the  development of the redesigned kill vehicle, RKV, and upgrading of the  GMD Communications Network, and launch support equipment.   General Greaves also successfully completed the expansion of the  Nation's deployed GBI fleet to 44 interceptors in 2017, known as 44 by  17, which resulted in a nearly 50 percent increase in the number of  deployed interceptors available for use by the warfighter.   Moreover, in response to the growing North Korean ICBM threat, in  December 2017, General Greaves began executing Department and  congressional guidance in the missile defeat and defense enhancements  plan to further expand the GBI fleet to a total of 64 deployed GBIs by  2023 through the rapid and efficient construction of a new, fourth  missile field at Fort Greely, AK, which will add 20 additional  operational silos to the GMD system.   If this were not enough, he oversaw multiple successful flight tests.  This includes flight test ground-based midcourse test 11, FTG-11, a GBI  salvo test against a complex, threat representative ICBM-class target.  This intercept flight test was so successful that the director for the  Department Operational Test and Evaluation, DOT&E, Agency directed  DOT&E staff to refer to FTG-11 as the first operational flight test of  the ground-based midcourse defense system. FTM-45, also conducted under  his direction, demonstrated an Aegis BMD organic engagement using a SM- 3 Blk IIA against a MRBM, a key milestone for the SM-3 Block IIA return  to flight. In addition, he directed the flight test integrated 3, FTI- 03, an operational live fire test demonstrating the engage-on-remote  capability of the Aegis Weapon System to track and intercept an IRBM  target with an Aegis Ashore-launched SM-3 Block IIA interceptor. This  test demonstrated the effectiveness of the European phased adaptive  approach phase 3 architecture and supports a critical acquisition  milestone for the SM-3 Block IIA missile program.   General Greaves also laid the foundation for the Long Range  Discrimination Radar, Homeland Defense Radar-Hawaii, Pacific Radar, and  other discrimination improvements to improve homeland defense against  emerging threats. He further advanced the development of two-stage  booster capability to provide additional homeland defense battle-space  capability by enabling shorter engagement times without the expense of  a separate development program. He also continued improvements in the  command and control, battle management and communication  infrastructure, which provides persistent acquisition, tracking,  cueing, discrimination, and fire-control quality data to Aegis  Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), GMD, Terminal High Altitude Area  Defense, THAAD, Patriot, and coalition partners to support homeland and  regional missile defense.   General Greaves was further responsible for major BMDS capability  enhancements and asset deployments around the globe. He guided program  plans to strengthen regional defenses by continuing deliveries of  Standard Missile-3, SM-3, Block IBs, for use on Aegis BMD ships and at  Aegis Ashore-Romania, and THAAD interceptors. After fielding the THAAD  Battery to South Korea, in late 2017, the commander of United States  Forces Korea requested tighter coupling between THAAD and Patriot units  in theater. General Greaves worked with Army PEO Missiles and Space on  proposed solutions to address the request and improve regional  ballistic missile defense. He also pushed for the development of a  future THAAD system, including development of a remote launcher  capability, integration of Patriot MSE interceptor and launcher into  the THAAD Weapon System, and improved interoperability by enabling  Patriot Launch-on-Remote (THAAD).   He also continued advancement of the Aegis BMD system in  collaboration with the Navy to counter growing and more complex  threats, including improvements in system and missile reliability as  well as increases in Aegis BMD engagement capacity and lethality,  including work on the Aegis Weapon System, Aegis Ashore-Poland, the SM- 3 IIA program, and Sea Based Terminal defense. General Greaves kept the  Agency on track to deliver the initial SM-3 Block IIA missiles  developed in cooperation with Japan to support European phased adaptive  approach, EPAA, phase 3. He oversaw the construction of the Aegis  Ashore system in Poland in support of EPAA Phase 3 to improve European  NATO defenses against medium- and intermediate-range ballistic  missiles, which is expected to be delivered in 2020.   General Greaves has been a tireless advocate for the development and  deployment of a critically needed space sensor layer for hypersonic and  missile defense, the need for which can be best summed by the general  himself when he said: ``If you can't see it, you can't shoot it.'' As a  result of his efforts, the Congress continually funded the MDA to  develop such a capability. In 2019, the general partnered with DARPA  and the Air Force on the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor  Program, which is now working with industry to reduce the key risks for  this space sensor layer.   He also successfully completed the development and deployment of a  network of sensor payloads hosted on commercial satellites, called  Space-based Kill Assessment, or SKA. This program will collect data on  missile intercepts, and inform the post-intercept assessment by the  warfighter. This capability will provide the warfighter the option to  adjust their shot doctrine to more efficiently manage interceptor  inventory, thereby dramatically increasing the number of threats the  system can engage for the defense of the homeland. In fact, when  warfighters took part in simulations involving SKA they were so highly  impressed by this new capability they requested it be made operational  sooner than MDA had planned. The SKA program has been so impressive  that the Department recently recognized MDA, under General Greaves  leadership, for its acquisition success by presenting it with the  Packard Award for Acquisition Excellence for the development of SKA.   General Greaves demonstrated his commitment to expand work with U.S.  international partners, to include conducting joint analyses to support  partner missile defense acquisition decisions, cooperative research and  development projects, deploying BMD assets, foreign military sales,  FMS, and coproduction efforts. Under General Greave's leadership, the  Agency executed an historic FMS case with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  for seven THAAD batteries and accompanying launchers, radars, and  interceptors. In addition, he continued work on the co-development with  Japan of the SM-3 Block IIA missile that will be deployed to the  operational Aegis Ashore missile defense sites in Romania and Poland.   His exceptional leadership style influenced an organization of over  10,000 personnel across 13 time zones. These distinctive  accomplishments of General Greaves are monumental. As he and his wife  Patricia prepare for retirement, I want to thank them for their service  to the United States of America--General Greaves and Patricia--Bravo  Zulu.                            ____________________
