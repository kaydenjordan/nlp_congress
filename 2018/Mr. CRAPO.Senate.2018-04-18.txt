 Mr. President, in a few minutes, at noon, the Senate will  begin the process of voting--two votes. The first of those votes will  be a vote on a resolution brought to the Senate by Senator Moran and  Senator Toomey to reject a rule proposed by the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau's 2013 action in which it sought to assert  jurisdiction over auto finance guidance. I use the word ``rule''  guardedly, though, because, as you will see from my remarks, this was  an end run by the CFPB in two ways. First, the CFPB doesn't have  jurisdiction over auto finance. Second, the CFPB did not use the  Administrative Procedure Act to adopt a rule; it sought to implement a  rule through a process of issuing a guidance to avoid the scrutiny and  the legal challenges to its effort to assert this jurisdiction.   It is important that Congress disapprove this guidance because it was  an attempt by the CFPB to make substantive policy changes through  guidance rather than through the rulemaking process governed by the  Administrative Procedure Act. As I said before, it is also an attempt  to regulate auto dealers, who were explicitly exempted from CFPB  supervision and regulation under the Dodd-Frank act. Finally, it is  also a rule that has caused great difficulty and problems in the  marketplace, hurting auto dealers and consumers alike.   The CFPB itself, when undertaking this action, admitted what it was  doing. The CFPB rejected developing a rule using its statutory  authority because the actions it was seeking to regulate are ostensibly  those of dealers over whom it has no regulatory authority. It is  interesting that even in the CFPB's own documentation of what it was  doing, it indicated that it didn't have the authority to do it. So the  CFPB decided to develop a guidance, rather than a rule, as a backdoor  way to regulate auto dealers.   The CFPB's indirect auto bulletin represents a departure from typical  Federal agency practice, as reflected in the GAO's conclusion that its  rule is subject to CRA requirements. In other words, in a ruling, the  GAO said: Yes, this actually is a rule even though the Administrative  Procedure Act wasn't followed. That decision by the GAO gives this  Congress the authority to reject the CFPB's actions.   Some of my colleagues on the other side say that disapproving  guidance is somehow a loophole we are using because we should only have  authority to disapprove a specific rule. The GAO's ruling on the CFPB's  guidance clearly puts this within the jurisdiction of this Senate.   I would point my colleagues to a statement from, among others,  Senator Reid in the Congressional Record from 1996 when the  Congressional Review Act was passed, explaining what the authors'  intent was when passing this legislation. He said: ``[T]he authors are  concerned that some agencies have attempted to circumvent notice-and- comment requirements by trying to give legal effect to general  statements of policy, `guidelines,' and agency policy and procedure  manuals. The authors admonish the agencies that the APA's broad  definition of `rule' was adopted by the authors of this legislation to  discourage circumvention of the requirements'' of it.   As a result of these significant concerns, this resolution has  attracted substantial support, including from 14 different  organizations involved with helping consumers buy a vehicle, and an  endorsement via a Statement of Administration Policy from the White  House. The following organizations submitted letters: the Chamber of  Commerce, the Credit Union National Association, the Independent  Community Bankers of America, the American Bankers Association, the  American Financial Services Association, the National Automobile  Dealers Association, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the  National RV Dealers Association, the National Independent Automobile  Dealers Association, the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association, the  American International Automobile Dealers Association, the National  Auto Auction Association, the Motorcycle Industry Council, and the  National Federation of Independent Business.   Finally, I would like to respond to the assertion that disapproving  this guidance somehow allows auto dealers to discriminate. That is the  issue that is at stake here. The reason that Congress did not give the  CFPB jurisdiction over auto dealers is that the auto dealers are  already subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. If we reject this  resolution, the auto dealers will continue to be subject to the Equal  Credit Opportunity Act, which will continue to apply to all creditors,  which means auto dealers who extend credit will be prohibited from  discriminating against customers on the basis of race, sex, age,  national origin, marital status, or because one receives public  assistance.   In other words, we are not changing the law. We are not taking away  any protections in the law. We are stopping a rogue agency from  continuing to be able to enforce a rule which it sought to create by  avoiding the Administrative Procedure Act.   I urge my colleagues to vote to support this resolution.   Mr. President, I yield my time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 5  minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to the second vote.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to start the first  vote immediately.    Mr. President, I have 13 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
