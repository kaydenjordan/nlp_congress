 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 70 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 70         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 38) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of       the Interior known as the Stream Protection Rule. All points       of order against consideration of the joint resolution are       waived. The joint resolution shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the joint resolution       are waived. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the joint resolution and on any amendment thereto       to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) One       hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural       Resources; and (2) one motion to recommit.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington is recognized  for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman and my good friend from  Florida (Mr. Hastings), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman and my good friend from  Florida (Mr. Hastings), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Washington?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, just yesterday, the House Rules  Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 70, providing for  the consideration of H.J. Res. 38, legislation utilizing the  Congressional Review Act to overturn the final stream protection rule  promulgated by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and  Enforcement, or the OSMRE, which is at the Department of the Interior.  The rule provides for consideration of the joint resolution under a  closed rule, as is customary with these CRA measures.   Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of a critical  measure that will help protect American businesses and families from  the Obama administration's rampant regulatory overreach. H.J. Res. 38  disapproves of the final stream protection rule which was released by  the Department of the Interior on December 19, 2016, representing yet  another last-minute, midnight regulation from the previous  administration.   This burdensome rule seeks to govern the interaction between surface  mining operations and streams by establishing a buffer-zone rule that  blocks mining within 100 feet of those streams. This was done, despite  the Department of the Interior's own reports, which shows that  virtually all coal mines in this country have no offsite impacts, they  are being operated safely, and that lands are being restored  successfully under existing Federal and State regulation.   During the rulemaking process, OSMRE and the Department of the  Interior ignored existing regulatory success at the Federal and the  State level and shut out the cooperating agencies, the States who are  responsible for enforcing Federal mining regulations.   In 2015, 9 of the 10 cooperating States withdrew as cooperating  agencies in the rulemaking and development process, due to OSMRE's  exclusionary tactics, failure to provide for meaningful participation,  and continual limiting of the States' involvement over the past several  years.   The National Environmental Policy Act or, as we know it as, NEPA,  requires OSMRE, as the lead rulemaking agency, to involve States in the  drafting of the regulation and requires them to involve States. These  failures, and the restrictive tactics that were employed by OSMRE, led  the House Natural Resources Committee chairman, Mr. Rob Bishop of Utah,  to send a letter in 2015 to the GAO, the Government Accountability  Office, requesting a review of OSMRE's compliance with NEPA in the  agencies' development and drafting of the proposed stream protection  rule. Ample evidence exists that OSMRE excluded these States from the  NEPA process, in contradiction of both NEPA regulations and the  memoranda of understanding between OSMRE and the States.   Mr. Speaker, the stream protection rule unilaterally rewrites over  400 existing rules and regulations. It threatens over one-third of the  Nation's coal mining workforce and will send repercussions throughout  the broader U.S. economy. The final rule is the definition of a one- size-fits-all solution due to OSMRE's failure to conduct the 7-year  rewrite in a transparent process consistent with their statutory  requirements to engage State and local stakeholders.   An economic analysis conducted by the National Mining Association  found that the total number of jobs at risk of loss is somewhere  between 112,000 and 280,000 people, approximately 30 to 75 percent of  the current industry employment levels.   Further, the misguided regulation would jeopardize 40,000 to 77,000  jobs in both surface and underground mining operations, industries that  are still reeling from 8 years of overregulation from the previous  administration.   And while the Obama administration never seemed to mind the  consequences of its actions on hardworking Americans, I can assure you  that the new, unified Republican government is opposed to ineffective  regulations like this one which unnecessarily put people out of work,  raise energy costs on consumers, and do nothing to improve the  environment.   By passing this rule, we have the opportunity to consider a  resolution that will prevent this regulation from removing over one- half of the total U.S. coal reserves available for extraction, while  also reducing oppressive barriers to responsible coal production.    The Congressional Review Act of 1996 was enacted to be a powerful  tool to  [[Page H762]]  allow Congress to overturn last-minute regulations from the previous  administration, under an expedited legislative process. If Congress  passes a joint resolution disapproving the rule, and the resolution  becomes a law, the rule cannot take effect or continue. CRAs are  designed to address and invalidate problematic rules from the previous  administration, and the stream protection rule clearly fits the bill.   Furthermore, this CRA provides certainty to State regulatory bodies  tasked with regulating 97 percent of the coal mines in the United  States and enforcing Federal mining regulations by strengthening the  State primacy framework provided in the Surface Mining Control and  Reclamation Act.   Blocking the final stream protection rule will restore an important  stream of State and Federal tax revenue associated with coal extraction  across the country that is benefiting hardworking American taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, every Member of this body wants to protect the  environment, ensure clean water and clean air for our citizens, and  encourage innovative and responsible ways to produce energy. However,  these goals are not mutually exclusive, as some opponents of this  legislation will argue.   It is past time that we embrace commonsense, practical Federal rules  and regulations that protect the environment and the countless  Americans working in the industries that support our economy and  provide for greater domestic energy independence.   The rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of a  bill that is critically important to the future economic growth and job  growth of our country. By passing this CRA, we can take a badly needed  step toward protecting American families and businesses from the  rampant executive overreach that will be the defining achievement of  the past administration.   I urge my colleagues to support this rule, as well as the underlying  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, getting back to the issue at hand and the stream  protection rule, there are many points that my friend from Florida  brought up. One occurred to me as well: Is this really a midnight rule;  or could something that was started in 2008 really be considered as  something that was shoved through at the last minute?   I did ask that question, and the answer is a resounding ``yes.''   During the process in 2011, some of the reports came out that were  leaked that the Department did not see as favorable as it related to  jobs and the economy and the negative impact that it would have on  that, so they stopped the process, shutting out the States violating  the memorandum of understanding that they are required to work with the  States on the rulemaking process leaving those States with no recourse  but to withdraw from the process.   In 2015, this Congress told them to reengage with the States, which  they did to some degree, making it necessary for States to actually pay  for the scientific evidence that was necessary for them to be engaged.  So there are several problems that cause this to be an issue that we  need to address today, and certainly making it a midnight rule, the  last thing done as the administration walks out the door, qualifies  this as something that we should be considering for many reasons and on  many levels.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Thompson), who is my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the good gentleman  from West Virginia (Mr. Mooney).   Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of the rule and the underlying joint resolution to begin the  process of rolling back President Obama's war on coal. That is the rule  we are debating today; that is the bill before us, not to be confused  with the other issue that is being discussed.   I was proud that, in the last Congress, I was the lead sponsor of the  STREAM Act, H.R. 1644, which would have prevented the implementation of  a new coal regulation that would have cost upwards of 70,000 good- paying jobs. My legislation passed the House of Representatives in  January of 2016, with bipartisan support, and sent a clear message to  President Obama's administration that the so-called stream protection  rule was bad policy. Unfortunately, my bill never received a vote in  the U.S. Senate.   Despite the clear message from Congress, the Obama administration, in  the final days, issued a disastrous stream protection rule. Again, he  did this as he was leaving the Presidency in the final days before he  left office. But don't let the clever name fool you. The new regulation  will have far-reaching impacts for the coal industry--an industry, I  might add, that provides over 90 percent of the power generation for my  home State of West Virginia.   The rule prescribes a one-size-fits-all approach in defiance of  common sense and the Federal law. There is no need to rewrite over 400  regulations, as this rule does, other than as a blatant attempt to  regulate the coal industry out of business. We cannot allow this rule  to move forward, and thus we need to support the rule and the  underlying joint resolution of disapproval.   Let us not forget that former President Barack Obama promised that he  would bankrupt the coal industry. People are losing their jobs and the  dignity that comes with work. Our communities are also suffering. Fewer  jobs means less economic investment and less hope.   I encourage my colleagues to visit West Virginia or Appalachia and  see firsthand what President Obama's policies have done to our  communities. It is heartbreaking to hear the stories and see the faces  of struggling families as they try to pay their bills. I stand today  with those communities in rolling back the policies that have caused so  much harm and pain.   These new regulations would be catastrophic to the coal industry and  all of the hardworking American families that depend on coal to keep  their energy costs low. The shame of it all is that it is preventable.  We must end this war on coal now, and that process begins today.   I made a promise to my constituents of the Second District of West  Virginia that I would fight for the coal industry and bring back jobs  to my State. Today is the first in many steps this Congress, along with  President Donald Trump, will take to make good on the promises we made  in November.   Again, I encourage support for the rule and the underlying resolution  of disapproval.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from wearing  communicative badges while under recognition.    Mr. Speaker, I do not yield.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington does not  yield. Therefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.    Mr. Speaker, I am reiterating my earlier announcement  that all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only, and I will not  yield for any other purpose.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington does not  yield. Therefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader of the  Republican Conference.   Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of the rule and the underlying  legislation.   Since the beginning of this Congress, we have devoted ourselves most  prominently to a single goal: making Washington work for the people  again.   There is one thing here in Washington that consistently stands  against our people, our economy, and our Constitution: the Federal  bureaucracy.   These agencies, bureaus, and departments--so numerous that nobody  even knows how many there are--spend their lives thinking up new rules,  and the rules they produce weigh down businesses, destroy jobs, and  limit Americans' rights. Career bureaucrats who can't be voted out of  office wield punishing authority with little to no accountability. They  are agents of the status quo, and the revolving door of Federal  employees moving to lobbying arms and consulting firms breed thousands  of regulations that enrich the connected and powerful, sometimes at the  great expense of the average American. This is the swamp. This is what  opposes the people, and we are draining it.   In recent weeks, this House has already started its two-part plan to  strip the bureaucracy of its power. We started to change the structure  in Washington by passing the REINS Act and the Regulatory  Accountability Act. This week, we begin part two: targeting specific  rules and stripping them from the books.   There has been no industry in America that has been more regulated  than energy. We are going to use the Congressional Review Act to repeal  the stream protection rule that could destroy tens of thousands of  mining jobs and put up to 64 percent of our country's coal reserves off  limits.   Then we will take on President Obama's 11th hour BLM methane  emissions requirement. The oil and gas industry in America has already  drastically reduced methane emissions even while increasing output, and  the EPA already has the authority to regulate air emissions. Instead of  helping the environment, this rule could cost America's energy industry  up to $1 billion by 2025 and force smaller operations, especially out  West, to shut down and lay off employees. So, this Friday, the House  will get rid of it.   We will also take the ax to the SEC disclosure rule, which--now, if  you can believe it--targets publicly traded American energy companies  with even more regulatory compliance while it lets foreign companies  off the hook. Washington should put American companies first, not put  them at a disadvantage to their foreign competitors.   Mr. Speaker, it is not just energy, which would be bad enough; but  under President Obama, the bureaucracy has even threatened our basic  constitutional rights. A new rule from the Social Security  Administration would increase scrutiny on up to 4.2 million disabled  Americans if they attempt to purchase firearms. For the completely  unrelated circumstance of having someone help manage your finances,  Social Security recipients could be kept from exercising their Second  Amendment rights. In an affront to due process, the bureaucracy has  even attempted to blacklist from Federal contracts any business that is  accused of violating labor laws, and that could be before the company  has a chance to defend itself in court.   Every single one of these will be gone. With a vote in the House, a  vote in the Senate, and President Trump's signature, we will get rid of  every one of these job-killing and destructive regulations. The House  is always at the service of the people. Now we are making the  bureaucracy serve the people, too.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time; so,  yes, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I would just like to take a minute to remind the American people and  my friends across the aisle that we are here today, as the minority  leader said, to begin the process of unwinding the burdensome  regulations that are truly stifling job creation and hurting our  friends and our families in each and every one of our neighborhoods  across the country.   Many from the other side have tried to distract with unrelated  issues. I just want to be clear that the rule today does not address  immigration in any way and that none of their requests went through the  regular and bipartisan process to clear such requests.   So let's focus on why we are here. We are here because we must take a  firm stand against the overly burdensome and restrictive regulations  that have been issued in the waning days of the previous  administration. By passing this CRA, we can rescind the final stream  protection rule, which the OSM produced without input from the States-- responsible for enforcing mining regulations--and which disregards  [[Page H770]]  existing regulations on both the State and the Federal levels that have  proven to be effective.   This regulation will have devastating effects on mining communities  across the country and will lead to significant job losses and higher  electricity costs--all while weakening U.S. energy security for  decades. The stream protection rule will drastically reduce our access  to coal and our ability to develop new clean coal technologies, which  will result in reduced domestic energy protection and in tens of  thousands of lost jobs in coal-producing States as well as in  industries across the country that are reliant on this energy. If we  fail to pass the underlying bill, the rule's devastating impacts will  be felt far and wide in our great land as approximately 78,000 mining  jobs will be lost, which is in addition to the tens of thousands of  mining jobs that have already been lost in the last 8 years.   Mr. Speaker, coal is essential to the U.S. economy. It provides  affordable energy that accounts for almost 40 percent of the Nation's  electricity supply--almost 20 percent in the gentleman's home State of  Florida. Because of its abundance, reliability, and affordability,  electricity generated from coal is generally 30 percent cheaper than  other alternative energy sources. Additionally, at current consumption  rates, our country has more than 250 years of remaining coal reserves,  ensuring that we will have energy security here at home for generations  to come.   Passing H.J. Res. 38 will protect American jobs and families from yet  another burdensome regulation that has failed to follow the basic  tenets of transparency, inclusivity, and cooperation with stakeholders,  cooperating States, and, most importantly, the American people.   Now is the time for Congress to overturn this unparalleled executive  overreach and implement policies that protect communities that have  been long forgotten by the former administration. The CRA was designed  for this exact purpose, and we now have a unique opportunity to pass  this legislation through both Chambers and see it signed into law.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for the  consideration of an important resolution that will ensure that mining  communities and hardworking families are not pressed by another  crippling Federal regulation. I believe this rule and the underlying  legislation are strong measures that are important to our country's  future. I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 70 and the  underlying joint resolution.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  opposition to H. Res. 70 and the joint resolution for which it would  provide consideration, H.J. Res. 38, expressing disapproval of the  Stream Protection Rule submitted by the Department of the Interior,  Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement.   The Stream Protection Rule is a critical update to a decades-old  regulation that provides clear and established requirements for  responsible surface coal mining while protecting vital community health  and economic opportunity across the United States.   The rule, crafted in an extensive and transparent public process,  includes reasonable reforms to avoid and minimize impacts on surface  water, groundwater, fish, wildlife, and other natural resources.  Grounded in sound, peer-reviewed scientific evidence and modern  technological advancements, the rule modernizes 33-year old regulations  to keep pace with modern mining techniques and incorporates in its  guidance a broader scientific understanding of the deleterious effects  caused by unmitigated surface coal mining activity.   During the development of this critical rule, the Department of  Interior received over 150,000 public comments, hosted 15 open houses  and public meetings, and engaged in broad outreach to stake holders  nationwide. This rule was carefully developed and thoroughly considered  with all stakeholders provided a seat at the table.   Ultimately, H.J. Res. 38 would undermine the Stream Protection Rule  and begin the process to undue monumental steps in the right direction  to protect the health, well-being, and economic prosperity of countless  Americans living near coal mining sites. I strongly urge my colleagues  to reject H. Res. 70, providing for the consideration of the harmful  H.J. Res. 38. Any effort to undermine this important health, economic,  and environmental protection results in a lose-lose situation for the  American public and I oppose it.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 70 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       724) to provide that the Executive Order entitled       ``Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the       United States'' (January 27, 2017), shall have no force or       effect, to prohibit the use of Federal funds to enforce the       Executive Order, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as       may have been adopted. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 724.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.  [[Page H771]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
