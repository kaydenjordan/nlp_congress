 Madam Speaker, this past June, our family was rocked by a  very scary incident. We were excited and joyfully anticipating the  birth of our very first grandchild, a boy whose name would be Silas.  Our excitement and joy quickly turned to fear and dread when Silas was  born lifeless, the umbilical cord tightly wound around his neck three  times.   I was in the waiting room when I received a text from my wife, and  she said:         Pray now. Silas was born, but he's not breathing. They're       working on him.    I began praying, and about 15 minutes later, my wife, Amie,  frantically ran into the waiting room in tears and said:         He's still not breathing. Pray harder. Pray harder.    Instinctively, I fell to my knees, and I pled, crying to God:         Please, God, save his life. Breathe life into him.    I realized in that moment what I have known for all my life, and that  is that human life is valuable, precious, and fragile.   Thanks be to God, about 10 minutes later, the doctor walked into the  room and said:         He's breathing, finally, and we think he's going to make       it.    Two days ago, Silas turned 6 months old, and I cannot wait to see  what God has planned for him. Silas fought for his life, and I am so  thankful he will get to experience all that life has to offer.   Members, every innocent child should have a chance at life. God  forbid, we would allow that fragile, precious, valuable, innocent life  to be taken.                            ____________________
