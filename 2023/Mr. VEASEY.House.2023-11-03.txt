 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend and congratulate the  Texas Rangers on their historic first World Series championship. They  brought the trophy home to Arlington, Texas, and the Rangers managed to  overcome a 6-year playoff drought and two prior World Series losses to  bring the trophy home.   They have a great front office, a great manager, and a great owner  that put together the winning combination that allowed them to be able  to hoist the Commissioner's Trophy this week and also set records of  the most RBI's and doubles in a single post-season game.   They had to overcome a lot. They had injuries, they lost their last  regular season game, and they had a commentator in the booth that  seemed to be rooting against them. Nonetheless, they stayed focused,  and it helped the Rangers cement the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area  as one of the few regions in the United States where all four major  sports franchises have won a championship.   From their humble beginnings through heartbreak and defeat to the  World Series champions, the Rangers have brought joy to everyone in the  Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area.   Congratulations again to the Texas Rangers, 2023 World Series  champions.                            ____________________
