 Mr. Speaker, what a wonderful country that we live  in. It is wonderful because we have come--maybe some because of the  Statue of Liberty's wonderful words or others who have come in  different ways, we are different, but we are one.   Tonight in his message, wouldn't it be well to focus on our unity and  not our divisiveness?   Since the election, there have been 1,000 hate crimes. And, of  course, in the last 72 hours to last week, two Indo Americans-- Indians--engineers, one dead, one shot. And the perpetrator indicated  in his words: I shot two Middle Easterners.   What kind of hate is being generated?   It has been generated, and it needs to cease. We need to have a  speech tonight that will speak to the unity, speak against anti- Semitism and the attacks that are going on the Jewish community. We  need to recognize the distinctions and the differences. We need to stop  the siege against Hispanics, mass deportation, African-American  discrimination and others, women and many others.   This needs to be a time of unity, respect, and dignity. I will be  waiting to hear and to see what kind of America are we going to be  guided by and what kind of America will we live in?   I hope for the best.                            ____________________
