 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Goodlatte) for his leadership on this area of human trafficking, along  with the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), my good friend, for  all of her support on this human trafficking issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present the Put Trafficking Victims  First Act to the House of Representatives. I am thrilled to have the  opportunity to address the concerns of victims of human trafficking  across our country.   Too often, victims of trafficking are overlooked and underserved.  This must stop. America needs to afford trafficking victims the same  justice, protections, and dignity that other victims of crime receive.   In my home State of Missouri, I have met with countless survivors,  along with survivors across this country, and I have listened to their  painful stories. They need help to rebuild their lives, and that is  exactly what my bill will do.                                time  1730    One important place to start is in the courtroom, where we need  victim-centered practices oriented toward justice and recovery. For  example, victims technically have access to mandatory restitution in  Federal courts, but the sad reality is that, according to one estimate,  sex trafficking victims get restitution in only 14 percent of Federal  sex trafficking cases. This, Mr. Speaker, is unacceptable. My bill will  direct the Attorney General to make mandatory restitution mandatory and  implement victim-friendly procedures in Federal criminal cases.   Another big problem is that we just don't have good data on how to  identify and rescue victims and put them on a path toward success. We  don't really know where to find victims, what portions may be coming  from foster care, or what their age, ethnicity, or other  characteristics are. We can't help them if we can't find them. So we  desperately need good data and reporting in order to improve victim  outreach.   To answer this need, my bill establishes a national working group to  develop robust methodologies to determine the prevalence and trends of  tracking and evaluating how to best identify victims and address their  needs. My bill will establish a national survey of survivors so we can  better understand how victims are accessing help.   Yet another problem is that we are failing to provide trauma-informed  care to victims, care that would help victims recover and cooperate  with criminal investigations so we can put pimps and buyers behind  bars. Lack of help for victims in the justice system can lead to  revictimization, or even result in victims being criminalized for  offenses they were forced to commit.   That is why we will train agencies, law enforcement, and prosecutors  across the country to implement victim-centered approaches to  investigating and preventing trafficking. We encourage law enforcement  and prosecutors to make every attempt to determine whether an  individual's participation in trafficking is, in fact, free from fraud,  force, or coercion before arresting or charging them.   Finally, victims of trafficking are mostly served at the State level,  so it is critical that States improve how they respond to victims. My  bill encourages States to improve outreach, screen children entering  child welfare services and the justice system, screen foreign nationals  who may be labor trafficked, create safe harbor laws, and develop  emergency response plans.   Mr. Speaker, together we can get victims of trafficking out of  dangerous and abusive situations and create better, more accessible  trauma-informed services. I urge my colleagues to put trafficking  victims first and to support this legislation.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), the original cosponsor of this  legislation and one of the champions of protecting children and a  leader of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth.
