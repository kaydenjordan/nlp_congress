 Mr. Speaker, what we are discussing  tonight isn't about us. It is about the will of the American people.   They are brokenhearted. They are crying. And they are discouraged.   An overwhelming number of American people want this President out of  office now. This is why we have to do it now. We have to heal the  wound. The longer the President is over there, the more we are tearing  the heart and soul out of the American people. Let us do it now.
