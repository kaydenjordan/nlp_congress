 Mr. President, I rise to speak about the same topic that  my colleague from Maryland and my colleague from Minnesota just spoke  of. I will start by highlighting the legislation that Senator Smith  from Minnesota has been leading. I am grateful for her work and am  grateful to be a cosponsor and a supporter of the legislation.   The Fair Compensation for Low-Wage Contractor Employees Act is the  bill that we are talking about. I think it is critically important that  we pass this legislation. The country has endured the shutdown of 35  days. Now we are in this interim period, waiting for the results of  negotiations that are underway with appropriators. We wish them well,  and we hope they can come to an agreement that can be signed into law  so that we will not have the threat of yet another shutdown. In this  case, President Trump decided to shut the government down for 35 days.  That decision, I guess, was prompted by his not receiving funding or  winning the debate, at that time, for the funding of his proposed  border wall.   As we know, Federal employees, as opposed to Federal contractors,  have received backpay. That was pursuant to legislation that was led by  Senator Cardin. I know his colleague from Maryland, Senator Van Hollen,  who just spoke, also worked very hard to pass that legislation. That is  good news that Federal employees have backpay.   In this case now, though, although the government has been open for  nearly 2 weeks, many vulnerable, low-wage Federal contractors, as  opposed to employees, are still struggling due to the lack of their  backpay. They were not covered by the bill that provided backpay to  Federal employees. Over 820,000 Federal workers went without pay in the  35-day shutdown. It is also estimated that some 2 million private  sector employees who work at companies that contract with the Federal  Government also may have gone without pay.   Although the financial future of the Federal contractors was and  remains in serious jeopardy, many of their stories have gone untold.  For example, a constituent of mine from Adams County, which is on the  southernmost border--right on the Maryland-Pennsylvania border--is a  Federal employee, not a contractor, who was furloughed, and her husband  works for a private company that has a contract with the TSA. So there,  in one family, one couple, you have a Federal employee, and you have an  employee of a Federal contractor.    This is what this constituent said:         Because of all of this, we have taken our children out of       daycare . . . so, now our daycare provider is without       hundreds of dollars a month. This will keep trickling down to       many others. . . . It will not just affect federal employees.    That is what a woman from Adams County said.   Then you go further east in our State to Montgomery County, a very  populous, suburban Philadelphia county. This constituent is a Federal  contractor. I will read part of this letter, not all of it. This  constituent said: ``As of now, I am back working; however, it may only  be until February 15th.''   That is the day when the current continuing resolution runs out.   I will continue the letter with these words:         In these last 6 weeks, I have completely drained the       family's rainy day fund. . . . I have asked all my utilities       and credit card companies to postpone my due payments. In       addition, my 8-year-old daughter was concerned we are not       going to be able to eat. Like many Americans we live paycheck       to paycheck.    I could go on from there, but I will not. I think people understand  the sentiment. Most people have some sense of the gravity of the  suffering and what could be even additional suffering, but most of us  can't even begin to imagine.   The longest shutdown in American history might be over, but these  Federal contractors are still struggling to put food on the table, to  purchase medicine, and to pay their bills on time. That is why, led by  Senator Smith, we must pass this legislation, the Fair Compensation for  Low-Wage Contractor Employees Act. The legislation would compensate  contractors for providing backpay to low-wage contractor service  employees who have been furloughed or laid off during the shutdown.   Who are these individuals we are talking about? Here are just a few  examples. They are custodians, security guards, and food service  workers who work alongside Federal employees and ensure that our  government runs smoothly.   We always hear a lot of talk by politicians and sometimes citizens  who complain about the government, denigrate the government, and talk  about how bad the government is. Then we go through a 35-day shutdown,  and people realize, maybe more significantly, what the government does  every day. It does, in fact, help our country run. The country doesn't  run simply because of the private sector.   When we are dealing with the aftermath of this, we have to be  thinking of making those employees whole but also helping the  contractors and those who work, of course, for the contractors. These  Americans, just like the Federal employees, also deserve to be made  whole once again. It is essential that we show our support for those  workers who keep the government running, whether they are employees or  contractors.   Shutdowns are harmful to the Federal workforce in both the short and  long term. They pose immediate danger of destroying the economic well- being of working families. As we have heard from constituents across  the country and some I just noted today, frequent shutdowns create  uncertainty and dissuade people from entering public service. These are  just two of the adverse outcomes or consequences.   The bottom line is that we not only need to repair some of the damage  and help people by way of legislation or other actions, but we should  also commit ourselves--both parties, both Houses, and it would help  enormously if the President of the United States would also commit  himself--to a very simple goal: no more shutdowns--no more shutdowns by  anyone.   In fact, I know that there are a number of pieces of legislation that  would, if not have that effect, then at least create the greatest  disincentives for a shutdown to occur. It would help all of us if the  President used that microphone that he has every day to make it very  clear that he is committed to no more shutdowns, no more hostage- taking, and no more use of shutdowns for leverage.   If the President will not do it, the Congress has to act and send him  legislation. He has the right to veto legislation, of course, but I  would hope that if he receives bipartisan legislation to make people  whole, to pass Senator Smith's bill, or to pass legislation to prevent  future shutdowns from ever occurring again, he would sign all of those  measures.   For purposes of today, we want to make sure that we highlight and  lift up the legislation by Senator Smith to help contractors.  [[Page S907]]    With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
