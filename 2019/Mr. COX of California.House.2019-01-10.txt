 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  the Federal workers in my district who are suffering because of the  government shutdown.   I rise today for my constituent, Raj Kaur, a single mother of two, a  breast cancer survivor, and a correctional officer at the Mendota  Federal Prison. Raj is currently on leave as she recovers from surgery.  She went on medical leave believing she would be financially secure as  she recuperates.   Now, not only is Raj worrying about her health and recovery, but as a  single mother, she is faced with the burden of trying to figure out how  to provide for her family on grit alone. Unfortunately, Raj doesn't  have a rich father to bail her out.   We say we are a Nation that values work and workers, but today we are  forcing thousands of working men and women to work without pay because  our colleagues in the Senate and the White House won't do their jobs.   Today, in solidarity with Raj and the hundreds of thousands of unpaid  Federal workers nationally, I am asking the Chief Administrative  Officer to withhold my pay until our government reopens.   This situation has gone on for far too long. It is time to get back  to work.                            ____________________
