 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to enthusiastically support  Congresswoman Wagner's born-alive bill, a bill that would protect  children born after a failed abortion from further attempts on their  lives.   This is not a liberal or conservative issue. This is not a Democratic  or Republican issue. This is not a political issue, even. It is a moral  issue, and moral issues have a way of being undeniable.   It is a universal truth that laws protect the living; and while many  of us cannot agree when life begins, I am confident that everyone in  this House would agree that life begins at least at birth. More  importantly, I am confident that the vast majority of the American  people would agree that a child born alive is, in fact, alive.   I understand there may be attempts to prevent a vote on this bill to  protect Members who are against the born-alive bill, but, no, it is  impossible to protect politicians from the moral convictions of the  American people, and history is unkind to those who try.   I urge Members from both parties to see the born-alive bill as an  opportunity to foster bipartisanship in this House.   Supporting this bill does not make you antiabortion or against a  woman's right to choose; it simply ensures that laws already in place  are enforced to protect the most vulnerable among us.                            ____________________
