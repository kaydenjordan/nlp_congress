 Madam Speaker, Biden took office only a  year ago, and under a one-party Democrat rule, America is experiencing  unprecedented adversity.   Today, jobs are being destroyed, and we face crises in energy,  education, crime, national security, the border, and more.   Bidenflation is at the highest in 40 years, resulting in real wage  decreases with job destruction.   Energy independence has been replaced by energy dependence, raising  gas prices by 50 percent.   Remote learning is catastrophic for students and teachers.   Defunding police leads to homicide rates at record highs.   National security is endangered from feeble responses to China, Iran,  Putin, and terrorists.   Two million illegal aliens, including murderous terrorists, have  crossed into America.   Today is a tragic, historical landmark as our children are burdened  by a $30 trillion debt.   America needs new positive leadership.   In conclusion, the Democrat elite think they are smarter than  everyone and believe Democrat voters and Democrat media are ignorant to  accept $5 trillion cost zero dollars.                            ____________________
