 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of  Christopher Roybal. He was a decorated U.S. Navy veteran who had  survived two shootouts while serving in Afghanistan. He attended the  Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1.   Christopher served in the Navy for 7 years before he left on a  medical discharge after he had become mostly deaf in his left ear from  all the explosions that happened near him. After leaving the Navy, he  began working with Crunch Fitness gyms, where he managed new facilities  as they opened around the country.   Christopher went to the Route 91 festival with friends and family to  celebrate his upcoming 29th birthday.   Everyone who knew him remembers him as a man who could always put a  smile on everyone's face. His favorite thing to do was serenading his  friends with Spanish ballads and going out to sing karaoke.   I would like to extend my condolences to Christopher Roybal's family  and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of  Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
