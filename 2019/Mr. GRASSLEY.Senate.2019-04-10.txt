 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak to  the Senate for 1 minute as in morning business.    On Monday, I spoke about the Clinton investigation, and  I want to reiterate one very serious issue. The FBI apparently had  highly classified information potentially relevant to the Clinton  investigation in its possession.   The FBI drafted a memo in May of 2016 to get access to the  information. That memo said review of the information was necessary to  complete the investigation. Sadly, that memo was never sent.   How could the FBI finish the investigation of the Clintons if they  never got access to all of the potentially relevant information?   Congress needs to know what happened in that instance.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today marks the 30th anniversary of a  very important law--the Whistleblower Protection Act. It is very  important because people in government ought to listen to  whistleblowers. They are very patriotic people.   The law is a critical foundation for the whistleblower protections we  have in place today. The Whistleblower Protection Act has helped to  usher in a  [[Page S2356]]  new era at our Federal Agencies. Government employees who are aware of  waste, fraud, and abuse can now step forward and do the right thing,  and they can do it with the law on their side.   As one of the original cosponsors of the Whistleblower Protection  Act, I remember what things were like before that law was passed. I  will give some examples, and these examples aren't pretty.   Back in the 1980s, I used to say that the whistleblower's only hope  was like the desperate Charge of the Light Brigade. There were rarely  any survivors. At the time, the executive branch saw whistleblowers not  as patriots but as threats. Agencies wouldn't even verbally acknowledge  the importance of whistleblowers in making government accountable to  the people. Our whistleblower laws had no teeth, so there was nothing  to stop it from happening and nothing to provide any relief at all to  the patriotic whistleblowers who were then experiencing retaliation.   To give an idea of just how bad things were, let's start in 1984. A  study conducted by the Merit Systems Protection Board found that nearly  70 percent of government employees who knew of fraud and impropriety  wouldn't even report it and wouldn't say what they knew about it. They  believed that no corrections would result if they did, and their No. 1  reason for nonreporting was fear of reprisal.   The sitting special counsel from 1982 to 1986 said that if he were an  attorney advising whistleblowers, he would tell them this: ``Don't put  your head up, because it will get blown off.'' At the time, the Office  of Special Counsel was part of a bigger organization that we refer to  as the Merit Systems Protection Board. Instead of protecting  whistleblowers, it protected the merit system--not individual  employees, and, let me emphasize, certainly not whistleblowers. The  special counsel's office would pursue only those cases it thought it  could win. If a whistleblower came to it with a retaliation case that  was difficult to prove, the whistleblower was simply out of luck.    So the Whistleblower Protection Act, 30 years old, addressed all of  these problems and then some. That law made the Office of Special  Counsel into a separate body, and it firmly established that the Office  of Special Counsel was there solely to protect employees, especially  whistleblowers.   In doing so, it gave whistleblowers a new and important ally. The law  also established that the Office of Special Counsel should act, not  just when it had an open and shut case but whenever it was likely that  a prohibited personnel practice had occurred against a whistleblower.  It made the Office of Special Counsel a chief defender of employees  subject to prohibited personnel practices. The law addressed other  problems as well.   I remember back in the 1980s, the Office of Special Counsel had  developed a disturbing practice of providing information on  whistleblowers to Federal Agencies conducting personnel inquiries; as  an example, people like Elaine Mittleman. Elaine worked at the Treasury  Department. She went to the Office of Special Counsel alleging reprisal  against her whistleblowing. When her case was rejected, she learned  that the Office of Special Counsel had leaked negative information  about her to the Office of Personnel Management to do her damage. The  old Office of Special Counsel effectively ensured that Elaine was  blacklisted from any other Federal employment.   Thankfully, the Whistleblower Protection Act stopped that practice  and stopped it cold. The act prohibited the Office of Special Counsel  from responding to Agency personnel inquiries about Federal employees  except in the most limited of circumstances. It also expanded the  definition of a protected disclosure and made it easier for employees  to show reprisal. Of course, the 1989 law wasn't perfect, and in the  time since it was passed, Congress expanded it and strengthened the  Whistleblower Protection Act in very important ways.   In 2012, I was proud to serve as one of the original cosponsors of  the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act. That legislation plugged  several holes in the original law and made it clear that the executive  branch can't use nondisclosure agreements to prevent whistleblowers  from making protected disclosures. If Federal employees are required to  sign a nondisclosure agreement, specific language has to be included in  that agreement making it clear that whistleblowers can still report  waste, fraud, and abuse. Wouldn't the taxpayers expect a Federal  employee who knows about waste, fraud, and abuse to report that as a  responsibility to their office and then not to be reprised against  because they did?   It is safe to say that, taken together, the Whistleblower Protection  Act and the 2012 amendments have had a transformative effect on our  Federal Agencies. Things are still hard for our whistleblowers in too  many instances, and we still have a long way to go, but we have come a  very long way since I first started working on these issues. By the  numbers, more whistleblowers now report waste, fraud, and abuse, and  they have the ability to fight retaliation. I hate to say this, but too  often whistleblowers are retaliated against, even with respect or even  in consideration of the Whistleblower Protection Act.   In fiscal year 2017, to show progress and to show that the bill has  made a difference, the Office of Special Counsel obtained 323 favorable  actions, including stays, corrective actions, disciplinary actions, and  systemic changes to Agency practices. That is an Agency record and a  16-percent increase over the previous year. Of those, 241 involved  instances of whistleblower retaliation, and 44 involved stays with  Agencies to protect employees from premature or improper personnel  actions against them.   One of those retaliation cases involved a Federal worker who reported  an Agency official to her management and to the Office of Inspector  General for suspected theft. In exchange for disclosure, the official  who was reported demoted the worker to the lowest possible position she  could.   That is just one example to show you how patriotic people in the  Federal employment who are whistleblowers--who just want government to  do what the law requires or spend the money accordingly--get shafted as  a result of just doing what you ought to do as a Federal employee:  report waste, fraud, and abuse and stealing.   This person had some help because, as I said, she was demoted to the  lowest possible position that she could; that is, until the worker  filed a complaint and the Office of Special Counsel investigated.  Following the investigation of the Office of Special Counsel, the  complainant was not only reinstated but given backpay and compensatory  damages. Faced with punitive actions, including temporary suspension  and a reassignment, the Agency official who had engaged in the  retaliation decided to resign. That is just one example of how the  Whistleblower Protection Act has made a difference. I could, of course,  list many others.    The Whistleblower Protection Act and its amendments have also had an  important effect on congressional oversight. Whistleblowers are the  eyes and ears inside the executive branch. In fact, when people come to  my office explaining why they ought to be confirmed by the Senate,  there are a couple of things I always tell them: No. 1, either you run  your Department or it runs you; No. 2, you ought to listen to the  whistleblower. Whether you are a little Agency with a couple of  thousand employees or whether you are the Veterans' Administration with  350,000-some employees, you can't know what is going on down underneath  you. When people tell you something is wrong, you ought to listen. Like  I said, I have found it very helpful with congressional oversight.   My own oversight efforts would not be possible without the courageous  action taken by whistleblowers. For example, whistleblowers contacted  my office during the Obama administration about criminals who should be  ineligible for DACA but, due to an oversight by the Department, were  still receiving benefits like work authorization. Scrutiny of the  program led to more thorough recurrent vetting of the U.S. Citizenship  and Immigration Services.   I worked with a number of whistleblowers at the Department of  Veterans Affairs who had the courage--and it takes courage--to stand up  and do what is right.   More recently, my office worked with Brandon Coleman after he was put  on administrative leave for more than a  [[Page S2357]]  year and kept from running an addiction treatment program for veterans.  It happens that Brandon's only ``mistake'' was to point out poor  treatment of suicidal veterans. Eventually, after a concerted effort by  my office, Senator Johnson's office, and the Office of Special Counsel,  Brandon was provided a new position within the VA's Office of  Accountability and Whistleblower Protection. That is how it should be  done.   Without the protections established by the Whistleblower Protection  Act, Brandon's story might have turned out very differently. Without  these protections, who knows how many other instances of waste, fraud,  and abuse that we have been able to find and repair thanks to  whistleblowers would be continuing now unabated?   Now, make no mistake, we still have a ways to go to ensure that  whistleblowers are valued as they should be valued and supported as  they should be supported. I still hear from far too many whistleblowers  who have done the right thing only to experience retaliation from their  Agencies as a result.   We in Congress, including this Senator, shouldn't be hearing those  things at all. That is why continued oversight by Congress is so very  important. Whistleblowers depend on us--you and me. All of our  colleagues in this body ought to be listening to them. We ought to be  supporting them and honoring them by following up on their concerns and  taking action to fix serious problems when they bring them to our  attention.   I thank the whistleblowers who worked with my office over the years.  They are truly patriots willing to put their job on the line, willing  to put their profession on the line. We have come a long way since the  Whistleblower Protection Act first passed in 1989. We owe it to them to  build on the progress we made and to continue to improve upon our  whistleblower laws for years to come.   You can rest assured that I will be part of those ongoing efforts on  this important anniversary of the Whistleblower Protection Act. I  encourage my colleagues to reflect on the important role whistleblowers  play in our government and to renew their commitment to the same.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
