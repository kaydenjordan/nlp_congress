 Madam Speaker, this is a Republican bill that we are  trying to fix to keep the government open and not holding our Federal  employees hostage.   I support this bill with qualifications that I know that in the 2020  fiscal year,  [[Page H2011]]  Democrats will put forward a humane bill that addresses many of these  issues. We gave $1.37 billion for barriers, not the wall.   We are protecting the environment in my own State: the Bentsen-Rio  Grande Valley State Park, the National Butterfly Center, the Santa Ana  National Wildlife Refuge, places where I have gone and people are  pleading: Don't put fences there.   We brought down the number of ICE detention beds from 49,000-50,000  to 40,000, and, of course, we have provided, as I have indicated, and  fought for facilities that deal with those children and women that are  coming across: $415 million for enhanced medical support;  transportation; food; clothing for migrants in detention, particularly  children; and $30.5 million for family case management.   As my good friend said, we brought up the alternative detention from  82,000 to 100,000. As my good friend said, there is $400 million for  VAWA. We are funding these programs because we understand how important  they are.   Finally, of course, in the justice area, we have given money for  Byrne grants; Community Oriented Policing Services, sexual assault kits  and DNA, Second Chance Act programs, and we funded NASA.   But more importantly, Madam Speaker, I think we have made a very  important point that should be made, and that is, as we work toward  fiscal year 2020 appropriations, it is critical that we ensure that  robust accountability of DHS, including limiting the agency's transfer  authority and dramatically reducing the number of people who are held  in detention, utilizing proven alternatives to detention, including  community-based alternatives and parole for the vast majority of people  who are held in detention who pose no public safety threat or risk.   ICE--we have to realize, there must be due process and justice. It is  unfortunate that this administration's treatment of immigrants is  unconscionable and inhumane. We can do better and we will do better.   But the final point of all of this today is, we stand on the floor to  not hold our Federal employees hostage and to open the government. I  will be going forward with the qualifications of working on a better  bill.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 31, which makes  the consolidated appropriations needed to fund the departments,  agencies, and programs of the federal government through September 30,  2019, and hopefully brings to a merciful end the uncertainty and  hardship cruelly inflicted upon federal employees, contractors, and the  American people by the President's decision to shut down the  government.   I thank Chairman Lowey, Ranking Member Granger, and their fellow  House conferees for their work in reaching this bipartisan agreement.   Left to our own devices, House Democrats clearly could and would have  made many different and better funding decisions but this agreement is  the best deal attainable in the circumstances, and importantly, it  responsibly funds the government for the remainder, while securing our  border.   Madam Speaker, coming from a border state, I am very pleased that  this legislation does not provide the President the billions of dollars  he demanded for a wasteful, ineffective, and immoral concrete wall.   In fact, it rejects the President's demand for $5.7 billion for his  wall and provides instead $1.375 billion for physical barriers with  language specifying that new fencing is limited to currently deployed  designs--ruling out the President's border wall proposal.   My constituents and other Texans will be gratified to learn that this  legislation specifically prohibits construction on sensitive  environmental areas such as the Bentsen-Rio State Park, the National  Butterfly Center, the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge, La Lomita Historical  Park, and the Lower Rio Grande Wildlife Refuge between Brownsville, TX,  and the Gulf of Mexico.   I also strongly approve that the legislation provides a path to a  reduction in ICE detention beds from 49,057 today to 40,520 at the end  of the fiscal year, bringing the number of detention beds back to the  level of average daily population funded in the FY18 omnibus bill.   This reduction in ICE detention beds, combined with Democratic  control of the Appropriations Committee and new biannual inspections of  detention facilities, will provide a check on the Trump  Administration's out-of-control deportation policy that targets law- abiding families instead of focusing on deporting violent criminals;   The agreement before also provides funding a more humane immigration  system with $415 million for enhanced medical support, transportation,  food and clothing for migrants in detention, particularly children and  families; $30.5 million for family case management; an expansion in  Alternatives to Detention participants from 82,000 to 100,000; and a  prohibition on ICE using information collected by HHS from sponsors of  migrant children for removal and deportation purposes.   I also strongly support the new investments in national security  provided in the legislation, including a new Coast Guard Polar Security  Cutter, the first icebreaker in over 40 years; and an $884 million  increase for the Transportation Security Administration.   In addition to the bipartisan compromise on Homeland Security, the  legislation before us includes six other appropriations bills that  reject the President's deep budget cuts and instead make bold  investments in to fund the programs Americans depend on and need to  move our nation forward.   For example, the agreement funds a 1.9 percent pay raise to federal  workers that overrides the President's decision to deny these  hardworking and dedicated public servants a pay raise.   The agreement provides $3.8 billion for the 2020 Census, an increase  of $1 billion, to ensure a fair and accurate count.   The agreement provides more than $3 billion for state and local law  enforcement to keep communities safe, including by addressing the  opioid crisis, closing sexual assault kit backlogs and hiring more  police officers.   Madam Speaker, all Members should celebrate the fact that the  agreement provides more than $17 billion in funding for new  infrastructure investments to improve our roads, bridges, highways,  railways and mass transit.   Another reason why I strongly support the legislation before us is  because it restores and increases investments in job-creating  initiatives for economic and business development, including for  minority and women-owned businesses, that the Trump Administration  tried to eliminate or reduce drastically.   Madam Speaker, the bipartisan agreement before us rejects the Trump  Administration's attacks on the environment by blocking the  Administration's deep cuts to initiatives to protect clean water, clean  air and public lands and it invests more than $9 billion in the EPA and  Land and Water Conservation Fund.   The agreement reinforces and strengthens America's global leadership  by rejecting the Trump Administration's radical cuts and securing $9.1  billion in security assistance for allies, including $3.03 billion for  Israel, $5.7 billion for PEPFAR and $1.7 billion for the Food for Peace  program.   Madam Speaker, I would like to draw particular attention to  provisions in the consolidated appropriations conference report that  are of special interest to my congressional district.   Customs and Border Protection: $1.375 billion, $4.325 billion less  than the $5.7 billion the Trump administration requested, for  approximately 55 miles of physical barrier along the southern border in  the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.   $564 million for the installation of non-intrusive imaging equipment  in the in-bound lanes of southwest border land ports of entry-- significantly increasing the percentage of cars and commercial cargo  scanned for narcotics and other contraband.   $415 million for humanitarian relief specifically for medical care,  transportation, food and cloth; for humanitarian improvements to the  McAllen Central Processing Center; and for a new El Paso CBP processing  facility.   $100 million for new border security technology.   $77 million for opioid equipment and staffing for use at  international mail and express consignment facilities.   $59 million for 600 new CBP Officers and encourages CBP to use fee  funding to hire up to 600 additional CBP officers for a total of 1,200  new officers.   Does not fund the Administration's request for joint detention  facilities.   U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)--Provides an  appropriated level for detention beds that establishes Congress's  intent to reduce the daily population in ICE detention to approximately  40,520 by the end of the fiscal year, down from a current count of  approximately 49,060.   Expands the Alternatives to Detention program from 82,000 to 100,000.   Provides $30.5 million for ATD family case management, which improves  compliance with immigration court obligations by helping families'  access community-based support for basic housing, healthcare, legal,  and educational needs.   Provides $40 million for additional ICE staffing dedicated to overall  ATD case management, particularly for asylum seekers.   Funds additional detention facility inspectors in the Office of  Professional Oversight to bring the number of inspections up from once  every three years to twice per year.  [[Page H2012]]    Provides funding to bring the number of detention facilities in  compliance with PREA requirements from 86 percent to 97 percent.   Provides $7.4 million for additional attorneys and for courtroom  expansion to assist in the backlog of immigration cases currently in  the system.   $1.9 billion for Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which  focuses on a wide variety of investigations with a cross-border nexus,  including those related to human trafficking, financial crimes and  cyber investigations.   $7.5 million for new HSI Victim Assistant Specialists and $44 million  for new staffing to enhance opioid/fentanyl-related investigations and  analyses.

Includes additional funding for computed tomography imaging systems  and $40 million for airport explosive detection system reimbursement.   Fully funds the TSA Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response teams,  staffing at exit lanes, as required by law, and the Law Enforcement  Officer reimbursement program.   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)--$16.6 billion in net  discretionary funding, an increase of $5.5 billion above the request  and $4.2 billion above the FY 2018 enacted level.   $12 billion for disaster relief to help States, communities and  citizens respond to and recover from disasters, as well as cost  effective mitigation to reduce the risk from future disasters.   $3.1 billion for grants to help States, communities, citizens, and  nonprofit organizations, with every grant being at or above the FY 2018  level, including $277 million for training, exercises, and education  for our Nation's first responders and emergency managers.   An additional $111 million above the request for the Cybersecurity  and Infrastructure Security Agency to address high priority  cybersecurity and infrastructure protection vulnerabilities.   $10 million in direct funding for Citizenship and Integration grants,  instead of relying on fee revenue to support the program.   $820 million to support cutting edge science and technology programs.   The bill includes the following provisions related to phisical  barriers: continues language allowing only fencing designs in use as of  2017 and prohibits construction on sensitive environmental areas such  as the Bentsen-Rio State Park, the National Butterfly Center, the Santa  Ana Wildlife Refuge, La Lomita Historical Park, and the Lower Rio  Grande Wildlife Refuge between Brownsville, TX and the Gulf of Mexico.   The bill improves transparency by requiring ICE to make public  information about the numbers and types of people in its custody, such  as families; border apprehension detainees; interior enforcement  detainees; and those who are in custody who have a positive credible  fear claim.   Prohibits DHS from preventing a Member of Congress from entering any  facility that is used to detain or otherwise house children and directs  DHS to make no changes to the current operations and facility  conditions in anticipation of a congressional oversight visit.   Prevents DHS from destroying any record related to potential sexual  assault or abuse of any individual in DHS's custody.   Prohibits ICE from using information provided by the Office of  Refugee Resettlement about sponsors or potential sponsors of  unaccompanied children to arrest, detain, or remove those individuals,  unless that information reveals the individual has a dangerous criminal  background.   Prevents DHS from placing pregnant women in restraints who are in the  custody of DHS, except in extraordinary circumstances.

This border security and funding bill that Democrats fixed did some  good things. In particular, it raised the number to 100,000 alternative  detention sites for women and children; it provided healthcare where  there was no healthcare so that little children would not die at the  border; and it prevented ICE from using data to deport people who are  trying to pick up their children.   The good news is our Federal employees will not be held as hostages,  and we have given them a 1.9 percent raise. As well, we provided for  Food for Peace, for people who are struggling around the world, $1.7  billion.   As a member of the Judiciary Committee, we provided $423 million for  the Byrne Grant; $178 million to address sexual assault kits and other  DNA; $100 million for STOP School Violence; $497 million, Madam  Speaker, for the Violence Against Women Act; and $75 million for gun  control, or at least the checks for background.   Madam Speaker, this is a humanitarian bill, and I ask my colleagues  to recognize it.                            ____________________
