 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of an incredible and selfless woman, Melinda Powell, affectionately  referred to as ``Sweet Melinda.''   A nurse and nurse practitioner by trade, Melinda led by example,  setting an unparalleled standard of love and service, enriching the  lives of her friends, family, and community members.   Melinda resided in Savannah, Georgia, where she remained an active  member of the Savannah community for many years. She was a caring woman  who looked after her patients like they were her own family.   She left a lasting impression on everyone that she encountered and  was deeply loved by all who had the pleasure of knowing her. Her  service and love for our community will forever be remembered and her  memory will always be cherished.   My thoughts and prayers reside with Melinda's family and friends  through this most tremendous loss, and I wish her Godspeed on her  journey home.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I  may hereafter be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 5996, a  bill originally introduced by Representative Fortenberry of Nebraska,  for the purpose of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings  pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII.
