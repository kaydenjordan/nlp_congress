 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend,  Representative Ray Rogers of Pearl, Mississippi.   On November 17, 2018, Ray completed his 55th and final season of  service as the Pearl High School Voice of the Pirates. For 55 years,  Ray volunteered his time and energy as the public address announcer for  the Pearl Pirate football games and was so committed that, in 55 years,  he missed just one-half of one game in 55 seasons.   Now, the reason Ray missed the first half of that game was so that he  could attend his daughter's wedding rehearsal dinner. After listening  to the game on the radio during much of the dinner, Ray left as soon as  the dinner was ended so he could announce the second half of the game.   Ray's commitment to the Pearl community was recognized several years  ago when leaders of the Pearl Public School District decided to name  the football stadium Ray Rogers Stadium.   Ray was one of the first students to attend Pearl High School when it  opened in 1948 and was the first quarterback for the first football  team in 1949.   Ray has been a public servant and leader for Pearl and Rankin County  in many other ways. In 1983, he was elected to serve District 61 in the  Mississippi House of Representatives and has been reelected every 4  years since, most recently in 2015.   Ray has spent 35 years in the State legislature working to improve  our schools and infrastructure. As chairman of the Military Affairs  Committee, he has been a tireless supporter of our National Guard and  veterans and was instrumental in the effort to build three veterans  homes in Mississippi with the help of then-Congressman Sonny  Montgomery, who served the Third District of Mississippi.   Ray has been a long-time member of the Management and PEER  Committees--a testament to the respect and trust that his fellow  legislators have for him. He has served as a mentor and role model for  many incoming representatives over the years, and Ray's example has  been invaluable to me. He has taught me by the way he lives, by what he  does, and by how he treats everyone with respect.   Ray Rogers has lived a life of service to others, and I know that he  believes his most important service has been to God and his family. An  active member of McLaurin Heights United Methodist Church in Pearl,  Mississippi, Ray is the father of three daughters, four grandchildren,  and two great-grandchildren. While he is proud to be known as the  representative and the Voice of the Pearl Pirates, he is proudest to be  known as Daddy and Pop.   Ray's wife, Shirley, has shared his passion for serving others.  Shirley served for two decades as the first city clerk for the city of  Pearl and after that was a director of personnel for the Mississippi  Department of Corrections. Like Ray, Shirley is an active member of  their church, and she is a loving and supportive wife, mother, and  grandmother.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate having the opportunity today to honor Ray  Rogers--my State representative, the Voice of the Pirates, proud father  and grandfather--and to congratulate him on his impressive record of  public service.   Thank you, Ray, for your friendship and for setting an incredible  example for all to follow.                            ____________________
