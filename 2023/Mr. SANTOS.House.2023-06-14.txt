 Madam Speaker, I rise to call attention to the concerning  rise of anti-Semitism that is proliferating nationwide.   Last weekend, in Plainview, New York, my constituents were subjected  to the intimidation of the Goyim Defense League, aka the GDL, a growing  hate organization that propagates anti-Semitic rhetoric.   It pains me to report that the henchmen of the GDL descended on my  district and distributed flyers that featured anti-Jewish propaganda  images of the Star of David drawn onto the heads of Federal lawmakers.   As the Congressman for Plainview, I am speechless and appalled. For  me, this is a sobering reminder that even in 2023, anti-Semitic  incidents like this happen every day across the country.   It is critical that this body continues to support and stand with the  Jewish community and Israel. I hope my colleagues join me in the fight  against anti-Semitism and send a clear message that anti-Semitism will  not be tolerated in the United States of America.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  proceedings during the former Members program be printed in the  Congressional Record and that all Members and former Members who spoke  during the proceedings have the privilege of revising and extending  their remarks.
