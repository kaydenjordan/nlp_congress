 Madam Speaker, this morning, Members of Congress,  Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate, had the high privilege and  distinct honor of hearing directly from the President of Ukraine,  Volodymyr Zelenskyy.   In the face of Russia's cruel and unprovoked invasion, the  President's fearless, heroic leadership has rallied his Nation and  inspired the entire world.   Our Members were very moved by his powerful remarks today, as well as  the heart-wrenching footage he shared showing Putin's inhumane terror,  brutally committing war crimes against children.   As President Zelenskyy said: ``Right now, the destiny of our country  is being decided . . . Russia has attacked not just us, not just our  land, not just our cities. It went on a brutal offensive against our  values--basic human values.''   Indeed, all are in awe of the extraordinary courage and determination  of the Ukrainian people as they defend democracy, not only at home but  democracy around the world.   It is with great respect for the Ukrainian people, and in recognition  of the grave threat that Russian aggression poses to the free world,  that Congress secured $13.6 billion in humanitarian, security, and  economic assistance for Ukraine in the government funding law that  President Biden signed yesterday.   But more needs to be done for the refugees and for the protection of  the people. I hope that all of this can be done in a bipartisan way.   So I join my colleague in saluting the people of Ukraine. Slava  Ukraini. That means ``Glory to Ukraine.'' Glory to the heroes of  Ukraine.   Madam Speaker, and in coordination with the Administration and our  Allies, we have taken strong, bipartisan action to cripple and isolate  the Russian economy:   Strangling its banks and taking on the oligarchs funding this war;   Banning the import of oil and energy products into the United States,  cutting off the lifeblood of the Russian economy;   Taking first steps to remove Russia from the WTO; and   Reauthorizing Global Magnitsky so we can impose further sanctions.   This week, the House will take our latest, most intense action yet:  revoking the privilege of permanent normal trade relations from Russia.   It is my hope that, when it comes to the floor, this legislation  receives overwhelming bipartisan support, worthy of the valor and  heroism of the Ukrainian people.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that proceedings  during the address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, held in  the Capitol Visitor Center Congressional Auditorium on March 16, 2022,  be printed in the Record.
