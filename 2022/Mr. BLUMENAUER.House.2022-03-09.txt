 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the underlying  bill, but I want to acknowledge the comments from my colleagues about  the bipartisan approach that we originally advanced. It is, I think,  unfortunate that we are not stripping away the most-favored trade  status from the Russians. I am convinced that we will be able to get  there with the expression that we have had on both sides of the aisle.  I think it is important that we can remain committed to advancing this  in terms of tightening the economic noose around Russia.   Mr. Speaker, I am a little disappointed with the rhetoric that we  have heard attacking the administration for not coming forth with  fanciful efforts to increase domestic production. As has been  documented on the floor repeatedly in the course of this debate, there  are ample leases that are unused now, some 9,000 such leases.   Everything that my friends on the other side of the aisle are talking  about is not going to produce one additional gallon of oil next year or  two years afterwards. These are longer-term issues that relate to the  mechanics of production, the economics of the industry.  [[Page H1398]]    Where our salvation is going to rise is taking advantage of the  elements that the Democrats have advanced in terms of clean energy  production. This is reliable, sustainable, and not subject to the whims  of international global petrochemical arguments and disputes.   In the meantime, I strongly urge support of the legislation and renew  my commitment to work on a bipartisan basis to be able to strip away  the most-favored nation status, working together to accomplish this in  as expeditious a fashion as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the cooperation of the chairman of the  committee being able to move and take advantage of the expressions of  my friends on the other side of the aisle.
