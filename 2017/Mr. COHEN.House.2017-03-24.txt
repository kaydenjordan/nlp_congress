 Mr. Speaker, this is not a healthcare bill. This is a  wealth care bill.   Unfortunately, President Trump, when he spoke in Louisville, said we  had to pass this bill to get the big tax cuts. It is about wealth care.  It is the Ebenezer Scrooge law of this Congress.   The insurance you will get with the amendments made will be as  worthless as the degree from Trump University. We do not need wealth  care, but we need health care.
