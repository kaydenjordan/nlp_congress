 Madam Speaker, this bill presents a very simple  question: Should we all but strip the President of his authority to  restrict travel from countries that pose a danger to the United States?   Ronald Reagan and George Bush used this authority to protect our  country. So, too, did Barack Obama and even Joe Biden as recently as  January 25.   President Trump invoked this authority against countries that were  hotbeds of international terrorism and that were not cooperating with  the United States in providing basic information about travelers coming  from these countries. Now, the left calls it a Muslim ban. What  nonsense. The President's orders affected only a tiny fraction of  Muslim-majority countries and a sizable number of non-Muslim countries.  The Supreme Court cited this obvious truth when it fully upheld the  President's actions. In fact, when a rogue government changed its  policy and cooperated with us, the restrictions were lifted.   Without this authority, the President would have been powerless to  take simple, prudent precautions against terrorists and criminals from  entering the United States.   The President's ability to protect against threats, negotiate  security protocols, and, when necessary, retaliate against  discriminatory actions by other countries depends on his having this  power at his immediate disposal.   This bill, instead, forbids the President from taking action until he  can show that it is the weakest possible measure at his disposal. It  requires him to get his own Secretary of State's permission, which is a  constitutional absurdity, and it gives anyone who claims any harm the  standing to block an order in Federal district court.   So, I ask, in this world that is becoming increasingly threatening  and unstable, does this bill make us more safe or less safe? The answer  should be self-evident to anyone who is not completely besotted with  the woke insanity of the radical left.    Madam Speaker, we are way beyond any question of  whether we face a border crisis. The question now is whether we have a  border at all.   When I put that very question directly to the president of the Border  Patrol, his answer was an emphatic: No, we do not.   By abandoning the border wall, rescinding the remain in Mexico  policy, and obstructing enforcement of court-ordered deportations,  President Biden has produced a mass illegal migration of historic  proportions, preying most tragically on young children and making the  Mexican crime cartels billions of dollars.   The only border security measure he hasn't pulled down is the ability  of the CBP to stop illicit activity at our official ports of entry,  where large volumes of narcotics and other contraband must pass.   Judiciary Republicans recently visited our facility at Hidalgo  crossing, where thousands of cars and trucks passing through the port  of entry must be inspected daily to protect our country from high- volume cartel smuggling. Our officers are experts at spotting  suspicious traffic hidden among the high volume of legal crossings  without unduly delaying honest commerce and passage.   Now, to do this, they wave the suspicious traffic to secondary  inspections, where they can locate and stop contraband that is often  ingeniously hidden.                                time  1400    Now, this has been a tremendous inconvenience to the cartels. We saw  millions of dollars of methamphetamines and other deadly drugs, as well  as infected fruits and vegetables heading to American markets, recently  seized at these secondary inspections.   But H.R. 1573 would grind legitimate trade and travel to a halt by  providing that anyone referred to secondary inspection can, within an  hour, consult with an attorney and call other third parties. Now, there  are more than 17 million secondary inspections conducted each year at  our 328 ports of entry.   Can you imagine the effect of this bill?   It is not limited to attorneys. A smuggler pulled into secondary  inspection could warn confederates behind him that their hiding places  have been discovered, turn back.   The officers told me they are already overwhelmed, using antiquated  facilities, and suffering manpower shortages. This bill gives the CBP  the Hobson's choice of curtailing inspections or routinely backing up  traffic for hours on end.   The inspection itself is not a criminal process. It is a screening  process to assure that only legal products enter our country. Only when  it becomes a criminal matter is there a right to counsel.   Now, if this isn't actually written by the crime cartels, it is  certainly entirely in their interest and service. It speaks volumes  about the attitude of the Democrats on the security of our border, the  safety of our citizens, and the sovereignty of our Nation.
