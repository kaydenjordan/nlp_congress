 Mr. President, later today, the House will vote to  pass a funding agreement that advances a number of America's  priorities, achieving important things that would not have been  possible under the previous administration.   Let's take the border. President Trump and the Republican Congress  made securing the border a priority, and this funding bill acts on it.  After years of an administration that failed to get serious on border  security, this bill provides the largest border security funding  increase in a decade.   Passing this bill means updating physical border infrastructure. It  means enhancements in surveillance technology. It means increasing  support for border personnel. It means finally providing resources to  end the practice of catch and release.   On securing our border, this bill obviously makes a departure from  the Obama years, and it is an important step forward.   Let's take defense. President Trump and the Republican Congress made  rebuilding our military a priority, and this funding bill acts on it.  After years of an administration that drew down our conventional force  structure and failed to address increasing threats across the globe,  this bill provides a critically needed downpayment on rebuilding our  military. Passing this bill means allowing our force to retain higher  levels of end strength. It means funding the largest military pay raise  in 6 years. It means replacing munitions used in the fight against  ISIL. It means finally ignoring the Obama-era demand of requiring  defense funding increases to be equally matched to nondefense  increases.   On rebuilding our military, this bill obviously makes a departure  from the Obama years and is another important step forward. These are  notable wins, and they wouldn't have happened without this  administration's tireless work in conjunction with the Republican  Congress.   Of course, there is further to go in both areas. We know more work  remains when it comes to strengthening our border infrastructure and  stemming the tide of illegal immigration. We know more work remains  when it comes to restoring our military's combat readiness and meeting  the full needs of the force.   But this legislation represents a step in the right direction in both  of these areas, and it advances conservative priorities in many others.  It adheres to the spending caps, it reforms bureaucracy, and it  consolidates, eliminates, or rescinds funds for more than 150  government programs and initiatives.   It supports the implementation of the Every Student Succeeds Act,  which shifts control of education out of Washington, and it extends an  important school choice program. It helps tackle terrorism, fight  crime, support veterans, protect life, reform the IRS, and freeze  funding for it.   It cuts funding for the EPA, prohibits funding for President Obama's  climate slush fund, and advances an all-of-the-above energy policy that  prioritizes research on technical advancements in nuclear, natural gas,  and coal power generation.   This research funding, along with the bill's support for troubled  coal mining communities and dislocated miners, is important for States  like mine, as is the provision I was proud to secure that will  permanently protect healthcare benefits for thousands of retired coal  miners and their families.   This bill also extends resources for a pilot program I worked with  Congressman Hal Rogers to secure, which will fund the reclamation and  development of abandoned mine sites.   Moreover, this bill also provides significant new resources to tackle  the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic that continues to ravage  communities in Kentucky and across our country.  [[Page S2688]]    The many achievements in this bill resulted from countless hours of  committee work and bicameral negotiations. I want to recognize again  the appropriators, our Members, and this Republican administration for  the tireless effort that made this bill possible.   The President and his team should be commended for their efforts in  working with the Republican Congress to address many important needs  for our country in this bill. I look forward to the House passing the  bill today so that we can take it up and send it to President Trump for  his signature soon.                            ____________________     Now on to the legislation we will turn to today.   In recent months, the Republican Congress has voted to provide much  needed relief to the American people from Obama administration  regulations pushed out the door at the eleventh hour. We have voted to  eliminate 13 harmful regulations already, using the tools contained in  the Congressional Review Act, and we will vote to eliminate another  later today.   Too often, the Obama administration pursued regulations that grew  government at the expense of jobs, wages, and economic growth. Too  often, under the guise of helping ordinary Americans, the  administration was really just helping to expand the reach of  government.   That is certainly the case with the regulation we are considering  today. President Obama's Department of Labor issued regulations that  would impose new burdens on employers and employees when it comes to  saving for their retirement. These regulations would give State  officials the power to force employers to enroll their employees into  government-run savings plans.   Though the State-run plans might not seem too bad on the surface,  what they really add up to is more government at the expense of the  private sector and American workers.   They would provide government-run retirement plans with a competitive  advantage over private sector workplace plans, while providing fewer  basic consumer protections to the workers who would be forced to  contribute to them.   As I mentioned when we voted on related regulations concerning  municipalities, States always had the power to set up these plans, but  until this regulation, they had to actually follow Federal laws that  protect the workers who would be automatically enrolled. In other  words, States preferred that the basic retirement protections that  apply to those who manage private sector retirement plans not apply to  the government as well.   As a coalition of employers and human resource managers recently  pointed out, the Obama administration was ``encouraging State  governments to provide private sector employees retirement programs  that do not''--I repeat, do not--``have the same high-level protections  as other private employer-sponsored plans.'' So, as they put it,  ``passage of [the legislation before the Senate] would ensure that all  retirement plans''--all of them--``for private sector workers are  subject to equal consumer protections under the law.''   That is why we will vote today to overturn this regulation, which  undermines a private retirement savings system that millions of  Americans have counted on for decades. By blocking this State-run  retirement regulation--as we already did with a similar regulation  aimed at municipalities--we can empower families in making their own  decisions when it comes to saving for the future.   So I want to recognize Senator Hatch, the Finance Committee chairman,  who has been leading the charge on this important issue. We look  forward to sending this resolution to the President's desk very soon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 66.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the body  the message to accompany H.R. 244.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the House agree to the amendments numbered 2       and 3 of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 244) entitled ``An Act       to encourage effective, voluntary investments to recruit,       employ, and retain men and women who have served in the       United States military with annual Federal awards to       employers recognizing such efforts, and for other purposes.''       and be it further        Resolved, That the House agree to the amendment numbered 1       of the Senate to the aforementioned bill, with an amendment.                               Motion to Concur     I move to concur in the House amendment to the Senate  amendment to H.R. 244.                                Cloture Motion    I send a cloture motion to the desk on the motion to concur.    Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  to the Senate amendment to H.R. 244, with a further amendment.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to concur  with amendment.    I have a second-degree amendment at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I move to refer the House message on  H.R. 244 to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  with instructions to report back forthwith with an amendment numbered  212.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my motion.    I have an amendment to the instructions.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.    I have a second-degree amendment at the desk.    Mr. President, for the information of all Senators,  the Omnibus appropriations bill is now pending. I filed cloture to  ensure that the Senate can pass it and send it to the President for his  signature before the end of the week. It is my hope that we can enter  into an agreement to vote on the omnibus tomorrow rather than running  out the clock into the weekend.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the  retirement of my friend, Dr. Gary A. Ransdell, who, since September 12,  1997, has served as the ninth president of Western Kentucky University.   During his nearly two decades leading WKU, Gary has overseen a  complete transformation of the school. An alumnus of the school  himself, graduating in 1973 with a bachelor of arts degree in mass  communications and again in 1974 with a master of public service degree  in public administration, Gary said that ``[s]erving my alma mater has  been a dream come true.''   Under Gary's leadership, the school has grown into a prominent  university with an international presence. Since 1997, enrollment has  increased from 14,500 to 21,000, with strong improvements in graduation  numbers, the number of applicants, and student retention. WKU has  attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in private donations,  completing two major capital campaigns under Gary's guidance. Those  funds have revitalized the campus and created state of the art  buildings and classrooms.   Students at WKU have a world of education within their reach. New  undergraduate degree programs focusing on mechanical, electrical, and  civil engineering and doctoral degree programs in education, nursing,  physical therapy, and psychology promote research and prepare students  for their careers. The university is also committed to transferring its  technology into the Kentucky workplace to help develop the State's  economy. WKU's regional campuses throughout Western Kentucky make  education accessible to many Kentuckians for the first time. The  creation of the Gatton Academy of Math and Science, which reached a  milestone in 2014 when the school was ranked as the No. 1 high school  in America for its 3rd year in a row by Newsweek, has helped Kentucky  students blossom into scholars and future leaders.   During Gary's time at WKU, the school successfully transitioned into  Conference USA and, in the 2014-2015 school year, set a record with  eight conference championships. The WKU  [[Page S2717]]  football program is nationally recognized and won two consecutive bowl  games. The Hilltoppers--named because of the school's scenic location  atop ``the Hill''--are strong student-athletes both on the field and in  the classroom, leading Conference USA in academic performance.   Gary is especially engaged in WKU's international outreach. He and  his wife, Julie, herself a WKU alumna, have led students into new  learning experience around the world in England, France, Italy, China,  Ecuador, Iceland, Scandinavia, and Africa. The school is also home to  Kentucky's first Confucius Institute and only Chinese language flagship  program and has been recognized as a top producer of Fulbright  scholars.   Gary has been at the center of each of these significant  accomplishments. The growth in campus infrastructure, academic  prestige, and community and alumni engagement at WKU have benefited  Kentucky students and are in large part due to Gary's work. With his  nearly 20 years of service, he is currently the longest serving  university president in Kentucky.   I have enjoyed every opportunity to work with Gary over the years and  support his vision for higher education in Kentucky. We have partnered  together to secure Federal funding for worthwhile projects like WKU's  mobile health unit and the agricultural research service Federal  research lab. He is a dedicated public servant committed to student  success. In addition to all of the work that Gary and I have  collaborated on, I am proud to call him a friend. Along with the WKU  community, I am sad to see Gary leave his alma mater at the end of this  school year, but I am deeply grateful for his passion and leadership.   After a brief sabbatical, Gary will continue working to connect  students with an international education. Starting next year, Gary and  Julie begin their next adventure, as he becomes the president and CEO  of Semester at Sea, a global study abroad program that uses a ship as a  traveling campus around the world. I wish him the best of luck as he  continues his passion for higher education in this next chapter, and I  wish him and his family congratulations on a remarkably successful  career at Western Kentucky University.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions, which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 151, S. Res.  152, and S. Res. 153.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed  to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.
