 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination  of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to serve as the next Associate Justice of the  Supreme Court of the United States. Judge Gorsuch has been nominated to  fill the seat left vacant by the late Justice Antonin Scalia.   Justice Scalia was a dear friend of mine, and his death was a great  loss to me and to our country, not just to me personally but for the  whole Nation. Justice Scalia joined the Supreme Court after years of  unbridled activism by the Court, during which time Justices imposed  their own left-wing views--completely unmoored from the law as  written--on the American people.   In response, he led a much needed revolution based on the enduring  principle that the role of a judge is to say what the law is, not what  a judge wishes it were. As the intellectual architect of the effort to  restore the judiciary to its proper role under the Constitution,  Justice Scalia was a singularly influential jurist.   To say that he leaves big shoes to fill is an understatement. Any  worthy successor to his legacy will not only be committed to continuing  his life's work but also capable of delivering the sort of intellectual  firepower and leadership that Justice Scalia provided for decades.   Of all the potential candidates for this position, this vacancy, Neil  Gorsuch stands out as the jurist best positioned to fill this role. His  resume  [[Page S560]]  can only be described as stellar: Columbia University, a Marshall  Scholarship to study at Oxford, Harvard Law School, clerkships for  Judge Sentelle on the DC Circuit and for Justices White and Kennedy on  the Supreme Court, a distinguished career in private practice and at  the Department of Justice, and more than a decade of service on the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.    Even among his many talented colleagues on the Federal bench, his  opinions consistently stand out for their clarity, thoughtfulness, and  airtight reasoning. In the words of one of his colleagues appointed by  President Carter, Judge Gorsuch ``writes opinions in a unique style  that has more verve and vitality than any other judge I study on a  regular basis.'' He continued: ``Judge Gorsuch listens well and decides  justly. His dissents are instructive rather than vitriolic. In sum, I  think he is an excellent judicial craftsman.''   This view of Judge Gorsuch's capabilities is broadly shared across a  wide swath of legal observers. Consider some other descriptions of his  qualifications from outlets that could hardly be considered  conservative. The New York Times reported on his ``credentials and  erudition.'' The Los Angeles Times called him a ``highly regarded . . .  jurist,'' and ABC News described how ``in legal circles, he's  considered a gifted writer.''   I think there can be no doubt that Judge Gorsuch has the credentials  to make him a capable and effective member of the U.S. Supreme Court.  Nevertheless, I have long held that a nominee's resume alone--no matter  how sterling--should not be considered sufficient evidence to merit  confirmation to the Supreme Court. Rather, we should also consider a  nominee's judicial philosophy. In this analysis, Judge Gorsuch has  developed a record that should command ironclad confidence in his  understanding of the proper role of a judge under the Constitution.   Judge Gorsuch's opinions and writings show a clear fidelity to a  judge's proper role. While his body of work is replete with examples of  this fidelity, I want to point to one example in particular, a lecture  he delivered last year in the wake of Justice Scalia's death that is  one of the most thoughtful and persuasive cases for the proper role of  a judge that I have ever read. In it, he affirmed his allegiance to the  traditional account of the judicial role championed by Justice Scalia,  which he described as such:         The great project of Justice Scalia's career was to remind       us of the differences between judges and legislators. To       remind us that legislators may appeal to their own moral       convictions and to claims about social utility to reshape the       law as they think it should be in the future. But that judges       should do none of these things in a democratic society. That       judges should instead strive (if humanly and so imperfectly)       to apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward,       and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a       reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would       have understood the law to be--not to decide cases based on       their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they       believe might serve society best.    As Justice Scalia put it, ``If you are going to be a good and  faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not  always going to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all  the time, you are probably doing something wrong.''   This is exactly the kind of judicial philosophy we need our judges to  espouse, and Neil Gorsuch is exactly the man to embody it on the  Supreme Court. If there is one line in that lecture to which I could  draw attention, it is the quotation of Justice Scalia's formulation of  the very basic notion that a good judge will oftentimes reach outcomes  that he does not personally agree with as a matter of policy. Such a  notion should be uncontroversial.   Indeed, many of Justice Scalia's brightest opinions came in cases in  which I suspect he would have voted differently as a legislator than as  a judge. Yet such a concept might seem wholly foreign to a casual  observer of media coverage of the Supreme Court, in which cases are  invariably viewed through a political lens. Decisions and Justices are  regularly described as liberal or conservative, with little attention  paid to rationale and methodology, the matters properly at the core of  a judge's work. This phenomenon reflects a regrettable dynamic observed  by Justice Scalia himself. As the late Justice observed, when judges  substitute their personal policy preferences for the fixed and  discernible meaning of the law, the selection of judges--in particular,  the selection of Supreme Court Justices--becomes what he called a mini- plebiscite on the meaning of the Constitution and laws of this country.  Put another way, if judges are empowered to rewrite the laws as they  please, the judicial appointment process becomes a matter of selecting  life-tenured legislators practically immune from any accountability  whatsoever.   If we value such a system of judicial review, a system deeply at odds  with the Constitution's concept of the judiciary, then one can easily  see why judicial selection becomes a matter of producing particular  policy outcomes. Thus, it is easy to see why many on the left who  believe in such a system demand litmus tests on hot-button policy  issues. To them, a judge is not fit to serve unless they rule in a way  that produces a particular policy. Simply put, this is a terrible way  to approach judicial selection. It undermines the Constitution and all  of the crucial principles that it enshrines from the rule of law to the  notion that our government's legitimacy depends on the consent of the  government.   A good judge is not one that we can depend on to produce particular  policy outcomes. A good judge is one we can depend on to produce the  outcomes commanded by the law and the Constitution. Neil Gorsuch has  firmly established himself as that kind of a judge. In Neil Gorsuch's  America, the laws that bind us are made by the people's elected  representatives, not unelected, unaccountable judges. In Neil Gorsuch's  America, the powers and limits of each branch of government are decided  by the Constitution, no matter whether their enforcement produces a  liberal or conservative outcome. In Neil Gorsuch's America, the basic  freedoms of the American people enumerated in the Bill of Rights are  carefully protected, whether they are in fashion lately with the left,  the right, both or neither. In Neil Gorsuch's America, the views that  matter are yours and mine, not those of a handful of lawyers in black  robes in Washington.   For these reasons, I applaud the President for his absolutely stellar  choice. Judge Gorsuch will do us proud as our next Supreme Court  Justice. I will do everything in my power to ensure his confirmation. I  will have more to say on this in the future, but I yield the floor at  this time.
