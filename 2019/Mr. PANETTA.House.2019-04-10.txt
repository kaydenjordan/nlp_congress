 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the National Day  of Silence that is going to happen this Friday, April 12. That is a day  when people around the country and in my community on the central coast  of California take a vow of silence to raise awareness about the issues  faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer students.   One of those students will be Oliver Cantrell, who lives in Santa  Cruz and is transgender and bisexual. As president of the queer- straight alliance at Harbor High, Oliver works to build bridges between  students and school staff through education and outreach.   When Oliver transferred to Harbor High, he was met with support.  However, we know there are students at other schools who may not be so  lucky. That is exactly why Oliver is taking a vow of silence to  highlight the struggle for acceptance by LGBTQ youth.   Many students will take that vow of silence this Friday. That is why  we as leaders should continue to speak up and step up every day to  ensure that all Americans are respected and appreciated for who they  are.                            ____________________
