 I yield the floor.    Madam President, less than a mile from where we are right  now--just a 15-minute walk away--are two curving, blue-gray limestone  walls about 304 feet long. They curve their way through the center of  Judiciary Square, under the shadow of neatly organized trees, adjacent  to the National Law Enforcement Museum. Built and dedicated in 1991,  these walls were inscribed with nearly 12,000 names at the time they  were built.   Each year since then, more names have been added. In fact, just this  weekend, families, loved ones--Americans of all backgrounds, Americans  of all beliefs, a tapestry of our humanity--gathered under the night  sky for a candlelight vigil; and very solemnly, additional names were  read aloud and inscribed into that limestone, adding, once again, to  the total.   These are hallowed names, engraved into those walls and etched  forever into our Nation's memory. These are names that belong to our  fallen heroes. The names are of brave, loyal, patriotic law enforcement  officers--our great citizens--who answered the call, who sacrificed for  their communities.   No greater love hath a man than this, than to give his life for his  friends, for his Nation.   These were men and women who knew, every day when they suited up,  that they could face danger, potentially even the ultimate call. They  are the names of police officers who had tragedy visited upon them and  their families and their loved ones. They are also police officers who  took their own lives. They are the names of officers who fell to  COVID--officers who, in the midst of the pandemic and when we were  sheltering in place, were out doing their duty.   Each one of these names is a son. Each one of these people is a  daughter. They are husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, friends  and colleagues. They are parents who have perished. In short, they are  the names of public servants--of men and women--who made the ultimate  sacrifice in the line of duty.   It pains me to say that I am familiar with some of these names listed  on the walls. I am familiar from my time as mayor when I oversaw a  city, including a mighty police department. I remember vividly those  times when I would receive that call that one of our officers had been  injured in the line of duty or had been shot or, in two cases, when  they were tragically killed. I remember those phone calls. I remember  the visits with loved ones, with their fellow officers, with friends. I  remember the pain and the hurt and the agony. I remember the eulogies  and the funerals--the grief that lingers still. I remember the families  and communities shattered then and still feeling the loss now.   It first happened in March of 2007, just months after I had become  mayor. Sergeant Tommaso Popolizio was the youngest of seven siblings.  He was an avid paintball player and a loyal son of Newark. His family  had immigrated from Italy back in the sixties and had settled in the  city, where Sergeant Popolizio attended high school. Police work, you  could say, was in his DNA. Two of his older brothers were Newark  officers, and Sergeant Popolizio was following in his family's  footsteps.   He had been a Newark police officer for 12 years when he had  responded to a call, on a late night, of dangerous drag racing going  on. Sergeant Popolizio pursued a subject in a high-speed chase during  which his SUV crashed into a pole and rolled several times. He  succumbed to head injuries 2 hours later.   I remember vividly, that day, speaking to news media at the hospital.  I remember speaking to his heroism. I remember speaking to his  dedication, to his commitment. And those words are as true today as  they were then.   Those words of heroism ring true also for Detective Michael Morgan, a  6-year veteran of the Newark police force, who was tragically taken  from us in November of 2011. It was said that Detective Morgan was  destined to be a  [[Page S1708]]  cop. When he was a young boy, he would sit by his window and make siren  noises as police cars went past his New Jersey home. Two of his cousins  were police officers. His uncle was a police officer--a retired deputy  chief no less. He was an athlete. He played linebacker and fullback for  New Jersey City University.   During his years on the force, he helped take hundreds of guns off  the streets, protecting people from gun violence. He was more than just  a Newark police officer. He was a community leader from Newark, serving  Newark, involved in the community, loving his city in every way.   On that November day, Detective Morgan was off duty when he attempted  to stop an armed robbery suspect. Just as he was about to pull his  weapon, he was shot in the torso. Other officers there tried to save  his life. They rushed him to a nearby hospital, but he was pronounced  dead.   Today, these stories cut even deeper. They weigh even heavier. New  Jersey has lost too many police officers.   New Jersey grieves, recently, the loss of Deptford Police Officer  Robert ``Bobby'' Shisler. He tragically passed away just this Sunday  from a gunshot wound that he suffered 2 months ago following a  pedestrian stop. A 4-year veteran of the force, he was the first  Deptford police officer killed in the line of duty. He was just 27  years old.   The stories of these officers, of these three individuals--Sergeant  Popolizio, Detective Morgan, and Officer Shisler--are among the  hundreds and hundreds of stories of fallen officers whose names are on  that wall. They are forever emblazoned on the heart and the soul and  the character of our country. Their stories show duty; they show honor;  stories of service, of selfless purpose and the ultimate sacrifice,  stories that remind us of the dangers that every single day law  enforcement officers face.   Most importantly, they demonstrate what it takes in this democracy,  the greatest Nation on the planet still--the call of duty, the  challenge of what it takes to preserve peace. Without officers who put  themselves in harms' way, I struggle to think how the challenges we  face would be all the deeper.   This week, as we commemorate National Police Week, the purpose of  these days is for us to pay tribute. Police Week is about paying  tribute to the law enforcement officers who made the ultimate sacrifice  to our country. Let's not forget that.   It is a chance for all of us to pause and reflect on how we can  continue to work together to ensure that police officers have the  support that they deserve in doing some of the most difficult jobs in  America.   Every day, law enforcement officers are on the frontlines of major  crimes. They are there in our crises. They are there when we are  afraid. They are there when we are under assault. They are there in our  communities and our neighbors with a noble purpose to serve, to keep us  safe, to make us strong. They respond to mass shootings, to domestic  violence, to horrible accidents, and to painful crimes. They have to  confront the scourge of the rising rates of gun violence in our  country, walking into situations where they face individuals sometimes  with weapons that belong not on our streets or in our neighborhoods but  in theaters of war.   I have seen situations, active shooter situations, where other people  are running out; they are running in. Other people are ducking for  cover; they stand strong to protect us.   In the past few years, during the pandemic, I began to hear the  stories of officers, with little regard for their own safety, still  going out and doing their job. When fear and the unknown of this  pandemic was hitting, you still had officers showing up for duty, going  into dangerous situations, and I began to worry about their well-being.   It is why, working with Senator Grassley, I was proud, in the depth  of the pandemic, to introduce legislation with other colleagues from  both sides of the aisle to expand the PSOB Program so that death  benefits are given to survivors of police officers and first responders  who lose their lives to COVID-19; that the presumption is, if an  officer dies, that it was a line-of-duty death.   Today, I introduced bipartisan legislation to ensure officers across  the Federal Government receive their full retirement benefits. They are  there for us for their whole career; we can make sure that we are there  for them when they retire.   Of all these bills that are introduced and debated in this body, I  know that it is a shadow of the work being done by the law enforcement  officers in this Nation. Many of us in this body were reminded of their  heroism when this Chamber was attacked on January 6, and we saw officer  after officer put their lives on the line. Indeed, as a result of that  attack, we lost Capitol Police officers, including Brian Sicknick from  the State of New Jersey. We stand here, and we debate. We stand here,  and we legislate. But out on the walls just yards from where I stand  are the officers who show that every single day they face a danger that  we will never know.   So this week, a week in which we remember our police officers, law  enforcement themselves are still out there serving our community. Law  enforcement officers are still, with little regard for their safety,  running into situations of great danger. Whether it is a rookie cop on  their first day or a seasoned veteran who has been on the job for  decades, police officers put on their uniform, head outside, and their  families and their children and their loved ones know the challenges  and the dangers of the job. Most of them will come home. Most of them  will raise their kids. Most of them will see retirement. But,  tragically, some of them will not.   So this week, we call it Police Week, but it is a bit of a divergence  from the understanding of why this week came to be. This week is here  to remember the sacrifice and the service and the patriotism: ``My  country `tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing;'' land  where fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers died who wear the  uniform, land of patriotism and pride. Let us not forget those who have  fallen, and let us continue in a bipartisan way to protect them, to  serve them who so nobly serve us, protect us, and advance this Nation  forward each and every day.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. Paul, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Collins,          Mr. King, Mr. Cramer, and Ms. Sinema):   S. 1667. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to  authorize lawful permanent resident status for certain college  graduates who entered the United States as children, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
