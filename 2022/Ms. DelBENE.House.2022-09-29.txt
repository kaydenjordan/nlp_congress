 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8982) to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United  [[Page H8265]]  States to suspend temporarily rates of duty on imports of certain  infant formula base powder used in the manufacturing of infant formula  in the United States, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(b) Definition and Applicability.--The U.S. Notes to       subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS are amended by adding       at the end following:        ``21.(a) For purposes of subheading 9903.19.23, the term       `infant formula base powder' means a dry mixture of protein,       fat, and carbohydrates that requires only the addition of       vitamins and minerals in order to meet the definition of the       term `infant formula' in section 201(z) of the Federal Food,       Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(z)).        ``(b) The necessary proof that an import is a qualifying       infant formula base powder under subheading 9903.19.23 shall       be established by a written notice from the Food and Drug       Administration that the base powder shipment qualifies for       importation under such subheading.        ``(c) The duty-free treatment of infant formula base powder       set forth in subheading 9903.19.23 shall apply only with       respect to the importation of an aggregate quantity not       exceeding 2,600 metric tons of such infant formula base       powder.''.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the ongoing baby formula  crisis and urge my colleagues to support the Bulk Infant Formula to  Retail Shelves Act.   I raised two kids, and I know the first months of parenthood are  tiring and stressful, even in the best of circumstances. But families  across the country remain in a challenging position as they try to find  formula that they need to feed their babies.   Nationally, 61 percent of formula shelves are still empty. In my home  State of Washington, it has been hit harder, with 67 percent of formula  shelves empty. While that is an improvement from the May nationwide  high of 86 percent, we in Congress have an obligation to do more.   Part of the improvement we have seen over the last few months can be  attributed to legislation that I led with Chairman Blumenauer, Ranking  Member Adrian Smith, and my Ways and Means colleagues back in July that  lifted tariffs on imported baby formula. This Chamber and the Senate  passed the legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support.   There are still more actions, though, that Congress can take to  support families, and that is what this legislation that we will vote  on today will do.   Consider what this legislation would mean to parents. Jessie is a mom  in my district who has been struggling to find formula for her 7-month- old daughter, Amara. She is not one to ask for help often, but when she  was running low on her last can, Jessie joined a local social media  group where other parents would post where they saw formula on the  shelves. She downloaded an app that would notify her when more cans  were available and made backup plans for donated breast milk if it came  to that.   Jessie was able to find formula in the end but realizes that she is  one of the lucky parents who had the means and the network to support  her daughter. Not all parents have these resources.   The Bulk Infant Formula to Retail Shelves Act would boost domestic  baby formula production and get more product on our shelves. It would  do so by lifting tariffs through the end of the year on safe imported  base powder. This is a key component filled with essential proteins,  fats, and carbohydrates that are mixed with other nutrients and  ingredients to make the formula that parents buy on store shelves or  online.   Lifting these tariffs and getting more formula on physical shelves  would be especially helpful for families participating in the WIC  program, the Women, Infants, and Children program.   For the WIC program, parents must use those resources in brick-and- mortar retail stores, and they can't be used for online purchases  currently. About half of the baby formula purchased in the United  States is purchased through WIC.   This legislation has strong bipartisan support from the leadership of  the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, Chair Blumenauer, Ranking  Member Adrian Smith, and my subcommittee colleagues, Representatives    John Larson,  Dan Kildee, and Drew Ferguson. In the Senate, we are  supported by Senators Mike Lee, Bob Menendez, Todd Young, and Mike  Braun.   Families need our help, and they need it now. Madam Speaker, I urge  my colleagues to support this bill with the same speed and bipartisan  force as they did 2 months ago. We worked hand in hand with our Senate  partners to ensure that this measure would pass immediately. We can't  delay while parents are struggling to feed their children.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Larson), who has been a leader on this issue and who  is an original cosponsor of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Trade who  has been an incredible leader on this issue and on the Formula Act that  we passed in July.    Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for all of his  support on this legislation. It is something that will impact families  across the country right away. It not only will help to make baby  formula more available, but also to reduce the cost of that formula,  and, in particular, help the families who are using WIC across the  country.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the strong bipartisan support in the  House and the Senate, and it is important for us to move quickly. I  urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
