 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss how the extreme MAGA  Republicans are plotting a government shutdown and forcing a partisan  impeachment inquiry.   While my Democratic colleagues and I are putting people over politics  to help working Americans, the extreme MAGA Republicans are doing  nothing to make life better for average Americans. They are pushing an  unpopular agenda of cuts to healthcare, childcare, education, and  public safety. They want to allow dangerous people to own guns, and  they want to limit voting so only their supporters can vote. They want  to take away rights for women and minorities that are protected in the  Constitution. Even Senate and moderate Republicans oppose their plans.   These extreme Republicans make our country weaker and hurt American  families. They need to serve the American people and stop this reckless  pursuit of a radical agenda.                            ____________________
