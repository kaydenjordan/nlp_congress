 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Crayons 2 Pencils of Norwalk, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week during National Women's Small Business Month and National Veterans  Small Business Week.   Owned and operated by husband and wife duo Matt and Jill Larsen in  Norwalk, IA, Crayons 2 Pencils is an early learning center and  recreation center providing childcare services to the Norwalk  community. Following her career in corporate America, Jill's start in  early childhood learning and development was in 2008, when she taught  13 kids in her home. In 2015, Jill partnered with her friend Cindy  Gavin to use the same childcare curriculum in each of their homes. In  2016, Jill and Cindy were able to move their childcare operation into  one location when they opened the Crayons 2 Pencils Early Childhood  Center. Over the years, they have grown to 63 employees, with  additional positions available over the summer months. Crayons 2  Pencils currently provides care to 281 children.   In 2020, Matt joined Crayons 2 Pencils full-time as a jack-of-all- trades driving the school bus, organizing construction projects, and  handling the technology and security systems. In 2022, Crayons 2  Pencils opened the Crayons 2 Pencils Recreation Center, which serves  preschool through third grade and is equipped with a gym, sand  volleyball court, stage, and additional classrooms. In 2023, Crayons 2  Pencils celebrated their seventh business anniversary.   Service to our country is integral to the Larsen family. Matt has  served in the Iowa Air National Guard for 18 years and was deployed to  Iraq. Following in Matt's footsteps, their son Jayden also serves in  the Iowa Air National Guard, in addition to being a member of Iowa  State University's Spirit Squad with his sister Joslyn.   Crayons 2 Pencils is also actively involved in the Norwalk community.  They are active members of the Norwalk Area Chamber of Commerce, being  one of the sponsors of the second annual Celebrate Norwalk Party in  City Park in 2023 and hosting the Norwalk Career Fair in 2021. They  have also served as a valuable resource to other childcare centers in  the area by mentoring and teaching courses on childcare to directors  and employees.   Crayons 2 Pencil's commitment to providing outstanding childcare  services in Norwalk, IA, is clear. I want to congratulate Matt and Jill  Larsen and the entire team at Crayons 2 Pencils for their continued  dedication. I look forward to seeing their continued growth and success  in Iowa.
