 Mr. President, today I recognize the bicentennial  anniversary of the great State of Maine, which will be celebrated on  March 15, 2020. For the past 200 years, Maine has made monumental  contributions to our Nation and exemplified the best of America, with  immense natural treasures surpassed only by the kindness, generosity,  and work ethic of its people. With the Pine Tree State now entering its  third century, we look back on the people and events that brought us to  this milestone and look forward to all of the successes that lie ahead.   Before it was ever known as Maine, the land was home to a number of  Indigenous Tribes that together formed the Wabanaki Confederacy; to  this day, Maine continues to be home to the Wabanaki people and several  Native Tribes who make invaluable contributions to our State and our  culture. The land was settled as an independent colony in the 17th  century, before being later annexed by the colony of Massachusetts.  Maine existed under Massachusetts' rule until March 15, 1820, when it  regained its independence from our southern neighbors as part of the  Compromise of 1820 and was admitted as the 23rd State of the United  States of America.   Maine's blessings are many. In the years since its admission to the  United States, Maine has made major economic contributions to the  Nation. Maine people have proven to be resourceful, adaptable, gritty,  and hard-working, which, combined with our vast natural resources, have  established the State as a leader in vital industries. As the most  forested State in the Nation, Maine's timber industry thrived; with our  thousands of miles of coastline, Maine people worked the waters and  created one of the most lucrative and sustainable fisheries in the  world. We have turned fertile farmland into a legacy of family farms  and diversified agriculture, allowing Maine-grown food to be served  across the Nation, and we have harnessed unmatched scenery to establish  our State as a leader in tourism, where visitors from around the globe  wait all year to spend a week in Vacationland. In these industries and  many more, Maine leads the way, and it all starts with the men, women,  and families who make up the fabric of our communities and set the  standard for the way life should be.   Maine's innate adaptability and determination extends to every part  of our society, including our choice of leaders. For generations,  Maine's elected officials have emphasized common sense and problem- solving above all, traits drawn directly from the State's voters and  values. The example set by Joshua Chamberlain, the Lion of Little Round  Top, who led his men against impossible odds during the Civil War to  strike major victories for the Union, exemplifies Maine's focus on  service over self. This legacy was furthered by Margaret Chase Smith as  she stood up to the political powers of her day and chose country over  party. There are so many other examples, from Ed Muskie to Bill Cohen  to George Mitchell to Olympia Snowe, of how Maine's leaders have  championed some of the country's most impactful pieces of legislation  by focusing on results over partisanship, wielding an outsized  influence given Maine's population. It is not just national either;  there are too many examples to list of State and local leaders who have  stepped forward to create a better Maine for all of our people. This  legacy of fighting to achieve the difficult right instead of settling  for the convenient wrong speaks to the unique independence of Maine  citizens, who have always voted based on ideas, not on party. This  approach is far too infrequent in our political discourse; on this  subject, as on most, the Nation could use more of Maine's sensibility.   I have always said that Maine is like a big small town, with very  long streets because, no matter where you live in Maine, we are all  neighbors and we are all in service to each other. This focus on  service is why Maine has long  [[Page S1623]]  had one of the highest rates of veterans per capita, and it is why  towns across Maine offer a wide range of resources to help lift up our  fellow citizens struggling with challenges ranging from substance use  disorders to unemployment to food insecurity. I have been lucky enough  to travel to every corner and pocket of our State, and the way our  communities care for our own never ceases to amaze me. No matter if it  is a time of crisis or business as usual, Maine people are in it  together. That is a profoundly rare phenomenon, and we are infinitely  better for it.   Maine's motto, ``Dirigo,'' is simple, declarative, and fitting;  translated from Latin, it means ``I Lead.'' That is exactly right: For  the last 200 years, Maine has led the way, economically, politically,  and socially. As we honor the 200th anniversary of Maine's statehood, I  know that our State is positioned to continue its leadership for  generations to come. So, regardless of which of the 16 counties you are  from, let us come together--as is the Maine tradition--and celebrate  our great fortune to live, work, and play in the greatest State in the  Nation. Happy 200th birthday, Maine, and thanks to each and every  person who makes our State so special. Thanks to your efforts, I am  certain we will see history repeat itself as Maine embarks on another  200 years of prosperity, community, common sense, and leadership.                            ____________________
