 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous question, so that  we can amend the rule to immediately consider H.R. 751, the Protecting  American Energy Production Act.   Now, my bill is straightforward. It prohibits the President from  declaring a moratorium on the use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking,  unless Congress authorizes the moratorium.   It further expresses the sense of Congress that States should  maintain authority for the regulation of oil and natural gas production  on State and private lands. That is how it has been done for decades.   President Biden and House Democrats have wasted no time in this  Congress, and since his administration began, undermining American  energy independence. They have signaled that they will use any tool  necessary to end fossil fuel production in the United States.   In fact, Democrats keep rushing to President Biden's defense,  claiming he never supported a fracking ban, which is simply not true.  When he was asked by a debate moderator during the Presidential debates  in 2019 if there was any place for fossil fuels in his administration,  this is what Senator Biden, now-President Biden, actually said: ``No.  We would work it out. We would make sure it's eliminated.''   He was talking about fossil fuels.   How is this policy working out for the American people at the pump?   They are seeing higher prices for gasoline, and as they are getting  ready to travel over the holidays and go on vacation, they are paying  more at the pump. That is less money to spend on their family for  family vacation during the holiday this summer. That is what bad policy  gets you, Madam Speaker.   President Biden has already made good on his promises to revoke the  Keystone XL permit, ultimately resulting in its cancelation and the  loss of thousands of American and Canadian jobs--thousands of jobs. He  also has halted all new Federal oil and gas leases. There is no telling  which energy-killing promise he will fulfill next as he continues his  war against American energy.   Instead of prioritizing American jobs and American energy, President  Biden and the Democrats would rather appease the backwards logic of the  radical environmental left. I have no other way to say it.   They would rather make us weaker and more reliant on energy from our  foreign adversaries at a time when we are energy independent and we are  actually exporting oil and gas.   The adversaries that they are supporting have no regard for the  environmental standards that we all push in this country.   The INVEST in America Act--or more accurately titled, the green new  deal and inflation transportation act--is a continuation of this  America-last agenda. One out of every $2 spent in this bill is tied up  in Green New Deal priorities. Madam Speaker, one out of every $2 is  tied up in Green New Deal priorities.   It is ironic that while President Biden has no problem killing  American energy projects and jobs, he is greenlighting at the same time  Russian energy projects, like the Nord Stream II Pipeline that is going  to bring gas into Europe and give Vladimir Putin even more control to  manipulate politics in Europe.   President Biden doesn't think twice before waiving sanctions on a  Russian company and friend of Vladimir Putin's.   Undercutting American energy production is a handout to Vladimir  Putin and opens doors for Russia to influence operations across Europe  and even in the United States.   New England doesn't have a pipeline for natural gas to come up there.  They bring an LNG ship in from Russia that provides natural gas to the  New England States--Russian, not American gas.   Colonial Pipeline's cyberattack is the most recent reminder of this  longstanding effort by the Russians. Putin will continue to use energy  as a political weapon, and through policies like the partisan Green New  Deal infrastructure package, Democrats will continue to help Russia,  not American families--they are paying more at the pump this summer-- Russia, Vladimir Putin. Putin will continue to use those policies.    The infrastructure policies we should be focused on are hardening our  energy infrastructure to protect against these attacks, but the INVEST  in America Act doesn't do this.   It instead remakes the entire energy market, squeezes fossil fuels,  and makes the grid far more vulnerable to attacks.   The INVEST in America Act puts radical climate and Green New Deal  priorities above the infrastructure needs of the Nation.   It creates more roadblocks for transporting clean-burning LNG, gives  more money to EV charging stations than to the entire Rebuild Rural  America grant program, and it fails to include any regulatory reforms  that plague infrastructure projects.   My goodness, instead of voting on a $548 billion Green New Deal- disguised infrastructure bill, we should be protecting American energy  production and American energy jobs here in the United States.   Not long ago, the U.S. depended on OPEC for much of our oil supply.  We now lead the world in oil and gas production as well as emission  reduction. That is a fact that the left doesn't want to acknowledge. We  lead the world in emissions reduction.   The Democrats refuse to acknowledge this and recognize this. Instead,  they want to surrender one of our greatest economic and strategic  advantages: our energy independence. As Admiral Mike Mullen once said:  ``There is no national security without energy security.''    Listen to this, Madam Speaker, there is no national  security without energy security.   How true is that statement?   This is all in the name of saving the climate. The reality is phasing  out fossil fuels in the United States won't eliminate carbon emissions  globally. Production will just happen someplace else, oftentimes in  dirty production areas, because they don't have the same regulations  that we have so that the environment gets dirtier, along with the jobs  and geopolitical leverage that we have when we export our energy.   Democrats' anti-fossil fuel agenda will have no effect on the  climate. Eliminating fossil fuels will also undercut our own economic  interests. On average, a Federal fracking ban will increase household  energy costs by $618 a year.  [[Page H3320]]    Allowing President Biden to ban fracking will make all of this worse.  Russia, China, and Iran stand ready to take advantage of us as we  continue to pursue this self-inflicting harm.   By prohibiting the President from banning fracking, we, in turn,  safeguard our energy production, our national security, our  geopolitical influence, and the livelihoods of Americans--thousands of  Americans--who have lost their job.   At the end of the day, American citizens--our constituents--pay less  at the pump and for their household energy needs when we produce energy  here in this country. That is a winning solution, and this bill that we  are hoping to replace isn't.   So if President Biden wants to back up his buy America rhetoric, I  have a question for him:   Why not start right here?   Let's buy American energy.   If he truly believes in buy America, then let's buy American energy  and support American energy jobs.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question so that the House will immediately consider this bill, put  Americans back to work, and protect our national energy security.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, this bill is riddled with problems, but one  example I want to focus on right now is the Low-Income Water Customer  Assistance Program.   I have an amendment that would rein in some of this program's  outlandish spending and take a more targeted approach at water  assistance.   Let me be very clear. I am not saying that there is not a need for a  program such as this, and I am not saying that some people wouldn't  benefit from it. All I am saying is that we should figure out the best  way to attack the problem before authorizing $8 billion to fund it.  Funding the program prior to a study is backwards.   The logical first step is to determine the scope of the problem,  rather than just throwing money at it; and my amendment would do just  that.   I would argue that the Democrats even recognize the need for a study.  They included it in the bill. I am just arguing it should be done  before the implementation of a permanent entitlement at the EPA, the  very first of its kind, when the EPA said they didn't have  the logistics or the ability to run the program.    This is irresponsible government, and it will come at the cost of  taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to consider this and vote  ``no'' on the underlying bill.
