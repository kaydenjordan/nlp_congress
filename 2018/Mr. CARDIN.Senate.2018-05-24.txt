 Mr. President, this Monday, we will celebrate Memorial  Day. Across our proud Nation this Memorial Day weekend, we remember the  men and women of our Armed Forces who made the greatest sacrifice  imaginable. Whether it was on the battlefield of Antietam, the beaches  of Normandy, or in the mountains of Afghanistan, thousands of Americans  have taken up the mission to defend our Nation, ideals, and freedoms at  home and  [[Page S2919]]  abroad, knowing that they may not survive. This Memorial Day, let us  pause to pay honor to their immense courage.   I specifically remember the sacrifices of my fellow citizens from  Maryland such as SPC Tocarra Green. She was the first woman from  Maryland to die in the Iraq War. I remember SGT Erick M. Houck, a  Baltimore native like me, who died in Afghanistan just last year. It is  a remarkable notion that our fellow citizens were willing to pay such a  high cost for our own freedom. They and those like them deserve every  honor we can bestow.   Memorial Day weekend often serves as an opportunity for Americans to  spend time with friends and family. As we consider the cost of our  freedom, let us also remember the families of our fallen, our Gold Star  families. As we remember the sacrifices of our fallen servicemembers,  we also recognize the tremendous loss to their families and admire  their patriotism and perseverance.   Despite all of these sacrifices, the struggle to preserve our freedom  continues. Just as in times past, our enemies seek to threaten the  freedom for which our American brothers and sisters have laid down  their lives. These enemies don't just fight our troops on the  battlefield; they have attacked the integrity of our electoral system  and our freedom of speech while seeking to reverse our progress against  racial inequity and religious freedom. One of the best ways to honor  our fallen comrades is for us to work together to defend our freedom  and our American principles. We cannot allow the erosion of the  liberties our family members and friends have fought so hard to defend.   As I pray for the fallen and their families this weekend, I will also  pray for our men and women currently serving in harm's way and for  their families too. I am truly grateful for those who have served our  country, past and present, and I will continue to do my very best to  serve them in return.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week, the Senate is poised to confirm  the nomination of David Cornstein to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador  to Hungary. Against that backdrop, as well as reports that Secretary of  State Pompeo will meet with the Hungarian Foreign Minister in  Washington at the end of this month, it is timely to consider the  troubling situation in Hungary.   Budapest is a fabulous city. The Parliament is regarded by many as  one of the most beautiful legislative houses in the world. Hungarians  are a warm and generous people, and the United States and Hungary have  a shared history dating to the times of Lajos Kossuth, whose bust  graces the halls of the U.S. Congress. Hungarians have come to this  country as both immigrants and refugees, enriching our national fabric.   The beauty of Budapest masks a growing climate of fear, however. For  the past 8 years, Hungary's ruling Fidesz party has tried to pass  majoritarianism off as democracy. Media pluralism has disappeared. The  government plays favorites with religions, preferring some while  discriminating against others, like the Hungarian Evangelical  Fellowship. Moreover, the checks and balances that are essential for  democracy are missing in action. To say that the ruling party now  exercises unchecked legal power is not an exercise in hyperbole, but  merely a concise analysis of the facts.   Prime Minister Viktor Orban has allowed corruption to flourish,  enriching his own friends and family. The government has recentralized,  and more of the economy is either under state control or in the hands  of Orban's cronies. Once Fidesz won two-thirds of the seats in  Parliament in 2010, the party changed the election system to perpetuate  that outcome. As Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe,  OSCE, elections observers concluded, separation of state and party is  no longer respected. For a country that suffered under a one-party  regime, that is a deeply disturbing conclusion.   In 2013, I chaired a Helsinki Commission hearing on the trajectory of  democracy in Hungary. Frankly, I did not think things would get this  bad, in part because I did not think the ruling Fidesz party would  become more extremist than Hungary's strongest opposition party,  Jobbik, but after 2010, with Jobbik's anti-Semitic and anti-Roma  rhetoric serving as a Greek chorus, Fidesz leaders carved out their own  revisionist bona fides, worked to rehabilitate fascist-era figures, and  repeatedly awarded, elevated, and amplified one of the country's most  extremist polemicists. They determined that they could get away with  further escalating hate-mongering against racial and religious  minorities with one tweak: call them Muslims and migrants. Hatred, it  seems, is fungible.   Not surprisingly, the politics of fear, historical revisionism, and  national grievances have found expression in the ruling party's foreign  policy too. The most alarming example has been Hungary's opportunistic  approach to Ukraine following Russia's 2014 invasion, with Hungary's  rhetoric often echoing Moscow's. Overall, the Hungarian Government's  approach suggests that it is not interested in a dialogue about the  Hungarian minority in  [[Page S2920]]  Ukraine, but in finding a new political enemy. The fact that this is  music to Vladimir Putin's ears may be just a coincidence.   In any case, Hungary's posture regarding Russia is unusual in the  region, to say the least. As suggested in the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee Report we issued on ``Putin's Asymmetric Assault,'' Russian  disinformation isn't just creeping in over the transom; the Hungarian  Government has opened the door and put out a welcome mat.  Paradoxically, however, while Prime Minister Orban may tilt his country  to east, Hungarians themselves remain among the most pro-European Union  of Europeans and many still vote with their feet, forming a steady  exodus west. In fact, the outward exodus is contributing to an emerging  labor shortage.   It is not surprising that Hungary gets compared to Russia: the  nongovernmental organization, NGO, Law adopted in Budapest last year  was inspired by Russia, proposed by Jobbik, and passed by Fidesz, but  there are still big differences between Hungary and Russia. Journalists  are not murdered in Hungary, and no one goes to jail for his or her  opinions. Instead, Hungary is using a fist in a velvet glove to silence  civil society and thwart political dissent without ever leaving a mark.  Viktor Orban has mastered nonviolent means of repression. He has used  the renationalization of segments of the economy, the recentralization  of state authority, and the kleptocratic control of putatively private  business to stymie opposition and dissent. I know political analysts  are using a lot of different terms to describe the specific system that  has emerged in Hungary under Orban--illiberal or mafia state? Oligarchy  or kleptocracy? One of the most apt may be ``goulash  authoritarianism.''   There are worrying signs that things may get worse before they get  better. Viktor Orban now appears set to fulfill his campaign pledge to  extract ``moral, political and legal'' retribution from those who  opposed him. He welcomed the publication of an ``enemies list''  containing some 200 names--including numerous American citizens--and  urged the close-to-Orban media to do more to root them out. This is the  kind of smear campaign that often comes just before the gloves come off  and the blows begin.   Under these challenging circumstances, the United States needs to  speak with a clear and unambiguous voice. As Senator Corker said at the  confirmation hearing last week, ``Mr. Cornstein will have the important  task of reminding the Government of Hungary that its future lies not in  a return to the dark days of the past but in remaining an active member  of the community of liberal democracies.'' Messages delivered behind  closed doors are likely to have little effect or may even be completely  misrepresented in public by Hungarian officials.   The United States will always have a relationship with Hungary, but  the question is: What kind of relationship will that be? One built on  deeply shared values or only fleeting transactional interests? Our  strongest alliances are with countries where human rights are respected  and democracy is strong, and that is the kind of relationship I hope  Mr. Cornstein will help build.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Strengthening  American Communities (SAC) Act of 2018. My bill seeks to expand access  to debt-free public service career pathways for Americans who want to  serve their communities, States, or Nation. No one should be denied the  opportunity to serve their community as a law enforcement officer,  public health practitioner, social worker, or educator based on his or  her ability to afford the rising cost of an undergraduate education. My  bill is a first step toward correcting public sector workforce  disparities by enabling people to serve their communities without being  hobbled by massive student loan debt, and by providing current public  servants with the financial freedom to continue to heed their calling  to service.   Every city, town, and rural community in the United States relies on  individuals who choose to utilize their talents for the betterment of  others while accepting the lower pay of public service careers. The  very foundation of our civil society is based on these public servants  making such sacrifices. Far too many individuals who feel drawn to  public service do not pursue such careers--or they are forced to  abandon such careers prematurely--due to the high cost of obtaining  their college educations. When I had the opportunity to hear directly  from a student at an Historically Black College and University (HBCU)  in my home State of Maryland, I was saddened to hear from an  academically successful sophomore who was planning to drop out of  school because she feared further indebting herself and her family. She  said that while she appreciated the financial assistance she did  receive, it simply wasn't sufficient to cover her cost of attendance.  While this student had aspirations to serve in her own community, she  could not bear to burden her family with the cost of her education. As  a result, my home City of Baltimore lost out on a young, engaged  aspiring public servant.   Our current system of indebting individuals at the onset of their  careers has led to minority underrepresentation in the public sector  workforce. First generation college students and students from low- income families cannot afford to take on student loan debt and enter  into lower-paying public service careers. As a result, our Nation is  deprived of the talents and perspectives of individuals who want to  serve their communities but simply cannot afford to do so. As a result,  our workforce is less representative of the people it serves. We must  find new ways for people to earn the degrees they need to serve our  communities. I believe that students who make a commitment to public  service should be afforded a debt-free pathway to the baccalaureate  degree they need to start their public service career. And those  individuals who have already made the decision to choose service over  salary should not have to wait for ten years in a lower-paying public  career before seeing any reward in the form of Federal student loan  forgiveness.   The Strengthen American Communities Act I am introducing today offers  a new path for future public servants to earn their baccalaureate  degree. Through a new partnership between the Federal Government,  States, and public and private, non-profit institutions of higher  education, students will have the ability to receive the first two  years of their education at a community college, Minority Serving  Institution, or Historically Black College or University tuition- and  fee-free. Colleges would be required to commit to ensuring student  success, and students would have to meet certain academic standards and  complete their education within two years. Once students transfer into  a four-year institution for their junior and senior years, those who  commit themselves to at least three years of public service and meet  academic standards will receive a National Public Service Education  Grant to pay a significant portion of their college's tuition, fees,  and room and board costs. Universities must provide students with  opportunities to engage in public service commitments, academic  counseling and student support services, and the opportunity to earn to  finish their degree in fewer than two years. Depending on a student's  financial need, under the Strengthening American Communities Act, she  or he may be able to graduate with a baccalaureate degree debt-free  before embarking on the path to becoming a public servant.   For those individuals who have already answered their calling to  public service, my legislation would assist more public servants  continue serving their communities by accelerating the existing Public  Service Loan Forgiveness program. Under current law, these dedicated  workers must work for 10 years in a public service career and make 120  payments on their Federal student loans before they see a dime of  [[Page S2937]]  Federal student loan forgiveness. Economic, family, and other reasons  can cause individuals to leave the public sector workforce and despite  their years of service, the service these workers provided are not  taken into consideration. I propose to accelerate the Public Service  Loan Forgiveness program to provide more immediate student loan relief.  For every two years of employment and corresponding monthly Federal  student loan payments, hard-working public sector employees will  receive a percentage of their student loans forgiven, with 100 percent  of the Federal student loan balance being forgiven at the end of 10  years of service. By accelerating Public Service Loan Forgiveness, we  can encourage additional individuals to stay in the public sector  workforce despite the lower-paying salaries, reduce their cost of  borrowing for home and auto loans, and set aside additional money for  their own retirement.   As Congress moves forward with an overdue reauthorization of the  Higher Education Act, I urge my colleagues to join in this effort to  help individuals who are wholly committed to public service by  supporting the Strengthening American Communities Act. No individual  willing to serve his or her community in a public service career should  be held back from that calling due to the high cost of obtaining a  college education. No individual willing to serve his or her community  should be forced to leave public service because of financial hardship.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Strengthening  American Communities (SAC) Act of 2018.
