 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tommy Fulford of  O'Fallon, Illinois, for winning the National Eagle Scout Service  Project of the Year Award for the central region.   This project was a year in the making. Tommy took a dirt-filled  storage room dating back to 1904 in the basement of the O'Fallon,  Illinois, History Museum and created an exhibit illustrating the long  history of coal mining in southern Illinois. The room was designed to  give visitors the feel of being in an actual mine.   I visited the exhibit last month. Mr. Speaker, coming from mining  roots myself, I can tell you Tommy's project hit very close to home.   To put things in perspective, Eagle Scouts around the country and  their volunteers completed almost 8.5 million hours of service toward  their Eagle projects last year. This works out to 150 hours per  project. Tommy and his 18 volunteers dedicated 934 hours of service to  complete his coal mining exhibit.  [[Page H6044]]    Tommy, I applaud you, and I appreciate your dedication and hard work.  I know you have a bright future ahead of you.                      School Violence Prevention Program     Mr. Speaker, in January, I came to this well to urge  support for bipartisan legislation I introduced with my Illinois  colleague, Mr. Schneider. Our bill proposed a Federal grant program to  improve security at our schools and protect our children.   Since then, our legislation passed the House and the Senate and was  signed into law by President Trump. Because of Members' bipartisan  support, I am proud to say these grants are now available to local  communities.   Please urge local officials in our districts to visit cops.usdoj.gov  for more information on how to apply for up to $500,000 in grants  through the school violence prevention program. However, the  application deadline for this fiscal year is July 30, so time is of the  essence.   We have advanced safety technology in banks, office buildings, and  retail locations. There is no reason we shouldn't have that same  technology in our schools to protect our children.                            ____________________
