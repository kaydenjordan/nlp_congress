 Mr. Speaker, I also rise in strong support of the  Combating International Islamophobia Act.   A recent report in California found that 56 percent of the students  in California feel unsafe in their school because of their Muslim  religious identity. That is not the America I know. Our Nation stands  for many freedoms, including the freedom of religion.   I am a proud sponsor of this legislation to create a special envoy to  fight anti-Muslim hate crimes in the U.S. and abroad.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.
