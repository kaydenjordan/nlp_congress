 Madam Speaker, small businesses in Orange County and  across the United States are struggling. States and local governments  have given shops and restaurants the green light for reopening but have  failed to provide businesses with the resources they need to open  safely.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to introduce the bipartisan Helping  Businesses Reopen Safely Act of 2020 with Congressman Brian Mast of  Florida. This bill will provide a tax credit to small businesses,  nonprofits, and local governments of up to $25,000 annually to purchase  personal protective equipment and other supplies that are essential to  mitigating the spread of COVID-19.   Madam Speaker, the science is clear. PPE, like face masks, is our  most effective tool to keep Americans safe and keep our economy  running. My bill would ensure businesses aren't financially penalized  for providing safe and clean service.   Madam Speaker, the Helping Businesses Reopen Safely Act of 2020 would  help businesses open while protecting the public health of workers,  customers, and communities. I urge my colleagues to support and pass  this crucial legislation.                            ____________________
