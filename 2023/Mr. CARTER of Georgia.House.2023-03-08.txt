 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Judge Frances Seckinger, who passed away on March 2. I might also  note that it is appropriate on International Women's Day to honor a  great judge.   Judge Seckinger served in the judicial system when she was elected as  a probate judge in Effingham County in 1977. That election sparked the  beginning of a long and fruitful career in public service until her  retirement in 2008. It is also important to note that Judge Seckinger's  election made her the first female to hold an elected position in the  Effingham County Judicial System.   Outside of her public service, Judge Seckinger was a faithful  attendee of Springfield United Methodist Church, and she enjoyed  hobbies such as crocheting blankets for friends and family. Judge  Seckinger's selfless career of community service and her love for  family and others should serve as an inspiration for all of us.   My condolences go out to Judge Seckinger's family, and I hope they  know how grateful I am for her years of service.                            ____________________
