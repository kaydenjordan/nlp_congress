 Madam President, the Senate is in the midst of  considering several more well-qualified nominees for service in the  executive branch and on our Nation's Federal courts. We are doing so in  a more reasonable, efficient manner--more in line with this body's  tradition--thanks to the modest reform the Senate passed just a few  weeks ago.   Until recently, our colleagues across the aisle had succeeded in  subjecting even the least controversial nominees to day after day of  so-called debate.   Countless hours of valuable floor time were spent on individuals who  passed through committees of jurisdiction without any opposition and  for individuals whose final confirmation votes frequently cleared 90  votes, but now the Senate has begun to clear the backlog and put more  public servants to work on behalf of the American people.   Last evening we voted to advance the nomination of William Cooper of  Maryland to serve as general counsel at the Department of Energy. Mr.  Cooper's nomination first arrived in the Senate 9 months ago. It has  twice been reported favorably by our colleagues on the Energy and  Natural Resources Committee. Mr. Cooper of Florida has waited even  longer to begin his service as Assistant Secretary of State for  Political-Military Affairs, and the story is not much different for the  jurists waiting to finally be confirmed to Federal district courts  either.   So I look forward to the swift consideration of this week's slate of  nominees, and I would urge each of my colleagues to join me in voting  for their confirmation.                                  Healthcare    On another matter, lest there be any doubt that my Democratic  colleagues here in the Congress are serious about their party's radical  left turn, the House Rules Committee is actually holding a hearing  today on their proposal to outlaw private health insurance and force  every American into a new government-run system.   As I have said, this grand scheme ought to be called Medicare for  None. Democrats want to drain the popular program that seniors have  relied on for more than 50 years and slap its name on a brand-new,  untried, untested government-run system, and this thing they have  cooked up would become the only option--the only option--available to  American families.   Democrats are so confident that Americans will love their one-size- fits-all government plan that they feel the need to ban the private  sector from competing with it.   This is a fantasy pulled from the farthest corners of the left, but  now leading Democrats are proudly embracing it.   Here is the chairman of the House Rules Committee: ``It's a serious  proposal that deserves serious consideration.''   Well, it certainly is a serious proposal for more than 180 million  Americans who would be unceremoniously kicked off of their private  insurance plans. It certainly is a serious proposal for the tens of  millions of Americans who paid into Medicare so it would actually be  there now when they needed  [[Page S2498]]  it--not distorted into something totally different.   This is a particularly important point, given the serious challenges  that Medicare is already facing. The Administrator for the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services recently explained that ``the program's  main trust fund for hospital services can only pay full benefits for  seven more years,'' and she noted the particular irony that this  ``sobering dose of reality'' is being delivered as ``some are calling  for a complete government takeover of the American healthcare system.''   On our current trajectory, as soon as 7 years from now, in 2026,  ``doctors, hospitals, and nursing homes would not receive their full  compensation from the program and patients could face more of the  financial burden.'' That is from the New York Times.   In other words, this is a time for shoring up the existing health  insurance that our seniors like and rely on, not a time to risk it-- risk it all--by packing millions and millions more--the whole rest of  the Nation--into that very system for the sake of a snappy campaign  promise.   The last time Democrats had unified control of the House, the Senate,  and the White House, of course, they implemented sweeping changes that  the American people were assured would keep healthcare costs down. Lots  of promises were made. Lots of promises were broken.   Many families are now saddled with sky-high premiums, deductibles,  and out-of-pocket costs, not to mention dwindling choices, and now  Democrats are back for another, even bigger bite of the apple.   The last thing American families need is even more top-down, one- size-fits-all social engineering. We need to take practical steps to  address what really matters most to American families--healthcare  costs. We need to preserve what works, fix what doesn't, bring costs  down, and preserve Medicare. That is the sensible approach that  American families deserve. That is the practical solutions-oriented  approach that Republicans are committed to.   But as we have already seen across the Capitol this week, our  Democratic friends want to wheel out the drawing board yet again and  take another big whack at the healthcare plans Americans already rely  on.                            Tribute to John Abegg    Madam President, on one final matter, one of the most bittersweet  subjects that Senators discuss on the floor is the departure of trusted  staff. On one hand, I am certainly glad for any opportunity to  highlight members of my all-star team, especially someone as diligent  and tireless as the subject of my remarks today. The vast majority of  the late-night hours and weekend projects that go on around here are  repaid with much private gratitude but little to no public fanfare. So  I am glad I can devote some time today to a longtime adviser who has  earned my complete trust and thrown himself heart, mind, and soul into  serving Kentucky and our Nation for nearly two decades.   But I am very unhappy that the occasion for this is that John Abegg  is taking leave of the Senate to pursue the next chapter for himself  and his family. John, you see, is my chief counsel. He arrived on our  team before I was whip and before I was leader. President Clinton was  still in office, and it was one of the more fortunate days of my career  when this bright, young lawyer walked into my office. He brought an  outsized share of shrewd judgment, sharp wit, and an eagle eye for  detail along with him.   Some 19 years later, nearly all of that is still the case. There  might be a little more seasoning. The reading glasses might be a little  thicker. But every ounce of the talent and dedication that were so  evident back then have remained part of my operation ever since.   John has literally flourished. He has become an institution in his  own right here in the Senate and in the legal community, and I feel so  fortunate to have had him by my side.   Now, today, it may all sound quite impressive--the chief counsel who  advises the Senate majority leader on judicial nominations and  countless important policy matters. But John can attest that the  original job description 19 years ago wasn't so glamorous.   It was the beginning of the 107th Congress. I secured a temporary  seat on the Judiciary Committee. It was an important assignment, but it  came with some caveats. Namely, I would be last on the docket to speak  at hearings. So most often, as a courtesy, I would yield my speaking  time and avoid holding up the proceedings.   But this will give you a picture of how unbelievably industrious and  meticulous John is, because my bright, young counsel saw this as a zero  license to slack off or let up on the comprehensive briefing books he  would prepare for me.   No matter how many times I opted only to listen and cast my vote, the  painstaking, encyclopedic preparations came pouring in--just in case. I  may have been the new guy on the block, but John made sure that every  week I showed up loaded for bear, with extensive background  information, potential amendments, and suggested questions, because,  you see, John Abegg is never, ever caught flat-footed--not ever, and if  you are around him, he will not let you be caught flat-footed either.  For John, a job worth doing is a job worth doing to perfection--or as  close to perfection as possible.   The man literally handled everything from nominations to policy  matters to his own colleagues' questions about Senate ethics. Now, all  of that was in a half-day's work, by the way, and yet every one of  these subjects, every single time, was handled with total commitment,  stunning professionalism, and the utmost care. Zero stones were left  unturned, zero angles left unconsidered--a true ``lawyer's lawyer''  from dawn until well after dusk, and then all over again.   We are talking about a mindset that you would think even a top  professional might reserve for one marquee project every couple of  months. John brought that high standard to 14 different things before  lunchtime, and he did it every day for almost 20 years.   Now, I realize that the picture I have painted so far may sound like  an incredible team asset but not necessarily the most warm and fuzzy  individual. It is true that John was never afraid to state his views  directly to his peers or his chief of staff or to me. Now, I am not  sure anyone on my staff has been able to deliver hard news, when  necessary, with more clarity or greater courage, but he has been  equally reliable for the best laugh line in most meetings, the  perfectly timed joke. He literally lifts everyone up by bringing the  house down.   And for all of the priorities he juggles, anybody who has seen John  in the presence of his lovely wife and their three girls knows exactly  what his real top priority is.   During his tenure, John has offered me peerless advice and analysis  on countless judicial nominations. A majority of the sitting Supreme  Court was confirmed while John has been on this job. He takes the  judiciary as seriously as it deserves. The third branch and our Nation  are better for his service.   Then, there is a lengthy catalog of legislative work that John has  steered and helped me to shape. Some of his legacy is what you might  expect from a no-nonsense lawyer for a Republican Member of this body-- work on causes like class action reform or medical liability reform.   But anyone who spent time around John would be equally unsurprised by  the long nights he put in to help bring about comprehensive legislation  to address the opioid crisis or crack down on the scourge of human  trafficking or to help local law enforcement care for fallen officers'  families and search for missing children. In every single case, John  was on the case--rock-solid legal advice, keen strategy. Before an  issue even popped up, he would have his finger on the pulse of the  Senate.   Once we were in the thick of it, he was often our field general and  backbone, and after our work was done, but only then, it was time for a  well-earned smile.   But John's smile is widest when he is talking about his beautiful  wife Heidi and their three lovely daughters, Abigail, Ingrid, and  Erika.   So while his friends and colleagues here in the Senate are sad to see  John go, we know he does nothing rashly, and so we are confident that  he has thought this calculus through as completely as he has everything  else.   Fewer full-day hearings and more bedtime stories. Fewer dinners  cracking up his colleagues over takeout food  [[Page S2499]]  during some all-night session and more times at his own kitchen table.   Well, after nearly two decades, I suppose we can let this slacker  head for the hills, and we will know that he has made the right call  because John Abegg is the one who made it.   So I really can't thank him enough for his loyal friendship, wise  counsel, and exceptionally well done job.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture  is invoked, the postcloture time on the R. Clarke Cooper nomination  expire at 2:15 p.m. today. I further ask that if confirmed, the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action. Finally, I  ask that following the cloture vote on the R. Clarke Cooper nomination,  the Senate recess until 2:15 p.m. today.    Madam President, every American has the solemn  responsibility to show our gratitude to the brave men and women who  have answered the call to serve our Nation in uniform. We have an  obligation to honor the values for which they fought and praise their  efforts to preserve the freedom of this great country and the world.   This year marks the 75th anniversary of the Allied invasion of the  beaches of Normandy on D-Day. With every step onto the European  continent, the forces of freedom moved closer to ending the reign of  tyranny. Kentucky's World War II veteran community also marks another  important milestone this year. Fifteen years ago, Sandy Hart, of  Wickliffe, organized a groundbreaking project to honor the service of  Kentucky's veterans. Because of Sandy's remarkable leadership, more  than 500 World War II veterans traveled to our Nation's Capital in 2004  to visit the new memorial dedicated in their honor.   It is my privilege to recognize Sandy for her many years of dedicated  service to American veterans, whom she calls true heroes. For many of  the members of the Greatest Generation, a visit to the World War II  Memorial in Washington, DC, simply wouldn't have been possible without  her. Through more than a year and a half of hard work, Sandy, the  daughter of a World War II veteran, collected the necessary donations  to fill 17 busloads and give every veteran the chance to visit their  memorial free of charge. Although shy by nature, she is animated by her  passion for honoring veterans.   To foster greater understanding and appreciation of the sacrifice  veterans made for this county, Sandy and her husband Ray established  the Kentucky Veteran and Patriot Museum. With donations of both funds  and memorabilia, Sandy hopes the museum can be a meaningful place of  engagement and remembrance both for current veterans and for future  generations. With focuses on each of the modern American military  engagements, Sandy's museum pays tribute to the heroes who defended our  Nation.   I am not the only one who admires Sandy for her tireless work in  Kentucky. In his series of books entitled ``Kentucky's Everyday Heroes:  Ordinary People Doing Extraordinary Things,'' Steve Flairty profiled  inspirational men and women throughout the Commonwealth who, in his  words, ``go quietly about their daily living, making others' lives  better, with little or no thoughts of personal benefit.'' Sandy's  remarkable servant leadership clearly belongs among the ranks of these  Kentuckians. Her inclusion in the book is a well-earned tribute to her  lifetime spent in service to others.   To celebrate the 15th anniversary, the Wickliffe community will host  a parade and a ceremony. They will also unveil new memorials to brave  American veterans. This anniversary gathering is the latest opportunity  for Kentuckians to honor our heroes that would be impossible without  Sandy's committed vision. I am sure she would try to avoid the praise I  am offering, but she deserves this and so much more. Sandy is an  inspirational woman who has dedicated her life to the benefit of those  around her, especially our veterans. So I hope my Senate colleagues  will join me in marking this important anniversary and in thanking  Sandy Hart for her extraordinary leadership honoring America's heroes.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
