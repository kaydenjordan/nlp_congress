 Mr. Chairman, I rise tonight in  opposition to H.R. 3.   As a practicing surgeon for the last 30 years, I believe I give  somewhat of a unique perspective on the unbearable high price of  prescription drugs, an issue that all Americans can agree upon.   I have seen patients and continue to see patients who simply cannot  afford their medications. We all agree on this problem. Unfortunately,  however, H.R. 3 is, while well intentioned, a poorly executed solution.  [[Page H10117]]    Healthcare economics are unique, a fact that many here do not  realize. Price controls do not work in healthcare. There is evidence to  show that, in countries that implement price controls, only a fraction  of medicines that come to market are actually available.    I should know. I have worked across the globe. I have worked in  places where I have tried to prescribe medications that I thought were  best for patients, only to have government prevent me from doing so.   In Australia, for example, only 36 percent of new drugs released  between 2011 and 2018 were available. Canada and the United Kingdom  hardly fared better with 46 and 59 percent.   The American public does not deserve to be shortchanged.   In my 30 years as a practicing surgeon, I have seen new drugs and  treatments become available that 20, 10, and even 5 years ago patients  could have only dreamed of. But curative therapies do not occur  overnight. They occur by innovative and dedicated scientists who  continue to be on the cutting edge of research and development.   Yet it takes financial risks to develop these drugs. At present, less  than 1 in 100 drugs that are being discovered actually ever come to  market.   H.R. 3 will gut companies with a 95 percent tax if they do not  succumb to the government's strong-arm negotiation.   As a urologist, I can personally attest to the leaps and bounds that  have been made in drugs that treat advanced prostate cancer. In just  the last 5 years, more progress has been made in metastatic prostate  cancer than in the preceding 70 years. I can now talk to patients about  outliving their cancers rather than succumbing to them.   We can control drug costs. H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act,  is a much better path. We should cut the billions spent on direct-to- consumer advertising or the billions spent on pharmacy benefit  managers. We need a surgical approach to cure this disease, not a  heavy-handed hatchet job by an overreaching government.   H.R. 19 leads to decreased costs while, at the same time, providing a  pathway for the cures that so many patients desperately seek.                                time  2115
