 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Randy Wilson,  the managing editor of the Arizona Daily Sun, who passed away  unexpectedly last week.   Randy's love for his job was evident, and he was a shining example of  journalistic integrity and fairness. His life went far beyond producing  a fine newspaper that serves thousands of Arizonans. He was also fully  committed to giving back to his community.   In addition to leading the annual New Year's Day Polar Plunge and the  Flagstaff Four on the Fourth race, he was active in his church,  explored northern Arizona's trails and parks, and played a major role  in the Daily Sun's citizen and organization of the year initiatives.   Randy's legacy will live on, thanks to his enduring commitment to his  community, his State, and his paper. My heart goes out to his wife,  Lindsay; his daughter, Caroline; his fellow journalists; and his loved  ones.  [[Page H6193]]                                ____________________
