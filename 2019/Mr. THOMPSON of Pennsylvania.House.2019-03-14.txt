 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 1695, the Community Services Block Grant Reauthorization Act of  2019.   This bill renews our Nation's commitment to reducing poverty through  locally driven, comprehensive approaches.   I am proud to lead this legislation with Congresswoman Betty  McCollum.   Mr. Speaker, the Community Services Block Grant traces its roots back  more than 50 years ago to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. This  act established local committee action agencies to help people identify  why people were in poverty and how to address it using public and  private resources and partnerships.   Virtually every county in America has a community action agency. They  act as a safety net for low-income individuals and families, but, more  importantly, they help to create opportunities to raise people out of  poverty--from poverty to independence.   The Community Services Block Grant is the only Federal program with  the explicit goal of reducing poverty, regardless of its cause.  Unfortunately, this program has not been reauthorized in more than 20  years, which is unacceptable.   It is time to reauthorize the Community Services Block Grant, and I  urge all my colleagues to cosponsor and support this bill.                            ____________________
