 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I am astonished by the last hour. It is  like they are living in a different universe. If you look at the  economic growth in the United States under this administration, it is  actually growing at such a rate that by the end of the year it will  have reached 6 percent in growth. So all of that blather that went on  on the other side of the aisle should be registered as what it is:  False.   But we are here to talk about something much more important than a  bunch of lies. We are here to talk about what 90 Members of the  Democratic Women's Caucus are concerned about, and that is the care  economy. The question that we want to ask is: Why does America not  value our families or our children?   Why is it that France has provided 8 weeks of maternity leave to  working women since 1913--yes, since 1913--yet we struggle to provide  paid family leave?   Why is it that Germany 30 years ago was able to decide children have  the right to quality childcare, yet some of my colleagues call  universal childcare and pre-K a handout?   Surely if our European counterparts can understand that childcare and  pre-K is not babysitting, it is education that fuels the brain and  emotional development in the most formative years of a child's life so  that children can grow and thrive, we certainly can grasp that.   Surely my colleagues who stand here and preach about the sanctity of  life can understand the hypocrisy of advocacy for birth but not  advocacy for life. After they come out of the womb is when we should be  investing in them.   And surely, they can understand that the she-cession that happens to  both Republican women and Democratic women is real in this country and  has resulted from a pandemic that isn't just a burden on working women  and families, it is a burden on all of us. It is an issue that touches  every corner of our society and government from national security to  economic growth, and most importantly, the health and well-being of our  children and the progress of our country as we work to build back  better.   Now, I am just getting started here, but I have got many colleagues  who are here and want to speak to this issue.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms.  Sherrill).    Madam Speaker, I would ask the Congresswoman, before she  leaves, she has also served in the military, and as she called upon  this being an economic issue, is it not also a national security issue?    I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for participating  today.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel), my friend  and colleague, and co-chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus.    It is about $11 an hour, isn't it?    I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida.    Isn't it stunning that we will pay those who watch our  money six times as much money as we will pay those who take care of our  children?    Well, that is why we have lost so many slots in childcare  centers around the country. That is why 60 percent of our families live  in childcare deserts now. Think about that.                                time  1745    There is no childcare available, even if they have the resources to  pay for it because the infrastructure doesn't exist anymore because we  paid them so little. And the Build Back Better plan, as you know--and  you can articulate--is going to change all of that.    Madam Speaker, we all know that from 1 to 3 is when the  brain is developing. That is when the resources need to be made  available to these young infants and toddlers so that they will be  prepared to then go into pre-K and then into school. If you don't have  that experience, you are not going to have the children being able to  do well in school and then to be able to be persons in our communities  who are working very important jobs. So if it is truly about the  children, let's make it about the children and build back better.    That is correct. In fact, as I pointed out earlier,  France had it back in 1913. Think about that. We are a century later  and we are still struggling with parental and medical leave.   It is important to point out, the vast majority of this money, in  terms of who takes advantage of parental and medical leave, it is for  the individual. Fifty percent of the paid leave goes for an individual  who is sick and who needs that particular benefit to be able to have  the surgery or be provided the healthcare during a time of sickness.   So when we say paid parental and medical leave, the big beneficiary  of that benefit is probably an older American who is in the workforce  who, without this, would have to use their sick leave up and then  probably go on unpaid leave.    Ninety of us.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and dear friend,  Ms. Frankel.   Madam Speaker, I would also point out that as we look at the  infrastructure bill that everyone is supporting, that trillion-dollar  package is going to create 2 million jobs over the next 10 years. That  is great, but 90 percent of those jobs are going to men.   Meanwhile, the pandemic has created an environment where 1.6 million  women have left the workforce. That is the lowest participation of  women in the workforce since 1988. We are going back. We are not going  forward, unless we have the Build Back Better plan, which is going to  provide the infrastructure for childcare and pre-K and the opportunity  for women to get back to work.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky), my dearest friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her rousing  speech and making the case, once again, that women are the backbone of  this country. If we build back better in the Build Back Better plan,  what we  [[Page H5717]]  will have is a situation where 2 million more jobs will be created.  There will be $24 billion more in take-home pay for women, which will  then move through the economy and benefit all of us, as well.   It is my great pleasure to introduce one of our newer Members, but  one of our feisty new Members.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Wild).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments.  I think it is important to point out, as she did, that when we are in a  situation where we want to bring our family members who are dying home  and keep them at home, and bring in home healthcare, we are actually  saving money for the Medicare system because if they were hospitalized,  the cost per day would be prohibitive.   I had my mother-in-law, my father, and my mother all living with us  at the end of their lives, and it was a great source of solace to know  that they could stay home and bring in a home healthcare worker.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan  (Mrs. Lawrence), a co-chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus, an  outspoken advocate for so many of these issues.    Madam Speaker, I thank my co-chair for that passionate  speech. I think you pointed out, as heads of households, that the  feminization of poverty that was dubbed some 30 years ago is still, in  fact, what we are dealing with today.    That is part of what we are trying to do with Build Back  Better.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Houlahan), my colleague on the Armed Services Committee and the  Military Personnel Subcommittee, and someone who has served our country  in the military.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  for her comments.   I do believe that today a woman serving in the Air Force would have  the benefits of 12 weeks of paid parental leave and, hopefully, in the  very near future a childcare system that will not speak of some 9,000  who are waiting for childcare slots that don't exist in childcare  centers in the military.   It is shameful that we have to legislate that, but we are in the  process of doing it.   I now will join my colleagues in welcoming our colleague from the  great State of Illinois, one of our new but very effective members,  Congresswoman Marie Newman.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Newman).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments  and for her great leadership.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of  California (Ms. Barragan).    Madam Speaker, I am very impressed that my colleague took  the red-eye because she was caring for her family and she is here  tonight caring for her constituents. I hope the gentlewoman can go home  and get some rest.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee). My colleague is a great advocate for all those in her State and  throughout the country.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for her  comments, and I thank Madam Speaker for allowing us to have this  Special Order hour to talk about families in America and what the Build  Back Better plan will do to make sure that families have childcare,  have pre-K, have the opportunity to go back to work.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
