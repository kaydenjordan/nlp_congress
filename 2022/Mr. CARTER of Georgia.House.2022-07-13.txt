 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 3967, the Honoring our  PACT Act. However, I want to make sure that my colleagues across the  aisle know how disappointed I am in these budget gimmicks that have  become a part of this final legislation.   As many of you are aware, I have the honor and privilege of  representing the First Congressional District of Georgia. We have every  branch of the military in our district. With every branch represented  in my district, I take pride in my ability to serve and aid our men and  women in uniform.   I promised them I would vote for this bill. I am going to vote for  this bill. But I do so begrudgingly, and the reason why is because I  think it is despicable, Mr. Speaker, that my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle are using our veterans in order to gain the ability  to use billions of dollars, almost $700 billion, on pet projects that  they want to spend on. I think that is a slap in the face of our  veterans.   Our veterans did not sacrifice, did not serve, in order to bankrupt  our country. But that is what our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle want to do.   Now, they deserve this. They need it. There is no question about  that. Anyone who votes for it or against it agrees they need this, and  we are going to make sure they get it. But I want to make sure that the  point is made that this is despicable to use a budget gimmick like this  against our veterans in order to be able to fund pet projects that my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to fund.
