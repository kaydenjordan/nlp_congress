 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of H.R. 3364, the Russia, Iran, and North Korea Sanctions Act.   These sanctions are critical to countering aggressive and  destabilizing actions by Russia, Iran, and North Korea, sending a  strong message at a critical moment.   Iran has continued its illegal ballistic missile program, its support  for terrorism, and its atrocious human rights record; North Korea has  continued to pursue its dangerous development of nuclear weapons;  Russia has maintained its aggression in Ukraine, its illegal occupation  of Crimea, and its destabilizing actions in Syria.   These sanctions also send a long overdue response to the Kremlin's  attacks on our elections here at home. I commend this body for coming  together on this important American national security issue. I call  upon the Senate to pass this legislation and for the President to sign  it.                            ____________________     BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I have an  amendment at the desk.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, this is a bit of  a complex issue, so I will do my best to explain. It is, unfortunately,  an issue that my constituents and a number in the suburban Philadelphia  area have been dealing with now for the last 2\1/2\ years.   The chemicals with the acronyms PFOS and PFOA are part of a class of  manmade, highly fluorinated chemicals that are highly persistent in our  environment.   In the 1970s, the Department of Defense began using a firefighting  foam with the acronym AFFF. Unfortunately, that firefighting foam to  extinguish petroleum fires contained these chemical compounds. These  chemicals have subsequently been linked to problems in liver, thyroid,  and pancreatic function, as well as changes in hormone levels.   Some studies have shown developmental issues in children, decreased  fertility, increased cholesterol, immune system deficiencies, and an  increased cancer risk. Production of AFFF has ceased, but stockpiles  remain.   Today, the Department of Defense is evaluating and testing the  drinking water systems of hundreds of communities nationwide due to  PFOA and PFOS contamination on or surrounding these defense  installations across the country that used AFFF.   So far, water contamination has been found near 27 military bases in  16 States. This includes the community that I represent and that my  colleagues share in representing. In my district alone, families  surrounding Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove, as well  as the Horsham Air Guard Station, suffer from the uncertainty of  wondering whether their child's or their spouse's illness is caused by  the military's contamination on the base in their local community.   They have paid for endless stockpiles of bottled water and higher  utility fees, as their communities have taken steps to reduce the water  system's exposure. I commend the steps the military has taken to date,  but more can and must be done.   I know that our communities in the Philadelphia area are, sadly, just  the tip of the iceberg. This past year alone, since the EPA tightened  its lifetime health advisory under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the  Department has completed testing of 480 drinking water systems at  locations where the Department supplies drinking water. It continues to  conduct preliminary assessments and site inspections under CERCLA to  identify sites where PFOA and PFOS may have been released by the  Department of Defense.   The Department spent approximately $200 million just last year in  response to PFOA and PFOS contamination nationwide. This funding has  been used to conduct preliminary assessments and site inspections, test  drinking water systems, and provide mitigation such as bottled water or  drinking water filtration systems where water system tests indicated  PFOA and PFOS are above the EPA advisory levels.   Unfortunately, though, the Department has been funding this response  using existing funds that were originally programmed for other response  actions.   In order to support near-term outreach and engagement in local  communities that have this impacted drinking water system and  adequately prepare for long-term remediation of what is likely to be  billions of dollars' and many years' worth of response, I worked with  the House Armed Services Committee to increase its authorization for  the Navy and Air Force environmental remediation accounts by an  additional $30 million each in the NDAA the House passed earlier this  month. My amendment would bring the  [[Page H6499]]  appropriation in line with that authorization.   This funding is a necessary response to an ongoing environmental  issue that is only going to get worse and more expensive for the  Department, not to mention the countless innocent communities impacted  across the country, both in Republican and Democratic districts.                                time  1500    I want to thank my Republican neighbors Pat Meehan and Brian  Fitzpatrick for working with me on this issue in a truly bipartisan  manner. I hope the House comes together in a similar manner today to  strengthen our Department of Defense's response to drinking water  contamination it is causing in the communities we represent.   Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I yield the balance  of my time to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), my  neighbor and colleague from Bucks County.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I yield back the  balance of my time.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded  vote.
