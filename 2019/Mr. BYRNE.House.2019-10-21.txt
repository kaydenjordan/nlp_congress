 Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my Alabama colleagues  in remembering the extraordinary life of Alabama's great public  servant, the late Congressman Jack Edwards.   Jack served Alabama's First Congressional District in Washington for  20 years. He was a great friend and mentor to me and countless others,  and he was a true leader here in Congress where he led the rebuilding  of our military under President Reagan.   Jack's service continued after Congress. He was chair of the Mobile  Chamber of Commerce during a period of remarkable renaissance. He also  served as chair of the board of trustees for the University of Alabama.   Jack was a born leader who loved his country and never failed to  answer the call of service. Jack helped create the America we know  today, and we owe him a great debt of gratitude. In remembering Jack  Edwards, we all should emulate his example and the principles he stood  for: unquestioned integrity, commitment to others, and respect for all.   Madam Speaker, I ask that all Members and guests of the gallery rise  for a moment of silence in honor of the late Jack Edwards.                            ____________________
