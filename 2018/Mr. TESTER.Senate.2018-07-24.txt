 Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the Montanans who  served our Nation during the Korean war.   Their service and sacrifice will forever be remembered in the  official Congressional Record. Many of them rest in peace in the sacred  ground of the Yellowstone National Cemetery.   During the Korean war, 6.8 million Americans served between 1950 and  1953. About 20,000 Montanans served in the military during that time,  and 5,000 of them saw combat. We lost 350 Montanans in Korea.   Today about 6,000 Korean war veterans call Montana home. Survivors of  the ``Forgotten War,'' far too many of them have struggled for far too  long to receive the recognition and benefits they truly deserve.   As ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, it has  been my honor to fight for legislation that rights this wrong. I have  introduced legislation that extends benefits related to toxic exposure  to more veterans who served along the Korean Demilitarized Zone.  Because when servicemembers deploy to harm's way and are exposed to  toxic chemicals, our country has a responsibility to meet their  healthcare needs.   Honoring these veterans takes more than just legislation; it takes  dedicated people who are committed to telling their stories and  honoring those who have served.   The Montana American Legion, led by Commander Richard Klose, is an  important partner working to ensure veterans who fought in every  conflict can get the healthcare, honor, and recognition they have  earned.   Since 2014, Montana veterans and their loved ones can choose to be  buried under the Big Sky in the Yellowstone National Cemetery--veterans  like COL John R. Black of the U.S. Army, the most highly decorated  veteran interred at the Yellowstone National Cemetery, earned two  Silver Star medals and two Legion of Merit medals in his service to our  Nation in the Korean and Vietnam wars; veterans like Captain Ralph D.  Myer, a U.S. Public Health Service Officer of the Korean and Vietnam  wars, is one of the highest ranking veterans interred at the  Yellowstone National Cemetery.   Montana will remember Colonel Black, Captain Myer, and all of our  citizens who fought during the Korean war.   We will honor their memory by relentlessly fighting to get the  veterans of the Korean war the equal benefits and care that they earned  but are too often denied.   Some paid the ultimate sacrifice. Some returned home bearing the seen  and unseen wounds of war. All showed courage and strength when they  heeded the call to protect our Nation far from home. We cannot forget  their service and sacrifice.   To Commander Klose, the Montana American Legion, my friends at the  Yellowstone National Cemetery, and all those who dedicate their lives  to this country in service, on behalf of myself, Montana, and our  Nation, I extend my greatest thanks for your enduring bravery, service,  and self-sacrifice.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of  George Ell, a member of the Blackfeet Nation who is being remembered by  his family, by his community, and by his Tribe.   George was born and grew up on Livermore Creek near Browning, MT,  fishing and exploring the mountains surrounding it. In the year 1890,  not long after Montana was admitted to the Union, the U.S. Government  forcibly took him from his home at the age of 16.   George was forced to board a train to Pennsylvania to attend Carlisle  Indian Industrial School. He was turned away from his cultural  practices, forced to cut his hair, and discard his traditional  clothing. He was barred from speaking his language.   George died under mysterious circumstances a little more than a year  after he arrived in Pennsylvania--a foreign land for a 16-year-old boy.  The government buried him in Carlisle. It took 128 years for George to  rightfully return home to Montana, where he belongs, to be reburied.   George's ancestors laid him to rest recently on a bluff next to  Flattop Mountain, where his family can mourn and our Nation can learn  from this sad chapter of America's history.   I also want to recognize George's family, including Dale Ell, Leon  Chief Elk, Rhonda Boggs, and everyone involved, who were relentless in  their quest to bring George back home. Their efforts are not only  admirable, but an essential part of the collective healing process.   The Ell family is just one of many Native American families who were  torn apart by this Nation's horrendous assimilation policies and the  boarding school era. It is my hope that, as his family lays George Ell  to rest, we commit ourselves to a brighter future--a future where we  celebrate the first people of this Nation, their culture, heritage,  religion, and strength. It is imperative that we learn from the story  of Mr. Ell, so the next generation is educated about the suffering, so  our kids and grandkids are inspired by his fortitude and the resilience  of so many other Native Americans.   I rise today to honor those who were tested by cruelty; may their  stories resonate in our history and spur us toward a stronger  tomorrow.                            ____________________
