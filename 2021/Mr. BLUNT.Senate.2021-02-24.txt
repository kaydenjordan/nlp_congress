 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a year ago, schools began to close due to  the coronavirus. Teachers quickly scrambled to try to figure out how  they were going to teach kids who weren't there. They set up virtual  classrooms on the internet. Parents started googling activities to keep  their children motivated and active, but they didn't start that a year  ago. They started 11 months ago. It didn't take long to figure out that  kids at home are different than kids at school. And even before that,  many parents had to start accommodating their schedule to try to figure  out how they were going to deal with this new and unanticipated  schedule.   Congress stepped up. On multiple occasions, we passed emergency  legislation to get money to schools to clean classrooms, to buy laptops  for students, and to do almost anything else that schools thought they  might need at the elementary and secondary level. But what started as  what I believe everybody thought was a stopgap--certainly no longer  than until the weather got hot in the summertime as we finished up the  last school year--has become, in many places, permanent, full time now,  where students for a year have not been in school. That is despite a  lot of widespread consensus that both scientists and medical experts  think that kids can be back in the classroom.   The science on studying and learning is also clear that when schools  are closed, students suffer. There have been a lot of studies to show  that prolonged remote learning puts kids at higher risk for falling  behind, for failing classes, for suffering from mental health problems,  and, in many cases, just deciding not to show up. And, you know, the  one thing about virtual is it is pretty easy to not virtually be there  as well.   The risks on all those areas--the mental health problems, the falling  behind, the failing grades--are even greater for students with  disabilities or for minorities or people who live in generally  underserved areas. A study by McKinsey looked at the toll prolonged  remote learning has taken on students. It estimated that when it comes  to mathematics, students, on average, are likely to lose 5 to 9 months  of learning by the end of this school year. It said that students of  color--this is according to McKinsey--could be 6 to 12 months behind at  the end of this school year. Think about that. One year of remote  learning could leave students 1 year behind where they should be in  math if you look at these expert studies.   In addition to the academic damage, remote learning has led to an  increase in mental health challenges facing students. A report by the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that mental health  problems accounted for a growing proportion of students' visits to  hospital emergency rooms. Visits were up 31 percent for kids between  ages 12 and 17 and 24 percent for kids between ages 5 and 11, and  according to the CDC, many of those visits are based on a mental health  challenge rather  [[Page S841]]  than some other kind of health challenge.   The risk of keeping kids at home are significant. What is worse, they  are unnecessary by the growing number of people who are looking at  this. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, who is the head of CDC, recently appointed  by President Biden--she began her work there on January 21--talked  about what we should do earlier this month. She said that there was  ``increasing data''--``increasing data that schools can safely  reopen.'' That ends the quote, but she went on to say, even if teachers  aren't vaccinated for the virus.   Anthony Fauci--Dr. Fauci echoed that point. He said: ``I would back  the CDC recommendation because that is really based on data . . . we  need to try and get the children back to school.'' That ends Dr.  Fauci's quote. He went on a step further by saying that it is not even  workable to wait for every teacher to be vaccinated before schools  reopen because, when you think about that, if every teacher had their  first vaccine today in the double-vaccine world we are still in, it  will be the end of March before every teacher had their second vaccine,  and you are so far down the line, before you know it, the school might  not be able to reopen in that circumstance.   Dr. David Rosen, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at  Washington University in St. Louis, said:         There is no situation in which schools can't be open unless       they have evidence of in-school transmission.    The Biden White House actually immediately said they just didn't  agree with the experts on this, even the ones in their own  administration. The President's Press Secretary said that Dr. Walensky  was speaking in her personal capacity when she said that you can go  back to school even if teachers weren't vaccinated, even though she was  speaking in an official White House coronavirus briefing. Now, how the  head of the CDC speaks in her personal capacity at an official White  House coronavirus briefing on this topic, I don't know, but that is  what happened   The White House just keeps repeating these points that teachers  should be a priority for vaccination. I don't have a problem with that.  I think that would be a great thing. It would make teachers more  comfortable and might make parents more comfortable. In fact, when we  were debating the budget resolution just a couple of weeks ago, I  offered an amendment that would have incentivized school districts to  get kids back to school after teachers had been vaccinated. That is  more stringent than the President himself has said and more stringent  than the CDC has said, but my amendment was blocked on a party-line  vote. Every single Member of our friends on the other side voted  against an amendment that would say we should incentivize, financially,  getting kids back to school when teachers have been vaccinated.   Now, a couple of my friends on the other side walked up and said:  Well, we just need to work this language a little bit because all of us  that have kids know how important it is that we get our kids back to  school. Democrats say we need emergency legislation to help the  schools. I have been part of five bills that did that, and we provided  $67.5 billion for K-12 schools to reopen safely. So far, States have  spent just under $7 billion of that $67 billion, so clearly money is  not the obstacle to getting back to school.   The new plan would give an additional $128.6 billion for schools,  according to the CBO, and, again, only 5 percent of that money would be  spent by the end of this fiscal year, only about $6.5 billion. The rest  of the money would be available over the next 7 years. Hopefully, that  money is not money that is designed to get kids back to school. We  don't need to be waiting 7 years to get kids back to school.   If schools need money right now, they, first of all, should spend the  money that the Congress has already provided. There is no reason to  have over $60 billion still waiting to be spent if that is what it  takes to get kids back to school.   This probably isn't about funding. It is really a discussion about  whether the schools should reopen and what else we need to do with  money that might be available right now because of this coronavirus  legislation.   We need to be sure we get back to school. Our goal should not be to  keep the schools closed. If it is, why are we providing all this extra  money so that schools can reopen, even though it will be a long time  before that is spent?   I started out my career, after college, as a high school history  teacher and then later I was a university president. I know the  challenges educators face every day and the ways well-meaning policy  experts sometimes miss the reality of the classroom. I also know that  teachers are used to big challenges. They see them every day. They meet  them every day. They do their best every day to overcome the challenges  in front of them. Teachers want to help kids learn, and they don't know  what to do when they can't have the contact they need to have with the  kids. They know that kids won't be doing as well as they need to do, in  more cases than not, until they are back to school.   In a recent Axios poll, teachers said they would return to school and  are ready to do that. It is really time for a commonsense appraisal of  what needs to be done to get kids back in school. This should not be  something that we wait till next fall to do. It is something that needs  to happen right now.   The CDC guidelines are helpful, but they need to be more flexible. We  need to constantly look at all the data. As people working hard to get  kids back to school, we need to be sure that we understand where that  is working, why that is working, how that is working, and we are  getting that information out to school districts all over America. It  is time to go back to school.   I yield the floor.
