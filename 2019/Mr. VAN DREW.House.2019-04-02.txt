 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to the importance of  honoring our government handshake agreements.   Medicare and Social Security are cornerstones of America's safety  net. Social Security enables millions of Americans to retire with  invaluable peace of mind, and Medicare is an effective tool that  provides greater healthcare to millions and millions of Americans.   These programs are a golden handshake agreement between the Federal  Government and the people of the United States that must be honored,  and I will not stand for any attempts to undermine our commitment.   Our seniors rely on Social Security and Medicare, and it is our  responsibility to ensure that these programs are always there for them.   Our word is our bond. Keeping the promises made to the people is  essential to the success of our Nation and to the success of our  government.                            ____________________
