 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I rise  today in opposition to H.R. 9, more appropriately named the U.S. energy  disadvantage act.   The bill attempts to lock us into a bad deal. While the United States  is continuing to lower its emissions and to lead the world through  technological innovation, other countries around the world are not  meeting even their targets. Some aren't making targets. Those countries  came up with targets on their own, and they still aren't living up to  them.   Staying in the Paris Agreement would raise energy prices and slow  economic growth without curbing emissions in a meaningful, global  fashion.   Mr. Chair, we are not the ones who are polluting the air and the  water. We are cleaning it up. We are doing it as a result of doing the  right thing. Yet, Mr. Chair, today, the ones that are polluting  greatest are doing nothing other than just being told to think up  something by 2030.   Mr. Chair, our President did the right thing. We should do the same.  We need  [[Page H3369]]  to get to work on legislating, not political messaging.   The American people sent us here to work on solutions to healthcare,  infrastructure, education, the economy, and much more. Let's get to  work on that, and let's encourage the nations of the world to do the  right thing and get involved in doing what the United States has done  already and, by the way, will continue to do.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this bill. We all should.
