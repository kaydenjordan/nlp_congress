 Mr. President, I want to honor the service and  dedication of one of North Dakota's most dedicated volunteer  firefighters.   Art Stavens of Hatton, ND, became a member of the Hatton Volunteer  Fire Department in 1951 and has served ever since. Art turned 95 on May  19 and was honored by his fellow firefighters and community residents  with a surprise drive-by parade past his home. It appropriately  included several fire trucks.   His time in the department has included being the fire chief for 6  years and assistant fire chief for another 3 years. When Art stopped  responding to fire calls, he could be found standing on the highway  directing vehicles to the location of a fire.   Art still attends firefighter functions such as meetings and  conventions, and he remains as dedicated as ever to the role of  volunteers who step forward to protect their communities.   Art Stavens may be the longest serving volunteer firefighter in the  United States. On behalf of all North Dakotans, I thank him for his 69  years of service on the Hatton Volunteer Fire Department. I  congratulate him on his 95th birthday and wish him many more years of  health and happiness.                            ____________________
