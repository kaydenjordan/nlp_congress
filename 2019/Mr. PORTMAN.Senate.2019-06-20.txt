 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I am here to continue the important  conversation we had on this floor about the ongoing addiction crisis we  face in this country. Over the past 2 years, I have come to the floor  57 times to talk about addiction, and usually it has been about opioids  and the impact opioids are having--tearing our families apart,  devastating our communities. There is certainly an opioid epidemic in  this country with prescription drugs, fentanyl, heroin--it is true--but  we also have to focus on the fact that we have a broader problem. That  is what I am going to talk about today, along with what we can do about  it.   Congress has done a lot in the last several years. When looking at  what was proposed and what was passed, we put new policies in place at  the Federal level to promote better prevention, better treatment  programs, and better long-term recovery. We passed legislation to stop  some of these deadly drugs from coming into our country. That has  helped somewhat. Those legislative initiatives, such as the CARA Act,  the 21st Century Cures Act, and the STOP Act, are starting to work.   Over $3 billion of additional funds has been appropriated by this  Congress just in the last 3 years alone to ensure that we have the  ability to push back against this epidemic. In my home State of Ohio-- one of the States hardest hit by this epidemic--we received nearly $140  million from the CARA and Cures grants. It is going toward stuff that  is working--evidence-based prevention, innovative approaches to  treatment and getting people into treatment, and closing some of the  gaps in the continuum of prevention, treatment, and recovery. A lot of  people were falling between the cracks. Closing those gaps has a made a  big difference in my State. We also equipped our first responders with  what they need and the training they need to help push back.   The good news is, these programs are starting to work. Drug overdose  deaths are still way too high, but for the first time in 8 years--8  years of increased overdose deaths every year--we are seeing a  reduction in overdose deaths.   In my own State of Ohio, we have seen significant progress. We have  had a 21-percent drop in our overdose deaths finally after 8 years of  increases. This was the biggest drop in the Nation from July 2017 to  June of 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control National  Center of Health Statistics. Nationally, again after 8 years of annual  increased deaths, we have seen a leveling out--in fact, a very modest  downturn. Between 2017 and 2018, overdose deaths fell from 73,000 to  71,000. In all, the overdose rate dropped in 21 States. Overall, there  has been only about a 1-percent drop, so it is very modest but a lot  better than the alternative we have seen for 8 years, which is  increased deaths.   As we begin to turn the tide on the opioid epidemic, I am convinced  that we would be doing even better if not for the influx of fentanyl.  About 4 or 5 years ago, fentanyl came to our country in a big way-- almost entirely from China and almost always through our own U.S.  Postal Service, believe it or not--and it has caused all kinds of  havoc. It is the deadliest of all the drugs. When you look at overdose  deaths, the primary cause now is fentanyl. It is a synthetic drug that  is 50 times more powerful than heroin.   We are beginning to push back again, including with our STOP Act,  which has now been passed, which requires the post office to begin  screening and stopping some of these packages from coming in. We will  do a better job in working with China. We have commitments from them,  and we hope they will follow through on them.   Even as this limited progress is being made on the opioid front, we  have a new, growing danger. I have heard this over the past few years  from law enforcement and from providers--from people on the frontlines  of the drug epidemic. They are seeing a resurgence of what are called  psychostimulants. Mostly it is pure, powerful methamphetamine from  Mexico--crystal meth.   In the last couple of months, I have heard about this from the people  in the trenches all over Ohio. I have talked to community leaders in  Knox County; treatment providers in Southeast Ohio; service providers  in Columbus; the ADAMHS Board in Adams, Lawrence, and Scioto Counties;  the leadership of  [[Page S4173]]  the Hamilton County Heroin Coalition; and community leaders and law  enforcement in Butler County and the Dayton area just last week. From  all over the State, they all tell me the same thing: We are making some  progress now on heroin, and that is good. We are making limited  progress on keeping the fentanyl out. But we are spinning our wheels on  combating particularly crystal meth, and they are also seeing a  resurgence of cocaine--both of which are stimulants, and both of which  are causing havoc in these communities, in part because, as a  psychostimulant, it leads to more violent behavior.   They are having a devastating impact in my State. According to a 2018  report from Ohio University, these psychostimulants--including meth-- were found in just nine overdose deaths in 2010. That number rose to  556 overdose deaths in 2017, which is the most recent data we have.  That is an increase of 6,000 percent. That same year, Ohio had more  than 1,500 people die of cocaine overdose, which is an almost 140- percent increase from the year before.   This problem isn't isolated to Ohio. According to the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, deaths involving cocaine, crystal meth,  and other psychostimulants have increased nationwide. In the more than  70,000 drug overdose deaths in 2017, more than 23,000 or nearly one- third involved cocaine, meth, or both. Just from 2016 to 2017, in that  1 year, death rates involving cocaine and crystal meth increased by  approximately 33 percent. Increases occurred across all demographic  groups and in all ZIP Codes.   In the case of meth in particular, usage rates have gone up as opioid  rates have gone down. I am told by experts that this is for a few  reasons. Some meth users initially turned to this drug to manage the  heavy crashes that followed prolonged usage of opioids--heroin,  fentanyl, and other opioids--and then they became just as addicted to  meth as they had been to opioids. Others turns to meth because the drug  is stronger and cheaper than other options.   By the way, the days of home chemists and one-pot meth labs in  America are largely gone. You probably can remember, 5, 10, 15 years  ago, the meth labs in your community. You are not hearing about those  now. That is the good thing, but the bad thing is that you are not  hearing about them because the stuff coming from Mexico is more  powerful and less expensive. The super-labs in Mexico run by the drug  cartels are mass-producing this meth. It is powerful, deadly, and low  cost. I am told by law enforcement in Columbus, OH, that crystal meth  now costs less than marijuana on the streets of Columbus.   Most of this pure crystal meth enters the United States from Mexico  in bulk at ports of entry along our southwest border, often hidden in  cars and trucks. Our Customs and Border Protection officers, who are  already stretched thin by the ongoing migration crisis, don't have the  resources to identify these smuggled shipments. The INTERDICT Act,  which we passed here, is beginning to help by providing some  technology, but, frankly, we need research on better technology, and we  need to provide more funding to ensure we can stop this deadly  substance by identifying it at the border to keep it from coming in.   According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the amount of  methamphetamine at our ports of entry has soared from about 14,000  pounds in 2012 to 56,000 pounds in 2018. We have also seen a 38-percent  increase in methamphetamine trafficking along the southern border just  in the 1 year from 2017 to 2018. One troubling measurement is that the  number of crystal meth submissions to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal  Investigation lab rose from 2,000 in 2015 to over 12,000 in 2018. That  is a 500-percent increase in my home State. This is an indication of  how much of this is being detained, being found by law enforcement and  taken to these labs.   As I heard from folks all across Ohio, we are also seeing meth laced  with other drugs, including fentanyl, heroin, and sometimes cocaine. I  am told that sometimes the cartels mix these drugs into methamphetamine  to lower the cost of the final product, meaning that the users may be  consuming dangerous opioids without realizing it. Other traffickers do  so because they know that fentanyl is incredibly addictive. You may  think it is one thing, but it is really another. Any street drug you  use is potentially deadly--remember that.   We still don't have the full picture of how these drugs are being  mixed together and sold for consumption. Over the past 2 years, I have  seen more reports of individuals in Ohio who used cocaine that, unknown  to them, had been mixed with fentanyl. In the last month alone, at  least 49 Ohioans in my hometown of Cincinnati, OH, were killed by that  deadly combination. It has been hitting our African-American  communities particularly hard.   Again, this highlights how the drug cartels sometimes try to hook  users by cutting stimulants with addictive, deadly fentanyl, often with  lethal outcomes.   The bottom line is, we have to address the broader issue of  addiction, not just the issue of individual drugs. We know that crystal  meth and cocaine are increasing pretty dramatically. That is why we  have to continue our fight against opioid use but also provide more  flexibility to our communities. As a result, today I am introducing new  legislation designed to address the resurgence of crystal meth and  cocaine into our communities.   To date, the grants provided by the 21st Century Cures Act--these are  grants that go directly back to the States, and the States determine  how they are used in local communities. These are called State opioid  response grants. They have been used to increase access to naloxone--a  miracle drug that reverses the overdose. They have also been used for  longer term addiction treatment and support services for opioids.   For all the good they have done, these grants can't be used  effectively to combat the drug crisis beyond opioids, which ignores the  new on-the-ground reality of addiction in my State and many others. So  the legislation I am introducing today will make a simple change to  existing law. It will allow the State opioid response grants to be more  flexible so they can be used for whatever the drug addiction problem is  on the ground, which will be a little different for every State and,  for that matter, every community. In particular, dollars would be able  to be used in programs focused on methamphetamine and cocaine treatment  and recovery.   We know these existing funds are making a difference. We have to be  sure and keep this program going. That is why my legislation will also  reauthorize the State opioid response grants program with this  flexibility but reauthorize it for 5 years, providing $500 million  annually to ensure there is stable funding.   A stable funding stream to these States is absolutely essential to  having the predictability and the certainty we need to continue to make  progress and to avoid these new drugs coming in and creating more  devastation in our communities. It is a simple, commonsense change that  will allow State and local organizations the flexibility they need to  fight what is quickly becoming a two-front war on addiction.   The fact that we are continuing to see these new types of drugs pop  up in Ohio and around the country highlights the reality that this is a  fight against addiction. Addiction is a disease. Again, this Congress  has done an unprecedented amount of work in this area in the last few  years, and I commend us for that, but we have to do more. We have to  provide this flexibility. We have to be sure we are focusing on the  fight against addiction, not just on individual drugs.   While I am encouraged by the welcomed progress in preventing opioid  overdose deaths, we cannot rest on our laurels. The cartels continue to  pump new combinations of opioids and stimulants into vulnerable  communities, hooking individuals on yet another toxic drug and  perpetrating this cycle of addiction. Let's keep our unprecedented  bipartisan efforts going in this body. Let's continue to partner with  allies, local government and State governments, and with our  nonprofits. Let's make sure the resources are there to continue to save  lives and restore communities.                                  ______                                         By Mr. GARDNER (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. McSally, and Ms.          Sinema):  [[Page S4174]]    S. 1932.
