 Madam Speaker, climate change is a major threat to our  national security; and military leaders agree.   Last year, the Department of Defense studied 79 mission-critical  bases and found that climate change threatened most of them. In the  past year alone, three of our military installations suffered  significant damage from natural disasters, and they are still not fully  recovered.   It is clear that the scale of this challenge is great. That is why  today I am introducing the Department of Defense Climate Resiliency and  Readiness Act to help tackle this challenge.   By setting clear goals and ensuring regular dedicated resources, my  bill gives military leaders the tools and flexibility to implement  policies that work best for their missions. We will also ensure the DOD  budgets for resiliency and maintains a focus on cutting-edge  technologies like hybrid microgrids and additive manufacturing.   As one of the world's largest energy consumers, DOD can offer  invaluable leadership toward addressing the global climate challenge,  while bolstering U.S. national security; and that starts today.                            ____________________
