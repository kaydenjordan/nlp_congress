 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize John Brewer  and his excellent service as a part of our team. Going into my first  term as Senator, I was proud to be the first Maryland Senator in almost  100 years to serve in the Senate Agriculture Committee. Understanding  the importance of this role, John hit the ground running as our USDA  fellow. With his past experience in both public and private sectors,  John leaned into every project, from advocating on behalf of land grant  universities to funding nutrition programs, with great enthusiasm that  stemmed from his dedication to serve the needs of Marylanders. Besides  his vast expertise, we will miss his kindness and dedication. Although  we wish we didn't have to give him back to the Department of  Agriculture, my whole staff and I know he will continue to achieve  great things.                            ____________________
