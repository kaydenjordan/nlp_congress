 Mr. Speaker, Utahns want and deserve quality healthcare  that they can afford. Now more than ever, our families need a peace of  mind that a preexisting condition or getting laid off from a job won't  cost them their insurance coverage or prevent them from getting  treatment for a sick family member.   That is why I supported the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Enhancement Act today. It strengthens the Affordable Care Act for  individuals, families, children, and helps Utah continue its Medicaid  expansion.   According to the Congressional Budget Office, the legislation would  lower individual healthcare premiums by 10 percent and give an  additional 4 million people coverage. It also lowers prescription drug  prices, like insulin, by allowing negotiations on the price of selected  drugs.   Utahns should not have to ration or forgo lifesaving medication  because they cannot afford their prescriptions. This bill provides  much-needed relief to seniors, individuals, children, and families and  will lead to overall improved health.                            ____________________
