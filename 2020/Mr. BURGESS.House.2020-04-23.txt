 Madam Speaker, of course, we are all observing the  Attending Physician's request that we stay at least 6 feet apart. And I  appreciate the Democratic Speaker's acknowledgment that it is perhaps  better to address the American people without a mask.   Mr. Cole, I also want to extend my sympathies to you. I know your  district suffered greatly last night in the storm, and certainly our  hearts are with our near neighbors in Oklahoma.   So our actions today represent a lost opportunity. I am grateful that  we are going to finally pass legislation that will provide more funding  for our small businesses and for our healthcare providers.   We should have been preparing for the needs of the American people  since the first of this year. Instead, the House considered 15 pieces  of non-crucial legislation and five resolutions that do not now, nor  ever will, have the force of law.   Six months before this crisis started in January, President Trump  signed into law the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, the  product of our health subcommittee, last Congress and this Congress.   But after this fire broke out across the globe, did we do any real- time oversight as to whether or not the bill that we had passed, the  bill that we had labored over, was, in fact, performing as indicated?   The Speaker talked about real-time oversight. We had an opportunity,  but we didn't take it.   The Energy and Commerce Committee held hearings on flavored tobacco,  we looked into horse racing, we looked into ticket scalping. And these  issues have a place in our legislative agenda, but not in the middle of  a pandemic when we should have been doing real-time oversight of a bill  we had signed into law a mere 6 months before.   So as the leader of the Health Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce, I  began calling for action in January. It was not until February 26, as  an add-on to a budget hearing for Health and Human Services where there  was a brief panel assembled, and only 10 Members were allowed to ask  questions of this expert panel on the emerging novel coronavirus.                                time  1045    It was a full 2 weeks later before Congress considered its first  comprehensive bill. During consideration in the Rules Committee, I  requested, because one hadn't been done, a survey of ventilators. We  didn't know how many we had available.   Now, thanks to vital steps taken by the Trump administration, to this  date, no patient has been denied a ventilator that needed one. This is  a testament to the administration's response. It is a testament to the  private sector in this country that responded so well. And it certainly  puts to shame the Democratic majority's response during January and  February.   We are in the middle of working to ensure patient survival and  keeping our economy afloat. Now is not the time to authorize yet  another partisan committee to conduct oversight in a manner that we  know will only be good for the next new cycle.   Early in this crisis, we forewent an opportunity to prepare. Let us  not make the same mistake again. Let us not continue to waste time. Let  us do the work of the American people and get to business as usual. If  we had been better authorizers, less oversight would be necessary.
