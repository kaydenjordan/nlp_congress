 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, sadly, Biden wants  Americans to believe his policies are working, but his borrow, tax, and  spend Bidenomics created a 40-year-high inflation, causing families to  suffer from skyrocketing energy and grocery costs and from discouraging  increases in rent and mortgages.   While Biden says that his hourly wages have increased, the reality is  that prices have risen faster and incomes have actually reduced.   According to the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, using Bureau of  Labor Statistics data, the number of hours worked per week has  declined. This amounts to the average family losing $5,600 in annual  purchasing power.   The Republican House majority is working to correct this, having  recently passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act to rein in government  overreach and limit inflationary spending, creating jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with open Biden borders.
