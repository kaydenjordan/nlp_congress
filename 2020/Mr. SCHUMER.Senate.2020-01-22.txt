 Mr. Leader, let me just add my thanks and gratitude from  all of us. It is rare, particularly these days, when 100 Senators from  both sides of the aisle, of every political persuasion, get up and give  someone a standing ovation, but you deserve it.   Thank you for your good work. We hope you have beautiful and  successful lives.   (Applause, Senators rising.)                            ____________________
