 Madam President, last night, President Biden delivered  his first address to a joint session of Congress, and today marks his  100th day in office.   President Biden is a likeable person. Many of us remember serving  with him in this Chamber. But while the tone of his remarks were  understated, the content was anything but. He talked at length about  competing with China without mentioning that he wants to cut U.S.  defense spending after inflation. Exactly what we cannot do if we want  to keep pace.   He talked about immigration without taking any responsibility for the  border crisis that has his administration packing unaccompanied  children into facilities and releasing arrivals into our country.   And the President talked about unity and togetherness while reading  off a multitrillion-dollar shopping list that was neither designed nor  intended to earn bipartisan buy-in, a blueprint for giving Washington  even more money and even more power to micromanage American families  and build the country liberal elites want instead of the future  Americans want.   Think back to the start of this administration. Remember its day one  priorities: axing a pipeline project that would have supported  thousands of jobs; freezing the exploration behind America's energy  independence; and re-signing the climate agreement that has gotten less  emissions reduction out of China, which is inside the deal, than the  United States achieved on our own, outside the deal.   The approach has remained equally radical since. Even after the CDC's  own experts showed months ago that schools are safe, the  administration's partisan COVID bill threw money at districts without  requiring prompt reopenings.   As a humanitarian crisis mounts at the southern border, the  President's team has offered mixed messaging and ineffectiveness.   While Iran keeps ramping up nuclear rhetoric and financing terror  across the Middle East, this White House keeps downplaying the Iranian  terror. And they appear eager to squander sanctions leverage just to  climb back into a failed deal from back in the Obama era.   And again, as Russia and China fast-track military modernization,  President Biden turned in a defense spending proposal that would put  U.S. forces behind the curve.   That was the backdrop for last night's speech. But instead of  practical plans to fulfill these basic responsibilities, America heard  a lengthy liberal daydream. We heard about the so-called jobs plan  packed with punitive tax hikes at exactly the time our Nation needs a  recovery. Ivy League experts say that it would actually leave American  workers with lower wages at the end of the day.   We heard about the so-called family plan, another gigantic tax-and- spend colossus. Instead of empowering all kinds of families with  flexibility, this one would just subsidize specific paths that  Democrats deem best so Washington can call the shots from early  childhood through college graduation.   But wait. There was more. There was hostility toward the Second  Amendment rights of American citizens. There was support for Democrats'  sweeping election takeover bill that would neuter voter ID in all 50  States--oh--and, by the way, make the Federal Election Commission a  partisan body--oh--and legalize ballot harvesting, where paid political  operatives can show up carrying stacks, stacks of other people's  ballots.   Here is the bottom line. Recall that more than a year ago, at the  outset of the pandemic, a top House Democrat said this crisis provided  the left ``a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our  vision.'' Well, last night, President Biden said much the same: that  his administration intends to turn ``crisis into opportunity.''    The far left certainly gets the message. Some of the most liberal  Members of Congress have gone out of their way to say they are  surprised and delighted--delighted--by the President's willingness to  do things their way.   Even a neutral wire report explained yesterday that the Biden agenda  seeks to ``fundamentally transform and expand government's role in the  lives of everyday Americans.''   Let me say that again. A neutral wire report explained yesterday that  the Biden agenda seeks to ``fundamentally transform and expand  government's role in the lives of everyday Americans.''   It is an attempt to continue dragging a divided country farther and  faster to the left. This administration wants to jack up taxes in order  to nudge families toward the kinds of jobs Democrats want them to have,  in the kinds of industries Democrats want to exist, with the kinds of  cars Democrats want them to drive, using the kinds of childcare  arrangements that Democrats want them to pursue. These plans aren't  about creating options and flexibility for Americans; they are about  imposing a vision.   Instead of encouraging work and rewarding work and helping connect  more Americans with opportunities to work and build their lives, this  administration is working overtime to break the link--the link--between  work and income. They want to break the link between work and income.   Outside observers across the political spectrum agree these Democrats  are unlearning the commonsense, pro-work lessons of bipartisan welfare  reform from back in the nineties.   This isn't what the American people voted for. This country just  elected a 50-50 Senate, a very closely divided House, and a President  who talked a big game about cutting deals, bringing people together,  and building bridges. But even on subjects as historically bipartisan  as pandemic relief, voting rights, and infrastructure, our Democratic  friends have become addicted to divide-and-conquer.   As our distinguished colleague Senator Tim Scott put it last night:         They won't even build bridges . . . to build bridges.    It doesn't have to be this way. Republicans support actually  competing with China. Republicans support actually helping working  families. Republicans support actual infrastructure. Ranking Member  Capito and a number of our leading Republican colleagues have rolled  out a multi-hundred-billion-dollar targeted infrastructure proposal.  Today, in fact, the Senate is set to pass bipartisan legislation to  help States and localities to provide clean and safe drinking water.   Our President will not secure a lasting legacy through go-it-alone  radicalism. He won't get much done that way. It won't be good for the  country. And whatever the Democrats do get done through partisan brute  force will be fragile. The American people need us to find common  ground and to move this country forward, and they would like for us to  do it together.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 189, submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, one family in Southcentral Kentucky  has waited more than 70 years to give their hero a proper tribute. Last  year, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, DPAA, identified the  remains of Navy Seaman 2nd Class Howard ``Scott'' Magers from Barren  County. Over Memorial Day weekend, a grateful nation will honor this  Kentuckian's sacrifice as he finally comes home. I would like to take a  moment today to add my personal gratitude for Scott's service and his  family's sacrifice.   Those who knew Scott remembered a soft-spoken young man with a kind  heart and a winning smile. In January 1941, he enlisted in the Navy at  the age of 17. Like millions of other men and women of the ``greatest  generation,'' Scott put his own ambitions on pause to defend the  country he loved. After completing his training and making one trip  home to Kentucky before his 18th birthday, Scott was stationed aboard  the USS Oklahoma at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.   On that Sunday morning, the Japanese forces rained bombs down on  unsuspecting American sailors. Torpedoes pummeled the Oklahoma, tearing  open her hull and igniting an inferno inside. Within minutes, the  massive ship capsized, and more than 400 of its crew plunged into the  water below.  [[Page S2349]]    In the chaos, more than 2,400 American servicemembers lost their  lives. The tragic events of that morning elicited a forceful response  as the United States entered the Second World War. Over the next 4  years, heroes were forged on the battlefield and at home as our country  defeated the forces of tyranny in defense of the American way of life.   Like thousands of families, the Magers could only wonder and pray  over Scott's fate. Although he would never make it home, he had sent a  telegraph before the bombing to his loved ones in Kentucky. In a  message delivered on Christmas Eve, Scott shared his love and his  holiday cheer. His loved ones held tight to this last compassionate  connection to Scott that reflected his best qualities.   In the following years, the Navy attempted to identify the remains of  those killed on the Oklahoma. Unfortunately, the vast majority couldn't  be accounted for and were buried together in 46 plots at the National  Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, also known as the Punchbowl.   In 2015, the DPAA exhumed the USS Oklahoma Unknowns. Using DNA as  dental, and other identifying records, they were finally able to  identify Scott's remains and give his family the opportunity for proper  burial in Kentucky.   Over 1,300 Kentucky servicemembers remain unaccounted for by the  DPAA. We have never forgotten these patriots, and we will continue  searching to bring them home. I am grateful for the ongoing efforts of  the DPAA to bring closure to more families like this one.   On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I would like to send our sincere  condolences to Scott's family and express our thanks for his brave  service to our Nation. We are proud this Kentucky hero will receive the  honor he earned.                            ____________________
