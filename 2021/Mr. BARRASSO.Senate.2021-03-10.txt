 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to oppose  President Biden's Executive orders on immigration.   Now, there are more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the country  today. This is a group equivalent to the population of the entire State  of Georgia, and this number has nearly tripled in the last 30 years. In  fact, some experts say the number is a lot higher than that. Folks at  Yale and MIT and the researchers there said it could actually be twice  as high; it could be 22 million people in the country illegally. Well,  that is more than the population of the entire State of New York.   So it appears to me that illegal immigration is making a mockery of  our borders. Yet President Biden and this administration refuse to  admit, even as of this morning, that there is a crisis at the southern  border.   Now, if you talk to law enforcement all across the country, they will  tell you that many of the problems that they face every day are  problems related to our open southern border. The Drug Enforcement  Administration has said for nearly a decade now that the vast majority  of illegal drugs in America come here across the southern border.   Now, I am a doctor. I will tell you, these drugs have killed  thousands of Americans. They kill thousands of Americans every year.  They tear families apart. They lead to heartbreaking stories. They rob  people of their God-given potential.   Our law enforcement, our Coast Guard, our border agents, they do  heroic work every day to intercept drugs, to stop human trafficking.  They can't do it alone. They need the support of the U.S. Senate.   Well, during the debate last week over the spending bill, we had a  chance to give them support. Senator Cruz introduced an amendment to  prevent checks from going to illegal immigrants. Democrats blocked it.  Senator Cotton introduced an amendment to cut the bailout funding to  sanctuary cities. Well, these are cities that actively try to prevent  Federal agents--actively try to prevent Federal agents from enforcing  our immigration laws. Democrats blocked the amendment.   So no wonder we have a crisis at the border. Democrats seem to be  advertising to the entire world: Come here now. If you come here  illegally, you can get a check, possibly.   If you are an immigration enforcement officer, Democrats seem to  block them from doing their own job. President Biden has already issued  at least seven Executive orders on immigration. In just over a month in  office, President Biden has already proven to be the most open-border  President in U.S. history.   Now we face an entirely predictable crisis at the border. That crisis  rests squarely at President Biden's feet. On his first day in office,  President Biden shut down construction of the southern border wall. By  the time the day was over, President Biden stopped all deportations for  a hundred days. It didn't matter to President Biden what you were going  to be deported for. No. Now, maybe you are a serious criminal.  President Biden says: You can stay longer. A court has already stepped  in and said this is illegal, this Executive order.   President Biden has, astonishingly, brought back the idea of catch- and-release--catch-and-release. He has ordered our immigration agents  to release illegal immigrants into the United States, and he is doing  it in the middle of a pandemic. Senator Cotton and I sent a letter to  the President raising this concern. It is now harder to go to church in  some parts of America than it is to cross the border into America.   Under President Trump, if you wanted to apply for asylum in this  country, you had to remain in Mexico. That was the policy. The policy  of ``Remain in Mexico'' was based on the standards of international  law. To get asylum, you have to show that you can't live safely in your  home country because of persecution--understandable. Yet the fact is  that most illegal immigrants don't come here because of persecution.  They come here for economic reasons. They want a better job. They want  better schools for their kids. They are understandable motives;  nonetheless, they are not standards for asylum.    Now, another requirement for asylum is that you have to go to the  nearest safe country and seek asylum. You don't get to pick anywhere  you want to go in the world. You have to go to the nearest safe  country. Yet people around the world know that our asylum system here  in the United States has become a sham. It is no secret that it is easy  to game the system, and it is being gamed regularly in the Biden  administration.   So they often stop in at least one other safe country, and they apply  for asylum here. President Biden now says: You don't have to wait in  Mexico. Cross the border. We will give you a court date years from now,  years from now, and after they give you the court date, they release  you into the United States. Even those who know they don't qualify and  will not qualify for asylum, they come anyway because they know they  get released into the United States. It happens all the time.   Just before the new administration took over, the Department of  Homeland Security published a report about this. According to the  Department, our border agents apprehended 3.5 million illegal  immigrants along the southern border between 2014 and 2019. Only 8  percent of them--only 8 percent, 1 out of 12--ended up receiving legal  protection from being deported, but the Department says half of them  are still here in the United States. How does that happen? They didn't  show up.   President Biden has also started an unprecedented expansion of the  refugee program. The most refugees that this country has ever resettled  in a single  [[Page S1441]]  year was 85,000 in President Obama's final year in office. President  Biden wants to break the record. He wants to increase it to 125,000. It  will be the most, by far.   President Biden has told his administration to bring back the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, also known as DACA. Now, this  is a program for people who were brought here illegally while they were  children. It is not the children's fault. Yet DACA is illegal, plain  and simple.   President Obama has admitted it. Liberal activists asked him to do  it. At least 10 different times President Obama said: No, I can't do  it. It is illegal. Then an election year came. He decided to do it  anyway.   As you and I know, we are a nation of compassionate people. We are  giving. We are generous. We have the most generous immigration system  in the world. The issue before us is one that should be handled by  Congress, not by Executive order--not through an illegal Executive  order, and DACA is still illegal. I expect a court will ultimately  strike it down.   So this is some of what President Biden has done by Executive order.  At the same time, he is trying to cram an even more radical agenda  through Congress. Last month, President Biden's immigration bill was  introduced in the Senate. It already has the support of 26 cosponsors  on the Democratic side of the aisle. It includes the majority leader,  Senator Schumer.   Well, this bill will give illegal immigrants not just amnesty,  citizenship--citizenship. Democrats in Washington tried that in 2007,  the year I arrived in the Senate. The American people picked up the  phone. They actually shut down the phone lines, shut down the  switchboards here in the U.S. Senate. They were all calling in to say  no.   Democrats in Washington tried it again in 2013. The American people  picked up the phone again. The American people said no. And we said no  in the Senate. We said no in 2007, no in 2013. The American people are  going to say no again in 2021.   Now, President Biden has issued, signed a lot of Executive orders;  many of them, the ones I talked about with people at home this weekend  in Wyoming, very unpopular. Polls show his immigration order is the  most unpopular of them all.   President Biden should keep in mind that it was a very close election  in November. We have a 50-50 Senate, very narrow margins in the House.  The American people, for the first time, are finding out just how  liberal Joe Biden is. Many of them are already having buyer's remorse.  They didn't believe he would be this radical and his actions would be  this scary.   President Biden needs to listen to the American people. The American  people don't want a radical, extreme, dangerous, scary agenda. We want  safe communities. We want laws obeyed. We want a secure border. It is  time to stand up to this radical agenda.   Our immigration system is broken. Instead of breaking it further, we  should work together to fix it. Let's protect our communities, protect  our American workers, and secure our southern border.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to submit for the Record a  letter sent to the U.S. Senate from Cathy and Bill Schreiber of Wilson,  WY.   I recently had the opportunity to visit with Bill. He shared with me  his optimism for the future of our Nation and his belief that the  ``worst of the pandemic is behind us.''   In their letter, Cathy and Bill expressed support for helping those  most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Like many people, they felt  assistance should be targeted to only those individuals truly impacted  by the pandemic. They offered sincere, honest options to make sure the  relief got in the hands of those who need it, while limiting the  financial strains additional debt spending will create for our Nation.   Cathy and Bill asked that I share their letter with the Senate. It  expresses their confidence in the future and their compassion for  others who continue to be adversely impacted by the current pandemic. I  ask unanimous consent that their letter be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      March 3, 2021.      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators: I want to start by thanking you all for the       hard work you have all performed over the last year dealing       with the COVID 19 pandemic. The economic relief and stimulus       bills that you have pass starting last March have made all       the difference in the world! Without this support from the       federal government I believe the country would have descended       into the greatest depression the country has ever       experienced. And that would negatively effect the world       economy.        As indicated by the amazing rebound in the stock market, it       is clear that the current economic slow down is a health       problem, not a systemic economic problem. I live and work in       a small resort in northwest Wyoming and our community was hit       very hard early last year. But now the economy is strong       again and the unemployment rate is less than 4%! That means       over 90% of the workforce is working. With the number of       vaccines being administered now close to two million doses a       day and vaccine availability ramping up very quickly, I       believe the worst of the pandemic is behind us.        So now it is time to focus on the people who got hit hard       by COVID. And there are millions. I see that the Senate is       reducing the income eligibility for stimulus checks and I       believe that is a good thing. I hope it can focus the $1,400       payments to an even higher degree to the people that need       them. This will help the bill be more bipartisan which will       set the tone for future legislation! This is SO important       right now.        It appears to me that my wife and I will qualify for the       full $2,800 stimulus check based on our income from 2019. But       we would not qualify based on our 2020 income. We do not need       the stimulus check. The check we received last spring we gave       to people we knew who had lost their jobs. We will do the       same thing again if we do receive a check, but we would much       rather see less money borrowed by the U.S. government than       giving money to the millions of workers that have not been       financially effected by the pandemic. I would like you all to       compromise a little and consider the following.        Treat the stimulus checks received in 2021 as ordinary       income. This way folks that have made great financial gains       over the last year will give some back to the U.S. treasury.        Restrict who gets checks based on net worth. Pick a number.       I understand this is difficult to determine but it can be       done.        Have state and local governments provide revenue statements       for the last 24 months to see which ones really needs help.       The county I live in does not need any financial help in my       opinion. A 5% reduction in revenue is not the end of the       world. It is even heathy in my opinion.        Keep some extra ``gunpowder'' for some more future support       for the unemployed for later this year and 2022.        Start to discuss how the government is going to pay this       money back. These trillion-dollar sums become meaningless       after a while. If the taxpayers of this county were to pay 10       million dollars a day towards this new debt, it would take       530 years to pay it off! And that amount does not even       account for any interest.        And last, please remove funding for special projects and       put them in a separate piece of legislation.        I know that fundamentally all Senators basically want the       same near-term result. The pandemic to be behind us and that       all Americans who have been hit hard by it be helped through       the next year or two. I believe the economy is going to come       roaring back very soon. It will be different but strong.        I thank you for your time.            Sincerely,                                          Cathy and Bill Schreiber,                                                   Wilson, Wyoming.         P.S. Please reduce the proposed stimulus bill by $2,800 on       our behalf.                            ____________________
