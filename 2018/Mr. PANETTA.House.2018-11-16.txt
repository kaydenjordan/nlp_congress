 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank Monterey  County District Attorney Dean Flippo. At the end of this year, Dean  will retire after 40 years of service to our home on the central coast  of California. DA Flippo is the longest-serving DA in Monterey County  history, and the longest current serving DA in California.   During his tenure, he presided over pivotal cases. He fought the rise  and he led the fall of our gang problem in our community. He enforced  environmental policy. He established the consumer fraud unit. He  created an early intervention anti-truancy program to keep kids in  school and off the streets by getting their families involved. And he  was a master at keeping a balanced budget.   I will always be grateful to Dean for giving me a chance and a job as  a prosecutor when I moved back home to Monterey County. During that  time, I was able to learn from him as I served under him. Now I count  myself lucky to have continued to work with him over these last 2 years  on criminal justice issues.   I hope Dean enjoys his retirement watching PG High School football  games, except when they are playing Carmel High, of course.   As we know, Dean leaves big shoes to fill, but he has left a long  legacy of public service and safety in our community.   We honor him. We congratulate him. And I thank Dean Flippo for his  service.                            ____________________
