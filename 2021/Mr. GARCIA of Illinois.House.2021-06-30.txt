 Mr. Speaker, I commend both Chairman Pallone  and Chairman DeFazio for their excellent work on moving forward the  INVEST in America Act and clean water work as well.   I fought hard to advance equitable transit oriented development,  create a National Frontline Transit Workforce Development Center, and  ensure that our transportation system is focused on providing access to  jobs and services for those who need it.   As we move forward toward a reconciliation package, I will keep  fighting for robust investments to reduce carbon emissions and air  pollution from transportation; expand mass transit and biking and  walking options; and electrify every public transit bus, school bus,  and commuter railroad in this country.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot wait any more for bold action. The climate  crisis certainly won't wait.
