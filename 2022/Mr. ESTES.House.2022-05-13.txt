 Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of the  Fourth District of Kansas to pay tribute to Ralene Bergquist as she  retires after 10 years of service in our congressional district.   Ralene has been faithfully serving the people of Kansas' Fourth  District for 10 years. She began with my predecessor, Congressman Mike  Pompeo, before he went to be the CIA Director.   Ralene was very familiar and a constant voice to help make sure that  we had a smooth transition when I became a new Member of Congress for  the Fourth District.   Ralene's dedication and work have been very much appreciated and a  [[Page H4925]]  great service to two Members of Congress, as well as the constituents  of Kansas' Fourth Congressional District.   I speak for myself and the entire D.C. and district staff when I say  we will miss Ralene as she retires from congressional service.   We are excited to see what the future holds for Ralene and wish her  many blessings as she enjoys more time with her husband, Kansas State  Representative Emil Bergquist, their children, and their grandchildren.   Congratulations on a wonderful career, and thank you from a grateful  district.                            ____________________
