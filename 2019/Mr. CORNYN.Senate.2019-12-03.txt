 Madam President, I rise to join my colleagues today in  celebrating the distinguished career of our friend, Johnny Isakson. It  is a great moment for all of us to talk about our shared aspirations as  representatives of the American people, to recognize the role that we  play--that all Americans play--in supporting our country, and to  celebrate some of our successes. We have heard a lot about Senator  Isakson's successes as a legislator and maybe to shrug off a few of our  failures, but reaffirm our determination to make self-government work.   The senior Senator from Georgia did not set out to build a long,  storied career in politics, I am told, or even to enter public service  at all, for that matter. After graduating from the University of  Georgia, he began a 40-year career in real estate. He opened a branch  of Northside Realty and would later spend more than 20 years as that  company's president.  [[Page S6813]]    Johnny's career in public service began in a unique way. It was by  winning an election that he never entered. He made the mistake of not  showing up at a meeting where he was selected as a member of a new  commission, as new commission president, with the host of zoning issues  that riddled the community, so that was Johnny's first election, as the  new commission president of the zoning commission.   Of course, in that position, you could imagine he listened to his  neighbors' concerns, and he would work with the commission to make  improvements, but the truth is, from that point onward, Johnny was  hooked. He went on to serve in the State house, the State senate, the  U.S. House, and finally in the U.S. Senate, as the first and only  Georgian to hold all four titles.   As we have heard--but it bears repeating--at each step, he never lost  sight of his most important responsibility: to listen to his  constituents and to work every day to make their lives just a little  better.   Here in the Senate, I have had the privilege, as we all have had, of  working with Johnny on a number of bills to empower our military,  strengthen American agriculture, and improve our Nation's healthcare,  but I believe his lasting legacy, the thing that perhaps is the most  important to my mind that he should be very proud of--and I know he  is--is our collective work together to support our Nation's veterans.   Johnny is a veteran himself, and he didn't take the position as  chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee lightly. He never stopped  listening to America's veterans or fighting to ensure they have the  services and the support they have earned.   One of the seminal pieces of legislation that we passed thanks to  Johnny's leadership was the VA MISSION Act, which made significant  reforms to the Department of Veterans Affairs and strengthened  healthcare options for all veterans. This was not an easy piece of  legislation to move through the legislative process, which, as we all  know, under the Constitution and under the way Congress works,  essentially, the system is dead set to defeat you, and you have to find  a way to navigate it in a way to get things done, which is hard work.  But at every step, Johnny helped guide this legislation from a bill  that looked good on paper to a law that has made a real difference in  the lives of our veterans. He did what he does best; that is, listened,  learned, negotiated, and built consensus between people who had very  different views of what that law should look like. In the end, it was  because of his hard work and dedication that it passed and was signed  into law.   As great as his legislative impact has been, his personal impact on  all of us has been immeasurable. During the time I served as the  Republican whip, I had a chance to work with him most often and saw how  this soft-spoken master operated.   Two years ago, we were working on tax reform, and I remember one  crucial meeting at a luncheon conference we had. We wanted to make sure  everybody was on the same page because we knew that failure was not an  option. Our Members heard from colleagues who were subject-matter  experts, who had been working on tax reform, but I think the most  encouraging words we heard came from Johnny Isakson.   It reminds me of that old movie that Ronald Reagan was in where the  coach, Knute Rockne, talked about an ailing player, George Gipp. He  talked about winning one for the Gipper. Well, Johnny told us to win  one for the Gipper that day, and we all left excited, inspired, and  eager to accomplish our goals.   That meeting showed a lot about who Johnny Isakson is. He is rarely  the loudest voice in the room, but when he speaks, people listen. He  isn't the type to pat himself on the back. He isn't afraid to work  behind the scenes or let his work go unnoticed in the press, and he  cares about getting results and results alone. He doesn't care who gets  the credit.   I believe the reason Johnny Isakson has been able to accomplish so  much here in the Senate--and he has--is because of his focus on  building relationships. In fact, as we have heard, you would be hard- pressed to find somebody more well-liked or well-respected by folks on  both sides of the aisle.   I think Johnny summed it up himself pretty well recently when he  said:         It's about relationships. It's about respect. It's about       motivation, and it's about getting things done. So make       friends. Be a friend, and know how to be a friend. It makes       all the difference in the world. I am sure that is true in       life in general, but it is certainly true in the U.S. Senate.    That is how our friend Johnny Isakson has gained the respect of every  Senator in this Chamber. He is a straight shooter, a man of great  integrity, and an honest broker. He is not just a nice guy by  Washington, DC, standards; he is a nice guy by any standard.   I know our friend from Georgia is sad, perhaps, to leave this  Chamber, and we are equally sad to bid him farewell. The Halls of  Congress will not be the same without Johnny Isakson.   I will personally miss those Wednesday mornings together at the  Senate Prayer Breakfast and catching up with my friend here on the  Senate floor. I know we will all miss his great example--this humble  man of great integrity, who has taught us all how to work together.   When another Georgia colleague, Saxby Chambliss, retired 5 years ago,  Senator Isakson said Saxby would join Richard Russell, Zell Miller, and  Sam Nunn and become the fourth face on the Mount Rushmore of Georgia  Senators. Well, Johnny, I think they are going to have to make room for  a fifth.   I thank our good friend Johnny Isakson for his dedicated service to  his State, to our country, and to this institution. I join all of our  colleagues in wishing him well, along with his wife, Dianne, their  three children, and their eight grandchildren. We wish him all the best  as he retires to his beloved Georgia.
