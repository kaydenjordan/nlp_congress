 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last month I spoke here about an amazing  story I was told when I had the opportunity to host several veterans  who survived the sinking of the USS Arizona during the attack on Pearl  Harbor. They recalled to me the incredible story of a true American  hero named Joe George, and I would like to briefly remind everyone of  that story now.   On December 7, 1941, Joe was a 26-year-old boatswain's mate second  class aboard the repair ship USS Vestal in Pearl Harbor, HI. That  morning, the Vestal was moored alongside the USS Arizona.   At 7:48 a.m., many sailors, including Joe, had just finished their  breakfast when the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service attacked Pearl  Harbor.   As we know, the Arizona suffered a direct hit by a Japanese bomb that  detonated in the ship's powder magazine. The resulting explosion sank  the ship and claimed the lives of 1,177 servicemen.   During this unimaginable chaos and carnage, Joe George displayed  stunning composure and courage. Joe spotted six sailors trapped in the  control tower of the sinking USS Arizona. These men were severely  burned and were searching for a way to safety.   Those six wounded sailors were Seaman First Class Harold Kuhn, Seaman  First Class Russell Lott, Gunner's Mate Third Class Earl Riner,  Boatswain's Mate Second Class Alvin Dvork, Seaman First Class Donald  Stratton, and Fire Controlman Third Class Lauren Bruner.   Upon seeing these men, Joe threw a heaving line between the Vestal  and the Arizona to rescue the wounded soldiers from the sinking ship.  Suspended 40 feet in the air, the six sailors climbed 70 feet hand- over-hand across the rope to safety on board the Vestal. These sailors  did all this while enduring injuries so severe that two would succumb  to their wounds in the weeks following the attack. As they struggled  across the heavy line, Joe George remained close by, all the while  encouraging the men to push on.   The four soldiers who survived their injuries each returned to serve  with honor during World War II, and then went on to live long lives.  Joe George's legacy of heroism will remain alive forever in the  children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the four sailors  who survived that infamous day thanks to Joe George's incredible  bravery and service.   Joe George was never awarded a medal for his role in the rescue of  these six sailors, although his commanding officer commended his  courageous actions.   When I met one of the Arizona survivors who was rescued by Joe, he  told me:         Joe George was never awarded anything for his bravery. He       is no longer with us, but I believe in his memory he should       be awarded the Navy Cross.    Lauren Bruner was another survivor Joe saved. He said to me:         The six of us would not have survived except for his       courage, in spite of being at high risk himself. He fully       deserves high commendations for his actions. I feel he should       be recognized for this courage and presented the Navy Cross.    In his own words during an interview in 1978, Joe said:         I'll tell you, the only thing I could tell you about that       day. . . . My conscience was my guide.    Well, his conscience was that of a hero. We need more people like Joe  George in this world.   That is why today I am committed to honoring Joe and why I rise today  with the honor and privilege to call for unanimous consent in the  adoption of a resolution honoring Joseph Leon George.   Joe passed away in 1996, and it is long overdue that the Senate, the  U.S. Navy, and a grateful nation honor the heroism of Boatswain's Mate  Second Class Joseph Leon George.   God bless Joe George, whose immense courage and astounding composure  serves as an example for the men and women in uniform who follow in his  wake. Let us never forget their heroism and sacrifice.   I would like to thank my colleagues Senators Gardner, Lee, Cotton,  McCaskill, and Bennet for joining me in this resolution and for helping  to ensure its adoption here today.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Armed Services  Committee be discharged from further consideration of and the Senate  now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 243.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The clerk will report the resolution by title.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         A resolution (S. Res. 243) expressing the sense of the       Senate that Joseph Leon George should be honored for heroism       at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941.    There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolution.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution  be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.
