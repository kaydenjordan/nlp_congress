 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of my dear friend and Lubbock legend, E.J. Holub, who passed  away Saturday.   E.J. was the pride of Lubbock High School and one of the best Texas  Tech football players of all time. Some referred to E.J. as ``The  Beast,'' and I called him ``Uncle E.J.'' because he was one of my dad's  best friends at Texas Tech and a lifelong member of the Arrington  family.   E.J. was larger than life on and off the field. His stature and  strength on the gridiron was only rivaled by the size of his heart for  people.   E.J. was a true gentleman and a real cowboy. He loved his family, his  horses, and all things Texas Tech. He is leaving behind a tremendous  legacy for west Texas.   To Sandi and E.J.'s girls: Please know that we love you and are  praying for you.   To Red Raider Nation: Take off your hats, get your guns up, and join  me in paying tribute to our favorite fearless champion and Herculean  hero, E.J. ``The Beast'' Holub.   I love you, Uncle E.J.                            ____________________
