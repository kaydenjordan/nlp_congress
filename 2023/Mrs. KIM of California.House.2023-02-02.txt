 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.  Con. Res. 9 to denounce the atrocities perpetuated by socialism around  the world.   If you want to see the difference between socialism and freedom, take  a look at North Korea at night versus South Korea. As an immigrant who  grew up in South Korea during the aftermath of the Korean war, I know  firsthand the horror, the destruction that socialism has brought to  millions of families in the Korean Peninsula under the evil regime of  the Kim dynasty, from Kim Il-sung to Kim Jong-il to now Kim Jong-Un.   Socialism divided my family and friends between North and South. My  mother-in-law, for example, crossed over the DMZ and back multiple  times to rescue loved ones from the tyrannical North Korean regime.  Tens of thousands of war-torn families remain separated to this day.  Meanwhile, famines and the daily threats of a nuclear war in east Asia  persist.   Although I was just a young girl, I remember the hope embodied by  those brave soldiers who defended the freedoms of a country they never  knew and a people they never met. It is because of them that I stand  before you today as one of the first Korean-American women to serve in  Congress.   The United States must continue to stand as a beacon of freedom,  hope, and opportunity for the world. I urge my colleagues from both  sides of the aisle to join us to say ``no'' to socialism.
