 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  Banks amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   Congress has a long history in supporting the Clean Water Act. In  1972, Congress overrode President Nixon's veto of the Clean Water Act,  demonstrating bipartisan support for the Federal regulation of our  Nation's water. The measure was very clear: human health would no  longer take a backseat to big business.   Now, more than 45 years later, we are again voting to overturn the  Clean Water Protection rule, a rule that, for the first time in over a  decade, provides clarity for regulated parties and protection for our  Nation's rivers and waters.   What message are we sending today? Clearly, we are telling the  American people that what water they have left isn't worth protecting.   Mr. Chairman, when developing the Clean Water Protection rule, the  EPA and Army Corps of Engineers went to unprecedented lengths to engage  with stakeholders, including ranchers, farmers, and municipalities.  They held over 400 stakeholder meetings on the rule and reviewed  approximately 1 million public comments to the rule.   It is evident that EPA and the Corps wholeheartedly considered these  comments and concerns because many of the Clean Water rule's reforms  benefit industry, agriculture, and municipalities. These reforms  include limiting permits for ditches and municipal storm water sewers,  and codified exemptions for certain agricultural, construction, and  mining activities.   Let us not forget that the farmers and developers, alike, call the  Clean Water Act's current regulatory process ``ad hoc,''  ``inconsistent,'' and ``costly.''   The rule we are attempting to overturn would keep the old, confusing  regulations in place permanently. The same groups that asked for this  rule and actually benefited from the rule are now asking us to do away  with the rule.   The only thing I can surmise is that those who oppose the rule would  oppose any rulemaking that did not drastically limit the application of  the Clean Water Act; or, said in another way, these groups are simply  opposed to the Clean Water Act entirely.                                time  1045    In my State of California, 99.2 percent of the population gets its  water from the drinking water systems that rely on water bodies  protected by this rule. With numbers like that on the line, intervening  now is simply reckless.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Peterson).    Mr. Chairman, I just think that, again, we are  saying anything Obama did is wrong. I want to continue protecting the  waters of the United States for the American people.   Mr. Chair, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.
