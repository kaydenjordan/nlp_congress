 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I first want to thank Chairman Smith and the members of  the Armed Services Committee for the work they have put into developing  this product over the course of the year. We have a number of new  members on the committee, and I continue to be impressed with the  seriousness with which they take their task, with the different  insights based on their background and perspective. It has been very  helpful.   I also want to thank the staff. As you can tell, Mr. Chairman, from  the size of the bill, as well as the number of amendments filed  throughout the process, it is a big job, and a limited number of staff  have worked very hard to get us to this point.   I think maybe it is helpful to just step back for a second and talk  about what this bill is about.   The Preamble of the Constitution says that one of the reasons we have  a government is to provide for the common defense, but Article I,  Section 8 goes into specifics by putting the responsibility on  Congress' shoulders to raise and support, provide and maintain the  military forces for the United States.   How well we do or do not do that job that the Constitution puts on us  has real consequences. Literally, the life and death of the men and  women who serve are at stake, as well as the security, the safety, and  the well-being of men and women throughout the country. It is a  significant responsibility, and, again, the Constitution says it is  ours.   Now, as the chairman noted, for 58 straight years, one of the ways we  have fulfilled that responsibility under the Constitution has been to  pass, and a President of both parties has signed, a National Defense  Authorization Act. Fifty-eight straight years that has occurred. And  most of that time, at least certainly in my experience over the last 25  years, it has been done on a bipartisan basis.   For example, in last year's bill, the committee reported the bill  favorably by a vote of 60-1. The year before, it was 60-1. The year  before that, it was 60-2. The year before that, it was 60-2. Last year,  on final passage, the vote on this floor was 351-66. The year before  that, it was 344-81.   I could go on, but the point is, that there has been strong  bipartisan support in fulfilling that essential responsibility under  the Constitution.   As you know, Mr. Chairman, this year is different. This year, the  bill was reported out of committee by a vote of 33-24, and the reasons  were serious, substantive disagreements with provisions that were in  the bill.   As the chairman, himself, said in, I believe, 2016: ``There is  nothing shameful about making a legitimate policy choice to oppose the  NDAA or any other bill. . . . Regardless of whether we support the NDAA  or not, we all support the brave men and women of our military who  defend the country.''   I think the chairman was right then, and I think the statement is  still true today.   When the bill came out of committee, some of us had a hard time  deciding whether to support it or not because there are many good  elements in this bill. And it is absolutely true that, from the ground  up, a number of Republicans, as well as Democrats, have worked together  to contribute to this bill. My view was that there were some  adjustments that could be made that would enable most Members to  support it.   Unfortunately, what has happened, as the bill now has come out of the  Rules Committee, is, in my view, at least, unprecedented.   First, the rule self-executes an amendment that has a number of  serious issues. Now, a lot of them have serious support, but shouldn't  they be on the floor so that we can talk about them, perhaps discuss  offsets on some very challenging issues that we have grappled with over  the years?   But then when it comes to other amendments, I believe that of the 439  made in order, 340 of them are Democratic-sponsored, 98 are Republican.  That is not the way it has been before.   Last year, more Democratic amendments were made in order on the floor  than Republican amendments. The year before, it was just about exactly  even. So we see the bill drifting in a particular direction.   Most concerning, I think, in many respects, is, of the contested  amendments--in other words, of those amendments about which there is a  difference and there will be a debate and probably a vote--63 of them  are sponsored by Democrats.                                time  1715    I believe there is just one sponsored by Republicans, Mr. Turner's on  low yield. I don't believe there is another contested amendment that  the rule has made in order.   Now, the problem with that, Mr. Chairman, is there is virtually no  opportunity to improve the bill.   I think Chairman Smith made a very important point in the Rules  Committee yesterday. He said it is with this bipartisan input and  support, every step in the process that results in a better bill. And I  think we have proven that time and time again.   Unfortunately, that is not what we are seeing today.   We have made a lot of progress in the last 2 years. As most Members  know, starting in 2011, defense spending was cut in real terms about 20  percent. Both Republicans and Democrats share responsibility for that,  by the way. And both Democrats and Republicans share responsibility for  making up about half of that amount in the last 2 years, but we haven't  finished the job.   As a matter of fact, a study in the Military Times earlier this year  found that military aviation accidents have increased 40 percent over  the past 5 years, but military aviation accident deaths hit a 6-year  high in 2018.   The point is, we made a good start at fixing our problems, but we  have not finished the job. And that is part of the reason that some of  us are so concerned about cutting the administration's request by $17  billion, to fail to keep that momentum on fixing our readiness, on  modernization, on research in key areas, all of the different  categories in making sure that we continue to improve the situation for  our troops.   Mr. Chairman, there are a lot of good things in this bill, but they  can't seem  [[Page H5343]]  to overcome the ways in which this bill takes steps backwards.   I don't know. There are lots of things we could talk about. The  bottom line, however, is there is only one thing that matters: does  this bill adequately support our troops and American national security?  There is really nothing else, no other criteria, that matters the way  that that fundamental question does.   I am concerned that this bill does not meet that standard. I know a  number of my colleagues are concerned about that as well.   We have hopes that at some point in the process, the bill will  actually come closer to adequately supporting our troops and American  national security, but it is not there yet. And I have concerns, given  what the Rules Committee has done, that it will be hard to do so on  this floor.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner).    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), a general new to the committee,  but not new to national security.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DesJarlais).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the remarks of the majority leader. I know  from some personal experience it is certainly not easy to hold your  side of the aisle and the other side of the aisle together to have the  sort of votes like we had--351, 349, and so forth--to pass this bill.   That is part of the reason I began my remarks by pointing out this is  different. I am not sure that great Democrats of the past--Roosevelt,  Truman, and Kennedy--would recognize this defense bill that is before  us, much less the amendments that we see coming down the pike.   I just want to emphasize two points, briefly:   One, is we have lots of quotes being thrown around here about what  General Dunford has said or what he has not said. I don't have his  words from a transcript, but what I do have is Defense News, June 13,  2017, where he says, directly: ``We now know that continued growth in  the base budget of at least 3 percent above inflation is the floor  necessary to preserve just the competitive advantage we have today, and  we can't assume our adversaries will remain still.''   Consistent testimony from Dunford, Mattis, Shanahan, et cetera, is  that the floor is 3 percent, and I think statements to the contrary do  not reflect his view.   Secondly, the majority leader said something like: Loyalty to the  President over loyalty to our troops.   I want to quote back Chairman Smith's comments that I mentioned  earlier, and expand a bit.   Chairman Smith said, when he voted against the bill on the floor:  ``There is nothing shameful about making a legitimate policy choice to  oppose the NDAA or any other bill. But it is hypocritical and the  height of shameless partisan pandering for him''--and he was referring  to Speaker Boehner--``to now claim that a vote against the NDAA is a  vote against the troops. It is not. Regardless of whether you support  the NDAA or not, we all support the brave men and women of the military  who defend this country.''   I think this side of the aisle, we have nothing to apologize for in  our support of the troops and American national security. We want a  better product, and I hope that at some point we will get it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Waltz).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire of the chairman if he has  only one more speaker remaining.  [[Page H5351]]         Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I would simply emphasize, as the gentleman from Florida just did, the  strong desire of Members on this side of the aisle is to continue to  work constructively with anyone who wants to work with us to help  improve this bill so that it strengthens America's national security  and does not take steps backwards in any critical area.   As was pointed out earlier, the body across the Capitol was able to  do that with a very strong vote of 86-8 just 2 weeks ago. I think that  ought to be our model. I think that this bill, if it moves in that  direction, will gain the support of a number of Members here.   But it is the real substantive concerns about what is in this bill,  as well as the lack of the ability to have amendments to improve the  bill, that has so many Members on this side of the aisle concerned.   Back to my original point: None of this to-ing and fro-ing matters.  What matters is does it support our troops and improve America's  national security. We may have different judgments, but that is the  only criteria that matters. It is about them, and it is about the  country, and that will continue to be our guiding standard.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Chair, I have no further requests on this en bloc  package.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I  am not completely sure I am opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Chairman, I only have myself to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I would simply say my view is that, if a servicemember  is qualified and can do the job without some sort of special  accommodation, then we ought to take advantage of that member's  service.   I note that Secretary Mattis has testified: ``It is a bedrock  principle of the Department of Defense that any eligible individual who  can meet the high standards for military service without special  accommodations should be permitted to serve.''   That is what I believe. I have read the gentlewoman's amendment. It  is not clear to me that her amendment is in violation of that statement  or my belief.   I heard and listened clearly to the concerns Mrs. Hartzler stated, so  maybe we need to continue, as we move forward, to look at whether there  are other consequences to the language. But it seems to me the standard  that Secretary Mattis has set out--if you can do the job, you ought to  be able to do the job--that is the right one.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, this is the third year in a row, I believe, we have had  this attempt to require DOD to only buy knives and forks and spoons  from a certain supplier.   I opposed it when it was brought by a Republican and I oppose it when  it is brought this year as well.   In all 3 years, I have yet to hear a national security justification  to dictate where DOD buys its knives and forks and spoons and plates. I  have not heard it yet.   At one point, there was a view that certain textiles and food were of  such importance to the functioning of our military, that there needed  to be restrictions on where they were procured. Again, I have not heard  that when it comes to knives and forks.   I will say that adding this mandate will hurt our troops, because the  only situation in which DOD would choose other than a domestic supplier  would be if it saves money if you can buy knives and forks and spoons  cheaper from some other supplier. So that means you are taking away  money from ammunition or whatever it is and spending more than you  would otherwise need to spend on your plates and knives and forks. I  can't tell you how much, probably not a lot, but it takes away money  for other vital programs.   The big question I have, Madam Chair, is where does this stop? I  admire  [[Page H5550]]  all Members who try to support manufacturing in his or her district.  That is part of our job as Members of Congress. Got it.   But if we are going to say, ``Okay. The DOD has got to buy their  plates and cups and knives and forks and spoons from a domestic  supplier in my district,'' what about the napkins? What about the soap  to wash your hands? Where does it stop?   I don't think that we want to go down this road without a clear  national security reason to limit the suppliers available to DOD.   Computer chips, that is one thing, but knives and forks, that is  something else.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time to  close.    Madam Chair, creating domestic jobs in industry after  industry is not the primary purpose of the Department of Defense,  especially without a national security reason to do so.   What this amendment would do, if it does anything, is to add another  category of bureaucracy and burdens that the Department of Defense has  got to go through before it decides where it is going to procure its  plates and spoons.   This has not been the law since 2006. I think our military folks have  been reasonably well fed in the 13 years since this was last part of  the law.   Again, the only reason to do it is if the domestic supplier is not  cheaper. So it costs money, if it does anything.   Madam Chair, there are lots of important national security issues.  Mandating where the Department of Defense gets its plates and spoons  and cups and bowls and however else you want to define dinnerware, I do  not think, is appropriate, and I urge opposition to the amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chairwoman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Chairwoman, I would say the first part of the  gentleman's amendment is certainly appropriate. There is no question  that DOD did not do what it should in reporting to the national  database and there have been instances where that made a difference,  tragic instances.   So requiring DOD to report within 3 days, I think, as the gentleman  from Virginia said, codifying the current policy, I think makes sense.  I hope someday we can get to the point, by the way, where we require  State and local governments to report within 3 days as well, because as  the study was conducted on DOD's failure to report to the database, it  turns out that some State and localities are even worse. So I think we  all ought to up our game when it comes to that.   I do want to express some concerns, however, about the second part of  the gentleman's amendment. It requires a feasibility study on a  military database for military protective orders. If it is a  feasibility study about whether it is technically possible to have a  database, that is one thing. But it is important for Members to  understand that military protective orders are issued by commanders,  and do not have any sort of due process that is associated with  civilian protective orders or much due process at all.    Now, military members can go and get a civilian protective order with  appropriate due process. But right now, a  [[Page H5554]]  military protective order by commanders is just issued at the request  of the victim or the victim's advocate. There are some opinions that  there are even instances where this process has been abused.   I just think we should be careful in treading down a road where we do  not provide due process with significant consequences. So as the  gentleman noted, there are some related provisions in the Senate bill.  I think it would be appropriate to take this measure and look deeper  into those consequences, especially to ensure that all servicemembers  have due process as well as all servicemembers and civilians have the  protection that the gentleman is seeking to achieve.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have no speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have no requests for time, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
