 Madam Speaker, I am an avid  outdoorsman. In November and December, if I have time, I tend to spend  it out in the woods, deer hunting. This is a popular passion among many  Pennsylvanians as well as Americans across our great country. Nothing  beats those early mornings heading out to the woods in hopes you will  return successful.   But our deer are currently threatened by chronic wasting disease.  This is a contagious, neurological disease affecting deer, elk, and  moose that is always fatal. CWD has been detected in 25 States and was  first discovered in Pennsylvania deer nearly 10 years ago.   Working across the aisle, my colleagues and I introduced H.R. 5608,  the Chronic Wasting Disease Research and Management Act, which  unanimously passed out of the House Agriculture Committee.   By working closely with stakeholders, we developed a bill to take us  one step closer to better understanding the genetic implications of the  disease and developing policies best suited to solve the problem.   Specifically, this legislation authorizes $70 million to split evenly  between CWD management and research efforts through USDA cooperative  agreements.   The research funds are authorized to be spent on testing and  detecting CWD in live cervids, noncervids, and the environment.  Additionally, these funds are authorized for research of genetic  resistance to chronic wasting disease, sustainable cervid harvest  management practices, and any additional factors of local CWD  emergence.   The management section authorizes funding for State or Tribal  wildlife agencies and departments of agriculture based on various  funding priorities, including the highest incidences of CWD, areas  demonstrating greatest financial commitments to addressing CWD, efforts  to develop CWD programs and policies, areas of greatest risk of being  introduced to CWD, and areas responding to new outbreaks.   This bill also includes key education provisions in which USDA,  State, and Tribal agencies are authorized to develop materials to  inform the public on chronic wasting disease.   Last but certainly not least, H.R. 5608 directs USDA reviewal of the  herd certification program within 18 months.   Madam Speaker, we need all hands on deck to help combat this disease,  maintain a healthy deer population, and protect our beloved elk range-- certainly, our elk range in Pennsylvania, which is near and dear to me.  It is imperative we better understand the transmission of, resistance  to, and diagnosis of CWD.   I am really pleased that, in December, this House passed H.R. 5608  with strong bipartisan support, marking an important step in that  direction. Today, we wait for the Senate to take up this time-sensitive  bill. It is my belief our colleagues in the Senate recognize the  urgency and the potential negative economic impacts of CWD if it  continues to spread at this rate and work toward its passage.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  the retirement of James S. Moulthrop, P.E., a western Pennsylvania  native and long-time Pennsylvania Department of Transportation  professional whose impact has traveled well beyond the Keystone State.  [[Page H202]]    Jim was born and raised in DuBois, Pennsylvania. He worked for two  decades as a registered professional engineer with the Pennsylvania  Department of Transportation in various positions, including district  and regional soils engineer, chief field materials control engineer,  chief of the Materials and Testing Division, and director of highway  maintenance.   His work in the pavement preservation industry has transcended his  professional role at PennDOT, Koch Materials, and as executive director  at FP2, Incorporated. He has also furthered transportation policy as  chairman of the Transportation Research Board's Committee on Pavement  Maintenance and on the Executive Committee of Road and Paving  Materials.   Mr. Moulthrop has spent his career encouraging comprehensive pavement  preservation practices as not only a cost-effective approach to  maintaining and preserving our roads, which stretches the Federal  budget, but also because they benefit drivers each and every day by  improving the quality and safety of our roads.   Madam Speaker, I will conclude by recognizing the impact Mr.  Moulthrop's career has had in increasing the awareness of the value and  importance of pavement preservation in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  and States nationwide.                            ____________________
