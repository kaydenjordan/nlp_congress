 Mr. President, I am coming to the floor for the final  time to give remarks about the Willow Project. I will explain it a  little bit in my remarks.   The President is getting ready to make a decision--a huge decision-- on a big project in Alaska--really, an inflection point for our State's  future. He is likely to make that decision any day. So I am just going  to come down and kind of wrap up the arguments that we have been  making.   I really want to thank a number of folks: Senator Murkowski, of  course, who, with me--we have been focused on this issue for 2 years,  the entire time of the Biden administration--2 years, arguments every  day, including a meeting with the President last week, last Thursday;  Congresswoman Peltola, who has done a really strong job in this regard,  particularly in the meeting last week with the President. Some of my  Democratic colleagues have been weighing in on this project. I really  appreciate that. I know it takes a lot of courage.   I am going to talk about some of the far-left lower 48 environmental  groups that don't support it based on nothing--no facts, no data. But  stand up to them, go to the White House and say: Come on, Mr.  President. Come on, Biden administration. You have to make sure Alaska  has this.   So my Democrat colleagues, I am not going to name you. I don't want  to get you in trouble or anything, but thank you. I really, really  appreciate this.   As I mentioned, we had a meeting with the President last week, and,  at the beginning of the meeting, in addition to handing the President a  unanimous resolution from the entire Alaska Legislature--the entire  State senate, the entire State house; Democrats, Republicans,  Independents; Native, non-Native--all passed a resolution saying to the  Biden administration: Please support the Willow Project.   There were three pads. I handed that to the President. I also handed  him this map that describes really the context, as I said to the  President, of what is happening in Alaska under this administration.   I was respectful. We were in the Oval Office. Of course, you are  going to be respectful with the President and his team. The Oval Office  is a very historic place, obviously. But I said, respectfully: Mr.  President, in every region of the State, every industry--oil, gas,  mining, hunting, fishing; you name it--there have been 45 Executive  orders and Executive actions--it is now 46; there has been another one  since the meeting we had last week--looking to shut down Alaska. It is  exhausting, to be honest. No other State is getting that kind of  attention.   I walked through some of these, but I just, again, respectfully,  wanted the President to know, and that is it. Every time we meet with  senior White House officials and say--these are the days we have met  with senior White House officials--``Hey, how about a ceasefire?'' we  just get more, more.   There is no other State in the country getting this kind of  attention. It is unwanted attention. As I have told many of my  Democratic colleagues, hey, if a Republican administration came after  you like this, singling your State out, putting thousands of people out  of work, and you came to me and said, ``Hey, Dan, could you help me?''  I would help you. Every Democrat here knows I would help you. So I  appreciate the help that we are getting.   That was the context of the meeting. Again, it was respectful. We  appreciated it. We had over an hour with the President and his team. He  is a busy, busy man, the leader of the free world. So we appreciated  that.   (Ms. HASSAN assumed the Chair.)   I was also recently down in Houston at this very big energy  conference called CERAWeek. To be honest, it is not an exaggeration to  say that all eyes are on the Willow Project because, essentially, the  question that is being posed in our energy sector is this. There was a  very good Wall Street Journal editorial last week calling the Willow  Project the test for Biden. This editorial lead by saying that the  ``President . . . says the only barrier to more U.S. oil production is  recalcitrant'' companies.    OK, a lot of us don't believe that, by the way. So here is an  opportunity to say: Is that true or not? Because if the Biden  administration--the President--approves Willow tonight, ConocoPhillips  will start moving people to build it tomorrow. We are ready. The State  is ready. The private sector is ready.   So I think that is the key question, and it was the key question down  in  [[Page S724]]  CERAWeek, the biggest energy conference probably in the world, with  almost 8,000 attendees.   This is a really important question, not just for Alaska but for  America.   I think the key arguments here are, given the President's priorities,  what the President emphasizes, what he and his administration talk  about. The Willow Project is actually exactly the kind of project  President Biden and his team should support because it reinforces so  many things that they talk about and care about.   Let me just mention four of those.   No. 1, which, of course, is really important, is that this project  has the highest environmental standards of any major energy project in  the world, by far. It is not even a close call. How do we know this?  Because the Biden administration's own environmental impact statement,  which came out a month ago, says this. It says this.   The Trump administration passed this project in their environmental  reviews with flying colors. Then, it was five pads. The Biden  administration's EIS, or environmental impact statement, took it down  to three. We didn't really like that, but that is about the minimum it  could go. And they explained in this administration's own environmental  impact statement--the scientists, the career staff were saying things  like that the greenhouse gas emissions would be ``minimal,'' not a  climate bomb like these lower 48 far-left groups keep talking about-- minimal.   Here is the number: Emissions from this project, according to  President Biden's own environmental impact statement, 0.15 percent, the  2019 emission levels. And they call it ``minimal.''   They also said if you don't do the Willow Project, the market  substitution analysis in the Biden administration's own EIS says that,  then, we will likely--we, America--have to go to other countries--Saudi  Arabia, Venezuela--to get oil, and their environmental records and  standards are so bad that the emissions globally from not doing this  project will actually rise.   That is in the EIS.   I have talked about the high standards for Alaska with regard to the  high standards in the world and the impacts on the environment.   By the way, this project is next to existing infrastructure. So you  don't have to build a lot of infrastructure. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline,  just plug it in.   This has the highest environmental standards in the world. How do I  know that? Because the Biden administration's environmental impact  statement lays it out in about 1,500 pages. That is one very important  argument that fits with the Biden administration's priorities.   Let me give you another one. The Biden administration frequently  talks about racial equity, racial justice, environmental justice for  people of color, indigenous people. They talk about that all the time.  The indigenous people in my State overwhelmingly support this project.  There are a few people--and that happens in every State, in every  country--who are opposed. They are getting a lot of press, by the way.  But the vast majority of the people, the First Nations' people, the  Alaska Native people in our State, strongly support this.   We held a press conference last week here in the Capitol. Some of the  most famous Alaska Native leaders in our State's history flew thousands  of miles just to be here to support this.   So all this rhetoric from the administration on racial equity, racial  justice is going to be very empty if they say: Do you know what? We are  going to choose the Center for Biological Diversity and Greenpeace's  priorities in the lower 48 over the priorities of the people who live  there.   I want to go into this a little bit deeper. This is a quote from the  Voice of the Arctic Inupiat. This is a group of Tribes and Native  leaders, a really broad-based group of the people who live where this  project would be. Here is a quote from Nagruk Harcharek:         Outside activist groups opposing Willow have drowned out       local perspective--    That is for sure--       and are actively working to supersede the views of the Alaska       Native people.    That is for sure.         This is not environmental justice or any kind of justice.       It is a direct attack on Alaska Native self-determination.    Some of our Native leaders last week were saying: Do you know what  really is infuriating? These lower 48 environmental groups that are all  driving the opposition of this project, are trying to tell Alaska  Natives who have lived in Alaska for thousands and thousands of years  how to live and what is good for them.   Do you know what some of our Native leaders are starting to call  this? The second wave of colonialism, eco-colonialism. Condescending  lower 48 environmental groups that don't know anything about Alaska are  coming up to our State and telling the Native people how to live--eco- colonialism. By the way, that topic came up in the Oval Office meeting.   The administration is going to listen to lower 48 environmental  groups that condescendingly tell Alaska Native people how to live? That  is certainly not racial equity. That is certainly not racial justice.  That is the definition of eco-colonialism, and I hope that they are not  going to go there.   One other area, another great group of Americans, whom I love to talk  about on the floor who support this project, are the great men and  women who build things in America. There has been no better champion of  that in the entire country than the president of the Laborers, my good  friend, Terry O'Sullivan, who, just 2 days ago, wrote another letter to  the President. He has been such a great advocate. The Laborers are the  greatest construction union in America.   This project will create 2,500 jobs, 75 percent of which are union  jobs, building trade jobs.   Madam President, I would like to submit for the Record another great  letter from Terry O'Sullivan. This one is dated March 6, 2023, to the  President of the United States. I ask unanimous consent to have the  letter printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      March 6, 2023.      President Joseph R. Biden,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Biden: I write to once again express my       support for the ConocoPhillips' Willow Project and express       concern over recent reports on the Administration's upcoming       decision. Recent reports indicate that Administration       officials are considering approving the project however       limiting its scope to only two (2) of the proposed Pads       currently under consideration. I want to be clear, a limited       approval like this is, in fact, a rejection of the project.        Proponents of this approach are displaying the kind of con-      game that has American voters and LIUNA members turning away       established political norms and embracing the hyper-partisan       extremism that our country seems to be lurching toward       uncontrollably.        Alaska's Willow Project will develop a domestic source for       the United States' energy portfolio, benefit local       communities, and put skilled union laborers to work. The       project will be built primarily through U.S.-sourced       materials and create over 1,800 union construction jobs with       long-term, family-sustaining careers for Alaskan workers, a       state with the fourth-highest unemployment rate in the       country.        The project's peak production of over 180,000 barrels per       day of responsibly produced domestic oil will reduce our       Nation's dependence on foreign energy supplies which often       come from nations that are only nominal allies or are hostile       to the interests of the United States. Additionally, our       imported oil comes from countries or regions of the world       with some of the worst human rights violations and where       environmental standards are either sub-par or lacking       altogether.        Experienced union workers are trained for the exacting,       detailed work needed to ensure compliance with Willow's       strict environmental protection requirements to safeguard the       Alaskan tundra and its wildlife. After years of collaboration       between ConocoPhillips, government agencies, Alaska Native       corporations, communities and the public, the comprehensive       project plans ensure Willow will be produced with the       strongest environmental and social standards.        With roughly 75% of Willow's North Slope installation work       hours slated to occur over five years, this union workforce       will continue to grow, creating family-sustaining careers       with good pay and benefits. In the North Slope, schools,       clinics, and essential services are almost entirely funded by       oil and gas production. Willow will generate over $10 billion       in public revenue, and 50% of federal royalties will go       towards local grants there to improve public resources for       North Slope communities and the indigenous population that       live there.  [[Page S725]]         With significant stakeholder input and a lengthy and       exhaustive review process completed, it is clear that this       project is widely supported in the State of Alaska and the       local communities that share the land with this project. It       is time to listen to local leaders, workers, and residents       and reject the game-playing that press reports indicate is       happening behind the scenes in the Administration.        Your personal commitment to American workers has been       exemplary. Please do not allow the opinions of those who are       against domestic energy production and are indifferent to       American workers, steer you in the wrong direction on this       important decision. If the Administration decides to limit       the scope of the approval, it will be a decision to kill this       project. LIUNA members, their families, and the citizens of       Alaska will understand this fact.        I implore you to keep your commitment to a rational energy       policy that allows for the responsible development of       domestic energy resources while the Nation transitions to a       lower-emission economy.        With kind regards, I am            Sincerely yours,                                                  Terry O'Sullivan,                                                 General President.     So I am just going to read a few lines from this  letter. But Terry O'Sullivan is a very astute man. He has seen what is  happening in Washington this past couple of weeks.   Here is what he said:         Administration officials are considering . . . limiting       [Willow's] scope to only two of the proposed Pads.    By the way, there is no environmental analysis of that at all in the  EIS in the Trump administration or the Biden administration. So if they  do that, it won't be based on any science, any data.         I want to be clear--    Said Terry O'Sullivan--       a limited approval like this [of two pads] is, in fact, a       rejection of the project.    This is what we have told the President. This is what we have told  his team many, many times. They know that.         Proponents of this approach are displaying the kind of con-      game that has American voters and LIUNA--    That is the laborers--       members turning away [from] established political norms.    So this great American, Terry O'Sullivan, he is a working man. He  leads working men and women. He is saying: Don't play these games. Two  pads is a denial. That was our respectful message last week.   What else did Terry O'Sullivan have to say in his final letter to the  President?         It is time to listen to local leaders [check] workers [for       sure] and residents and reject the game-playing that the       press reports indicate is happening behind the scenes in the       Administration.        [K]eep your commitments [Biden administration] to a       rational energy policy that allows for the responsible       development of domestic energy resources while the Nation       transitions to a lower-emission economy.    Terry O'Sullivan, once again, Madam President, weighing in. I can't  thank him enough, Sean McGarvey, the building trades.   By the way, when we held this press conference last week, every union  in Alaska supports this project. The trades, of course, but all the  public unions, every single union, 100 percent.   Now, again, this administration likes to talk about: Hey, we really  care about the working men and women, the men and women who build  things, the unions. OK. OK. Let's see where you are on Willow.   Finally, Madam President, I want to talk about an issue that, again,  came up in the Oval Office, and that is just the foreign policy  ramifications of this upcoming decision.   We are in a new era of authoritarian aggression that I talk about a  lot. The brutal dictators Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, and this guy  Maduro in Venezuela, they are on the march. But the one thing they fear  almost more than anything is American energy power. Read the reporting.  Xi Jinping is scared to death, the dictator of Beijing, scared to death  of American energy power. So is Putin, by the way.   So in the last 2 years--because, like I said, Senator Murkowski and I  have been raising this issue about daily--I have asked in dozens of  hearings on the Armed Services Committee, military experts, Biden  administration officials, Biden administration military members: Do you  think it matters and do you think it is good for our national security  if we have more energy in a project like this?   By the way, Willow, at max production, will produce about 200,000  barrels a day.   Every single official in this administration who deals with national  security, for 2 years--for 2 years--has said yes. Not one has said no.   Now, I am not going to name names. I don't want to get anybody in  trouble. But it is obvious. This is one of the great strengths of our  Nation. And our adversaries--the dictator in Moscow and the dictator in  Beijing--fear it.   So why do I have this slide up? There is something going on right now  that is unbelievable. And every time I have asked anybody and I have  raised it with anybody in this administration, they look at me with a  blank stare and don't answer my question.   My question is this. This administration came in; they wanted to  limit the production of American energy. I fully disagree with that  approach, but what happened?   Well, the predictable result happened. If you limit supply, prices go  up. So prices on energy have gone up on working families for the last 2  years like this. We all know it. Inflation like this.   So what have they been doing? They have been going overseas begging  other countries to produce more oil and then poured it into America.  Now, why on Earth would you do that when you can do it here?   So the latest and greatest--they did it in Saudi Arabia. They were  rejected, by the way. They were flirting with Iran. My goodness, the  largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, and you are flirting  with those guys, with the blood of American soldiers on their hands?  Ridiculous. But they went to Venezuela after the election, and they  said: Let's lift sanctions on you.   So we are now importing over 100,000 barrels a day from Venezuela.  Can you believe that? That is a fact. Venezuela pollutes--in its  processes to produce oil, it is a production and greenhouse gas  emission process that is 18 times--with an ``x'' times--more polluting  than in America and certainly way more polluting--probably 30 times  more than the great State of Alaska's Willow Project.   So if you really care about the environment, why did you just lift  sanctions on one of the dirtiest producers in the world? They are a  terrorist regime. They have a horrible human rights record, a horrible  worker rights record, a well-known U.S. adversary, and we are already  importing 100,000 barrels a day from them--just started. And we don't  want to produce in Alaska, with the highest standards in the world on  the environment and workers?   So when I ask the question why would we do that and not let us  produce in the great State of Alaska, like I said, I have never gotten  an answer to that question. So, hopefully, the answer is going to be:  Well, we are going to help the great State of Alaska with this Willow  Project.   Do it because, right now, Madam President, with regard to energy  policy, my State is being treated worse than a terrorist regime. And  that is not hyperbole. That is a fact.   So in my final appeal before this decision is made, respectfully  asking this administration: This is exactly the kind of project that we  think should be easily supported by this administration, given their  priorities--the highest standards in the world on the environment, no  doubt about it; the lowest greenhouse gas emissions--negligible,  according to the President's own EIS; racial equity; racial justice.   The Native people of Alaska want this. Listen to them. Don't listen  to the ecoterrorists down in the lower 48, coastal elites who don't  know anything about Alaska and are trying to tell the Native people how  to live their lives--insulting, by the way. Don't listen to the  ecoterrorists. Listen to the great union members like Terry O'Sullivan,  all of whose members support and help enhance the national security of  America with strong energy policy in the great State of Alaska.   I hope the Biden administration does the right thing. So many of my  colleagues have helped. I want to thank Senator Murkowski again for her  relentless, relentless advocacy on this with me.   We will see. Big stuff for America. Giant stuff for my State. I hope  they do the right thing for our country, for our workers, for the  Native people, for our national security.  [[Page S726]]    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
