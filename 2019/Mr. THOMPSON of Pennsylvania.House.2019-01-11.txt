 Madam Speaker, last week, I introduced  a bill that protects private property rights in Pennsylvania's only  national forest, the Allegheny National Forest. H.R. 245, the  Cooperative Management of Mineral Rights Act of 2019, will ensure that  private property owners and energy producers in the Allegheny National  Forest have access to the property.   Despite being successfully and sufficiently regulated by the  Commonwealth for decades, a Federal law passed in 1992 required the  Forest Service to write new regulations on oil and gas production in  the ANF. However, Federal courts have repeatedly ruled that the Forest  Service does not have the authority to do so because the minerals in  the ANF are privately owned.   My bill corrects this Federal law by repealing the improper 1992  requirement. In fact, the House of Representatives previously passed my  legislation, twice, with strong bipartisan support, overwhelmingly in  2016 and unanimously in 2017.   I hope we can get this commonsense legislation across the finish line  during the 116th Congress. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this  important legislation to put the brakes on excessive litigation in the  ANF and protect private property rights.                            ____________________
