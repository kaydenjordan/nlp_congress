 Mr. President, our Founding Fathers believed strongly in  the civilian control of our military. Having escaped from the tyranny  of the British crown, they did not want the powers of government and  military to be fused. In America, the people would control their Armed  Forces. This standard has endured, and was enshrined in law in 1947.  Congress had to pass a waiver to the 1947 law in 2017, and we are being  asked to do it again in 2021. I hope that this is the last time  Congress will be asked to pass such a waiver.   Civilian control of the military goes beyond the basic question of  how long ago a nominee wore the uniform. It is also a question of  whether the nominee is enmeshed in the interests of our vast defense  contracting industry, an industry whose bottom line depends on an  expansive American military posture and, with it, an ever-growing  defense budget. Going from firing the missiles to selling the missiles  is technically a move into a civilian role, but nothing more. It is  every bit as corrosive to the principle of civilian rule for the head  of the Pentagon to churn from the military to the boardroom to the  Pentagon, working with many of the same people at every step along the  way.   General Austin retired from the Army in 2016, and he immediately  joined the board of United Technologies, which was acquired by  Raytheon. He was very well-compensated for his work there, and is  reportedly due a buy-out of up to $1.7 million when he leaves Raytheon  and his other work and returns to the Pentagon. All we are doing by  confirming these types of nominees, no matter their other  qualifications, is tightening the ever-increasing bonds between the  military and the contractors who serve it. It is getting hard to see  where one stops and the other begins. No pledge of recusal from a  nominee will solve this larger problem. We are not limited to selecting  our Secretary of Defense from the world of defense contractors, and our  country would be better off if we stopped. However, with regard to  experience and expertise, I do not question General Austin's  qualifications and will vote to allow the President his choice.    Mr. President, today we honor the life and legacy  of a great Kentuckian, James ``Jim'' Milliman. Jim was born October 29,  1942, in Norwalk, OH. He led a life of faith, passion for the law, and  an unmatched enthusiasm for Notre Dame football. Jim attended Notre  Dame, then earned his law degree from the University of Louisville  Brandeis School of Law, which is where he would embark on a brilliant  career as a lawyer.   Jim began his legal career at Middleton-Reutlinger Law firm, where he  most notably appeared in the U.S. Supreme Court confirming his  defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial. He would continue  his work fighting for the little guy always advocating for equal  justice under the law. After a long successful tenure practicing law,  Jim shifted to being my State director. With Jim's guidance, my staff  and I have been able to fight for Kentuckians in Washington and  throughout the State. The feats we have accomplished would not have  been possible without the mentorship of Jim Milliman.   Jim passed January 5, 2021. A true testament to his impact on people,  Jim's eulogy was not given by any of his law partners, business, or  political friends--he had plenty--but by Muhammed Lasege, a former  University of Louisville basketball star from Nigeria whose college  career was cut short due to eligibility issues. A successful  businessman himself, he told the story of how Jim provided guidance and  hope when his basketball dreams were crushed. He described their  relationship of a father-son bond, despite the fact that Jim never had  a son and Muhammed never knew his father.   While our hearts are heavy acknowledging Jim's passing, we reminisce  with great joy remembering all our accomplishments, but most of all our  friendship. May Jim Milliman rest in peace.                            ____________________
