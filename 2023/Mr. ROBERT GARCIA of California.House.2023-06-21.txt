 Mr. Speaker, this resolution is a  joke.   They are trying to smear Congressman Schiff for his work to defend  our institutions. Meanwhile, the same people who attack Adam Schiff for  seeking the truth refuse to take action against a serial and admitted  fraudster in their own Conference.   Adam Schiff did not win his elections on false pretenses. He has not  been accused of crimes in the U.S., nor has he admitted to crimes in  Brazil. Unfortunately, not all my House colleagues on the Republican  side can say the same.   Thirty-five days ago, every House Republican voted to defend George  Santos. Instead, they want to censure someone who stands for truth and  justice, Adam Schiff.
