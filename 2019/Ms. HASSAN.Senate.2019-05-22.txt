 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Elizabeth  Guillotte  [[Page S3052]]  of Hill, NH, and Richard ``Ricky'' Mazur of Franklin, NH, as the May  2019 Granite Staters of the Month for their dedication to helping their  classmates whose financial and/or family circumstances render them  unable to afford basic necessities like clothing and toiletries.   When the Franklin High School FIRST robotics team sat down to discuss  how they could give back to their community, Elizabeth and Richard had  an idea: They could revamp the makeshift thrift shop at their school.  Now, students at Franklin High School who are in need of anything from  clothing, to toothbrushes, to cereal, can get all these items  anonymously and for free at the new and improved ``Karma Korner.''   Elizabeth and Richard were inspired to act after they noticed that  some of their classmates were walking the halls in the same clothing  that they wore the day before and learned that some classmates were  eating their only meal of the day in the school cafeteria.   With the support of their FIRST Robotics teammates, the two students  moved an already existing makeshift thrift shop to a wheelchair- accessible room with better lighting and brightly colored walls. They  added food to the inventory of items available for students and started  a program that allows students to bring home a backpack stuffed with  pantry items so that they do not go hungry over the weekend.   Ensuring anonymity and, as a result, reducing stigma was important to  Elizabeth and Richard. If a student wants to check out an item, all  they need to do is record what they are taking on a clipboard, so that  the students working the pantry know what needs to be replenished.   Many businesses in the surrounding communities have also lent their  support in the form of gift cards or donated items. By collaborating  with local businesses and charities, Karma Korner recently received  washers and dryers for student use, which were bought and installed at  no expense to the school.   In establishing Karma Korner, Elizabeth and Richard have recognized  and elevated the dignity of their friends, peers, and classmates, and  they have reminded us of our shared humanity and shared promise. I join  the rest of the Franklin High School community in thanking Richard and  Elizabeth for their efforts to help make their school a more supportive  and welcoming place and congratulate them for being honored as May  2019's Granite Staters of the Month.                            ____________________
