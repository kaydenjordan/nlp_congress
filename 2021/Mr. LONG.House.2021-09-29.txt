 Madam Speaker, the Ways and Means Committee went in last  Saturday to mark up a $3.5 trillion spending bill, and when they got  done, they had a $4.3 trillion spending bill.   I don't know exactly how that happened, but I might have a suggestion  on how it could have possibly happened.   I am at a trillion. Now two, two trillion. Now three. Are you able to  buy $3 trillion down here? Now 3\1/4\. What do you go for? 3\1/2\, 3\1/ 2\. Now 4. Oh, 3\1/2\, now 4. At last call, 3\1/2\. Oh, 4 trillion, 4- 1, 4-1, 4.1, now 2. You can afford 2. 4.2. Now 3. $4.2 trillion, and I  have sold it for $4.3 trillion.   You know, Madam Speaker, Missourian Harry Truman said, when you get  elected to Congress, you spend your first 6 months up here thinking,  wow, how did I ever get here? And then you spend the whole rest of your  career thinking, how did some of these other people get here?   If you have watched the boondoggle on the floor this week, you know  exactly what I mean.                            ____________________
