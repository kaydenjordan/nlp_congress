 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  and honor Sergeant Harry Amigh, a resident of Ebensburg, Pennsylvania,  and a Korean war veteran.   Sergeant Amigh enlisted in the United States Army in 1948 and would  go on to serve in the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, one of the Korean  war's greatest battles. Sergeant Amigh was killed in action during that  battle at just 20 years old.   Though his military career ended far too soon, Sergeant Harry Amigh  left an incredible legacy behind. I am humbled to be joining the Amigh  family this Friday, January 17, to honor his legacy and present the  family with seven military awards and medals in his memory.   Sergeant Amigh is the recipient of a:   Purple Heart;   National Defense Service Medal;   Korean Service Medal with one Bronze Star;   Combat Infantryman Badge;   United Nations Service Medal;   Republic of Korea-Korean War Service Medal; and.   Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.   The men and women who have chosen to dedicate their lives to  defending the United States are among the most courageous citizens.   Sergeant Amigh loved his country, and he fought valiantly for his  country. For that, we are forever indebted to Sergeant Amigh and the  many men and women like him who made the ultimate sacrifice.                       In Support of Iranian Protesters     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  and as a cosponsor of House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy's H. Res.  791, supporting the protesters in Iran. H. Res. 791 serves notice to  the Iranian regime that the United States is watching and the world is  watching.  [[Page H242]]    Sadly, yesterday, my Democratic colleagues blocked a vote on this  resolution that expressed support of antigovernment protestors in Iran  and condemned Iran's role in the downing of a Ukrainian civilian  aircraft last week.   So what was in this resolution that motivated my Democratic  colleagues to prevent consideration?   The resolution would have condemned the Government of Iran for  killing 1,500 Iranian citizens who were protesting their government as  well as condemned the Government of Iran for shooting down Ukraine  International Airlines flight 752, killing 176 people.    In addition, the resolution, in section 3, ``condemns the Government  of Iran for repeatedly lying to its people and to the world about its  responsibility for the downing of Ukraine International Airlines flight  752''; section 4, ``calls on the Government of Iran to, A, refrain from  the use of violence, and, B, protect the rights of freedom of  expression and peaceful assembly; and,'' section 5, ``supports the  protestors in Iran, their demands for accountability, and their desire  for the Government of Iran to respect freedom and human rights.''   Mr. Speaker, I am deeply disappointed that my Democratic colleagues  would block a measure expressing support of freedom and human rights,  principles that should be afforded to all persons.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize January as National Mentoring Month, when we volunteer our  time to provide support and guidance for our Nation's young people so  they are better equipped to tackle personal and professional  challenges.   A good mentor could be a friend, a family member, a boss, or a school  counselor. Effective counseling prior to graduation can assist students  in making better informed decisions about their educational options and  career prospects.   That is why Congressman  Jim Langevin and I introduced the Counseling  for Career Choice Act. Despite a great deal of money being invested to  improve education, very little has been spent to address career  development specifically. This bill authorizes a grant program to give  States and local education agencies access to current counseling  programs or the means to implement new counseling frameworks.   Additionally, the bill provides resources to ensure counselors can  support their students to the best of their abilities. When we equip  students with the tools that they need to succeed, they embark on  educational journeys that lead to rewarding careers.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join Congressman Langevin  and I in support of H.R. 5092, the Counseling for Career Choice Act.                            ____________________
