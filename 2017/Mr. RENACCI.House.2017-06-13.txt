 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2581, the  Verify First Act, introduced by my good friend and colleague,  Congressman Lou Barletta. This legislation seeks to remedy one of the  many oversights of the ACA that it failed to address--an oversight at  the expense of the American taxpayer.   Under the current system, the Treasury disburses credits to  individuals before their application has been verified. In the real  world, where I come from, that just doesn't happen. If the IRS then  finds out that this individual is not eligible, they have to try to get  the money back. It is almost impossible to recover that money.   This legislation closes a loophole simply by requiring an individual  be verified as lawfully present before the Treasury releases the money.  It is important to understand that the issue at hand is about poor  stewardship of hard-earned tax dollars. That is what the American  people sent us down here for. The sole intent of this credit was for  the credits to be used lawfully, and this legislation helps ensure just  that.   At a time when our national debt is $19 trillion and counting, it  makes no sense for the Federal Government to continue to write these  checks. My constituents in Ohio depend on me to ensure responsible  stewardship of their hard-earned tax dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to commit to the same  responsibility and support the Verify First Act.
