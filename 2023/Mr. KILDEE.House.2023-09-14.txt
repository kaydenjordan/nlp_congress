 Mr. Speaker, I stand in solidarity with the hardworking  men and women of the United Auto Workers as they bargain for a fair  contract.   Unions helped build the middle class. The labor movement was actually  founded in large part in my district, the Eighth Congressional District  of Michigan, in my hometown of Flint where the autoworkers sat down in  the auto plants to stand up for good wages, for safer working  conditions, and for better benefits.   Every day in my district, UAW members build award-winning vehicles.  They are standing up to demand a fair share of the value that they  produce. Everyone, every worker, not just those at the top, should  benefit from that.   The fight is not just about fair contracts for union workers, though.  It is about fairness and the future of all workers in this country.   In Congress, I have championed bills to expand workers' rights,  including the right to join a union, and I have  [[Page H4309]]  stood in opposition to those efforts to try to take those rights away  to pass antiworker, anti-union legislation that would hurt our economy  and hurt American families.    Let me be clear. To the men and women of the UAW who are fighting for  a fair contract, I stand in solidarity with you.                            ____________________
