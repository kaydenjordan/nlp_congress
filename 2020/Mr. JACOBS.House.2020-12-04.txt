 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of extending the  successful and bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program by making $138  billion in already appropriated funds available to help more businesses  that are experiencing dire and desperate need.   This week, it was reported that almost 30 percent of small businesses  in New York have closed for good due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and many  more will face the same fate without further aid.   $138 billion appropriated to the PPP is just sitting here in  Washington, D.C., instead of helping our Nation's small businesses.   For months, we have asked the Speaker to allow a vote on H.R. 8265,  which simply enables the SBA to do another round of grant awards,  getting this $138 billion out on the street before it is too late for  many of these hard-hit businesses. This legislation is targeted,  addresses a dire need across the Nation, and requires no additional  Federal funds.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Speaker and her leadership to reconsider this  tactic and allow this legislation to come to the floor for a vote. I am  confident it will receive bipartisan support.                            ____________________
