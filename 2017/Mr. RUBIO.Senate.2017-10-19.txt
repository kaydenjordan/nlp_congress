 Mr. President, this amendment relates to the child tax  credit. It is abundantly clear that perhaps one of the most effective  ways to deliver tax relief--tax cuts--to working families is through  the expansion of this credit, as it is our hope to achieve during tax  reform.   I think it is important to point out that the U.S. Department of  Agriculture compiles data on how much it costs to raise children in the  21st century. Today, it is expected that middle-income families are  going to spend $230,000 to raise their children. By the way, that does  not include the cost of their going to college.   Being able to deliver relief to hard-working families through the  expansion of the child tax credit, which is applicable not just against  income tax but payroll tax, is perhaps the single most effective way to  do that given the framework under which we will be working. That is  what this amendment intends to reserve the opportunity to do.
