 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 6395, the William M.  Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.   As we debate this important legislation today, we must remain laser- focused on how our fellow Americans, servicemen, and veterans continue  to face incredible challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   In particular, I remain concerned about the student loan crisis that  existed long before the pandemic paralyzed our economy and threw tens  of millions of Americans out of their jobs. Student loan debt has  surpassed credit cards and auto loans as the largest debt held by  consumers, second only to mortgages.   According to the Federal Reserve, more than 40 million Americans hold  $1.6 trillion in cumulative student loan debt. In 2019, private student  loans comprised nearly 8 percent of the outstanding balances, amounting  to roughly $123 billion.   This crushing student loan debt reduces homeownership, jeopardizes  retirement security, and limits the formation of small businesses.   We also know that many Americans were struggling to repay their  student loans before the pandemic. Now, it has only gotten worse.   Prior to COVID-19, more than one in seven student loan borrowers were  more than 90 days delinquent, and almost half did not pay down their  balances over the previous quarter.   That is why we created protections for student borrowers in the CARES  Act. In CARES, we granted people with Federal student loans a break  from their payments until next September.   Unfortunately, private student loan borrowers continue to find  themselves with very few relief options. During the pandemic, the  number of private student borrowers not making repayment progress has  increased by 36 percent.   Even though Congress has passed a number of bills to provide relief  during these difficult times, we have left millions of Americans  uncovered and without necessary protections.   That is why I proposed an amendment with the NDAA that is simple and  fair. It would extend the CARES student loan protections that were  provided to Federal student loan borrowers to private student loan  borrowers who were left out. This would include a pause in borrower  payment obligations, in accrual of interest, in negative credit  reporting, and in debt collection.   Additionally, the CARES student loan protections expire on September  30, 2020, and the pandemic and the economic fallout do not appear to be  ending in the near future. So, the amendment extends the private  student loan protections an additional year, until September 30.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the gentlewoman that, since  March, this body has provided $600 billion in funds for the Paycheck  Protection Program. But because of shoddy implementation, the  administration lavished billions on this Nation's country clubs and  private jet companies and other entities of the 1 percent. That doesn't  even include the multiple tax breaks and the advantages for  corporations that were written into the  [[Page H3508]]  CARES Act, which, combined, equal as much as the amount spent to  provide Americans with $1,200 in a stimulus check.                                time  1930    So, Mr. Speaker, why is it that it is only socialism when we endeavor  to provide relief to working-class or middle-class Americans? Why are  American taxpayer dollars only sacred when we try to provide for those  who are in need the most?   We are living in unprecedented times, and so we need an unprecedented  response. People are struggling. They are trying truly to get by, no  fault of their own.   We know that supporting our fellow Americans will require significant  investments and funding, so let's find the courage and let's have some  compassion to provide the financial support that student loan relief  could do that they urgently need.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, with 32 million Americans receiving unemployment  benefits, nearly 20 percent of our workforce is in need of relief.   And, yes, folks who have loans and folks who signed a contract to pay  rent and their mortgage, because of this pandemic and they have lost  jobs, they can't do that.   You know, according to one higher education expert's calculations,  some 10 billion student loan borrowers could be out of work amid the  recession, and right now, the most important expenses for Americans are  food, medical care, housing, and utilities.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to operate from a place of  compassion and fairness. As Members of Congress, we are blessed to have  jobs. No one here has lost a paycheck. We have health insurance and all  the other basic needs that we have, so the least that we can do is  provide a temporary economic life raft to our fellow citizens. This  amendment gives us the opportunity to help those in need.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
