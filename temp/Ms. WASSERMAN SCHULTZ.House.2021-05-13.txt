 Mr. Speaker, I rise to declare unwavering and  steadfast support for the State of Israel.   Hamas and Islamic Jihad are single-handedly responsible for the  escalation that has led to the bloodshed of Israelis and Palestinians.   These terrorist organizations do not care about people or peace. They  seek only to destroy the Jewish state. Israel has every right to defend  herself. No nation should be subject to a barrage of rocket fire, like  what we see on this easel on a civilian population.   Without the Iron Dome air defense system, the loss of life would be  worse than the nightmare before us today. Congress must ensure the  lifesaving missile defense systems continue to get the support and  funding needed to keep civilians safe.   Israel has taken serious steps to deescalate the conflict while Hamas  has only escalated its attacks. So it is especially irresponsible to  demonize Israel's conduct while ignoring her right to self-defense.   America unequivocally stands by our key democratic ally, Israel. I  pray for peace and security in the region, and I mourn the loss of all  lives--Israeli and Palestinian. I urge the cessation of all intentional  acts of violence and a return to working toward a viable two-state  solution. Everyone deserves to live in peace from terrorism.                            ____________________
