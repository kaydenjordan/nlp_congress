 Mr. Speaker, this tax scam is one of the  greatest cons I have seen in my time in Congress, and Republicans know  it. Why else would they rush to vote without giving the public time to  review or understand legislation that impacts 100 percent of our  economy? In the Senate, they even shattered regular order to pass this  bill with handwritten, illegible changes in the dead of night on  Saturday. Perhaps it is because they don't want anybody to see how far  this bill strays from their promises.   They promised historic tax cuts, but unless you are already rich or a  corporation already seeing record profits, you are unlikely to benefit.  Instead, you and your children will be paying to make the rich richer.   Republicans don't even deny that individuals get less than  corporations. But it is okay, they claim, because that money will get  to you eventually. They keep citing these magical numbers of money that  you will get, but we know these dollars won't come.   Whether losing deductions for State and local taxes, paying more for  student loans, or facing higher healthcare prices, thanks to the repeal  of the mandate, the GOP tax scam will hurt millions.
