 Madam Speaker, over the weekend, the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania kicked off one of my favorite events, the  Pennsylvania Farm Show.   For more than a century, farmers have gathered each January at the  Pennsylvania Farm Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. 102 years ago, the  very first Pennsylvania Farm Show was held on January 23 through  January 25, 1917, under the title of the Pennsylvania Corn, Fruit,  Vegetable, Dairy Products, and Wool Show.   In 1955, Dr. Milton Eisenhower, Penn State University president at  the time and the brother of the then-President of the United States,  Dwight D. Eisenhower, dubbed the Pennsylvania Farm Show ``always the  greatest show on Earth.''   Thanks to the dedication of the Pennsylvania farmers and farm  families, tens of thousands of volunteers, and generations of  agribusiness owners  [[Page H292]]  and staff from the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, the  Pennsylvania Farm Show continues to be among the greatest shows on  Earth.   This weeklong event is the largest indoor agricultural exposition in  the Nation, showcasing over 6,000 animals, featuring nearly 12,000  exhibits and more than half a million visitors.   Each year, I host a listening session at the Farm Show, and we  covered a range of topics on Saturday during the public forum, from  raising awareness about agriculture education to helping our dairy  farmers, and more. We discussed the passage of the 2018 farm bill,  which will restore certainty for our farm families, provide nutritional  support and greater opportunity for ultimate food security through  employment for our neighbors in financial need, renew a pathway to  prosperity for our dairy producers, and build toward a stronger rural  economy.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Pennsylvania Secretary of  Agriculture, Russell Redding, for participating in the listening  session, and also my colleagues: Congressman Dwight Evans, Congressman  Dan Meuser, and Congressman Lloyd Smucker.   The Pennsylvania Farm Show truly does bring together so many  different people in the ag community, and it is an event like no other.   The Farm Show complex houses 24 acres under one roof, spread  throughout 11 buildings, including three arenas. There is no admission  fee. It is a great event for the entire family, and there are numerous  educational shows.   The Pennsylvania Farm Show provides an atmosphere for everyone to  walk through, observe, and educate themselves about the different areas  of agriculture, the Commonwealth's largest industry, which brings  nearly $6.9 billion annually in agricultural cash receipts. Almost half  a million jobs are tied to the industry, which positively impacts all  Pennsylvanians.   Madam Speaker, 103 years ago, the Pennsylvania Farm Show was a 3-day  exhibit. Today, the event is a weeklong celebration of how the  agriculture industry touches our lives every day. Proudly, this event  draws visitors from across the country to highlight everything our  State has to offer when it comes to ag. Numerous students participate  in the event as well from 4-H clubs to FFA organizations.   The Pennsylvania Farm Show truly showcases our Nation's farmers and  landowners. I was thrilled to again take part in the best agricultural  expo in the country.   Madam Speaker, I want to close with the words from the prologue to  the 100th anniversary book that is published by the Farm Show  Foundation, with the Farm Show being dedicated to the farmers who feed  us, the Penn State extension staff that lead us, and the consumers that  need us.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today on Law  Enforcement Appreciation Day to commend law enforcement officers  throughout our Nation who answer the call to serve their communities.  This day is designated annually on January 9 to show support to our law  enforcement leaders in every community, including our Capitol Police,  who are with us here each and every day.   Law enforcement officers face increasingly difficult circumstances  while working to serve and protect the public. It is a dangerous job,  and, often, it is a thankless job. Our officers put on their uniforms  each day knowing that they can be in harm's way at any moment. They  answer the call in times of distress, and they follow the rules and  wear the badge proudly.   Mr. Speaker, we must remember that our officers are mothers and  fathers, sons and daughters, husbands and wives. They are humans, and  they arguably have one of the most difficult jobs in America.   So today and each day, let's honor our brothers and sisters in blue.  Let's thank them for the important work that they do to keep us all  safe.                            ____________________
