 Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today in support of  [[Page H7522]]  my good friend, my dear friend, Congressman   Andy Barr and his  legislation named, of course, in memory of his late wife, Carol.   Andy knows Monica and I loved being with Carol and Andy whenever we  could. Whenever we could get together it was great, especially when we  traveled together.   Let me talk about the bill for a second. The Cardiovascular Advances  in Research and Opportunities Legacy Act, or CAROL Act, will help to  advance research on valvular heart disease.   Specifically, this bill authorizes grants that allow us to identify  and develop a cohort of individuals with valvular disease.   We will then be able to gather data and help doctors determine which  individuals are at high risk of sudden cardiac death.   And finally, the bill will convene subject matter experts to  strategize on what research is needed to develop guidelines for  treatment of patients with mitral valve prolapse.   As a doctor, I know this legislation will undoubtedly help to save  many lives.   The bill's 180 cosponsors, who span the political spectrum, are a  testament to how important this body believes this bill to be.   Today, we take another step towards getting this bill across the  finish line. It will be a fitting tribute to a beautiful life when we  see it signed into law.   Madam Speaker, I know Carol is beaming with pride as she looks down  on Andy today. And Andy and Carol's girls, Eleanor and Mary Clay, are  even more proud of both their mom and their dad than they already are  on this particular day.   So may God bless Andy and Carol Barr. Carol reached out and touched  the face of God, but the positive effects of her life and Andy's work  will never perish. Their legacies are that they bring good things to  life. So I am glad to see all of my colleagues here to support this  bill, and I urge its passage.
