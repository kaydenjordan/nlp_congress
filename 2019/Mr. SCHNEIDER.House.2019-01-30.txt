 Madam Speaker, the American people sent us here to  clean up corruption and make Washington work for them. Restoring public  trust in our system of government has to be one of our top priorities.   I am proud that the very first legislation I introduced this Congress  is aimed at strengthening ethics rules and slowing the revolving door  between industry lobbyists and executive branch agencies.   We need to bolster the firewall between public service and corporate  lobbying to ensure public servants are putting the needs of the people  first, not the industries they regulate.   I am very pleased the Ethics in Public Service Act was included in  H.R. 1, the For the People Act, the first major government reform  package we will consider this Congress. This bill will go a long way  toward elevating the people's voice in our politics by restricting the  influence of dark money in campaigns, defending voting rights  protections, and limiting corporate influence.   Working together, we can build a government more responsive and  effective in making progress for the American people.                            ____________________
