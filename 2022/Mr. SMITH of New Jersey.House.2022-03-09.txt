 Mr. Speaker, Russian oil and gas is  absolutely financing Putin's horrific war of aggression. I am for this  bill, but there are provisions in this one in particular that should  not be in here.   Mr. Speaker, I am the prime sponsor of the Global Magnitsky Human  Rights Accountability Act which we added to the 2017 NDAA.   Under the act, an actionable offense occurs only when there is a  gross violation of internationally recognized human rights which has  the meaning given to it in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.   Specifically, the Foreign Assistance Act includes torture or cruel,  inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, prolonged detention  without charges and trial, causing the disappearance of persons by the  abduction and clandestine detention of those persons, and other  flagrant denial of the right to life, liberty, or the security of  person.   H.R. 6968, however, radically strikes and replaces the current  definition of what constitutes an actionable offense with language that  is not defined--and this being done tonight without the benefit of  hearings or due diligence.   Under the new language, the President may impose sanctions on an  individual if responsible for or complicit in or has directly or  indirectly engaged in what they call serious human rights abuse.   Exactly what does that mean?   There is no definition.   How is that phrase defined?   How elastic is it, especially when it is not linked to any  international treaty or covenant?   What does directly engaged mean?   How indirect?   Guilt by association?   The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act got it right. It  was bipartisan, and it links sanctions to internationally recognized  human rights.   I hope the Senate will take a look at this. This is an egregious  mistake.
