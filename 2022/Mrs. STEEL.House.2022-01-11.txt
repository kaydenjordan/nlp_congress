 Madam Speaker, January 13 is Korean American Day, a day  to recognize the countless contributions of Korean Americans and  celebrate the arrival of the first Korean immigrants to the United  States in 1903.   As one of the first Korean-American women to ever serve in Congress,  this day is very special to me. I was just 19 years old when I came to  America, and I achieved what I never thought was possible, to serve  this country as a Member of Congress.   So many Korean-Americans like me came to this country with the hope  of achieving their own American Dream. We must work together to inspire  and support the next generation of Korean-American leaders.   Today, we celebrate the vibrant community of Korean-Americans in the  United States and all that they have worked to achieve.   Happy Korean American Day.                            ____________________
