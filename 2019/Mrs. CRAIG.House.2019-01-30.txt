 Madam Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I came to  Washington to work across the aisle and create economic opportunities  for Minnesota families.   Since I have gotten here, I have regularly met with Democrats and  Republicans to discuss the issues so many Americans talk about around  the kitchen table: better schools for their children, a fair shot at  economic security for their family, and healthcare they can afford.   We have also discussed over the last several weeks the shutdown. This  must never happen again. Yesterday, I joined many of my colleagues,  freshman colleagues, to introduce a bill to prevent another shutdown,  the Shutdown to End All Shutdowns Act.   This would prevent Federal workers from being used as pawns in future  political negotiations. Our bill creates strong incentives to prevent  another shutdown from occurring by withholding pay from Members of  Congress and the executive branch, while forcing lawmakers to remain in  Washington until a deal is reached.    Additionally, the bill ensures that the government will continue  running, even if we can't get to an appropriations bill.   Americans deserve better. We can do better for them. I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting the Shutdown to End All Shutdowns  Act and take a stand to never put politics over the American people  again.                            ____________________
