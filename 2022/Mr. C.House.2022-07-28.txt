 Scott Franklin of Florida asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, this past week, my  sheriff and friend, Grady Judd, celebrated 50 years of service with the  Polk County Sheriff's Department. Belovedly known as ``America's  Sheriff,'' Grady is renowned for his plain-spoken style and relentless  commitment to the rule of law. People from all over the world tune into  his live-streamed press conferences to hear his Gradyisms, such as,  ``You can't fix stupid, but you can arrest it.''   Grady joined the department in 1972, at the age of 18. He rose  quickly through the ranks and has served as sheriff since 2004. He has  been approached many times throughout his career for running for higher  office but has always responded, Why in the world would I want to do  that? I have the best job in the world already.   His half century of service is just one example of how seriously he  takes his commitments. Less than 1 month after joining the department  all those years ago, he married his sweetheart, Marisa. They will  celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary on September 16; and are the  proud parents of 2 sons and 13 grandchildren.   Thank you, Sheriff, for all you do to keep our community safe and for  being such a good and decent man.  [[Page H7264]]                                ____________________
