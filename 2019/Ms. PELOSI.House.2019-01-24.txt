 Madam Speaker, I rise following our 11th vote earlier  today to reopen government and end the senseless chaos and the pain of  this shutdown.   Why won't the Republicans take yes for an answer? Why won't they  provide relief for the hardworking Americans suffering in their own  communities?   It is important to note, Madam Speaker, that on every occasion we  have presented to the floor initiatives that had been passed by the  Republicans in the Senate, just their own bills, sending them back to  them, and they have said no, or their bills acted upon by a bipartisan  group in the House, our most recent contribution to send over to the  Senate, and they have said no.   And today, in the simplest--the simplest--of resolutions, we said  please vote ``yes'' for $12 billion for disaster assistance--we all  know that we have to do that--and open up the government for 2 weeks in  order to have a discussion of how best to protect our borders. And they  said no.   Madam Speaker, $12 billion for disaster assistance and 2 weeks of  opening up government to allow the debate to continue so that people  can come to work and those who are working already, all of them, can be  paid:    Americans like Brenda from Maine, whose family can no longer pay for  heating fuel this winter, while temperatures remain below freezing;   Americans like Julie from rural Iowa, who says that farmers, already  hit hard by tariffs, will feel the squeeze even more now;   Americans like Sarah from Colorado, whose new job at the VA is on  hold, adding to wait times for veterans who need healthcare services;  and.   Veterans, who comprise nearly a third of our Federal workforce, 31  percent. Our veterans' security clearances are at risk. You can lose  your security clearance if you lose your credit rating, and you can  lose your credit rating if you cannot pay your bills on time--your  mortgage, your rent, your car payment, your credit card bills, and the  rest. If your credit rating goes down, the vulnerability of your  security clearance is increased.   So it is harmful to our veterans to be doing this, and it is  important for everyone to know how they are affected because our  veterans, who have donned the uniform of our country to protect us and  then carry on their commitment to public service in the public sector  as Federal employees--in some ways still continuing to protect us, in  other ways meeting our needs in another way--all of them are affected  by this shutdown.   Or like Lila from Georgia, who says: ``Food stamp recipients will go  hungry. Many will lose subsidized housing. State and local services  will be overwhelmed trying to make up for the losses.''   One woman, Vivian, from Maine, asked: ``How is a wall more important  than families?''   This senseless shutdown throws the American people's safety and  security into peril.   This week, FBI agents released a report warning of the dire effects  of the shutdown on nearly every aspect of their work.   The FBI writes: ``We don't have funds to get drugs and guns off the  streets and to prosecute the violent gang and drug traffickers. . . .  ''   ``We aren't able to take child sexual exploitation cases to grand  jury to seek indictments and warrants in order to get our most violent  offenders arrested. . . . This just puts our children in jeopardy. . .  . ''   ``We have no funds'' to pay sources that provide cybersecurity  intelligence to protect the country ``against our foreign  adversaries.''   And they conclude: ``The fear,'' during this disastrous shutdown,  ``is our enemies know they can run freely.''   The FBI talked about children, putting our children in jeopardy. This  shutdown is putting so many children and the families of our Federal  workers in jeopardy as well.   Those of us who have had the privilege of serving those in food lines  and the rest, to listen and hear their stories, can tell you firsthand  that this is making enough impact that it is material for sure. It is  about their financial security, but psychological as well.   We are doing serious damage to our country, totally unnecessarily.   The President and the Republicans either do not notice or do not care  about the real effects of this shutdown on real people. They say: Oh,  you will get paid later.   Well, they have to pay their bills on time, not sometime later.   This morning, when told that many Federal workers were going to food  banks, Treasury Secretary Wilbur Ross said: ``I don't quite understand  why.''   As hundreds of thousands of workers are about to miss a second  paycheck tomorrow, Secretary Ross does not know why people without a  paycheck have to go to food lines.   This Marie Antoinette attitude of ``let them eat cake'' is pervasive  in the administration. The President thinks, I guess, that they can  call their dads for money.   Hours after Secretary Ross made his statement, White House economic  adviser Larry Kudlow doubled down on this administration's ``let them  eat cake'' attitude, saying that the shutdown was ``just a glitch.''   Just a glitch? Maybe to you it is a glitch, but it is a paycheck to  our Federal employees and the work they do for us.                                time  1715    So they are being harmed by not getting paid. The people they serve,  the American people, are being harmed by not being served.   Our economy will suffer a downturn. It does, at these times. The  President's own economic advisers can tell them that.   This shutdown is not a glitch. It is a crisis that the President  alone created and that the President alone can end. The Republicans in  the Congress have been accomplices to the President's irresponsibility  in just ignoring the consequences of his actions. Either he doesn't  know or he doesn't care, but, nonetheless, the Trump shutdown goes on.   Once again, we call on the President and the Republicans in Congress,  especially in the United States Senate, where they are holding this up,  to reopen government now for the sake of the health, the safety, and  the well-being of the American people.   I thank our Federal employees for what they do to meet the needs of  the  [[Page H1198]]  American people, for the role they play in providing the public-sector  promise that we make to people to meet their needs, to provide the  services of the courts and the protections of our security in terms of  the FBI, of TSA, of the Coast Guard.   The cost of this shutdown--the Coast Guard is the only defense entity  that is not being paid. Because this is a 25 percent shutdown, 75  percent of the workforce is at work. The Department of Defense is at  work, but the Department of Homeland Security is not, and that is what  the Coast Guard falls under.   Imagine those responsible for search and rescue and emergency  situations having to go to food banks to get food for their families.  How does that keep them as strong as they can possibly be, as strong as  they can possibly be to search and rescue and to protect us? They are a  line of defense in securing our borders.   A lot of the discussion is about secure borders. Well, our borders  extend to the seas, and our Coast Guard is our line of defense there.  In our proposals for the opening up of government, we have funding for  our Coast Guard for assets that they have asked us for.   This is a tragedy in so many respects. It shouldn't go on any longer.  We should at least be able to discuss and compare the merits of our  different proposals, and we should be able to do that with government  open and not holding the American people hostage, Federal employees  hostage, the security of our people hostage, and the safety and well- being of our children hostage to an idle campaign applause line that  the President seems committed to at this time.                            ____________________
