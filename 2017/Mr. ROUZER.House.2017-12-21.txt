 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Amy Wright, the  cofounder of Bitty & Beau's Coffee Shop in Wilmington, North Carolina,  on being named CNN Hero of the Year.   When Amy and her husband, Ben, found out that 70 percent of adults  living with disabilities do not have jobs, they opened the doors of  Bitty & Beau's in January 2016 with the goal of providing these worthy  individuals the opportunity to interact, contribute, grow, and succeed  in the workplace.   As those in Wilmington know, Bitty & Beau's is more than just a place  to grab coffee. It is a warm, inclusive environment with exceptional  customer service. Named after their two children who have Down  syndrome, the coffee shop employs 40 exceptional individuals with  disabilities.   Congratulations to Amy on this very special honor. Her and Ben's  contribution to our community and our fellow man is truly remarkable  and an inspiration for us all.                            ____________________
