 Madam President, what took place here on the floor  yesterday was nothing short of the Senate working at its very best. The  Senate took a bold step toward securing greater justice for millions of  Americans by advancing the Respect for Marriage Act with a resounding  bipartisan vote.   Standing here on the floor yesterday, you could feel the sense of  relief, of joy, within the Chamber. After the vote, I got on the phone  with my daughter and daughter-in-law and told them the good news, that  marriage equality is now on the march toward final passage--thank  goodness.   Passing the Respect for Marriage Act is no longer a matter of if but  only of when. Later this afternoon, the Senate will take the next step  in the process by formally adopting the motion to proceed. After that,  both sides will have to work together to reach an agreement for voting  on final passage as soon as we can.   Yesterday's vote was a vindication that it was well worth the wait.  While nothing was inevitable about the result, I never lost faith that  deep down enough of our colleagues would understand how important it  was to get this bill done. I am glad that that faith has now been  justified.   While some may want to delay this process, make no mistake, there is  no stopping this bill from final passage. As I said a moment ago, the  question of passage is not about if but when. I hope my Republican  colleagues will work with us to move forward with this bill sooner  rather than later.   I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who  spearheaded this legislation: Senators Sinema, Baldwin, Collins,  Portman, and Tillis. They did terrific work. We wouldn't be here  without them.   Finally, I hope this bipartisan legislation, and all others we have  passed this Congress, will continue to show how the Senate can function  in the upcoming 118th Congress. I have always said I have a hierarchy:  First, try to get things done in a bipartisan way whenever possible. It  is far better to get things done for the American people than to hold  show votes that bring political reckoning but have no hopes of passing.  Our job, after all, is to get things passed and make lives better here  in the Senate. And when the new Congress begins next year, that will  [[Page S6750]]  continue to be my guiding star and No. 1 focus.                              Midterm Elections    Madam President, now on MAGA, last week's midterm elections revealed  a basic but often unappreciated truth about politics: When elected  leaders prioritize getting things done--getting things done--and when  candidates can run on accomplishments, the American people respond  positively. That shouldn't be some remarkable insight, but,  unfortunately, too many seem to forget it. Indeed, too many of my  Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten it over the last couple of  years.   Look at what happened on Tuesday. The Republican side ran many flawed  candidates who embraced MAGA radicalism, and they lost. They spread the  Big Lie, sowed doubt and division and nastiness, and they ignored the  issues that mattered most to Americans. As a result, voters ran in the  other direction.   But don't take my word for it. Here is what Leader McConnell himself  said earlier this week, and I want to quote him in full. This is Leader  McConnell:         We underperformed among independents and moderates because       their impression of many of the people in our party and       leadership roles is that they're engulfed in chaos,       negativity and excessive attacks, and it frightened       independent and moderate Republican voters.    Listen to that part again:         [I]t frightened independent and moderate Republican voters.    That is exactly what I have been saying. MAGA Republicans did, in  fact, scare a lot of Americans who might have otherwise given the GOP a  closer look. All that talk about stolen elections, threatening poll  workers, it frightened people--and thank God. Americans said this is  not for us. Americans believe deeply in democracy, despite the  rightwing radical MAGA news media throwing all kinds of lies and  incendiary statements at them every day. The roots of democracy are  deep and a shield against that kind of activity.   Republicans have a choice to make when the 118th Congress begins next  year. If they continue embracing the MAGA approach of chaos and  gridlock and division, they are going to keep losing. I earnestly hope  that Republicans realize it is better for them and, of course, for the  country to cure themselves of this MAGA sickness as quickly as they  can.   I know that it won't happen overnight, and I know that some on the  other side would prefer to double down on MAGA, but it is critical for  our Nation's health, and, in fact, their party's health that they learn  this lesson.   Americans don't want government to be an endless circus of MAGA  insanity. They want leaders who will take their job seriously and work  across the aisle to solve our Nation's problems. They know we are not  going to succeed at everything, but they want good, earnest efforts at  trying. And when we try--when both sides try in good faith--we often  get a lot done, as this past Congress has shown.   If Republicans fail to accept this wisdom, they will only invite  further defeat in the future.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I just left the floor of the House for  one of the most emotional moments I have had in my career: the  valedictory of Nancy Pelosi, one of the greatest legislators and  greatest people I have ever met.   I first met Nancy Pelosi back in 1987. I was a Congressman, and we  had a little dinner group that would go out to dinner every Tuesday  night. One of the leaders of that group, George Miller, a Congressman  from California, came up to me. He said: In a few minutes, I am going  to introduce you to a new member of our group. She is the new  Congresswoman from San Francisco, and she is going to become the first  woman Speaker.   That was the first thing I heard about Nancy Pelosi, even before I  met her, and the moment I met her, I saw what he meant. It was obvious  that this new Member from the west coast of California had it all-- Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi.   She is the proud daughter of Baltimore's Little Italy neighborhood,  the estimable Representative from the State of California, and the  first woman ever as Speaker of the U.S. Congress.   It was amazing. She did an amazing job, and I wanted to go over to  the House floor where I had served 18 happy years, many of them as a  colleague of Speaker Pelosi and a friend, to just say thank you for the  amazing things she has done for our country.   Few in American history have been as effective, as driven, as  successful as Speaker Pelosi. She has transformed practically every  corner of American politics and unquestionably made America a better,  stronger nation. You know, I am known as having a lot of energy, but I  have never ever met anyone with more energy than Nancy D'Alesandro  Pelosi. She is always moving in many directions at once, and she has a  complete grasp of each direction in which she is moving even though she  is moving at the same time.   She is just an amazing person. She never forgot why she is in the  fight to begin with--as she said, the children, always her North Star,  helping the children of America. She did so much--her passion to pass  the ACA was for the children above all; and for women, where she broke,  of course, one of the greatest glass ceilings we have had, becoming the  first woman Speaker; and the American Rescue Plan and the Lilly  Ledbetter Act and the infrastructure bill and VAWA and pandemic relief;  climate change; repealing don't ask, don't tell--just a few of her  amazing achievements.   She taught me a whole lot. Nancy Pelosi paid attention to each of her  Members--I try to do the same--and she always taught the Members to be  unified. Her expression that she repeated over and over again, which I  have repeated to my caucus on so many occasions: Our unity is our  strength.   She would tell us, she would tell everyone: If everyone goes in his  or her own direction, you will get nothing done, but if we all come  together and everybody gives a little bit, we could get a lot done. And  she sure did.  [[Page S6766]]    I remember the moments that just became available on the tape when  she and I were at the ``secret place'' during the attack on this  Capitol, which so, so struck her, but there she was, cool, calm, and  collected. Together, we worked to try to get either the National Guard  or the police on the Hill, and we resolved that we were going to come  back and actually count the votes--heavily regarded as one of Speaker  Pelosi's greatest moments. And, again, she was cool, calm, collected.  She knew exactly what to do and how to do it.   So it is hard to fathom that very soon we will begin a new Congress  where she is no longer a member of the party leadership. In my time as  Democratic leader and as majority leader, she has been the best partner  and ally I could ask for, and we have also been friends. She shared the  joy of the birth of my children. I shared the joy of so many of the  good things that happened in her family. She would always be talking  about her family and always wanted to hear about mine. She was not only  a great legislator; she was a great human being.   Today particularly, I want to wish the very best to her family,  especially Paul. I cannot imagine how painful and scary it has been for  the Pelosis in the aftermath of Paul's attack, but, as usual, Speaker  Pelosi carried herself with the same courage, grace, and dignity that  she has always been true to.   Finally and maybe most importantly, Nancy Pelosi made our country a  much better place for countless women and girls from every walk of  life. Nancy Pelosi was the one to blaze the trail, but you can be  certain that countless other women will rise up in leadership in this  country because of what she has accomplished and how she inspired them.   I am going to have more to say in the weeks to come, but for now, let  me finish with this: To Nancy Pelosi, my dear, good, and close friend,  thank you. Thank you for being you. Thank you for dedicating your life  to public service. Thank you for teaching us so much. Thank you for  inspiring us all. It has been an honor of a lifetime to work with you.                              Order of Business    Now, one notice to the Members, who I know want to hear about the  schedule: We are working on an agreement on the marriage equality bill,  and I hope that we can have a vote on the motion to proceed shortly. If  we do not reach agreement, the vote is going to occur at 10 p.m. this  evening. Members should be aware, and Members should stay close.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we continue to work on an agreement on  the marriage equality bill. If we do not reach agreement, the vote on  the motion to proceed will occur at approximately 10 p.m. this evening,  so Members should stay close by.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 848, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the  resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to  and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.   The preamble was agreed to.   (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record  under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions introduced earlier today: S.

I further ask that the substitute at the desk be  considered and agreed to; the bill, as amended, be considered read a  third time and passed; and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 7132, which was received  from the House and is at the desk.    I further ask that the bill be considered read a third  time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, in a few moments, I am going to file  cloture on the substitute amendment for the Respect for Marriage Act,  as well as the underlying bill. The substitute I am filing will contain  the legislative text for the Senate session of the Respect for Marriage  Act negotiated by both parties. We will hold a cloture vote on the  substitute amendment when the Senate comes back into session on the  Monday after Thanksgiving.   Let me be clear. Passing the Respect for Marriage Act is not a matter  of if but only of when.   I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle who led this bill,  and I have zero doubt that Respect for Marriage will soon be the law of  the land.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 6487.
