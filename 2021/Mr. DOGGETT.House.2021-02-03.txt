 ``Reconciliation'' defines not only this budget process,  but, to most Americans, it simply means that you come together to  overcome prior differences. President Biden has made clear his desire  to reconcile, to come together. We welcome Republican proposals, but we  steadfastly reject Republican delay. Too many Americans are struggling  to let these filibustering Republican Senators repeat what happened  last year. You remember, Mr. Speaker. We waited, we waited, and we  waited more than seven months, and, finally, they yielded at the edge  of Christmas and gave us too little, too late.   After so much dithering, today represents an opportunity for  Republicans to reconcile. They need to reconcile with the truth. They  need to reconcile with the facts--not phony ``alternative facts,'' but  reality; to come together, with us, for American families who never  received those 100 million vaccines that President Trump told us would  be here last year, to reconcile with the reality of anxious Americans  today who are out there calling, standing in lines, and trying  anxiously to get some protection from this pandemic that wasn't  provided last year.   When the Senate is permitted to become a graveyard for important  legislation for American families, too many Americans are sent  prematurely to the graveyard.   Could anyone have imagined here a year ago that Trump Republicans who  refused to prepare and respond to this pandemic--remember when they  claimed that the virus would simply just disappear like a miracle?   Could anyone have imagined that now as a result of their approach,  almost half a million Americans are dead and more to come from their  vanishing virus?   As that virus has evolved to become more transmittable, cannot our  colleagues evolve to hear the need for vaccine, for food, and to not  having people sleep under bridges?   Let's reconcile, let's make amends, and let's deliver relief now.
