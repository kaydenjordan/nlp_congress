 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to H.R. 1689, the Private  Property Rights Protection Act of 2017.   While I believe this bill is well intentioned, it is the wrong  approach to a serious problem. It seeks to prevent abuse of eminent  domain power, but its provisions could cripple the finances of State  and local governments without even providing a remedy to the victims of  an unjust taking.   In Kelo v. City of New London, the Supreme Court upheld the right of  a municipality to use eminent domain authority to take private property  and to transfer it to another private entity for a public purpose.  Building on a century of precedent defining public use to include a  public purpose, the Court held such a transfer did not violate the  Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause, which provides that no person's  private property shall be taken for public use without just  compensation.   Critics of the Kelo decision believe that the Court overreached and  that eminent domain should be exercised only when the taken property  will be owned by the government or by a private entity operating as a  public utility.                                time  1545    H.R. 1689 would overturn Kelo by prohibiting any State or local  government that receives Federal economic development funds from using  eminent domain to transfer private property to another private entity  for the purpose of economic development.   The bill broadly defines economic development funds to include any  Federal funds distributed to States or localities under laws designed  to improve or increase their economies. Should a State or local  government violate this prohibition, it is subject to the loss of all  such funds for 2 years.   This draconian remedy could potentially devastate the finances of  State  [[Page H6613]]  and local governments. Even projects unrelated to takings could lose  funding, and cities could face bankruptcy simply by incorrectly  guessing whether a given project would sufficiently qualify as being  for a public use. The potential loss of such funding would also have a  chilling effect on a government's willingness to use eminent domain to  promote legitimate economic development projects.   Even if a government never takes a prohibited action, it would likely  be adversely impacted by this bill. Just the potential loss of  significant Federal funding may make it impossible for a government to  sell municipal bonds or could require a government to pay inordinate  interest rates given the possibility that it might, at some point in  the future, use eminent domain improperly and thereby lose all Federal  economic aid and, with it, the ability to repay the bonds.   The power of eminent domain is an extraordinary one and it should be  used with great care. Historically, there are examples of States and  localities abusing eminent domain for purely private gain or to favor  one community at the expense of another. When used inappropriately,  this power has wrecked communities for projects, resulting in little  economic benefit.   When used appropriately, however, eminent domain is an important  tool, making possible transportation networks, irrigation projects, and  other important public works that support communities and are integral  to their economic and social well-being.   Unfortunately, this bill's vague definitions may prohibit projects  that have a genuine public purpose while allowing others that  historically have abused eminent domain.   For example, this bill allows use of eminent domain to give property  to a private party ``such as a common carrier that makes the property  available for use by the general public as of right.'' That would seem  to include a stadium, which is privately owned and available for use by  the general public as of right.   On the other hand, communities could be barred from using eminent  domain to pursue affordable housing projects if they are built using a  public-private partnership, such as the HOPE VI program, which uses  Federal money to encourage private development of mixed-income housing.   Yet another shortcoming of the bill is that it does not actually help  an aggrieved property owner or tenant because it would not allow them  to sue to stop the allegedly prohibited taking. The bill only  authorizes suit after a condemnation proceeding has concluded, when it  is too late.   In addition, injured persons would not be entitled to any damages  other than the just compensation they got at the time of the taking.  All they could get is the psychic satisfaction they may receive from  bankrupting their community after the fact.   I would also point out that this bill is unnecessary, since more than  40 States have already moved aggressively to narrow their eminent  domain laws in the 13 years since Kelo was decided.   Finally, H.R. 1689 undermines federalism, and it may raise  constitutional concerns. Subject to the Takings Clause, local land use  decisions are generally left to the judgments of State and local  governments, which are in the best position to weigh local conditions  and competing interests. This is the essence of federalism, and  Congress should not be in the business of sitting as a national zoning  board.   Also, the loss of all economic funding, even for projects that may  have nothing to do with takings, is so draconian that it may amount to  an unconstitutional coercion of State and local governments.   Accordingly, I oppose this bill, and I would simply make two comments  to amplify on what I said.   If you want to stop improper takings, all right, but have a proper  remedy. Allow the alleged victim of the improper taking to go to court,  sue for an injunction to stop the improper taking, and get monetary  damages, if any. That would be at least a reasonable remedy.   Instead, this bill says that you can't go to court to get an  injunction; you can't get damages. All you can do is wait until after  the improper taking has occurred--you already lost your property--then  you can go to court; and if the court finds you are right, that it was  an improper use of the eminent domain procedure, then the government  will lose economic aid for 2 years. It doesn't help the plaintiff. It  doesn't help the property owner. All it does is bankrupt the community.  So what is the point?   Second, as I mentioned before, this could injure communities that  never do an improper taking because, if I am the mayor, I may not be  able to float a bond lest somebody think that maybe my successor once  or twice removed may, 20 years down the line or 10 years down the line,  do an improper taking. And then the Federal Government would come in,  stop all economic aid, and we wouldn't be able to repay the bonds.   So this would impair the ability of States or local governments to  bond for projects. It wouldn't help the victim--there may even be no  victim--but it would hurt the government. It makes no sense. This is a  real problem.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I first comment, the gentleman from Wisconsin says that  we object that the penalty is too severe. We do not object that the  penalty is too severe. We object that the penalty is irrelevant, that  the penalty won't help the plaintiff. It won't help to prevent the  misuse, number one. And number two, it could be a plot that would have  the practical effect, when there is no misuse, no taking at all, of  having a deleterious effect on  [[Page H6614]]  the community's bond rating, even when there is no taking.   If you are going to do this bill and you want to narrow the  definition of a public purpose, which is the purpose of the bill, I am  not sure we can do that, given the fact that the Supreme Court has  decided what it is. Assuming we could do that, fine, but have an  appropriate remedy, a remedy that would enable the plaintiffs to get an  injunction against the taking, that would give them monetary damages,  which is the way we normally do things, not a remedy that will not  prevent the taking and only will damage a community, whether or not it  does any improper takings. That doesn't make sense.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman. The standard way  in which someone can vindicate rights is to sue. If the local  government wants to abuse the rights of a homeowner, let's say, by an  improper taking, the proper way for us to help is to give them the  right to sue and to get injunctive relief. Let them go into Federal  court and get an injunction which says: Do not tear down the building.  Do not take away title. You can't do it because this is too broad a use  of taking. It is a violation of the Fifth Amendment.   This bill won't actually help that person because it gives them no  rights except the right after they have lost the property. It gives  them the right to go to court and not get any relief for themselves,  not get the property back, not get any monetary damages, not get an  injunction. It gives them the right to go into court and seek to block  financial aid to the community. So they can say, ``I took revenge on  the community,'' but what is the point? It doesn't help them.    I think there are such decisions, and this would seem to  violate them.    Yes. The Medicaid decision said you cannot draft the  local government to exercise a function for the Federal Government,  which this would seem to do also.    That is exactly what it said.    I agree with the gentleman. I think the gentleman from  Maryland makes a very valid point.   Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, I oppose this bill. I would  simply say: We agree there is a serious problem with abuse of eminent  domain, and we agree there may very well be decent legislation that  would do something about the problem.   If you are going to do it, draft legislation that really deals with  the problem, that is constitutional, that will protect the small person  such as Mrs. Kelo but that won't bankrupt the community in a way that  is probably unconstitutional anyway.   This bill is not the solution. We could, on a bipartisan basis, work  for an intelligent solution, but this is not it. Accordingly, I urge a  ``no'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the defeat of this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5954, the Anti-terrorism  Clarification Act of 2018. This bipartisan bill, of which I am proud to  be the lead Democratic sponsor, amends the Anti-Terrorism Act, or ATA,  to make it easier for American victims of international terrorism to  have their day in court, to obtain some measure of justice for their  injuries, and to hold terrorists accountable for their heinous acts.   The ATA provides that U.S. nationals, or their survivors or heirs,  may recover treble damages and attorney's fees and costs for any civil  action arising from an injury sustained by an act of international  terrorism.   H.R. 5954 seeks to minimize certain procedural obstacles that ATA  plaintiffs have encountered in their attempts to obtain full relief for  their injuries. For example, the ATA contains an exception for injuries  caused by an ``act of war,'' which it defines, in relevant part, as  including ``armed conflict between military forces of any origin.''   Unfortunately, this ambiguous statutory language has led to  considerable confusion among Federal courts as to the proper scope of  the act of war exception, and even as to the proper kind of analysis to  apply when the armed conflict at issue involves a terrorist group such  as Hamas or Hezbollah.    For example, in one case, the court found that the act of war  exception prevented U.S. civilians injured by Hezbollah rocket attacks  into Israel from pursuing their claims under the ATA. Yet, in another  case, a different court concluded that gunshots fired into Israel by  Hamas that resulted in injury to a U.S. civilian did not constitute an  act of war and, therefore, was compensable.   H.R. 5954 resolves this confusion by specifying, among other things,  that a foreign terrorist organization or a specially designated global  terrorist, as designated by the executive branch, is not a ``military  force'' and, therefore, is subject to ATA liability.   This change makes it clear that violent actions targeted at U.S.  civilians by a terrorist group are acts of terrorism that could give  rise to liability under the ATA. Indeed, to read the act of war  exception otherwise, as some courts have done, threatens to undermine  the ATA's entire purpose.   Even if victims successfully obtain a judgment under the ATA, many  plaintiffs find it impossible to obtain full compensation for their  injuries because there are not sufficient assets available to satisfy  the judgment. This bill would address that problem as well.   Under current law, terrorism victims can reach assets blocked  pursuant to the Trading with the Enemy Act or the International  Emergency Economic Powers Act to satisfy terrorism-related court  judgments. This bill would simply allow terrorism victims also to  attach assets that have been blocked pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics  Kingpin Designation Act.   The final hurdle to bringing ATA claims that this bill helps overcome  is an overly narrow reading of personal jurisdiction that some courts  have applied, which has prevented some victims from bringing those  responsible for their injuries to justice.   Most recently, this occurred in the Second Circuit's misguided  decision in Sokolow v. PLO. In Sokolow, several plaintiffs, including  Morris and Eva Waldman, two of my constituents, sought relief under the  ATA for injuries sustained as a result of various terrorist attacks in  Israel that killed or injured U.S. citizens.   Although a district court awarded the plaintiffs $655 million in  damages, the Second Circuit reversed, wrongly concluding, in my view,  that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over the  defendants in that case; namely, the Palestinian Liberation  Organization and the Palestinian Authority. The court reasoned that the  defendants' contacts, including maintaining offices in Washington and  New York and the activities associated with those offices, were  insufficient to support personal jurisdiction.   This bill responds to the Second Circuit's decision by deeming a  party to have consented to personal jurisdiction if the party accepts  foreign assistance of any kind from the United States beginning 120  days after the bill's enactment date. In the case of the PLO, or  affiliated entities, it would also deem  [[Page H6618]]  consent if the defendant maintains an office in the U.S. jurisdiction  120 days or more after the enactment date. By undertaking one of these  acts, a potential defendant is sufficiently on notice that it is  consenting to personal jurisdiction in an ATA case.   My support for H.R. 5954 is part of my longstanding efforts to secure  a measure of justice for terrorism victims, including leading House  efforts to reauthorize the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund. I was also  the lead House Democratic sponsor of the Justice Against Sponsors of  Terrorism Act, which helped ensure that 9/11 victims and other victims  of terrorism on American soil can bring their claims in court,  regardless of where the foreign conduct occurred. This bill is a  natural extension of those efforts.   For these reasons, I support this important bipartisan measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, although nothing can ever bring back the lives lost to  terrorism or repair the emotional scars of the survivors, terrorism  victims deserve the chance to achieve some justice through our courts.  Congress' purpose in passing the ATA was to give them that chance.   I believe H.R. 5954 will help further that purpose by addressing  procedural barriers that have unfairly stood in their way.   In closing, I thank Judiciary Committee Chairman  Bob Goodlatte for  his leadership on this important measure. I strongly support H.R. 5954,  and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
