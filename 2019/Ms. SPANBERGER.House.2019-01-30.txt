 Madam Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the life of  Dr. James Harold Bowles. Dr. Bowles was born in June 1921, and raised  on the Pea Ridge in Goochland County, Virginia.   Dr. Bowles served in the U.S. Army and graduated from Virginia Union  University before attending medical school and returning home to  Goochland to open his medical practice. As he began his career serving  his patients, Dr. Bowles continued his service as the first African  American to serve on the Goochland County Board of Supervisors where he  worked to strengthen our community for 32 years.   He was a lifetime member of the NAACP, a trustee of Emmaus Baptist  Church, and an active member of community organizations across central  Virginia. Above all, he was a beloved husband, father, brother, uncle,  grandfather, and great-grandfather. He left an indelible mark on our  community.   Madam Speaker, I leave you with the advice Dr. Bowles frequently  gave. May it guide our work here in this Chamber.   SMILE. S, seek to understand before being understood; M, make others  feel important; I, it is not about me; L, listen twice as much as you  speak; E, emphatically, enthusiastically, and quickly admit it when you  are wrong.   When you do this, dialogue can be easily achieved.                            ____________________
