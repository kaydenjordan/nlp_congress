That same  day, I joined with Finance Committee Ranking Member Wyden of Oregon to  introduce a bill entitled ``Tax Extender Disaster Relief Act of 2019''  to extend these two dozen tax provisions through 2019.   I very much thank Ranking Member Wyden for his cooperation on this  effort. Actually, we have a lot of cooperation on a lot of different  subjects within the Finance Committee.   Now, unfortunately, we are still waiting on House Democrats to send  us a tax bill that includes those provisions so taxpayers who have  relied on them can finish their 2018 tax returns. I have had some  discussions with the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and I  don't have any reason to believe he doesn't believe some of these  extenders should be extended. I suppose because they are new to run the  House of Representatives, and they have dissension within their own  caucus, it takes a while to get an active group of people pushing for  this particular legislation, but it ought to be easy to happen because  these tax provisions have traditionally been extended every 2 or 3  years over the last 20 years--maybe longer than that in some cases.   I remind my colleagues in the House of Representatives that taxpayers  have all but run out of time. Part of my purpose in introducing the Tax  Extender and Disaster Relief Act way back in February was to provide  additional certainty for the current year for those businesses that  have made use of these tax credits in the past.   I noted that in most cases, Congress enacted those provisions to  provide an incentive for taxpayers to engage in certain actions like  investment and job creation.   In February, I also reminded my colleagues that those incentives are  most effective when taxpayers can rely on them during the tax year. For  the most part, over the last three decades, they have had that  certainty by the renewal of these tax provisions.   Regrettably, we are now one-third of the way through 2019 with no  certainty for affected taxpayers in sight. I also said, in my February  remarks, that my broader objective of including an extension through  2019 was so we could have some maneuvering room to examine the  temporary provisions overall and try to identify longer term  solutions. Through efforts in the last Congress, we identified  potential long-term solutions for two of them--the short-line railroad  tax credit and the biodiesel tax credit--but we have the opportunity  now to do more.    While we continue to try to help taxpayers who still need to resolve  their 2018 tax returns, we need to press ahead on more permanent  solutions so we can end Congress's continual bad habit of waiting until  the eleventh hour or months after to extend temporary tax policy.   Accordingly, today, I am announcing, along with Ranking Member Wyden,  that the Finance Committee will form several bipartisan task forces to  examine the temporary tax policies. These task forces will consist of  members of the Finance Committee and will focus on provisions that  expired or will expire between December 31, 2017, and December 31 of  this year. That is a total of 42 expiring tax provisions.   Each task force will be charged with examining temporary tax policies  within one of five identified issue areas. These issue areas are:  workforce and community development, health taxes, energy, business  cost recovery, and a combined group consisting of individual, excise  taxes, and other temporary policies.   We will ask the task forces to work with the stakeholders, other  Senate offices, and interested parties to consider the original  purposes of the policies and whether the need for the provisions  continues today. If so, we will ask the task force to identify possible  solutions that would provide long-term certainty in these areas. That  may mean the credit or deduction phases out over a period of years to  provide an affected  [[Page S2906]]  industry a glide path to self-sufficiency. In other cases, it may mean  the provision could be scaled back while still providing a sufficient  benefit for the affected industry or taxpayers in exchange for long- term certainty. If there is little or no case for continuing the  temporary policy, the task force should consider whether the provision  should be eliminated.   There may also be provisions that the task force identifies that  should be extended without reform. For these provisions, the task force  will have to consider whether a continued short-term extension is  sufficient to achieve the policy goals, whether a longer term extension  is desirable to force a future Congress to reevaluate the provision  down the road, or if permanency is warranted.   This is particularly relevant for the temporary tax policies relating  to healthcare. For these, we will ask the task force to focus on  whether the tax policy should be extended and for what duration. Of  course, we will leave the evaluation of the underlying healthcare  policy to the health experts.   In all, the task forces will work to identify reform proposals, like  those identified for the short-line railroad tax credit and the  biodiesel tax credit last year, so we can end the policy of having  Congress always kick the can down the road each time, or, as is the  case with 2018, an even worse policy of doing the kicking months after  the year has ended.   If Congress is going to use temporary tax policy, taxpayers should be  able to count on it for the intended period. Moreover, the intended  policy should be clear so that taxpayers do not fall into the trap of  relying on a provision simply because Congress has created the  expectation that the provisions will be consistently extended even well  after the fact.   Taxpayers who have been relying on these provisions have been doing  what Congress has wanted them to do. That happens to be free-market  investing in certain types of property, hiring new employees, or taking  other types of action. We shouldn't punish them for doing what Congress  intended with these tax provisions.   Additionally, we will have a sixth task force to examine the related  issue of temporary disaster tax relief. It will consider whether we  should have a core set of permanent proposals so taxpayers who have  suffered through devastating disasters--like with the floods, most  recently, in my home State of Iowa--don't have to wait for Congress to  act before they can start rebuilding their lives, their small  businesses, or their farms.   We have asked the task forces to begin their work right away, and we  expect them to complete their efforts by the end of June. This should  provide adequate time to identify possible long-term solutions that  could be enacted this year to end the annual extenders drama and  provide certainty to the taxpayers who utilize those provisions.   We will continue to work with the House of Representatives to resolve  the situation with respect to the 2018 temporary policies and to  provide relief for all of those affected by the disasters of 2018 and  so far this year, but we shouldn't wait any longer to start laying the  groundwork to deal with all of these temporary tax policies as  permanently as possible.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am placing a hold on the nomination of  David M. Satterfield, who has been nominated to serve as Ambassador to  Turkey. My objection comes down to one increasingly irrefutable point:  the State Department's, through Ambassador Satterfield, consistent  efforts to protect the Palestinian Authority and Palestine Liberation  Organization from liability and thereby undermine the rights of  American victims of Palestinian terrorism. This stands in sharp  contrast to the intent of Congress.   Last year, I introduced the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act, ATCA,  in response to recent court decisions that gutted the jurisdictional  reach of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992, which I also authored. These  decisions made it substantially more difficult for American victims to  hold sponsors of international terrorism accountable in our nation's  courts.   The ATCA expressed a clear principle: If you accept taxpayer-backed  assistance or maintain a presence in the United States, then you should  be answerable in our courts if you are alleged to have supported  terrorism that harmed or killed Americans.   The bipartisan bill was considered through regular order, with  markups in both Chambers, as a standalone bill, passed Congress without  objection, and was signed into law by President Trump in October. Never  once did the State Department or the administration raise a single  concern.   Yet, 2 months later, at the end of the 115th Congress, the State  Department began directly lobbying Congress for a ``fix'' to the ATCA  to remove certain forms of assistance from the statute, thereby  allowing defendants like the Palestinian Authority to enjoy such  benefits without risk of liability. Ambassador Satterfield led the  State Department team, with whom my staff attempted to negotiate in  good faith over several weeks at the end of 2018 and early this year.   I offered numerous compromise proposals to the State Department,  including delays of the foreign assistance provisions, a rule of  construction to aid victims, and even a complete strike from the ATCA  of the assistance that State Department deems so valuable. Never once,  however, did State or Ambassador Satterfield demonstrate interest in  supporting language that would tangibly benefit victims. Rather, my  bill seemed an annoyance to State's priorities, and Ambassador  Satterfield on several occasions vocalized his concern about the law's  impact on the Palestinian Authority, who have been found liable in U.S.  courts for supporting terrorist attacks against Americans.   When my staff asked for any alternative ideas they would support to  help victims, State's team came back empty-handed, and after I found  bipartisan support for a compromise proposal, the State Department made  clear to other offices that it would not support the compromise unless  and until Congress expressly protects the Palestinian Authority's  presence in the United States.   I refuse to assist the State Department in silencing any litigation  arguments of U.S. victims of terrorism.   I also understand that recent efforts in the House of Representatives  have proved futile in finding language that both benefits American  victims and gets support from the State Department. I am tired of our  State Department putting the interests of alleged sponsors of terrorism  over those of our own citizens. The State Department should work in  good faith with Congress and victims by unambiguously demonstrating its  support for restoring jurisdiction over sponsors of terrorism.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the misuse of opioids is a national  crisis. Every single day, more than 130 people in this country overdose  on these drugs, with tragic results.   In 2017, there were more than 70,000 drug overdose-related deaths in  the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control. These  deaths eclipsed the number that were due to guns or automobile crashes.   May 12 through 18 is National Prevention Week, which is dedicated to  increasing public awareness of substance abuse disorders. Addiction  exists everywhere. We have taken steps in the past to fight this  epidemic.   We passed comprehensive substance abuse and treatment legislation in  2016 and again last year. However, the opioid epidemic continues to  destroy lives and communities. We need to remain committed to defeat  this crisis.   This week also marks the seventh anniversary of my investigation,  with former Senator Baucus, into opioid manufacturers' connections to  medical groups and physicians who advocated for the increased use of  opioids. As senior members of the Senate Finance Committee in 2012, we  sought documents and financial information from three opioid makers, in  a period when deaths from opioid overdoses were skyrocketing. News  reports of that time suggested that opioid makers may have initiated  conflicts of interest to encourage the prescribing of opioids.   More recent news reports confirm that we had very good reason to  launch this oversight work. For example, yesterday, BBC News published  an article concerning opioid makers' sponsorship, in the early 2000s,  of so-called educational meetings for pain specialists from the United  Kingdom. The doctors, whose opioid prescribing rates were being  monitored by opioid makers, were invited to New York City, where they  would stay in posh hotels and attend Broadway shows at a drugmaker's  expense, BBC reported. As reportedly shared by a doctor who attended  one of these trips: ``I feel very ashamed . . . I was just a guinea pig  to promote the prescribing of a class of drug.''   I remain concerned that opioid-related deaths over the last decade  may have been fueled by misinformation and marketing practices embraced  by drugmakers and the medical organizations to which they donated.   What I said 7 years ago remains true today: ``Doctors and patients  should know if the medical literature and groups that guide [opioids']  use are paid for by the drugs' manufacturers and if so, [by] how  much.'' As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I intend to  continue my oversight work in this area, including by convening a  congressional hearing later this summer.   I also believe that we need to do more to ensure that Americans have  access to effective recovery treatment options. The recent arrests in  multiple States of those who operated sham treatment facilities for  addicts point to a problem. Moreover, we have reason to be concerned  about the lack of information available to the public about the most  promising treatment options available.   A related issue has been the lack of adequate, national standards of  care in the addiction treatment field. That is why I joined several of  my colleagues in sponsoring bipartisan legislation that calls for the  development of new quality measures to improve treatment for Americans  battling opioid and substance addiction. This measure directs the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to work with a coalition of  healthcare providers to identify quality measures to be used to assess  the effectiveness of substance use disorder treatment programs.   In 2016, I also supported the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery  Act, or CARA. This bipartisan measure was enacted after the Senate  Judiciary Committee approved it during my tenure as chairman. It  includes a number of provisions I authored.   The causes of the opioid epidemic are complicated and its effects are  widespread. It is impossible to solve this national crisis overnight.  We must continue our efforts at the local, State, and Federal level to  break the cycle of addiction.                            ____________________
