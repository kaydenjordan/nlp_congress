 Mr. Speaker, one of the best ways for workers to get  the pay and benefits that they deserve and to raise their families and  provide for them is to join a labor union.   Unions have helped millions of American families join the middle  class, including thousands in Rhode Island. The  [[Page H1542]]  freedom to join a union is the most fundamental right afforded to all  workers in this country.   Unfortunately, that right is constantly under attack by big companies  that spend millions and millions of dollars engaging in intimidation  and retaliation against those seeking to exercise their right to  unionize.   What is worse is that companies are often allowed to write off the  expenses for union busting from their taxes. You heard that right. All  of us, the taxpayers of America, are paying for companies to intimidate  workers out of joining unions.   This has to stop. That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the No Tax  Breaks for Union Busting Act, led by Representative Norcross because  enough is enough. We need to make it easier in this country for workers  to join a union if they choose to do so, and we certainly should not be  giving tax breaks to companies to intimidate workers out of exercising  that right.                            ____________________
