 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement  of one of Arkansas' most-admired sports journalists, Clay Henry.   Clay has retired after decades of covering Arkansas Razorback  athletics, notably the publisher of Hawgs Illustrated, the weekly  publication dedicated to the coverage of our beloved Hogs.   It was natural for Clay, given that he was the son of another sports  legend in Arkansas journalism, Orville Henry. I am quite confident his  introduction to Razorback sports was while he was still in diapers.  Then later as a stat man for the Arkansas Gazette at the age of 14. He  was produced by the best, tutored by the best, and like those before  him, became the best.   Stops along the way at publications like the Log Cabin Democrat in  Conway and the Tulsa World helped prepare him for a gig in 1992 with a  new Arkansas magazine called Hawgs Illustrated. Leaving the Tulsa World  for an upstart might have been a tough decision for a lot of people,  but with Clay, it just seemed a natural fit. After all, Clay was a Hog,  not a Sooner.   Clay partnered to buy the publication with George Billingsley before  eventually selling to Stephens Media, then later to the Hussman  Company, WEHCO Media, which became the sole owner. In every step, the  common denominator that found its way into the mailboxes of Hog fans  everywhere was Clay Henry. Lots of contributing writers, amazing  photographers, great salesmen, but only one Clay Henry. He served 27  years as publisher.   Now, it is off to the Norfork River where the trout now have a full- time enemy--that is, when Jean Ann, his bride of 43 years doesn't have  him doing honey-dos, or assuming the Razorbacks don't come calling.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Clay for a journalism career of  enormous success and professionalism. The Hog Nation is forever  grateful.                                    Canoo     Madam Speaker, more than a half century ago, Americans  walked on the Moon for the first time. Now, a new lunar mission is upon  us in 2024, and the Third District of Arkansas will support this next  step in space exploration.   NASA has chosen Canoo, a high-tech mobility company with announced  headquarters and facilities in northwest Arkansas, to produce a  transportation fleet for astronauts, part of the Artemis program. That  is right, as the crew prepares for their historic launch, they will be  moved by state-of-the-art vehicles manufactured in Bentonville,  Arkansas.   A demonstration of ingenuity and the Natural State's focus on  harnessing emerging technology and novel ideas, great things can be  achieved when the public and private sectors work together.   I am so proud that the future of space discovery is being supported  by the Third District and our incredible workforce. The pioneering  spirit of Arkansas and America will be on display as fully suited  astronauts ride to their liftoff location.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Canoo for the role they are playing in  such an incredible moment in American history. From Arkansas to the  Moon--and eventually on to Mars--their work is driving innovation  forward.                            ____________________
