 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to address a matter that I  believe should alarm every Member of this Senate, regardless of party,  and that is the President's and the executive branch's increasing use  of declared emergency powers to seize powers that are not lawfully  theirs to take.   Just in the last week, we have seen two examples of this. We saw an  administration claim emergency authority to move forward with an arms  sale to Saudi Arabia and others. Last week, we also saw the President  claim emergency powers in order to threaten an escalating set of  tariffs on the country of Mexico.   Earlier this year, the President claimed emergency powers to divert  funds away from important military and national security priorities to  fund part of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. There was a headline,  May 10, 2019, ``Pentagon Shifts $1.5 Billion to Border Wall From Afghan  War Budget and Other Military Projects.''   I, personally, oppose the outcomes the President is seeking in each  of these emergency declarations. I oppose selling weapons to Saudi  Arabia under the current circumstances. I oppose putting huge tariffs  on Mexico that will harm American consumers and American businesses. I  oppose diverting moneys from the Defense Department to spend on a  wasteful, ineffective wall along the entire U.S. border.   Those are my views with respect to these outcomes. I suggest that all  of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, should focus not only on the  outcomes of each of these emergency declarations but the means the  President is using to achieve them because, in each case, the President  is claiming emergency powers to justify these actions. If this Senate  stands by and allows that to happen, we will be surrendering our  coequal powers as a separate branch of government and, in the process,  undermining the integrity of our democracy itself. We should not leave  this to the courts. We should not say, well, we don't think the  President should be able to declare these emergency powers, but we are  not going to deal with it here in the Senate; we are going to leave  that to the third branch of government. That will undermine our  democracy and this institution. Whether you like the outcomes or  dislike the outcomes, the claim of emergency power to achieve these  goals establishes a terrible precedent for our democracy, and we cannot  sit idly by and allow that claim to continue unchecked.   I want to start by reviewing the Trump administration's invocation of  so-called emergency powers to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and others.  The President's desire to please the Saudi regime and promote the Crown  Prince's reckless conduct apparently knows no limits. It is a  bottomless pit. We all recall President Trump vetoed a resolution that  passed both Chambers of Congress with bipartisan support to end U.S.  military support for the disastrous war in Yemen. When his own CIA  Director concluded that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia was complicit  in the murder of U.S. resident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the  President refused to hold the Crown Prince accountable. Instead, he ran  to his defense saying that ``it could very well be that the Crown  Prince had knowledge of this tragic event--maybe he did and maybe he  didn't!''   That was the President's attitude, go ahead and murder a resident of  the United States, go ahead and murder a columnist for a major U.S.  paper. It doesn't really matter.   The administration went on to flout the law by refusing to provide a  determination to Congress on whether the Saudi Crown Prince was  responsible for the murder of Khashoggi. Despite the fact that Saudi  leaders have openly talked about acquiring a nuclear weapon, the  President is singularly determined to conclude a nuclear cooperation  agreement with the Saudis, attempting to dodge oversight and  accountability at every turn.   That was just the prelude to what the President did last week when  Congress was in its work period. The President invoked a so-called  emergency authority to sell precision-guided munitions and other arms  to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and others. Why? It is pretty obvious. He  knew that arms sale would be challenged by Congress, and it would be  very likely that Congress would not approve that sale.   What happened? Here are the facts. Under the law, the administration  must submit a formal notification to Congress of a proposed arms sale,  if it is large enough. After the sale is notified, Congress has a short  window in which we can act to block the sale. We would do that by  introducing and passing a joint resolution of disapproval through the  House and the Senate. The President knew the Congress was not going to  support that sale and that we would likely vote to block it. What did  he do? Instead of trying persuasion, instead of going through the  constitutional process, the legal process, he decided to fake an  emergency because under the law, the President can bypass congressional  review if he states that ``an emergency exists,'' which requires the  sale to be made immediately ``in the national security interests of the  United States.''   By making that declaration, the President was able to commit an end- run against Congress, and we should not allow it to happen because it  is abuse of power and, I believe, an abuse of the law.   That emergency authority has only been used a handful of times in the  last few decades. In fact, the last President to invoke it was  President George H. W. Bush following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  Let's be clear. There is no emergency here, and the President is  invoking it under false pretenses simply to hand another favor to the  Saudi Crown Prince.   Where are these bombs and munitions going to end up? The war in Yemen  and the Saudi-led coalition's war against the Houthis in Yemen has  raged for 5 years now, costing the lives of more than  100,000 civilians. Millions are on the brink of starvation. The United  Nations has declared Yemen the world's largest humanitarian  catastrophe. Where are we 5 years into this war? The Houthis are more  entrenched and militarily sophisticated. Iranian influence in the  region has expanded.    In short, the Trump administration's strategy has been totally  counterproductive. Instead of prioritizing a diplomatic solution of the  conflict, the President is fueling the fire and perpetuating a  humanitarian crisis.   What was the claimed emergency here, the emergency the President  invoked to try to bypass the Congress  [[Page S3179]]  and sell these weapons to Saudi Arabia? The administration cites in its  documents, in its notice, Iranian malign activity in the region. The  administration claims that the ``rapidly-evolving security situation in  the region requires an accelerated delivery of certain capabilities to  U.S. partners in the region.''   We all know that Iran is a malign actor in the region. This is  nothing new. It has kept the Assad regime in Syria alive. It supports  the Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and a  constellation of Shia militia groups in Iraq--all of which have  contributed to instability in the region for a very long time.   The administration has not explained why all of a sudden this ongoing  malign activity justifies an emergency declaration to circumvent this  body in the House of Representatives, nor has it shown how the delivery  of these weapons is going to provide some kind of an immediate benefit  to either the United States or our allies.   What we really have is, this administration has, under the direction  of National Security Advisor John Bolton, in a calculated effort,  dramatically increased tensions with Iran to a point where we could  easily have a miscalculation that leads to war.   This administration has ripped up the nuclear agreement, choked off  Iran's oil exports, and, against the advice of America's military  leadership, designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard a terrorist  organization while accelerating the movement of American ships and  bombers into the Persian Gulf.   Maybe most troubling is that even when given multiple opportunities,  Secretary of State Pompeo, has refused to acknowledge that the 2001  authorization to use military force, AUMF, would not justify the  administration taking military action against Iran. The  administration's failure to make that very clear shows the need and  urgency for us to act in these areas. In fact, what we know from our  intelligence communities, cited in public reports, there is zero  evidence that Iran and al-Qaida have carried out any joint operations  against the United States. In fact, to the contrary, ISIS, which we  know is an al-Qaida descendant in Syria and Iraq, took credit for a  2017 attack on Iran's Parliament building and tomb of the Islamic  Republic's founder, the Ayatollah Khomeini, which according to Iran's  state media killed at least 12 people.   Anyone who knows anything about the history in this region knows that  while Iran is a malign actor, they have been an enemy of al-Qaida and  an enemy of ISIS--Iran, of course, being a majority Shia country and  ISIS and al-Qaida being extreme elements of a Sunni ideology.   As we sit here and watch the President invoking these emergency  powers to undermine the separation of powers, we are not doing our job  so we need to begin to take action. Yet what the President is learning  from our inaction is the ability to continue down this road of claiming  emergency powers to take further measures.   As I said just last week, we also saw the President invoke emergency  powers to put in place a mechanism to dramatically increase tariffs on  Mexico over a period of time. That, of course, would be incredibly  costly to American consumers, costly to American businesses, but it is  also incredibly costly to our system of government and separation of  powers, where article I clearly gives this Congress power in the area  of setting trade policy. Yet where are we? We are AWOL, totally AWOL  when it comes to standing up for the Constitution. We are allowing this  President to, time after time, claim emergency powers to accomplish  certain goals. Some may justify it by saying: OK. I agree with the  outcome in that particular use of emergency powers.   This pattern of conduct is going to set a very dangerous precedent.  While some of my colleagues may like some of these outcomes today, you  have another President in the White House who starts claiming emergency  powers left and right, and all of a sudden, I can assure you, my  colleagues will take a different view. This is the moment when people  need to come together and stand up for the Constitution and do our jobs  as a separate branch of government. We can't contract this all out to  the courts to make these determinations. Of course, earlier in the  year, the President claimed emergency powers to divert moneys from  important national security efforts, including the effort in  Afghanistan and to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.   Again, I suggest, don't be lured into going along with this process  simply because you like the outcome. We can disagree about whether it  is smart and cost-effective to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico  border, but we should not disagree that it is an abuse of power to  continue to manufacture or claim emergency authorities to override the  will of Congress.   This is an important moment, especially as we consider the fact that  Secretary Pompeo has not clearly indicated that the 2001 AUMF does not  give this administration or any administration the power to use  military action against Iran.   If we don't start standing up and doing our job, we will be  undermining important constitutional principles that the Founders put  in place to prevent an Executive from running wild over the legislative  process. So I hope, as the Republicans and the Democrats see the  President invoke these emergency powers of whether to sell arms to  Saudi Arabia, to increase tariffs on Mexico, or to build a wall, we  recognize that we are going down a very, very slippery slope and that  we have a constitutional obligation to protect our democracy and the  principles outlined in the Constitution.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I oppose the nomination of Andrew  Saul to be Commissioner of Social Security. I am deeply concerned about  the treatment of unions who represent workers at the Social Security  Administration, and Mr. Saul declined to give meaningful assurances  that anything will change under his leadership. Americans everywhere  count on the Federal employees of the Social Security Administration to  ensure fairness and efficiency in the benefits provided by Social  Security for retirees, people with disabilities, and surviving spouses  and dependents.   The Social Security Administration demonstrated particular hostility  towards its workforce in the way it implemented Executive orders that  were issued by President Trump on May 25, 2018, which would have  undermined lawful civil service protections. Despite a court order  striking down significant portions of these Executive orders,  management at the Social Security Administration has continued to  insist on positions in collective bargaining agreements that closely  mirror the invalidated Executive orders. The Federal Service Impasses  Panel recently imposed a contract on one of the unions representing  Social Security workers that hews closely to the Executive orders,  including provisions to deny the union use of office space in  government buildings and slash the official time available to the union  to fulfill their statutory duties to represent workers.   When asked about these attacks on the rights of Social Security  workers, Mr. Saul provided only vague statements that included no  commitments to take meaningful action to improve labor practices at  Social Security. Workers at the Social Security Administration and the  American people who are counting on Social Security deserve better, and  I hope Mr. Saul will prove me wrong by proactively engaging with his  workforce and reversing the damage that has been done.
