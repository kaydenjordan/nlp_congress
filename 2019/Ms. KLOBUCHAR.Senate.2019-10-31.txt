 Mr. President, today I rise to honor and pay  tribute to my good friend Senator Kay Hagan.   When I think of Kay, I will always think of joy, as reflected by the  bright colors she used to love wearing. Regardless of how things could  get at times, her wonderful spirit would make it all seem better.   You could always count on Kay to look out for people, whether it was  restoring a program to pay tuition for Active-Duty servicemembers,  establishing stronger protections for victims of domestic violence, or  passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to stop pay discrimination.   Kay made history. She was the first woman Democratic Senator from  North Carolina and the State's second woman ever elected to the U.S.  Senate. I have always thought that the women of the Senate work harder,  work together, and get things done. Kay was definitely one of those  women.   In fact Kay, in her inimitable way, summed it up best when she said,  ``There are only two types of senators: those who'd spend all day on  their hair . . .  and the women senators.''   Kay loved to swim, and when she arrived as a new Senator in 2009, she  went down to the Senate pool only to find a sign outside that said  ``Men Only''--a fact that she mentioned during one of her first  speeches as a Senator without realizing media was present. When the  press started calling around to various offices asking about the ``men  only'' Senate pool, some were quick to push back on Kay's claim, so Kay  asked them to meet her down at the pool to see for themselves. Within a  day, the sign was changed to ``Co-Ed Aquatic Facility: Please Dress  Appropriately.'' As it turned out, four male Senators had been swimming  naked. But because of Kay Hagan, now all Senators can enjoy the pool,  and everyone wears ``appropriate attire''.   That is what I loved about working with Kay. She always looked out  for her colleagues. And so when Kay left the Senate, the women Senators  had a special farewell party for her next to the pool.   Kay's drive to get things done came in part from her family. Born in  Shelby, NC, as the second of three children and the only daughter, Kay  once remarked ``being the girl in the middle . . . I had to fight for  everything I got.''   And fight she did, rising from an internship in the U.S. Capitol in  the 1970s, where she operated the elevators for U.S. Senators, to  eventually becoming a Senator herself. In between, Kay served as State  senator for 10 years and was named as one of North Carolina's ``Ten  Most Effective Senators'' three terms in a row.   My friend, former Vice President Walter Mondale, once told me that  when elected officials gain power, they ``either grow or they swell.''  Kay was a Senator who grew.   Kay was one bright yellow ray of sunshine for everyone she touched-- the Senate, her beloved State of North Carolina, her friends, and her  family. As she struggled with her illness the last few years, her  loving husband, Chip, and their family were always at her side. I  encourage everyone to look up at the Sun and think of Kay.                            ____________________
