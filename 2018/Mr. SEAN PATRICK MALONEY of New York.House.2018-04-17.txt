 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  memorialize two beloved elected officials from the Hudson Valley who  passed away this weekend: Assemblyman Frank Skartados and Newburgh  mayor, Judy Kennedy.   First, Assemblyman Frank Skartados represented a number of  communities up and down the Hudson Valley. He lost a battle with cancer  early Sunday morning. Even though he was struggling through his  sickness, Frank still fought relentlessly for his neighbors up in  Albany.                                time  1045    Frank was an immigrant from Greece, grew up on a small Greek island,  came to America as a teenager, learned English, paid his way through  school, and built a successful business. He went on to represent the  people of the Hudson Valley and the State Assembly for nearly a decade.  Now, if that is not the American Dream, I don't know what is. My heart  goes out to the Skartados family and to everyone else grieving his  loss. We will miss Frank sorely.   I would also like to memorialize Judy Kennedy, the mayor of Newburgh,  New York. Judy and I shared a love for the city of Newburgh. Judy also  passed away from cancer this weekend. She fought through her sickness  to serve the people she cared so much about and the city she loved.   She was a relentless warrior for the people she represented. She  brought the city of Newburgh through an economic crisis and presided  over a real revitalization throughout that city. Our thoughts are with  the Kennedy family as well, and, of course, the entire Newburgh  community that will miss her leadership.   The public servants we lost this weekend were truly special people.  They dedicated their lives to the people they served, and the best way  for us to honor their legacy is to finish their work, to look out for  the communities they represented, and to make sure they stay the  wonderful places to live, work, and raise a family that they are.   Frank and Judy, thank you for all you have done for us. I hope  everyone in the Hudson Valley joins me in saying a prayer in  remembrance of their service, and, of course, we will see them; we will  see them whenever we see the government doing something right. We will  see them when we see the city of Newburgh continue to thrive. We will  see them when we see the State government improving our environment-- looking out for working families, fighting for people without a voice.  That is where we will see their legacy, when we continue the work they  fought so nobly and so long to advance.   Rest in peace.                            ____________________
