 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this budget  resolution. It begins the gutting of the Affordable Care Act, stripping  health care for millions of working families across the Nation,  including over three-quarters of a million in my home State of  Washington.   Here is the bottom line: This repeal will put into chaos small  businesses, hospitals, and community health centers. I have one of  those in Seattle called the International Community Health Services,  which provides culturally appropriate health services to anyone in  need. Recently, an elderly woman at ICHS shared her fears about the ACA  repeal. She and her husband, a heart attack survivor who went through  bypass surgery, rely on Medicare and Medicaid for affordable health  services. They have an annual joint income, Mr. Chairman, of $14,000,  and they would be unable to afford quality care if the ACA repeal  happens and, let's be clear, with absolutely no better plan to replace  it.   Mr. Chairman, the budget resolution is a moral document. It does  translate our values into commitments, and it should tell the world  what the United States stands for. Looking at this budget resolution, I  cannot help but conclude that our moral compass will be broken if we  pass this resolution. I urge my colleagues to oppose this immoral  budget resolution.
