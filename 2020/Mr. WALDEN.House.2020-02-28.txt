 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, my colleague from the Energy and Commerce Committee  and I do disagree on this bill.   Every Member in this Chamber is concerned, and rightfully so, about  the rise in youth tobacco use. We all know this: Smoking is harmful,  and we must do what we can to prevent use by children and adolescents.   This is a goal that we share as Republicans and Democrats and with  President Trump, which is why we have worked together to address the  increase in youth tobacco use by making it illegal for anybody under  the age of 21 to buy these products. We have done that together. We  have passed that. It is now law.   The use of traditional tobacco products by children has actually  declined over the last decade. In fact, the surge in tobacco use in  recent years has been caused by one thing, and that is the emerging  popularity of e-cigarettes, vaping. The use of e-cigarettes increased  from 3.6 million youth users in 2018 to 5.4 million last year. That  increase is truly alarming. But that is not what this bill addresses.   We addressed youth vaping when we raised the age to 21 to be able to  buy these tobacco products. Most children were acquiring e-cigarettes  through social sourcing. So, what does that mean? This occurs in  high schools where kids who are over 18 at that time would acquire the  products and then resell them to kids who were under 18. That is what  was going on. By moving the legal age to 21, we have closed that  loophole.    We unanimously passed legislation requiring online retailers to  verify age at the time of sale and delivery. That bill is still  awaiting the Senate's action, but I think it demonstrates that we did  come together in a bipartisan way to address this problem.   Now the legislation before us goes much further than most of us can  support, because what it does is make legal products for adults  illegal. Now, I am not a smoker, I am not a chewer, I don't do any of  that stuff, but I know a lot of people who do. And they use these  products as adults, and these flavored products will be banned under  this law. So if you do chew, if you do smoke, if you use these menthol  cigarettes or menthol chew or something, and you are an adult, this  legal product today will be illegal if this bill were to become law.   Now, meanwhile, the majority Democrats have refused to address  another issue that is a big problem in my communities and my schools.  Marijuana-based products can still be flavored, and they are not  covered by this legislation. Now, they will say, oh, that is illegal in  America anyway. Well, we all know states like Oregon and others that  have passed these rules, nobody is enforcing the law against marijuana,  it is Federal.   But what we do have is literally products named CannaKids grape  flavor. Another one over here CannaKids. This is what is happening.  They are using these products mixed with acetate vitamin E oil to cut  it with cannabis products, THC products, and they are vaping those.  That is left out of this legislation. So you can't go to the store and  get your snuff and chew that or whatever you do with it if it is  menthol, but you can still go to the pot store and get this. That makes  no sense to me.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague for her comments and putting  this letter into the Record. She is absolutely right, according to the  ACLU, the National Association of Social Workers, the Law Enforcement  Action Partnership. They say in this letter: ``Any ban on menthol  cigarettes will disproportionately affect people of color.''   They go on to talk about how other criminal laws will be affected  under this act, including those that could lead, their concern, to the  sort of stop and frisk that occurred in New York in the Eric Garner  case that they cite in this letter.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Flores).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson), a distinguished member of the Energy  and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to point out again that if you want to do something about  kids, if you want to do something about lung disease, then we need to  do something about marijuana and the oils it gets mixed with that this  bill does not address.   These are literally named CannaKids--CannaKids, flavors. What does  this one say? Liquid Black Cherry, DOPE.   They voted that down when we tried to put this in the bill to ban it.  If you are going to ban something, let's ban something kids are using.  But, no, we let the marijuana products go forward.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Allen).    Madam Speaker, I would inquire how much time is remaining  on each side.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I just want to point out the administration, in their  opposition to this legislation, reminds us that, in January of 2020,  the administration issued guidance to prioritize enforcement against  the unauthorized marketing of certain vaping products to youth.   The FDA is conducting regular surveillance and, when appropriate,  taking enforcement measures against websites, social media, and other  publications that advertise regulated tobacco products.   And the Speaker knows, the President signed into law the ban against  these products being sold to anyone 21 and under. So we agree that it  is about the children. We believe Congress has acted in this measure.  This bill is about adults.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the top Republican on the Education and Labor  Committee.  [[Page H1267]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time available on  both sides.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Comer).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I continue to reserve the balance of my time, Madam  Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just want to follow up on my friend from Florida's comments. Let me  remind the body that it was the Obama administration that failed to  take enforcement action against e-cigarette manufacturers while these  products grew in popularity among our children.   In contrast, it is the Trump administration that is actually taking  significant action to curb youth use of tobacco and e-cigarettes. The  Food and Drug Administration under President Trump has already removed  most flavored e-cigarettes from the market and stated they will take  additional action against any products found to be targeting children.   My friends will say the administration left open a giant loophole by  not targeting all these cigarette products. I reiterate: FDA has stated  they will ``take action against any product, regardless of whether a  product is cartridge-based, disposable, or flavored, if it is targeted  to minors, its marketing is likely to promote youth use, or if the  manufacturer has failed to take, or is failing to take, adequate  measures to prevent minors' access.''   The FDA has that authority to regulate e-cigarettes. It has taken  action to remove those products that are targeted to kids from the  market. In addition, any product wishing to come back on the market  will need to receive marketing authorization from the FDA beginning  later this year making the actions of this bill actually unnecessary.   But remember this bill deals with adults because we already, in a  bipartisan way, passed a law to prohibit these products from being sold  to people under 21 years of age. That was a huge problem. There was a  big loophole. As I said, the Obama administration let all this unfold  before their eyes.   We passed a bill. It is now law. Nobody under 21 has access to these  products.   Madam Speaker, the bill doesn't address this issue; this is literally  called CannaKids. This is literally DOPE e-Liquid, Black Cherry.  Marijuana-flavored vaping products are not covered under this  legislation.   But this legislation goes so far as to take legal products that  adults may use--I don't use any of this stuff. I am not a big fan of it  at all. But they have their choice. These are adult products. Adults  will no longer have access to these products. They are gone. They are  banned under this bill.   Madam Speaker, you are going to set up a whole new criminal  enforcement effort that some, including the ACLU, believe will target  people of color more than others.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I think we have had a good debate here  today, and we understand the differences between the proponents and  opponents. I want to close with a couple of comments.   Marijuana and THC-laced products are illegal at the Federal level  under the Controlled Substances Act. Nobody disputes that. Yet, we have  seen how easy it is for individuals, including children, to get their  hands on these products.   They are marketed all over the internet in kid-friendly flavors. Not  only are these illegal products easy to access, but they caused an  outbreak of serious illnesses known as e-cigarette, or vaping, product  use-associated lung injury--it is known as EVALI--and resulted in the  deaths of 68 Americans. Centers for Disease Control confirmed this  outbreak was linked to vitamin E acetate used in THC-containing e- cigarettes.   The point is, though, as more people are pushed away from flavored  tobacco products that are currently legal--again, we already made all  this illegal for anybody under 21, so we are talking about adults  here--they will start pushing products through illicit markets.   We all hope that in the face of the tobacco prohibition, tobacco  users would simply quit using these products, but the fact is, these  products are addictive. They are designed so users cannot simply quit.   Without accounting for this reality, this legislation will simply  push individuals to more dangerous and unregulated products. Illicit  markets are already thriving, as is evidenced by the cannabis  marketplace and the existing illicit tobacco trade.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the National  Association of Black Law Enforcement Executives. They say:         Organized criminal groups are already increasingly active       in selling illicit cigarettes from low tax states to high tax       states. A new market--menthol cigarettes--will only fuel       those criminal enterprises and everything that comes with       them from money laundering of shell companies that are       funding gang and terrorist activities.   [[Page H1271]]                                             National Organization of                                Black Law Enforcement Executives,                                      Alexandria, VA, June 11, 2019.      Re H.R. 2339: Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic of 2019,           Bill introduced by: U.S. Congressman Frank Pallone.       Hon. Frank Pallone,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Moore: The National Organization of       Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE) serves as the       conscience of law enforcement in America by being committed       to Justice by Action. Founded in 1976, NOBLE is committed to       ensure equity in the administration of justice and its       unyielding commitment is to work toward the elimination of       racism and bias of any type within the law enforcement field.        NOBLE has nearly 60 chapters and represents over 3,000       members worldwide that represent chief executive officers and       command-level law enforcement officials from federal, state,       county, municipal law enforcement agencies, and criminal       justice practitioners.        As an organization, NOBLE has no stance on the scientific       and medical issues regarding the impact of the use of menthol       cigarettes aside from saying that we believe any governmental       decision--especially one that could ban a previously legal       product--should be rooted on rigorous science.        Historically, NOBLE has expressed concerns over the ban of       menthol cigarettes for adults due to the unintended       consequences that occur when said products are made available       through a illicit market. The result can be the increased       encounters between the consumer (in this case African       Americans) and law enforcement officials who are enforcing       the ban.        NOBLE applauds the legislation to increase the minimum age       to consume tobacco products from 18 to 21. We currently are       launching a program aimed at educating and informing young       people to the dangers of consuming tobacco products and their       derivatives. However, we are concerned over the inclusion of       menthol flavored products in H.R. 2339 that may encourage a       ban of these products in the adult market. Research data       shows that menthol cigarettes constitute one-third of the       U.S. market and is the preferred cigarette of more than 80%       of African Americans who choose to smoke. Our goal is to       reduce policies and legislative actions that may increase       unintended enforcement interaction between police and people       of color.        Organized criminal groups are already increasingly active       in selling illicit cigarettes from low tax states to high tax       states. A new market--menthol cigarettes--will only fuel       those criminal enterprises and everything that comes with       them from money laundering or shell companies that funding       gang and terrorist activities. A ban on menthol cigarettes       would be exploited by criminal organizations to finance their       activities.        We urge you to consider the real-world evidence of the       ramifications of the unintended consequences of a ban on the       sale of menthol cigarettes and the disproportionate impact of       a menthol ban in African American communities.        Given all of these concerns, NOBLE respectfully requests       that this legislation remove menthol from the list of flavors       being considered for a ban on retail sales.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                      Vera Bumpers,                                                National President.     Those aren't my words. Those are the words of the  National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, which  opposes this legislation.   This bill is making an additional set of products illegal that will  further encourage illegal behavior that is already occurring and  difficult to combat.   Madam Speaker, where does this stop? We are all for stopping children  from having access to these products. We did that with T21. It is now  law. We have legislation--bipartisanly passed in the House, pending in  the Senate--to require age verification at point of sale and delivery  of tobacco products so that we really get boundaries around these  products getting into the hands of youth.   But if you are going to ban flavored tobacco products but not  flavored marijuana products, are you going to ban flavored alcohol  products?   We know childhood obesity is an epidemic. Are we going to go down  that path as well and ban products adults use but tell kids they can't  have a candy bar?   I mean, where does this end?   I led an effort when I was student body president in high school to  get smoking out of the bathrooms. I went to the school board, and we  actually created a smoking area outside that required parental  permission, a permit, and a fee. That was the 1970s. It was an amazing,  revolutionary thing. Thankfully, a few years later, they got rid of the  whole thing, but I got tired of using the bathroom only to find my  friends smoking in there and lighting fires in the trash cans.   I have been an advocate for getting smoking and smoking products away  from kids my entire life. That is why I supported T21 to ban the sale  of tobacco products to anybody under 21, the age verification issue,  and all that. But we are talking here about now telling adults in  America that you can no longer have access to these legal products.   Now, I am not a fan of these legal products. Don't get me wrong. But  I represent people who do use them, and I am going to go home, and they  are going say: ``What do you mean you took away my Grizzly or Kodiak or  Snuffs?'' I don't even know what you do with those products, but we are  going to take them away. We are going to ban them for good under your  law, and we are going to have our law enforcement go enforce that.   Now, they will tell you that it is just the FDA, but what they won't  tell you is, in the bill, it only relates to the FDA, but there are  criminal penalties in this bill. It probably should have gone to the  Committee on the Judiciary.   There are other laws on the books that law enforcement can enforce,  and that is why the ACLU and others sent us this letter concerned about  the stop and frisk tactics. Remember, Eric Garner was selling illegal  cigarettes on the streets, individual cigarettes. That is what led to  the law enforcement action that tragically ended up in his death with  the illegal choke hold.   They reference all that in their letter in opposition to this  legislation. We are not making this up on our side. It is all right  here.   I include in the Record this letter, along with a Statement of  Administration Policy in opposition to H.R. 2339.                                         Monday, February 24, 2020.      Re Coalition Concerns with Blanket Prohibition on Menthol and           Other Flavored Tobacco within H.R. 2339, Reversing the           Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act.       Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington,           DC.        The undersigned civil rights and civil liberties       organizations write to express concerns with a broad       prohibition on menthol and other flavored tobacco products       within H.R. 2339, the Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic       Act of 2019. While this legislation is a well-intended effort       to address health issues associated with tobacco use among       youth, we have concerns that a blanket prohibition on menthol       and other flavored tobacco products, which will apply to       adults, will (1) disproportionately impact people and       communities of color; (2) trigger criminal penalties,       prioritizing criminalization over public health and harm       reduction; and (3) instigate unconstitutional policing and       other negative interactions with local law enforcement.   I. H.R. 2339 Disproportionately Impacts People and Communities of Color         Of adults, approximately 80 percent of Blacks and 35       percent of Latinx who choose to smoke prefer menthol       cigarettes. Thus, any ban on menthol cigarettes will       disproportionately affect people of color. While H.R. 2339       and similar legislation are often motivated by the desire to       decrease and eliminate smoking among certain populations,       Blacks and other people of color should not       disproportionately bear the brunt of enforcement of such       prohibitions, which a menthol ban would ensure.        Similarly, enforcement of a ban on flavored cigars will       also disproportionally impact people of color given cigar       preferences. Black adults are 60% of cigarillo and non-      premium cigar smokers, with these products often flavored.       Additionally, at Committee markup, H.R. 2339 was amended to       exempt certain traditional, expensive cigars from a       prohibition of online tobacco sales. There is no       justification for differentiating a La Palina from a Black       and Mild. Making this distinction undermines the public       health arguments made for this bill and suggests that some       tobacco preferences, within certain communities, will be       prioritized and protected over others.        II. H.R. 2339 Increases Criminal Penalties Over Public Health         H.R. 2339 prohibits menthol and other flavored tobacco       products under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).       This prohibition criminalizes the manufacturing, importing,       distributing, or selling of menthol and other flavored       tobacco products under the FD&C Act, imposing up to three       years of imprisonment. Violating a menthol and flavored       tobacco ban would implicate other federal criminal penalties       as well. For example, the Federal Cigarette Contraband       Trafficking Act would be implicated, allowing up to five       years of imprisonment.        With a criminal legal system that incarcerates Blacks at       nearly six times the rate of white Americans and a prison       population that is 67 percent Black and Latinx, any       prohibition on menthol and flavored tobacco products promises       continued over-criminalization and mass incarceration of       people of color. A ban on menthol and flavored tobacco       products could reintroduce many of  [[Page H1272]]       the harms imposed by the failed war on drugs as lawmakers       work to legalize cannabis and take a public health approach       to opioids. A bill criminalizing tobacco is contrary to those       efforts. Righting the wrongs of earlier failed drug policy       requires consideration of the unintended consequences of       well-intentioned policies, especially on the most vulnerable       communities. It also requires us to remember that harm       reduction, including education and counseling, are what work       to reduce usage and harm in our society, not prohibition.              III. H.R. 2339 Encourages Harmful Police Practices         Recent history shows us that drug prohibitions and bans       increase negative interactions between law enforcement and       people of color. The New York Police Department's (NYPD) stop       and frisk program resulted in nearly 700,000 stops in 2011,       with drugs serving as the alleged pretext for most of those       stops. Ninety percent of those stops were of Black and Latinx       people. We are concerned that law enforcement's attempts to       enforce a menthol and flavored tobacco ban will undoubtedly       lead to fines, arrests, and eventual incarceration for those       who continue to use and sell menthol and flavored tobacco       products. While the legislation was amended at Committee to       try to minimize law enforcement practices here, it only       applies in the context of federal enforcement of the FD&C       Act; it does not govern local enforcement around any state       and city prohibition policies that will follow.        The death of Eric Garner in 2014 generated national       attention not only for the brutality he experienced at the       hands of NYPD police, but for the reason that led to the       encounter with law enforcement. Mr. Garner died from an       illegal chokehold having been stopped by police for selling       single cigarettes in violation of state law. Gwendolyn Carr,       Eric Garner's mother, cautions: ``When you ban a product sold       mostly in Black communities, you must consider the reality of       what will happen to that very same overrepresented community       in the criminal justice system.'' With a federal prohibition       on menthol and flavored tobacco products, states will develop       their own prohibition and enforcement policies that could       result in harmful police practices like that witnessed with       Mr. Garner.        Based on our concerns, we urge you to not impose a blanket       ban on menthol and related tobacco products. A prohibition on       all menthol and flavored tobacco products will not achieve a       public heath goal of reducing smoking among Black people,       young people, or others. We hope we can work together to       avoid repetitions of policies that are intended to protect       youth and communities of color, but instead only further       engrain systemic criminalization and racism.            Sincerely,        American Civil Liberties Union, Drug Policy Alliance, Law       Enforcement Action Partnership, National Action Network,       National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, National       Association of Social Workers, The Center for Popular       Democracy.                                   ____                      Statement of Administration Policy         H.R. 2339--Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019                  (Rep. Pallone, D-NJ, and 126 cosponsors)         The Administration opposes H.R. 2339. The Administration is       encouraged by legislative efforts to protect American youth       from the harms of addiction and unsafe tobacco products, and       it also acknowledges that H.R. 2339 exempts premium cigars,       which have comparatively lower youth usage rates, from       certain regulatory burdens. Unfortunately, however, this bill       contains provisions that are unsupported by the available       evidence regarding harm reduction and American tobacco use       habits and another provision that raises constitutional       concerns. Accordingly, the Administration cannot support H.R.       2339 in its current form.        The Administration cannot support H.R. 2339's       counterproductive efforts to restrict access to products that       may provide a less harmful alternative to millions of adults       who smoke combustible cigarettes. This includes the bill's       prohibition of menthol e-liquids, which available evidence       indicates are used relatively rarely by youth. It also       includes the bill's approach to remote retail sales. At this       time, problems surrounding such sales should be addressed       through the application of age verification technologies       rather than, as this bill would do, prohibiting such sales       entirely.        The Administration is also concerned about the       constitutionality of a provision in the bill that prohibits       certain advertising practices with respect to electronic       nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products. The bill would       prohibit marketing and advertising that ``appeals to an       individual under 21 years of age.'' This standard may not       satisfy the stringent vagueness test applied to regulations       of speech under the Constitution's Due Process Clause.        The Administration is committed to protecting the Nation's       youth from the harms of tobacco and has already taken several       steps to do so. This includes signing legislation to raise       the minimum age of sale for tobacco products to 21. In       January 2020, moreover, the Administration issued guidance to       prioritize enforcement against the unauthorized marketing of       certain ENDS products to youth. And the Food and Drug       Administration (FDA) is conducting regular surveillance of--      and, when appropriate, taking enforcement measures against--      websites, social media, and other publications that advertise       regulated tobacco products.        The bill takes the wrong approach to tobacco regulation.       Rather than continuing to focus on the FDA's Center for       Tobacco Products, Congress should implement President Trump's       Budget proposal to create a new, more directly accountable       agency within the Department of Health and Human Services to       focus on tobacco regulation. This new agency would be led by       a Senate-confirmed Director and would have greater capacity       to respond to the growing complexity of tobacco products and       respond effectively to tobacco-related public health       concerns.        If presented to the President in its current form, the       President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the       bill.    Meanwhile, marijuana products are not covered by the  bill. Go figure. I urge my colleagues to vote against this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    In its present form, oh, yes, I am opposed.    Madam Speaker, Congress has already passed and President  Trump has already signed into law a ban on tobacco product sales,  including vaping product sales to children under the age of 21. We did  that. It is now law. Those are banned.   The Food and Drug Administration is aggressively going after  companies that still try to target kids and has the authority to stop  them--and will.   But we all care deeply about the health of our children. Taking care  to protect the health and welfare of children is a common cause.   We know that the younger the child, the more vulnerable and  defenseless they are, the more these children need our help. That is  why we are offering a final amendment to the bill that literally would  save the lives of the youngest children, the babies.   I would hope we could agree to end the ghastly practice of letting  children die without medical help when they are born alive after an  abortion. Providing, literally, lifesaving medical care to these babies  is something on which we should all find common ground and support.   It is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do for the  children. These are not fetuses that are born. These are tiny little  babies that are struggling to live.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.  Wagner), author of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a  mother and a grandmother herself, who always puts the lives of children  first.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
