 Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Grijalva for  yielding and for his leadership in opposition to the polluters over  people act.   I must say that the concern of the gentleman from New Jersey--we just  heard about ocean animals--is touching, considering the effect that  climate change will have on all wildlife and all of us, for that  matter.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bad faith amendment aimed  at slowing our Nation's transition to the affordable clean energy  economy we need to address the climate crisis and create good-paying  American jobs. With nearly 164,000 New Yorkers already working in the  clean energy industry, the State is expected to create more than 10,000  additional jobs through its commitment to developing 9,000 megawatts of  offshore wind energy in the coming years.   Mr. Chairman, if you are worried about the potential adverse effects  of wind energy development, you will be pleased to know that the Bureau  of Ocean Energy Management is already required to perform substantial  environmental reviews. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's  Renewable Energy Program subject matter experts are best equipped to  analyze potential environmental and industry impacts of offshore wind.    Considering this, it is strange that my colleague from New Jersey is  supporting an appropriations request to defund the Renewable Energy  Program.   It is also strange that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  claim to worry about the industry's impact on whales when most of them  oppose the  [[Page H1670]]  North Atlantic right whale vessel strike reduction rule. The data shows  that most whale killings are attributed to vessel strikes.   Again, Mr. Chairman, this is a bad faith attack on offshore wind, and  I urge my colleagues to oppose it.
