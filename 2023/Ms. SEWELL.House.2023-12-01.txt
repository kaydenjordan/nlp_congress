 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call on all of my  colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 308, the Rosa Parks Day Act.   Today, December 1, Americans across the Nation are celebrating the  legacy of Rosa Parks. It was on December 1, 1955, when Rosa Parks was  arrested in Montgomery, Alabama, for refusing to give up her seat on a  city bus. This simple but bold act of resistance to Jim Crow  segregation laws inspired the historic Montgomery bus boycott.   For 481 days, spurred by Rosa Parks' courage, thousands of African  Americans peacefully protested the Montgomery City Bus System until the  United States court ruled in Browder v. Gayle that the segregation  ordinances were unconstitutional.   Rosa Parks was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1966, the  Congressional Gold Medal in 1999, and was the first woman to ever lie  in state at the U.S. Capitol rotunda.   In addition, many States, including Ohio, California, Missouri, and  Oregon already observe Rosa Parks Day at the State level. Her legacy  continues to inspire new generations of Americans to advance justice  and equality.   Madam Speaker, now is the time to pass this legislation and to  declare December 1 as a Federal holiday, as Rosa Parks Day.  [[Page H6055]]                                ____________________
