 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Carol Clews, a  pro-life leader in Maryland who passed away from cancer this spring.  Archbishop Lori, without exaggeration, called her a ``towering figure''  in the pro-life movement.   Carol's vocation was to help women in their crisis pregnancies by  directing the faith-based Greater Baltimore Center for Pregnancy  Concerns, where pregnant women could go for support until and after  their children were born. Her pregnancy center, staffed mostly by  volunteers, helped thousands of women and their children in a time of  need.   When the City of Baltimore decreed that her pregnancy center had to  display a poster that promoted abortion, she refused to do so and took  the case to Federal district court, where she prevailed. On appeal, the  Fourth Circuit upheld the important religious protections and free  speech rights of pregnancy centers from attacks by pro-abortion  governments that want to deny the choice of life for women during one  of the most vulnerable times of their lives.   The pro-life and pregnancy center movements in Maryland will greatly  miss Carol Clews and her faith and courage. The thousands of women and  their children who were helped by her pregnancy centers are her legacy.                            ____________________
