 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Johnson for yielding and  for his support on this important legislation today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Ocean Shipping Reform  Act of 2021. Throughout the pandemic, I heard from Georgia farmers who  were unable to access affordable shipping. Agriculture is the largest  industry in my district and the largest industry in the State of  Georgia. Our ports are a critical part of our Nation's infrastructure  and it should be considered a great honor and privilege for any  international company or entity to have access to them.   Foreign players gain access to the largest consumer market on earth  through our ports, with a GDP of $20 trillion and 325 million people.  Yet,  [[Page H7479]]  American farmers face high fees and barriers to getting their  commodities into shipping containers.    After defying the odds of weather and many other issues that our  farmers face, it is unconscionable that our perishable exports are left  sitting in warehouses to rot.   This bill provides the first significant Federal update of the  Federal Maritime Commission's powers since 1998 and will significantly  improve our farmers' access to affordable shipping.   Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act  of 2021, and I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.
