 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  Republicans' ongoing plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care  Act. Senate leadership unveiled their plan this morning and plans a  vote as soon as next week.   This bill was drafted in secrecy and will have massive consequences  for the healthcare of every American. It will affect more than one- sixth of our economy. Yet for all its impact, it was written behind  closed doors, with absolutely zero bipartisan input.   I have heard from more constituents on this issue than any other-- more than 5,000 letters, emails, and telephone calls: people like the  cancer survivor in Lake Bluff who is worried whether she will be unable  to find affordable insurance without the ACA's preexisting condition  protections; or my constituent in Grayslake, who says he could only  start his business because of the individual coverage he bought on the  exchange.   I urge my colleagues to listen to the great majority of the American  people. It is time to end this ill-considered charade to repeal  ObamaCare and work together in a bipartisan way to improve our  healthcare system for every American.                            ____________________
