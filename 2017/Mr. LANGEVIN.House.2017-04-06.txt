 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join a number of my  colleagues in strong support of the National Endowments for the Arts  and Humanities. These venerable institutions, which both recently  celebrated their 50th anniversaries, are a cornerstone of American  cultural expressions. Sadly, they are also under attack.  [[Page H2771]]    The President's recent budget outline called for the defunding and  dismantling of the Endowments. So I have gathered here with my friends  and colleagues in the hope that we can help the President change his  mind and demonstrate to him the immense benefit that the NEA and the  NEH bring to our districts, our country, and, in fact, the world.   Being a Rhode Islander, I have always felt a special connection to  the arts and humanities. Rhode Island was founded as a colony that  welcomed free expression of religion, and that freedom of thought  quickly translated into an independent mindedness that drove creative  endeavors. It is no wonder, then, that into such an environment was  born one of the 20th century's great statesmen and a champion of the  arts, our late senior Senator, Senator Claiborne Pell.   Senator Pell was a mentor of mine, and I actually had the privilege  of interning with him twice at one point. He is rightly lionized for  many of his legislative achievements, including the Pell grants that  bear his name. But I believe that no issue was closer to his heart than  that of preserving and promoting American art and culture.   Anyone who knew the Senator knew that his own passion was reflected  and redoubled by his wife, the indomitable Nuala Pell, one of the great  supporters of the arts that my State and our country has ever seen. The  National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities can trace their  beginnings to the passions of the Pells, the vision of President  Kennedy, and the determination of President Johnson.   President Kennedy began his term with a focus on American culture,  when he invited Robert Frost to read a poem at his inauguration. He  soon followed this up by appointing August Heckscher his Special  Consultant on the Arts. Heckscher's report entitled, ``The Arts and the  National Government,'' led to the creation of the President's Advisory  Council on the Arts.   Meanwhile, Senator Pell, the chairman of the Senate Special  Subcommittee on the Arts and Humanities, was hard at work. He began his  first hearing in 1963 with this statement: ``I believe that this cause  and its implementation has a worldwide application; for as our cultural  life is enhanced and strengthened, so does it project itself into the  world beyond our shores. Let us apply renewed energies to the very  concept we seek to advance: a true renaissance--the reawakening, the  quickening, and above all, the unstinted growth of our cultural  vitality.''   So over the next 2 years, working with legislators including Senators  Hubert Humphrey and Jacob Javits and Representatives Frank Thompson and  William Moorhead, Senator Pell crafted President Kennedy's vision into  a reality. With the full support and assistance of President Johnson,  the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act was signed  into law on September 29, 1965.   The first Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities,  incidentally, was another Rhode Islander, Barnaby Keeney, then  president of Brown University.   Mr. Speaker, I begin this hour with a survey of history for a couple  of reasons. First, I think that it is vital that both Members and the  President understand the care and consideration that went into creating  the Endowments. So years of deliberation by some of our finest  legislators went into the determination made in the arts and said:         While primarily a matter for private and local initiative,       the arts and humanities are also appropriate matters of       concern of the Federal Government.    So there is no doubt that private foundation and corporate  philanthropy are the bedrock of artistic funding in this country.  Nonetheless, there is an important role for government at all levels to  play, and the Endowment serves as the catalyst for governmental  involvement.   Second, looking back helps remind us of the aspirations that drove  the creation of the Endowments in the first place. Last week, we  learned of the death of Yevgeny Yevtushenko, a Soviet poet who defied  his totalitarian government. When President Kennedy brought poetry to  his inauguration, it was in direct contrast to the Soviet Union, where  literary dissidents were imprisoned or exiled and not given freedom to  create.   What a message to send to the world in the 1960s, that the United  States prized artistic expression, celebrated scholarly inquiry, and  believed in the strength and progress embodied by multiculturalism. So  the playwright in New York was not censored. He was cheered. A  historian in North Carolina was greeted not with accusation, but  acclaim. The painter in Nevada was not imprisoned; she was empowered.    Placed in context, the message sent by the creation of the Endowments  was that America's culture was not just an asset to be protected, but a  powerful tool for promoting freedom worldwide.   Just as importantly, the 1965 act recognized that American culture  was not static. Rather, its evolution over time was the source of its  power. However, I believe the most important reason to begin with the  history of the Endowments can be found in the Arts and Humanities Act  itself: ``An advanced civilization must not limit its efforts to  science and technology alone, but must give full value and support to  the other great branches of scholarly and cultural activity in order to  achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the  present, and a better view of the future.''   Why do we study the arts and humanities? Why do we promote them in  the Halls of Congress? ``To achieve a better understanding of the past,  a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.''   Mr. Speaker, I co-chair the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, a  caucus that owes its very name to the work of an artist, William  Gibson, who first coined the phrase ``cyberspace'' in 1984. Gibson  helped create the lexicon that we use today to describe the internet as  we know it and, in so doing, helped to shape its development and  growth--a better view of the future, indeed.   For years, I promoted the STEM to STEAM movement, the concept of  adding art and design to the STEM disciplines of science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics.   Incidentally, this movement is another product of my home State,  courtesy of the brilliant minds at the Rhode Island School of Design,  in particular, as I understand it, then former President John Maeda,  who, as I understand, coined the term ``STEM to STEAM.''   Incorporating principles of art and design in STEM helps foster  creativity, encourages collaboration, and can engender sudden, inspired  breakthroughs, all by helping to better analyze the present.   So in my role in the Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees,  I am presented daily with new threats brought on by the advent of new  technologies or fast-moving global events. The temptation to act  quickly is strong, and sometimes immediate reaction is warranted; but  more often than not, it is through examination of the past that I find  a path forward.   These United States have weathered many crises over the centuries-- some of our own making--but by better understanding of them, I can  better analyze the present and better see a future of America peaceful,  prosperous, and free.   Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues have stories to tell of the great  works that the NEA and NEH have supported in their districts, and I  will share some of those stories as well. But I hope my words on the  history of the Endowments have helped shape our understanding of their  incredible purpose and ideals of President Kennedy, President Johnson,  Senator Pell, and their colleagues.   America is better for the Endowments existing. The world is better  for it. To cast them away in a budget outline that zeros them out  without even a word of justification is a tragedy.                                time  1115    It dismisses the ideals of our forbearers as insignificant. It  ignores the half century of work that many of my colleagues here have  done to promote our culture through the Endowments. And in the cruelest  of ironies, it does so without engaging with the very disciplines it  dismisses as unneeded. It cannot and will not go unchallenged.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price). The gentleman has co-led  this effort with me, and he proudly co-chairs the Caucus on the  Humanities.  [[Page H2772]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his outstanding  comments, his insights, and his leadership on the arts and humanities  issues. As co-chair of the Humanities Caucus here in the Congress, I  appreciate his efforts in helping me organize and colead this effort to  speak out against the effort to zero out the National Endowments for  the Arts and the Humanities budget. We hope it will not stand, and we  hope that the President will reconsider his initial budget proposal.   I am proud to yield to a number of my colleagues and want to begin  with the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), no shrinking violet  himself, someone who is artistic and colorful in his own right, but it  is no surprise to me that being from New Jersey he would be here since  it was one of his late colleagues, the former Congressman from New  Jersey, Frank Thompson, who was the House sponsor of the National  Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act.    Mr. Speaker, I know everyone is on a tight time  schedule, but I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) for  staying and contributing his thoughts and his support to this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline). I know that he is on a tight schedule to try to catch a  train at noon.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Cicilline from Rhode  Island for his comments and also for his partnership in helping to  support the arts and humanities back home in Rhode Island and in our  country as a whole. As the gentleman said, we have a special connection  to the arts and humanities, given the leadership of our late senior  Senator Claiborne Pell who created the National Endowment for the Arts  and Humanities in the first place, along with the support of his wife,  Nuala Pell, who David and I both know very well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Adams).    I thank the gentlewoman for her presence here today  but,  [[Page H2775]]  most especially, for her outstanding words and participation in this  effort. Thank you for what you have contributed here today, your  wonderful perspective. I hope it catches the President's attention and,  hopefully, reverses this effort to zero out funding for the National  Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities.   Mr. Speaker, some may think of the arts and humanities as just  luxuries or extras, but they are not. They are central to who we are.  It is also about the jobs they create and how the artists and the folks  from the humanities contribute to our economy, people who earn a living  and pay taxes and, again, are a vibrant part of our communities, our  States, and our country. So that is something else that is important to  remember.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud now to yield to my colleague from New  York (Mr. Tonko), who has an important perspective to offer.    I thank the gentleman from New York for his comments  and for his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time we have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield now to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Foster).    I thank the gentleman from Illinois for his great  comments and for his participation here today. It is very deeply  impactful, and I am grateful.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains?    Mr. Speaker, like my colleagues, I too have stories of  the impact that the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities  have back home, and some of these stories are small and deeply  personal. I would like to thank the wonderful leaders of the Rhode  Island Arts and Humanities Council for helping to collect them so that  I can share them with everyone here today.                                time  1200    The State of Rhode Island is deeply indebted to Randy Rosenbaum and  Dr. Elizabeth Francis for their work in promoting the arts and  humanities. The State councils are an essential component of the  Endowments' efforts, and we are incredibly lucky in Rhode Island to  have Elizabeth and Randy heading up our initiatives.   One of the stories they shared comes from FirstWorks, an NEA- supported organization that helps connect students experiencing new  types of performance with artists premiering new pieces. FirstWorks  recently helped bring together a Philadelphia hip-hop group with high  school students in downtown Providence. The students participated in a  workshop with one of the dancers one day and followed it up with a  lecture and a matinee performance the next.   FirstWorks had just created a Spanish-language version of their  student survey, which they administered after the matinee performance.  Students were asked to rate their enjoyment and explain why they gave  their answer. Two Spanish-speaking students responded that they loved  the performance because it was ``the first time they went to one.''   The FirstWorks team weren't exactly sure what the students meant. Was  it the first matinee? Was it the first time seeing the hip-hop group?  So they followed up with the teacher, who wrote back: ``These students  have never been to a live performance. It just goes to show you how  important these opportunities are for our population. They will  remember this forever.''   This is the kind of impact the arts can have on our communities.   Another story comes from an artist who has, with the help of State  Arts Council funding, been working with underserved communities for 6  years. She helps students learn to apply themselves to art projects in  a way that builds self-confidence and helps them learn the power of  their imaginations. About an elementary school student named Danny, she  wrote: ``When I first started working with him, he did nothing but  whine and cry and insist he couldn't do anything. With my  encouragement, he took his own ideas and went with them--in a puppet  workshop, he made three stuffed animals instead. He sleeps with them  every night now. They make him feel safe.''   There are hundreds of these stories in Rhode Island alone, and they  would simply not be possible without the support of the Endowments.   Of course, some projects supported by NEA and NEH are on a much  larger scale. It is virtually impossible right now to find a Rhode  Islander who, today, doesn't know about WaterFire, Providence's  massively successful creative placemaking project. I have experienced  this wonderful WaterFire many times myself.   For those of my colleagues who have not had the pleasure of attending  a WaterFire--and, Mr. Speaker, I am happy to extend an invitation to  all of my colleagues to come and to visit--it is a dynamic sculpture,  basically, with dozens of these metal baskets or metal braziers  transforming the rivers of downtown Providence.  [[Page H2777]]    This groundbreaking artwork has completely transformed Saturday  nights in Providence, with tens of thousands of people flocking  downtown for each lighting and the performances, music, and camaraderie  that accompany it. It is hard to describe it in words, but it has been  transformative. WaterFire really has fundamentally altered the way  Providence is viewed and the way the people of Providence view  themselves. Support from NEA is helping WaterFire further explore  creative placemaking, and it is incredibly meaningful.   A final thought to share comes from Professor Touba Ghadessi, a board  member for the Rhode Island Council on the Humanities. Professor  Ghadessi was asked to share her thoughts on why NEH matters for all  Rhode Islanders, and I truly cannot improve upon her words. This is  what she had to say:   ``The Rhode Island Council for the Humanities uncovers beautiful  stories about individuals and places and brings them to life--these  stories become our history and make us understand that we, too, write  the narratives that construct culture. The intentionally diverse  programming that RICH supports builds communities that, eventually,  will view diversity as normalcy--this normalcy is the one I aspire to  construct for the next generation. RICH allows for our best selves to  come forward and celebrate together what culture teaches us--from the  struggles of social justice, to the legacy of first peoples, to the  craft of filmmaking for children. All of these things matter. All of  these things make us better human beings. All of these things turn us  into ethical and engaged citizens of the world. Without an  understanding of the humanities, opinions become facts and truth is  debatable. History has offered us a roadmap to behaving with  integrity--we can't ignore it or ignorance wins.''   Mr. Speaker, I cannot think of more important words for these times,  and I would ask all of my colleagues to reflect on what it will take to  view diversity as normalcy and why it seems today that the truth is  debatable.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all my colleagues for being here today. I am  proud to share my thoughts on why it is so important that we not zero  out the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities and the  incredible impact they have on our communities.   I have one more story from my district about the impact of the arts  and humanities that I'd like to share.   It, too, relates to the legacy of Senator Pell, but it also points to  the broader cuts to arts and humanities in the President's budget  outline.   A decade after the passage of the National Foundation for the Arts  and Humanities Act, Senator Pell was again at the forefront of cultural  preservation and promotion when he sponsored legislation creating the  Office of Museum Services.   While the Office was eventually rolled into the Institute of Museum  and Library Services, it continues to support great work, which I saw  firsthand last year in my district when the Tomaquaq Museum in Exeter  was awarded the prestigious National Medal for Museum and Library  Service.   Recently, we in Rhode Island have been celebrating the 350th  anniversary of our charter and Roger Williams's respect for the  Indigenous People he lived among.   But far too often, this story treats Rhode Island's tribes as bit  players rather than delving into their rich culture and history.   The Tomaquag Museum's founders recognized this flaw in the narrative  in the 1950s, and while I'm disappointed it took the rest of us so long  to catch up, I'm incredibly proud of all the recognition it's received  of late.   The Tomaquag Museum remains the only Rhode Island institution  dedicated solely to the history and culture of the state's indigenous  population, and I have experienced its power to start conversations and  change attitudes in our communities.   Unfortunately, IMLS, too, is slated for defending under the  President's budget outline.   We are very lucky that my home state Senator, Jack Reed, has taken up  Senator Pell's mantle in pushing for its reauthorization and full  funding.   But it is important that all of my colleagues join together to  protect the NEA, the NEH, IMLS, and support for the arts and humanities  throughout the federal budget.   We must do so because of the lives touched and forever altered by  these organizations.   We must do so in order to achieve a better understanding of the past,  a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.   We must do so because it is good policy.   I hope that hearing the stories shared today has helped cement that  fact in the minds of my colleagues, and I look forward to working with  them to continue to promote the arts and humanities.   With that, I again thank all my colleagues who joined me this  morning.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
