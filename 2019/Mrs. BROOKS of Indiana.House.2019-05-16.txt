 Mr. Speaker, as we recognize National Police  Week, let's provide our law enforcement every tool possible to prevent  senseless acts of gun violence from harming or claiming the lives of  innocent people, including our law enforcement officers.   That is why, today, I am reintroducing a gun violence reduction bill,  categorized as a red-flag bill, with my colleague Ted Deutch, who  represents Parkland, Florida, and our colleagues from Michigan, Fred  Upton and Debbie Dingell.   Our bill, the Jake Laird Act of 2019, is named after an IMPD officer  who paid the ultimate sacrifice serving and protecting his community of  Indianapolis, Officer Jake Laird.   Our bill provides grants to States to enact laws substantially  similar to Indiana's red-flag law because we know that, since 2005,  this Hoosier commonsense bill has been working.   Specifically, the Jake Laird Act will enable law enforcement to  remove and retain firearms from individuals who are determined to be a  danger to themselves or others, while ensuring due process under the  law.    According to a USA Today article recently published, more than 30  States across the country are either considering similar measures or  have passed red-flag laws.   It is past time for our Nation to adopt laws like Indiana's red-flag  law that will keep our law enforcement and citizens safer.                            ____________________
