 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 969 and ask  that it be reported by number.  [[Page S1248]]    The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cruz] proposes an amendment       numbered 969 to amendment No. 891.    The amendment is as follows:  (Purpose: To provide children with an option for in-classroom education   instruction if the child's local public school does not commit to re- opening to 5-day-a-week, in-classroom instruction for the remainder of           the current school year and the 2021-2022 school year)          At the appropriate place, insert the following:       SEC. __. STATE DIRECT FAMILY GRANT PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       this title, not later than 7 days after the date of enactment       of this title, each school that is eligible to receive grant       funding under section 2001 shall submit to their respective       State Secretary of Education, or equivalent State official, a       plan to re-open and resume regular, full-time, 5-day-a-week       in-classroom instruction with teachers and faculty physically       present for the remainder of the 2020-2021 and for the 2021-      2022 school year in such a manner that meets or exceeds the       plan for in-classroom instruction that was in effect for that       school at the start of the 2019-2020 school year.        (b) Direct Education Assistance Fund.--Each State shall       establish a State-controlled Direct Education Assistance       Fund. In the event that a school fails to timely submit a re-      opening plan in accordance with subsection (a), the State       shall withhold all grant funds that would have been provided       to such school under section 2001, depositing such amount       into the Direct Education Assistance Fund. The State shall       administer the Direct Education Assistance Fund, using the       monies deposited therein, to establish and operate a grant       program to assist families with educational costs in order to       provide students with access to alternative education for the       2021-2022 school year. The State Department of Education       shall operate the grant program as follows:        (1) The Department shall establish an application process       that allows parents to apply for an education grant from the       State's Direct Education Assistance Fund as follows:        (A) Awards grants from available funds in a manner that       prioritizes children--        (i) from schools that have not submitted a re-opening plan       as required by this section;        (ii) who are special needs students;        (iii) who are suffering from depression or a similar       condition or at risk of suicide due to COVID-19-related       isolation; or        (iv) who have a parent (or parents) or guardian (or       guardians) who work outside of the home during regular school       hours and are not available to assist the child with virtual       learning.        (B) Includes, as part of the application form, the       opportunity for the parent or guardian to submit an education       plan for the child that--        (i) as part of an application for a grant for direct       education assistance, includes the proposed school, if any,       that the parent or guardian has selected for the child and       the cost of any fees associated with the application,       enrollment, or attendance at such school; or        (ii) as part of an application for a grant for supplemental       education assistance a list of any costs which the parent or       guardian anticipates will be incurred to purchase items       listed in paragraph (5)(B).        (2) The Department shall publicize the availability of       direct education assistance to parents across the State with       an application period of not less than 45 days and a deadline       for applications as of a date not later than July 1, 2021.        (3) The Department shall first prioritize eligibility for       grants awarded from available funds to the parents or       guardians of children between the ages of 5 and 18 who are       eligible to attend a school that failed to timely submit a       re-opening plan as described herein and, if funds remain       available in the Direct Education Assistance Fund after each       priority student has received a grant, the Department shall       make grants from the Fund available to the parent or       guardians applying on behalf of students from other       elementary and secondary schools in the State.        (4) The Department shall only award a grant to an       individual who is the legal parent or guardian of an eligible       child provided that such individual is also a citizen or       national of the United States or an alien (as defined in       section 101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8       U.S.C. 1101(a)) who is lawfully present in the United States.        (5) The Department will administer the Direct Education       Assistance Fund as follows:        (A) 75 percent of such Fund shall be set aside and used to       award direct education assistance grants to finance all or a       portion of the educational costs of a child to attend a       different school as selected by that child's parent or       guardian in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per grant award.        (B) 25 percent of such Fund shall be set aside and used to       award supplemental education assistance grants to cover a       portion of the costs for education such as tutoring services,       educational classes, or curriculum inside or outside of the       home, books, instructional materials, online educational       materials, educational therapies, including educational       therapies and services for students with disabilities, and       such other educational and instructional materials as the       child's parent or guardian determines is beneficial in-      relation to at-home learning, including online or virtual       schooling or home instruction.        (6) All grants shall be awarded not later than August 15,       2021.        (7) The Department shall require that any parent or       guardian who receives a grant pursuant to this section       maintain records of how any grant funds were spent.        (8) Grants awarded out of the Fund for direct education       assistance shall be distributed in an equitable manner among       recipients for such grants consistent with the priorities       identified in this section but in an amount not to exceed the       educational costs identified within an application and grants       awarded out of the Fund for supplemental education assistance       shall be made in an equitable manner among recipients for       such grants in an amount not to exceed the costs identified       in such application.        (c) Prohibition of Control Over Non-public Education       Providers.--        (1) In general.--Nothing in this section shall be construed       to permit, allow, encourage, or authorize any Federal control       over any aspect of any private, religious, or home education       provider, whether or not a home education provider is treated       as a private school or home school under State law.        (2) No discrimination.--No State shall exclude,       discriminate against, or otherwise disadvantage any education       provider, including home education provider, with respect to       programs or services under this section based in whole or in       part on the provider's religious character or affiliation,       including religiously based or mission-based policies or       practices.        (d) Parental Rights to Use Grants.--No State shall disfavor       or discourage the use of qualifying grants for the purchase       of elementary and secondary education services, including       those services provided by private or nonprofit entities,       such as faith-based providers.        (e) Repayment.--If a school does not re-open and maintain       operations consistent with the plan submitted under this       section, the school shall be required to repay all monies       received under section 2001 to the State.        (f) Return to Treasury.--Any monies remaining in the Fund       as of September 30, 2021, or if subsequently repaid under       subsection (e), shall be repaid to the United States Treasury       not later than June 30, 2022.        At the end of section 2001(c), add the following: ``An       allocation to a State shall be made pursuant to the previous       sentence only if the State has publicly published, by not       later than 7 days after enactment of this Act, a written plan       that guarantees each child in the State has a local public       school education option to resume regular, 5-day-a-week in-      classroom instruction with teachers physically present and       that identifies by name and location which schools will be       available for regular in-classroom instruction. Assistance       from a grant awarded to a State under this section shall only       be provided to a school identified by the State under the       previous sentence.''.    I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of debate equally  divided.    Madam President, we are facing an absolute crisis with our  schools. Today, only 40 percent of school kids in America are attending  in-person school 5 days a week.   It has been a year since these COVID lockdowns began. Millions of  school kids are falling behind, and it is falling disproportionately on  low-income kids, on African-American kids, on Hispanic kids.   This bill spends billions of dollars on schools and doesn't require  that they open. My amendment does something very simple. It says if a  school is open, it gets the new money that is in this bill, but if the  school is not open 5 days a week, then that money goes to the parents,  up to $10,000 per child, so they can get their kids an education.   We have single moms with kids trapped in schools that are not open,  and this crisis, this body can do something about. Those kids, if they  fall behind, the science and the data tells us that they will be  behind, potentially, for the rest of their lives. We should come  together in a bipartisan way to say: We are going to open the schools,  and we are going to give hope and relief to the kids who are being left  behind.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 968 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of  debate equally divided.    Mr. President, moments ago, the Democrats in this Chamber  just voted to send $1,400 stimulus checks to murderers, to rapists, and  child molesters incarcerated in prison. This amendment, just like the  one we just voted on that Senator Cassidy and I introduced, this  amendment before us today provides that the stimulus check should not  go to illegal aliens in this country.   The question for the American people to answer is, Should your money,  should taxpayer money be sent--$1,400--to every illegal alien in  America? This amendment provides that it should not; that stimulus  checks should only go to American citizens or to people lawfully  present.   Now, Democrats may say their language allows for that, but they know  that the IRS treats someone who is illegally present in the United  States for 31 days last year as a resident alien. So this corrects that  and ensures that illegal aliens are not eligible for taxpayer-funded  stimulus checks.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?    I call for the yeas and nays.
