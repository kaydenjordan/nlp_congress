 I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I would like to ask the Chair for  clarification. It is my understanding there is 4 hours of debate,  evenly divided between the Democrats and Republicans, on the discharge  petition.    And either side can yield back; is that correct?    Thank you.   Mr. President, let me be the first to rise today on our side and say  that I am in strong support of the nomination of Vanita Gupta to be the  Associate Attorney General.   The Justice Department has not had a Senate-confirmed Associate  Attorney General in over 3 years because President Trump never put  forward a nominee. The No. 3 position in the Department of Justice has  been virtually vacant of a Senate-confirmed nominee for 3 years.   That position, by definition, oversees the Department's civil  litigation components. This is no small deal. It is a big deal. The  Department of Justice needs and deserves to have full leadership in  place.   Vanita Gupta will be the first woman of color and the very first  civil rights attorney to serve as Associate Attorney General. This  historic nominee is also exceptionally well qualified. She is a veteran  of the Justice Department. She has a proven record of working across  political and ideological lines to uphold the rule of law in a  nonpartisan fashion. I don't believe President Biden could have picked  a better nominee.   Vanita Gupta first joined the Justice Department shortly after the  shooting death of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, MO. I  remember it. I am sure many of my colleagues do as well. It was a  difficult moment for many. As the head of the Department's Civil Rights  Division, Ms. Gupta worked closely with all of the stakeholders  involved in police reform: community leaders, civil rights leaders, and  law enforcement.   Not only did Ms. Gupta implement meaningful reforms in Ferguson, MO,  and other cities, but she did so by helping to repair the relationship  between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Can you think  of a better qualification at this moment in time in our history?   Sadly, in recent days, our Nation has been rocked by controversial  police shootings. Vanita Gupta is exactly the type of person we need at  the Justice Department at this very moment. One strong piece of  evidence is the incredibly broad range of support her nomination has  received. When you say the words ``civil rights lawyer,'' you say,  ``Oh, way off on the left. I will bet she is out of touch with  reality.''   Not so. It is not just the civil rights groups that support her. Her  nomination has the support of virtually every major law enforcement  organization in the country. I want to repeat that because in the  ensuing several hours, when we will discuss the discharge of her  nomination, there will be assertions made which do not acknowledge the  obvious.   Vanita Gupta has the support of virtually every major law enforcement  organization in the country, including the Fraternal Order of Police,  the National Sheriffs' Association, the Major Cities Chiefs  Association, and the International Association of Chiefs of Police,  just to name a few.   I can read numerous quotes from law enforcement groups praising Ms.  Gupta. I am going to read one. In a letter to the Senate, David  Mahoney, President of the National Sheriffs' Association, said:   ``I strongly believe that Ms. Gupta is exactly the type of leader who  is needed in the Justice Department today. She possesses immense  credibility among law enforcement leaders and community leaders.''   Immense credibility, with both law enforcement and community leaders.  Isn't that exactly the type of person we need in the Department of  Justice at this moment in history?    It comes as no surprise when you look back on her background.  Throughout her career, Ms. Gupta has worked across the partisan divide,  forming broad coalitions to get things done when people said it was  impossible. A great example of this is criminal justice reform. Over a  number of years, Vanita Gupta partnered with numerous conservatives-- certifiable, reported conservatives. Let me give you a couple names:  Grover Norquist; Mark Holden, the former general counsel of Koch  Industries.   These efforts helped lay the groundwork for the passage of the FIRST  STEP Act, a bill which I worked on with Senator Grassley, Senator Lee,  Senator Whitehouse, Senator Cornyn, a number of Democrats, Cory Booker  included. We put together a bipartisan bill, signed into law by the  President of the United States.   Vanita Gupta was part of that effort. She knew how to put Republicans  and Democrats at the table and come up with a reasonable compromise.  Isn't that exactly what we need at this moment in history?   The Judiciary Committee has received so many letters from Republicans  supporting Ms. Gupta's nomination that I only have time to scratch the  surface. Former Republican Congressman Tom Coleman, whom I served with  in the House, put it very well. He represented Missouri's Sixth  Congressional District for 16 years. He understood the challenge of  Ferguson, and he understands the record of Vanita Gupta. Here is what  he wrote: ``Ms. Gupta is a person who seeks the common good, without  concern for partisan gamesmanship.''   He added: ``I urge you, my former colleagues, to recognize the truth  with respect to Vanita Gupta: She is an ideal public servant. She  possesses wisdom and an ability to work across partisan lines.''   Ms. Gupta has spent her career fighting to uphold the rule of law,  almost always on behalf of those who had little power or little money.  In her previous tenure at the Justice Department, Vanita Gupta  undertook critically important work. In addition to police reform, she  led efforts to prosecute human trafficking, combat religious  discrimination, and protect the rights of servicemembers to ensure that  they didn't have to be worried about being taken advantage of  financially while they were protecting our Nation.  [[Page S1958]]    More recently, during her tenure at the Leadership Conference on  Civil and Human Rights, Ms. Gupta led initiatives on voting rights,  criminal justice reform, and the census.   Ms. Gupta began her career as a civil rights lawyer with the NAACP  Legal Defense and Educational Fund. One of the first matters she worked  on as a young attorney involved nearly 40 wrongfully convicted  individuals in the small town of Tulia, TX. The individuals who had  been wrongfully convicted were almost all African Americans, and they  had been convicted of drug charges based solely on the false testimony  of one corrupt, blatantly racist undercover police officer.   How about walking into that situation, trying to resolve that  situation. She did. Despite being completely innocent, these  individuals were sitting in jail, and their appeals had been rejected.  Vanita Gupta took their case anyway.   As a result of her work, not only were these individuals exonerated,  but they received pardons from the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick  Perry, and Texas eventually paid out a $6 million settlement. That is  nothing short of a political miracle, and she achieved it by hard work,  being smart as can be, and reaching out to both sides to find some area  of agreement.   Ms. Gupta's commitment to ensure the equal protection of the law has  been praised by Republicans and Democrats alike. Michael Chertoff,  former Secretary of Homeland Security under President George Bush, said  about Ms. Vanita Gupta in a letter to the Senate. ``She is a relentless  advocate for fairness and the rule of law.''   How would you like to have that as the lead sentence of your legal  biography: ``a relentless advocate for fairness and the rule of law.''  How would we like to have a person like that in this administration, in  the Department of Justice? Obviously, we would jump at the chance.   She is the right person at the right time. She will bring experience,  dedication, and a nonpartisan approach to the role of Associate  Attorney General, and I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.   Now, if you heard what I just said about Vanita Gupta, you might  think: Why was this a tie vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee?  First, it is an evenly divided committee: 11 Democrats, 11 Republicans.  And there are a lot of things going on, on both sides of the table,  when it comes to the final vote on nominees like this.   Several Republicans told me they might be leaning in her direction  but they couldn't vote for her in the committee. I hope they will  reconsider when it comes to the floor   And there was another thing going on too. Rightwing groups were  spending millions--millions--of dollars on television in Washington  trying to attack the reputation and character of Vanita Gupta.   I think I have made it clear. Vanita Gupta is highly qualified and  historic, with broad support from law enforcement and civil rights  organizations, advocates across the political spectrum. She, clearly,  on the merits, will be an outstanding Associate Attorney General.   But every step of the way, her detractors have tried to delay and  obstruct her nomination. We saw that in our Judiciary Committee markup  on March 25. I allowed committee Republicans to speak for 94 minutes  about Ms. Gupta's nomination at markup. One Senator from Texas spoke  for 29 minutes himself. I didn't cut him off.   But someone on the Republican side made the decision to invoke the 2- hour rule, a Senate rule that says that a committee cannot operate more  than 2 hours after the Senate comes into session, to try to cut off the  markup for the vote even before the vote.   I had received assurances earlier that the 2-hour rule would not be  invoked, but at 11:55, with barely 5 minutes to spare, I was told the  other side had changed their mind. Just as the previous two chairs of  the committee, Senators Graham and Grassley, had done in the past, I  ended debate, notwithstanding committee rule IV, and called for a vote  on the nomination.   I won't go into a debate over committee rule IV other than to say it  is a doomsday filibuster. Any Senator can object to the business in the  Senate Judiciary Committee and virtually stop all proceedings  indefinitely. There is no recourse.   I gave Republicans ample time to make their arguments in the  committee. I was prepared to give them even more time until the 2-hour  rule was invoked. But someone on the other side decided to force my  hand. I had to act quickly.   I told Republicans in writing in a March 24 letter that we would hold  a vote on Ms. Gupta's nomination the next day, and I meant it. In the  future, I would be happy to limit the number of minutes that Senators  can speak in order for all Senators to have an opportunity, but at this  moment in time, we have to accept the obvious.   Vanita Gupta has been subjected to blatantly false attacks from many  rightwingers and conservative, dark money groups. Republicans have  falsely claimed that she supports defunding the police. Be prepared.  You are going to hear this mantra again and again.   In reality, Gupta has the support of virtually every major law  enforcement organization in America. Republicans have made false claims  about Gupta's position on drugs. For example, the senior Senator from  Texas alleged that Gupta previously advocated, ``All drugs should be  legal.'' In reality, Vanita Gupta has never advocated that all drugs  should be legal. As the senior Senator from Texas knows, Gupta did  write, 9 years ago, that she favored decriminalizing the ``simple  possession'' of ``small amounts'' of marijuana and other drugs.   Take a look at what we have done with sentencing and drug crimes in  America, even under the Trump administration.   At her hearing, Ms. Gupta was completely forthright in explaining  that she changed her mind over the years in terms of decriminalizing  drug possession, due in part to a family experience with opioid  addiction.   Republicans have criticized Ms. Gupta's past statements on Twitter,  despite the fact that they strongly supported President Donald Trump  and many of his nominees, many of whom were just White males, who made  such harsh statements in speeches and social media posts that they were  legendary.   Republicans have argued that Gupta is radical and dangerous. In  reality, Vanita Gupta has a career-long record of working closely with  conservatives, business leaders and community leaders and law  enforcement. That is why she has the support of so many prominent  Republican leaders now.   I am looking forward to voting for her and to watching her serve in  the Department of Justice. She will follow the trail that she set in  her legal career, looking for solutions, bringing us together. Can you  think of a moment in history in this country when we needed that more?  I can't.   Every day we have these conflicting stories coming at us, from the  courts in Minnesota on a question of George Floyd and the culpability  for his death to a situation here in the Capitol, where we are honoring  law enforcement when Officer Billy Evans of the Capitol Hill Police  gave his life serving this country.   We are torn trying to find the right combination for law enforcement  that is sensible and principled and humane. We need someone like Vanita  Gupta at the table in the Department of Justice, leading. I hope her  critics will have second thoughts.   Give this outstanding woman an opportunity to serve her country even  more than she has in the past.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I don't know that there is another  Republican Senator that I have worked with as much and as effectively  and with as much pleasure as Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa--and I mean  it. We have done some good things together.   We sometimes started off in opposing positions and tried to find some  common ground. The First Step Act was a good illustration of that, but  it is not the only demonstration, and I trust that there will be more.  I am sorry we disagree today.   Two points I will make. Rule 4, as described by Senator Grassley, is  virtually, as I mentioned earlier, a doomsday filibuster. There is just  no way out of it, particularly with an evenly divided committee. I am  not the first to discover that as chairman.   I will make as part of the Record, and I am going to share with my  colleague from Iowa, the four or five instances when previous  Republican chairs of the committee did exactly what I did with this  nomination and said: We are moving forward; we are not going to pay  attention to rule 4.   Senator Graham, Senator Grassley, and others have done just exactly  that in the past. So I think we adopted that as a rule because it was  already in the rules, and we were evenly tied in committee. But it sure  ties the hands of a chairman or anyone who is trying to accomplish  anything if there is one person who just stands and objects and objects  and objects. It is a very difficult situation.   The second thing I will mention is--I am going to make this a part of  the Record, and I don't have it at hand as I stand here--the quote from  Merrick Garland in his nomination hearing when someone raised the  question about Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clarke, another nominee working  her way through the committee. Merrick Garland may not have known  either one of them personally beforehand. He could have, but I am not  sure. But he made it abundantly clear that this is the team he wanted  to manage the Department of Justice--no ifs, ands, or buts about it. He  totally committed and believed that each of them brought a perspective  in the law and by their own legal experience valuable to him and the  Department of Justice and to the Nation. So I don't think there is any  question that he is committed to Vanita Gupta, as he should be.   I will yield back at this point.    Excuse me. If I can have a clarification. As I understand  it, we are in measured time, 2 hours to a side. Any speakers on our  side will be taken from that 2-hour total.    Thank you very much    Mr. President, my friend and colleague from Utah is not  the first to come to the floor on the Republican side and raise  questions about committee procedure that led to Vanita Gupta being  considered today before the U.S. Senate.   They say it is unheard of, unthinkable, unimaginable, unfathomable  that the Senate committee rules were not carefully followed and that  their attempt at a filibuster was in some way diverted.   I would ask unanimous consent to have printed into the Record a memo  entitled ``Senate Judiciary Committee Rule Violations by [Senate  Judiciary Committee] Chairs Graham, Grassley, and Hatch.'        There being no objection, the material was ordered to be       printed in the Record, as follows:  Senate Judiciary Committee Rule Violations by Chairs Graham, Grassley,                                 and Hatch                       Chairman Graham Rule Violations         Graham (116th Cong.)

Graham ignored Democratic requests to       hold the bill over; called a vote--setting a time certain for       final passage of the bill--without first allowing any       Democratic members to speak; and did not allow any amendments       to be offered.        iii.

Date: October 15, 2020        ii. Summary: Chairman Graham held a markup during which       Committee Republicans held over Amy Coney Barrett's       nomination to the Supreme Court. Chairman Graham also called       a vote to vote on Barrett's nomination at a time certain the       following week. However, Barrett's hearing had not yet       concluded by this point--the witness panels were held in the       afternoon on October 15, 2020, after the markup vote.       Committee Democrats objected to holding this markup before       the hearing concluded, and Senator Durbin--the only Democrat       in attendance--moved to adjourn the markup. Graham overrode       Durbin's motion on a roll call vote in violation of the       Committee's quorum rule.        iii.

No Committee Democrats attended       this markup, at which Amy Coney Barrett's nomination was       voted out of Committee. Chairman Graham ignored this rule,       and Committee Republicans voted 12-0 to advance Barrett along       with the other nominees on the agenda that day.        iii.

Violation: Rule IV        i. Date: September 13, 2018        ii. Summary: Then-Chairman Grassley violated Rule IV by       passing a motion to cut off debate on Brett Kavanaugh's       nomination without an affirmative vote from one member of the       minority. At this markup, the Judiciary Committee held over       Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Numerous other items were on       the agenda that day, most notably a motion from thenChairman       Grassley to set a precise time at which the committee would       vote on Kavanaugh's nomination the following week. Senators       Leahy and Durbin argued that Grassley's motion violated Rule       IV by cutting off debate without the consent of any member of       the minority. Senator Durbin read Rule IV aloud and then       summarized: ``The point is, you need 11 votes and one member       of the minority to stop debate on any matter, let alone a       nomination to the Supreme Court.'' Grassley responded, ``The       answer to your question is no we don't, and we've checked       with the Senate Parliamentarian.'' Grassley asserted that       Chairman Hatch had done the same thing in 2003, setting a       precedent that he was following.        Other items on the agenda that day included: six motions to       subpoena various documents related to Kavanaugh' s record; 21       lower court judicial nominees; a nominee to be a U.S.       Attorney; a nominee to be a U.S. Marshal; a nominee to be       Director of National Drug Control Policy; and five       legislative bills.        iii.

Hatch (108th Cong.)        a. Violation: Rule IV        i. Date: February 27, 2003        ii. Summary: At a markup, Chairman Hatch ignored Rule IV by       cutting short Committee debate on the nominations of John       Roberts (D.C. Cir.) and Deborah Cook (6th Cir.). Pursuant to       Rule IV, then-Ranking Member Leahy asked for a vote before       Hatch ended debate, but Hatch refused, directing the clerk to       call the roll and noting that ``[t]he Chairman's prerogative       is to determine that we can go ahead to a vote'' and that       Rule IV ``does not apply to executive nominations.''        iii. February 27, 2003 Executive Business Meeting Record,       on file with the Senate Judiciary Committee Library     Mr. President, before yielding to my colleague from Rhode  Island, I would like to respond very briefly.   My, have we come a long way since we had a President who, for 4  years, refused to disclose his tax returns--first time ever. Oh, they  are under audit. I will get back to you at some other time later.   Now we have witnesses and nominees coming before the committee,  suggested by President Biden, who are producing the documentation and  the things that are being requested by this committee so that everyone  knows the answers.   So did Ms. Vanita Gupta produce 100 pages of documents? No. Did she  produce 1,000? No, she produced 11,000 pages of documents, answering  every question that was to be asked. And the suggestion the senior  Senator from Texas raises--he raised it before in committee--that  somehow, because her family made a business decision about selling a  chemical, legally, into the nation of Mexico, she should be held  responsible as a shareholder or as a member of the family?   You will notice, if you listen very carefully to what the Senator  said, he is not saying there was any wrongdoing. He is saying there was  an article once which made that allegation, and he has referred the  question to others to decide. That is a long way from saying Vanita  Gupta is responsible for whatever the company did, if it did anything,  wrong. She has made that full disclosure, and I think raising this is  unfair, just fundamentally unfair.   Secondly, on the question of decriminalizing drugs, narcotics, she  says her position on it has evolved. Well, I think the Senator from  Texas would be the first to acknowledge that the position of America  has evolved on the question of drugs; has it not? Hasn't the position  of Texas recently evolved on the decriminalization of some drugs and  the possession thereof?   We are thinking differently about it. We are trying to find the most  effective way to end addiction and save lives. We no longer want to  lock everybody up, nor should we. We are deciding that there are some  drug violations that shouldn't merit any time in jail, that some people  just need help to break their addiction.   If Vanita Gupta has been part of that conversation in America over 9  or 10 years, she is in good company. We have all been part of it.  Virtually all of us have been part of it.   And this notion of defunding the police--do you honestly believe the  Fraternal Order of Police would be endorsing her if she wanted to  defund the police?   She made it clear, as others have too, that reallocation of funds for  law enforcement is just common sense. Putting a social worker in a  delicate situation, putting a psychologist in a delicate situation, may  spare a policeman a terrible choice that he has to make, and I think  most of us agree that it is common sense.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, what is it about these nominees Vanita  Gupta and Kristen Clarke that drives some of the Members on the other  side of the aisle into a rage? Listen to how they describe them.   The senior Senator from Texas describes Vanita Gupta as a political  ``culture warrior,'' slandering and vilifying people. Then, of course,  the junior Senator from Texas calls her an ``extreme partisan  ideologue.'' ``Radical twins,'' he calls them.   What is it about these two nominees that drives them into such a  state of mind that they say these things about individuals seeking an  opportunity to again serve our Federal Government?   It is amazing to me that the junior Senator from Texas suggests that  they are in the thrall of handlers. Handlers. If you heard the story of  the lives of these two women and what they have overcome to be where  they are today, the last thing in the world you would use is a  reference to handlers. They have defied handlers all throughout their  lives--sons of immigrants, daughters of immigrants. Like so many of  them, they know they have to work hard to prove themselves, and they  have done it time and again.   Vanita Gupta. Can you picture that moment when the civil rights  organizations said to Vanita Gupta: We want you to go to Tulia, TX,  because something has happened there that looks like a terrible  miscarriage of justice. Forty people have been arrested for drug crimes  in Tulia, TX, and we want you to go down there, even though they are in  jail and they have been convicted, and defend them and try to find a  way that they will be released.   That is exactly what Vanita Gupta did. The net result was that they  were not only released, but the lawman who had supposedly found them  guilty was the one who was discredited and dishonored when it was over,  and the Texas Governor--the Republican Texas Governor--acknowledged it  with a pardon of these individuals and paying them millions of dollars  for what they had lived through. Who led that charge? Vanita Gupta. Was  she waiting for a message from a handler? No. She showed extraordinary  courage there and throughout her life as an attorney fighting for the  civil rights of others and as an attorney representing the Government  of the United States of America and the Department of Justice.   When I listen to efforts to discredit her and her professionalism, I  think, you haven't read the story. You would know in a second she  doesn't wait to hear from a handler. She never has. She has shown  exceptional courage and professionalism every step of the way.   Kristen Clarke, the same. Born in an area of New York City that I am  sure Senator Schumer knows, in a public tenement type of building, she  overcame all the odds. She graduated from law school and served in the  Department of Justice.   When the junior Senator from Texas comes and refers to Vanita Gupta  and Kristen Clarke as ``radical twins,'' zealots, ideologues, it is  disgusting. It is terrible. It is a terrible reference to a fine life  that each of them has lived.   And this notion that somehow they have fooled the Fraternal Order of  Police into believing that they really do love police, when, in fact,  as the Republicans argue, they just want to take all their money away-- we know better. The fact that Vanita Gupta has the endorsement of every  major law enforcement organization puts to rest some of the charges  they have made against her.   I can't believe what they are saying about these two nominees, but I  think that a majority of the Senate is ultimately going to judge that  they are ready to serve this country again and should, and the  Department of Justice.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Tester) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
