 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Stauber amendment  No. 83 that is in this en bloc.   This amendment would simply provide oversight over the DOD's  management of religious and medical exemptions for the COVID-19 vaccine  requirement.   At a time when we need every servicemember we can get, I am concerned  that there are people being discharged from the military without full  consideration of their religious or medical exemptions.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, it is past time for more transparency in  the exemption process so we can ensure that our servicemembers'  requests are being properly considered and fairly adjudicated.   While I don't think our servicemembers should be subject to the  COVID-19 vaccine at all, the least we can do is bring transparency to  the process of those who are seeking a legitimate exemption.   I thank Mr. Stauber for introducing this commonsense amendment and  looking out for the best interests of our men and women in uniform.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The Freedom-class littoral combat ships fill an important operational  need in the Navy's fleet. We have invested billions in this program and  decommissioning nine ships at the beginning of their service life is  complete financial malpractice and takes away from important assets  that can be used around the globe.    This amendment would have a direct negative impact on our national  security.   The Chinese Communist Party plans to expand their fleet, which will  reach 460 vessels by 2030. Meanwhile, in the same time period, the U.S.  fleet will shrink to less than 300.   These ships aren't perfect, as was mentioned earlier; no new class of  ship is. But scrapping these ships at less than half their average life  cycle is like throwing away a dime to save a nickel.   Admiral Gumbleton himself said that the fix for these isn't an  exorbitant amount of money. Why is it worth scrapping them entirely and  throwing away billions of hard-earned taxpayer dollars?   The push to decommission these ships is a multimillion-dollar  misstep. These ships are out in the fleet and they are executing  missions in littoral waters, making our country safer--from helping the  Coast Guard with drug interdiction in SOUTHCOM to maritime security  operations in CENTCOM.   Mr. Speaker, a vote in favor of this amendment is a vote against  national security, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  amendment.
