 Madam Speaker, I come to vote my heart.   Saddam died more than a decade ago, and even the faintest echoes of  his regime have long dissolved.    So if we are unable to declare victory and bring our troops home at  this time after Saddam is dead, after his regime has evaporated, after  ISIS has collapsed, then no war is ever truly winnable and every  authorization is an authorization for a forever war.   Let's not hand the 21st century off to China as we toil in the Middle  East. Instead of sending America's bravest patriots to the bloodstained  sands of the Middle East, let's care for our veterans here at home.   Instead of wasting American treasure bombing and rebuilding Iraq,  let's rebuild our own great Nation. Let's secure the U.S. border with  Mexico before we send the next soldier, sailor, dollar, or marine to  secure Iraq's border with Iran.   Instead of ill-fated adventurism, let's put America first.   Keeping U.S. Forces in Iraq is not what President Trump wants. It is  not what the American people want. It is not what the Iraq parliament  wants.   The best time to vote against the Iraq war would have been in 2002.  The second best time is today.
