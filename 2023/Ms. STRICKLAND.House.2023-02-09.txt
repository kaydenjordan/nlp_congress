 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  contributions of Black business owners during National Entrepreneurship  Week.   Black entrepreneurs have been at the forefront of innovation,  introducing new products, services, and industries that drive economic  progress. Yet, many face barriers accessing equity capital and  financing with affordable interest rates to sustain their growth.   According to the Alliance for Entrepreneurial Equity, Black startups  receive a mere 1 percent of total venture financing. Most start with  just one-third of the capital available to their White counterparts.   This Black History Month, I want to recognize Makieda Hart, a startup  founder and Black businessowner in my district. Through her tenacity  and determination, she continues to grow her business and makes an  impact in the 10th Congressional District of Washington State.   Knowledge about capital and resources are essential to all small  business owners, and she encourages young people to seek a mentor and  to always learn.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in Congress to take a closer look  at the challenges faced by Black entrepreneurs and to work together to  build a stronger, more equitable economy for all because economic  justice is, indeed, social justice.                            ____________________
