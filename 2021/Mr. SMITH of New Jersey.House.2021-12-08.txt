 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding. I thank Mr. McCaul for his extraordinary leadership on China,  including his Commission that has made many, many recommendations. I  want to thank Chairman Meeks for his leadership as well and, of course,  Chairman McGovern, with whom I have worked on this bill, for his  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I chaired a Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission hearing  in May titled ``China, Genocide and the Olympics,'' which helped  further underscore why H.R. 1155, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention  Act, which I have cosponsored with  Jim McGovern, is so important and  so necessary.   At that hearing, we heard testimony from Rayhan Asat, whose brother,  Ekpar, a Muslim Uyghur, at last report is still incarcerated in a  concentration camp in Xinjiang. Ekpar is a tech entrepreneur, media  founder, and philanthropist who won recognition both inside of China  and outside. Indeed, our State Department thought so highly of him that  he was part of the International Visitors Leadership Program.   But upon his return, because he was a Muslim Uyghur, the Chinese  authorities arrested him and disappeared him into a concentration camp  where he has remained for 5\1/2\ years.   What happens, Mr. Speaker, to those swallowed up in these horrific  concentration camps?   That is something we heard about in another Lantos Commission hearing  this past July where Gulzira, a survivor, told us what goes on each and  every day. In addition to her horrific, firsthand description of  unspeakable physical abuse, organized forced prostitution, rape, and  every gross violation of human rights imaginable, she also gave a  firsthand account of a forced labor factory in which she made gloves  for export for 1\1/2\ years. Gulzira is one of the lucky ones because  she was released when Radio Free Asia broadcast her plight to the  world.   Mr. Speaker, there are millions of stories like hers waiting to be  told, truly nightmarish accounts of President Xi Jinping's genocide.  And make no mistake about it, this is Xi Jinping's genocide. He is  personally responsible for having ordered it.   The rape and sexual abuse of women being held in so-called internment  camps, forced abortion, and involuntary sterilization to prevent the  birth of Uyghur children are in direct violation of Article II(d) of  the U.N. Genocide Convention, which states in part that genocide  includes imposing measures intended to prevent births within a group.   Forced labor on a massive scale that allows Chinese companies to  profit--and profit big time--from modern-day slavery is also absolutely  pervasive in Xinjiang. Documents obtained by The New York Times and the  International Consortium of Investigative Journalists exposed just how  cruel these plans are, originating, again, with Xi Jinping himself who  early next year will be hosting the Olympic Games, which is outrageous.   The leaked documents show how Xi directed the crackdowns, saying that  the Communist Party must put the ``organs of dictatorship'' to work and  show ``absolutely no mercy'' in dealing with Uyghurs and other  predominantly Muslim minorities.   In one speech, President Xi said: ``The weapons of the people's  democratic dictatorship must be wielded without any hesitation or  wavering.''   Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned by a report from Josh Rogin in The  Washington Post just last week stating how the Biden administration and  Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman sought to undermine the Uyghur  Forced Labor Prevention Act, which passed the Senate last July and the  House last Congress 406-3. According to Josh Rogin: ``Biden  administration officials have been quietly telling lawmakers to slow  down. . . . Sherman made it clear that the administration prefers a  more targeted and deliberative approach to determining which goods are  the products of forced labor.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record Josh Rogin's column from The  Washington Post, ``Opinion: Congress needs to act on Xi Jinping's  genocide now.''                  [From the Global Opinions, Dec. 2, 2021]        Opinion: Congress Needs To Act on XI Jinping's Genocide Now                         (By Josh Rogin, Columnist)         This week, a private U.K.-based investigative panel       released what it says are classified Chinese government       documents that appear to show how Chinese President Xi       Jinping personally laid the groundwork for systematic forced       assimilation of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. It's the most       damning proof to date of the ongoing Uyghur genocide. So why       can't Congress pass a simple bill to stop the products       connected to that genocide from ending up in U.S. homes and       businesses?        Yet the documents, which likely come from the same tranche       of leaked Chinese Communist Party communications revealed by       the New York Times over two years ago, add to the already       abundant evidence that the Chinese government's mass       internment, mass forced labor, forced population control,       family destruction and cultural erasure of the Uyghurs fit       the United Nation's definition of genocide as ``a crime       committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnic,       racial or religious group, in whole or in part.''  [[Page H7501]]         Yet, the Democrat-led Congress can't seem to get the Uyghur       Forced Labor Prevention Act, which passed the Senate       unanimously in July, to President Biden's desk. Pointing to       procedural issues and promises of future action, Democratic       leadership in both the House and Senate can't seem to agree       on a strategy to pass the bill through both chambers, despite       publicly claiming they support it.        On Wednesday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), the co-sponsor of       the, Senate's version of the bill, pushed to add it as an       amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, a must-      pass piece of legislation.        Senate Democrats objected under a procedural rule that bars       amendments that affect appropriations. Rubio called that a       dodge. ``This is about the fact that they don't want this       bill to pass over at the House,'' Rubio said on the Senate       floor, referring directly to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).        Rubio also said U.S. corporations that profit from forced       labor in China, such as Apple and Nike, have been lobbying       against the bill, which is true. On Thursday, Pelosi denied       Rubia's accusations of stalling and promised her chamber       would pass the House's version of the legislation, introduced       by Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), which the House passed last       year 406 to 3. In an interview, McGovern told me his bill       will be voted on and likely passed again in the House next       week. But if and when that happens, that won't be the end.       The two chambers will still have passed two different       versions of the bill, with no firm plan for how to reconcile       them.        Meanwhile, Biden administration officials have been quietly       telling lawmakers to slow down. Administration sources       confirmed that in an October call between Deputy Secretary of       State Wendy R. Sherman and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), the       other co-sponsor, Sherman made it clear that the       administration prefers a more targeted and deliberative       approach to determining which goods are the products of       forced labor. She also told Merkley that getting allied buy-      in was critical and more effective than unilateral action.        ``To be clear, the Department of State is not opposing this       amendment,'' a State Department spokesman told me. ``We share       the Congress' concerns about forced labor in Xinjiang.'' In       other words, while the administration supports the       legislation in public, they are asking Democrats to       essentially water it down in private. Sherman's specific       criticism relates to a part of the bill that would require a       presumption that all products coming from Xinjiang are       tainted by forced labor unless the importer can prove       otherwise. This happens to be the exact provision       corporations are also objecting to. Maybe it's a coincidence.        ``It isn't partisan or in any way controversial for the       U.S. to be unequivocally, resoundingly opposed to genocide       and slave labor,'' Merkley told me. ``The Senate passed this       legislation in July, and it's time to get it over the finish       line.''        There is a legitimate concern that supply chains for       everything from solar panels to sneakers could be affected by       the bill. But our dependency on products from an area where       genocide is occurring is the root of the problem. Passing the       bill now would send industry a clear signal to speed up what       they are already doing, which is to stop doing business in       areas riddled with forced labor. Also, forced labor products       from China put U.S. manufacturers at a severe disadvantage.       ``We must shine a light on the inhumane practice of forced       labor, hold the perpetrators accountable and stop this       exploitation,'' Pelosi said while passing the bill last year.       ``And we must send a clear message to Beijing: These abuses       must end now.''        Another year has gone and the bill still lingers. Pelosi       has been a champion for human rights in China for decades,       but the fight is not over and the ball is in her court.       Overall, it's up to both parties and both chambers to act to       stop a genocide now. There's no good reason to delay.    We have no access, Mr. Speaker, to the  concentration camps in Xinjiang. We have no idea the supply chains. It  is closed. It is a dictatorship. There are no onsite inspections.  Again, we are talking genocide against these Muslims who are being  wiped off the face of the Earth.   The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act prohibits imports from  Xinjiang to the United States by creating a rebuttable presumption.  That is the core of this bill, that all goods produced in the region  are made with forced labor unless U.S. Customs and Border Protection  certifies by clear and convincing evidence that goods were not produced  with forced labor. So the rebuttable presumption is the key to this  legislation.   It is very workable. As my good friend and colleague noted, cotton,  solar panels, and so many other things are produced there. We need to  know. We need to stop them from coming here.    Again, if these companies can prove that it  is not made by forced labor, not made as part of this genocide, then it  would be welcomed here. But we know that is unlikely to happen.   My hope is that we will unite--Republican and Democrat, Democrat and  Republican--around this bill and get it to the President as soon as  humanly possible.   Delay is denial. People are being slaughtered each and every day in  Xinjiang, and we can do something, maybe not a whole lot, but something  to mitigate and stop this.
