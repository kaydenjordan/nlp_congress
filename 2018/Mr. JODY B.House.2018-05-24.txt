 HICE of Georgia asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life of Mr. Ernie Simons, a longtime Georgia resident, a brave hero of  the Vietnam war, and a dedicated public servant who has worked  tirelessly on behalf of the men and women who have served in our Armed  Forces.   Having first served as a marine in Vietnam, Mr. Simons continued to  serve as an employee of the Georgia Department of Veterans Service.  During his 30 years there, he worked in a number of capacities,  including as the director of the Georgia Veterans Memorial Cemetery and  director of the Health and Memorials division of the Georgia Department  of Veterans Service.   In April, the community renamed Veterans Drive, a road adjacent to  the veterans home where Mr. Simons dedicated so many years, as Ernie  Simons Veterans Way. There is perhaps no better tribute for a man who  has given countless hours and his undivided attention to our local  heroes than to have this road named in his honor.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please stand with me to honor the  life and legacy of this Georgia hero, greatly deserving the respect of  all Americans.                            ____________________
