 Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend from South  Carolina for yielding. Go Gators.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1, which would unleash  American energy, lower energy prices, and restore the United States as  energy independent and as an energy leader in the world.   I thank my good friends, Leader Scalise and Chair Rodgers, and my  good friend here from South Carolina--he is a good man even though he  roots for the wrong team--for being such strong leaders on the issue  and bringing this legislation to the floor.   Since the Biden administration came into office, Americans have been  faced with a persisting energy crisis. We are in the midst of  unprecedented increases in the costs of living, and I continue to hear  from my constituents regarding how difficult it is to make ends meet.   I have heard from numerous constituents who are facing the prospect  [[Page H1557]]  of losing their livelihood due to increased energy costs driving up  their business' operational costs.   Tragically, other constituents are now facing severe financial  hardship and facing increased energy costs while on fixed incomes. Our  seniors are having a very hard time, Mr. Chairman.   My constituents deserve energy policies that make energy more  affordable for Americans, not more expensive.   Not only will H.R. 1 unleash American energy to decrease costs, but  it will also spur the mining and processing of critical minerals  domestically. It is essential that we do this. We are too dependent on  our adversaries, particularly China, for these minerals that we use in  nearly every aspect of our economy. H.R. 1 will allow us to produce  innovative technologies and critical resources here at home and not in  China.   This bill will return the United States as a global energy leader and  secure America's future from dependencies on our adversaries.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the Member for yielding. He is a great man, and  he is a leader on these issues.    Mr. Chair, I was recorded as ``no,'' but I intended to  vote ``aye'' on rollcall No. 170.
