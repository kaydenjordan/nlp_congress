 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the members of the  Wisconsin delegation for joining me at this very difficult moment.   Madam Speaker, I really wish that I did not have to make the request  that I am about to make, but I am asking Members to join me and indulge  me in this undertaking.   Two days ago, the employees at Molson Coors in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,  went to work in my district, and, unfortunately, five of them did not  go home. Now their families are gathering to put them to rest.   I want my colleagues to know their names:   Jesus Valle Jr. of Milwaukee was an employee since 2014 and was only  33 years old.   Gennady ``Gene'' Levshetz, 61, of Mequon, was an employee since 2008.  I have known Gene personally since 1992, and his wonderful wife, Alina;  his daughters, Tanya and Becca.   I was so inspired by his story of having emigrated from the former  Soviet Union to Mequon in the early 1990s. He worked like a dog.   Gene will be remembered for being the best husband, the best dad, and  the best grandfather. I can attest to that.   Trevor Wetselaar, 33, of Milwaukee was married and a 2009 graduate of  the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was an employee since 2018.   Mr. Dana Walk of Delafield was an employee since 2004. He had been  married to Dori for 35 years. His three children, Andy, Melanie, and  Michelle are left to grieve his loss. He was a graduate of Kettle  Moraine High School.   Dale ``Huddy'' Hudson of Waukesha was an employee since 2008.   Madam Speaker, I would ask that all Members and guests in the gallery  rise for a moment of silence and reflect on these souls.                            ____________________
