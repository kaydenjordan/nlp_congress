 Mr. Speaker, Alexander Hamilton was 21 years of  age; Aaron Burr, 20 years of age; James Monroe, 18; James Madison, 25  years old. These young Founding Fathers, some of America's most notable  names, were college age when they stood against an opposing British  monarch and demanded life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   In fact, the right to freedom of speech was considered so important  that James Madison, the author of the  [[Page H3347]]  Constitution, made it the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights.  However, it seems today that some of America's youngest minds of this  generation have forgotten just what it is this great Nation stands for  and what ideals it was built on.                                time  1015    A disturbing trend has begun cropping up on some college campuses  around the country. The ideals that our Founding Fathers so  painstakingly penned into life are at risk of disappearing from the  sacred parchment of liberty. Freedom of speech is under attack. The  left has perpetrated the idea that freedom of speech only applies to  them but not to opposing views: free speech for me but not for thee.   Conservative thinkers are often banned from some universities. If  they are invited, students are allowed the disrupt the events.   Mr. Speaker, since when does a war of words include physical violence  against anyone who disagrees? Some universities and students claim that  if speech is offensive, it must be banned; and who are we going to let  decide what is offensive or hurtful? The listener? The elite academia?  The government?   This is a very dangerous philosophy that some of our universities are  promoting and students are accepting. The British censored speech  critical of the King. That is one reason the free flow of diverse ideas  is protected in our country. The Bolsheviks and Lenin enforced  censorship of ideas they opposed.   Lenin said, to paraphrase: We don't let our enemies have guns. Why  should we let them have ideas that are calculated to criticize the  government?   Speech control by universities, professors, students, or government  is a violation of the 1776 movement. It seems as if our very founding  document is at risk of fading into the abyss of history.   Have we forgotten the meaning of the First Amendment? The First  Amendment protects all forms of speech, even those we don't personally  agree with. Even those words that offend us personally are protected.   If our American public square or university becomes a place where  only ideas that the speech police allow, then we have lost our way and  have become nothing more than an echo chamber.   How can political ideas be challenged if people cannot be allowed the  freedom to speak different opinions? In Terminiello v. Chicago, Supreme  Court Justice Douglas stated: ``A function of free speech under our  system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its  high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates  dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to  anger.''   I guess Justice Douglas would not be allowed on some of our  university campuses today to have dialogue with students because he  ruled controversial views are constitutionally protected.   Freedom of speech is one of the things that made this country  different from the rest of the world.   We must remember that fact and reject the tendency to bruise the  First Amendment by stamping out speech that is controversial.   In the famous words of Evelyn Beatrice Hall, who wrote under a  pseudonym in the 1900s: ``I disapprove of what you say, but I will  defend to the death your right to say it.''   I don't see any university professors teaching this dedication to  free speech. What is most disturbing is that often it is the public  universities that are responsible for silencing speech that they don't  agree with. This is clearly a violation of the philosophy of the First  Amendment.   George Washington said it best: ``If the freedom of speech is taken  away, then dumb and silent we may be led like sheep to the slaughter.''   America must always remain a free and open public space where the  marketplace of ideas, even those we may detest or disagree with, are  always freely expressed.   Mr. Speaker, I leave you with the words of James Madison: ``The  advancement and diffusion of knowledge is the only guardian of true  liberty.''   Our college youth of today should heed the words of American youth of  1776. But the elite academia of our university speech police may not  allow controversial words--those words of Madison and Jefferson--to be  taught on campus because it just might offend them.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the first board of her keel landed on  the dockyard with a loud thump.   It was 107 years ago today, April 17, 1911. One year later, she  sailed smoothly into Newport News, Virginia, harbor, christened the USS  Texas, BB-35. She was commissioned and saw immediate action in World  War I. The Texas made numerous voyages to the North Sea, serving the  country and our State of Texas.   Upon formal entry into World War II, the battleship Texas escorted  war convoys across the Atlantic, was the flagship on D-day, and saw  action in the Pacific as well. She was decommissioned in 1948.   Texas schoolchildren saved their nickels to bring the ship home to  Texas. She is now moored in La Porte, Texas. But now after serving our  great Nation, Texas is in danger of being scrapped for parts, a fate  unfitting for the majestic ship that served our country.   To prevent this, the State of Texas and Congress must band together  and work to save the battleship Texas from sinking into the depths of  history.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 2905) to require the Attorney General to establish  procedures for expedited review of the case of any person who  unlawfully solicits personal information for purposes of committing  identity theft, while purporting to be acting on behalf of the IRS, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2905         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Justice for Victims of IRS       Scams and Identity Theft Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

SEC. 3. PUBLICATION OF REPORT.         Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Attorney General shall make the report submitted       under section 3(b) publically available on an Internet       webpage of the Attorney General.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2905, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, identity theft is a problem across the United States. It  affects millions of Americans each year. A recent study found that $16  billion was  [[Page H3357]]  stolen from more than 15 million American consumers in 2016.   In the last several years, sophisticated phone scams targeting  taxpayers, including recent immigrants and elderly persons, have been  prevalent throughout the United States. Callers claim to be IRS  employees using fake names and bogus IRS identification badge numbers.  The fraudsters sometimes know a lot of information about the targets,  and they may even alter the caller I.D. to make it look like the real  IRS is calling them.   Victims are told they owe money to the IRS and that it must be paid  promptly through a gift card or wire transfers. Victims are threatened  with arrest, deportation, or suspension of a business or driver's  license. In many cases, the caller becomes hostile and insulting. In an  effort to trick victims into sharing private information, these thieves  sometimes claim that the refunds are ready for deposit. If the phone  isn't answered, the scammers leave an urgent callback request.   These crimes must be prosecuted in order to protect victims and bring  scheming criminals to justice. I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2905, the Justice for Victims of IRS Scams and Identity Theft Act,  which will help Congress better understand how many identity theft  crimes are being prosecuted, as well as ways to prevent these crimes,  bolster assistance that is made available to victims, and go after the  thieves.   I thank Congressman  David Young for his work on this bill, which  will protect American consumers, and I urge the Senate to take it up  without delay.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Iowa (Mr. Young), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Young from Iowa and Ms. Sinema from Arizona  for this bipartisan legislation; the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee for bringing this to the floor; and my friend, Ms. Jackson  Lee, from Houston, Texas, for supporting this legislation as well.   Mr. Speaker, when the phone rings and a person answers it, if  somebody on the other end says they are from the IRS, that brings fear  and trepidation into the soul of whoever answers the phone. People fear  the IRS for a multitude of reasons, so they become vulnerable to a  thief who identifies themselves as an IRS agent and want to do the  right thing. They don't want to go to jail for an IRS violation, so  they cooperate with this criminal on the other end who is a smooth- talking criminal thief, who is trying to steal money from this person.   As Ms. Jackson Lee said, many times these are the elderly. These are  people who have tried to save money over the years; and now the IRS,  they think, is coming after them, and they want to cooperate because  they want to follow the law.   These scammers are just, to me, some of the worst people in our  society. As a former judge and prosecutor, I don't like thieves--people  who steal from others--especially vulnerable people.   This legislation helps in a couple of ways, several ways. It helps  the victims understand what their responsibility is, and is not, when  somebody calls. But it also lets those thieves out there in our  country, and other countries, know that we are going to go after them.  I mean, $16 billion stolen in one year from 15 million Americans. That  is a lot of money. That is a lot of money even for the government.   This legislation is vital, it is good legislation, it is bipartisan  legislation, and it should pass quickly. The Senate, down the hallway,  should take up this bill and pass it as well.   And that is just the way it is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
