 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to rise today to  anchor this CBC Special Order hour.   Today, Monday, October 2, members of the Congressional Black Caucus  will be speaking on the floor about the devastating impact of natural  disasters, particularly hurricanes, and the critical role of the  Federal Government's response.   In the wake of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and now Maria, the Federal  Government has already deployed assets to affected regions, from HHS  public health resources, the Coast Guard, the Urban Search and Rescue  Task Force, to Corps of Engineers flood-fighting projects.   In the coming weeks and months, additional resources will help  shelter displaced Americans and get businesses back on their feet.  Congress must also ensure that the Federal response to these disasters  is just and equitable, and that communities of color are not directly  or indirectly harmed by recovery efforts.   During this time, we will hear from other members of the  Congressional Black Caucus and its friends to discuss this issue. For  the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the American  people on issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus,  Congress, the constituents we represent, and all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne),  from the city of Newark.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Payne, my colleague, for those  sentiments and that support to the people of the Virgin Islands and  Puerto Rico and to all the people of the Caribbean region. I am  grateful for his empathy, for his support, the support of his  constituents, as well as all the Members who have reached out to the  Virgin Islands in these last several weeks.   The islands have been struck by something that is nothing less than  cataclysmic in many respects, particularly in a time of year when we  are preparing for what is right now our only viable and large industry,  the tourism industry. We have lost that for this year. We have lost  that on all of the islands, all of the regions at this time.   I know that so many of you have seen and expressed--so many Members  on both sides of the aisle have come up to me and said, or texted or  called and said, that they are there for me, and I am going to hold  them to that. I am going to hold them to that because what we are  facing in the Virgin Islands, I feel guilty right now--and I told my  staff--being here, having air conditioning, sitting in a room. I feel  guilty because I know what the children of the Virgin Islands are going  through right now.   There is no air conditioning. There is no light on the islands right  now. Many of the people, many of the communities are in utter darkness,  and as the heat rises with the amount of moisture that is in the air,  we know that there will be health hazards that are about to happen in  terms of mosquitoes, with dengue, chikungunya, and all other kinds of  diseases that are going to be occurring.    I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.    I know that that is why I am here because I need to be  their voice, because they are voiceless right now. If you look on  national media, you hear about what is happening in Puerto Rico, and,  Lord knows, I feel for our fellow islanders, our brothers and sisters  over there, but very rarely do you hear about what is happening in the  Virgin Islands.   On September 6, Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic  storms this century, destroyed the islands of St. John and St. Thomas,  the islands that are part of the district that I represent. Three weeks  later, the island of St. Croix was devastated by Maria, a second  Category 5 hurricane ripping through the U.S. Virgin Islands in less  than a month. Both Hurricanes Irma and Maria have wreaked havoc in the  U.S. territories of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and other  Caribbean nations.   We forget that there are other places in the Caribbean that have also  been struck, St. Martin and Sint Maarten, Barbuda, Anguilla, our very  close neighbors, the British Virgin Islands, Tortola, Anegada, Virgin  Gorda, Jost Van Dyke, places that Americans love to go to, to vacation,  to enjoy themselves, not thinking about the lives of the people that  are there or not there anymore.   We know that right now the island of Barbuda is without an  inhabitant, without an inhabitant in centuries. There is no one on  Barbuda after the hurricane.   Turks and Caicos, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, one that also strikes me is  Dominica. Dominica was not hit by the first Hurricane Irma, and that  little island nation reached out to the U.S. Virgin Islands, reached  out to Puerto Rico and said: We don't have much, but we are going to  give you the money that we have. We, as a government, will give you  200,000. We will bring relief. We will bring whatever we can.   And 2 weeks later, Hurricane Maria struck them and has devastated  that island.   Their Prime Minister went to the United Nations a week ago and  begged, begged the support of the free world, begged the support of the  members of the United Nations to support them.   Although the full extent of the two hurricanes' impact has yet to be  assessed, it is clear that, in the Caribbean, the damage from these  storms appears to be unparalleled.   President Trump issued major disaster declaration for the Virgin  Islands and Puerto Rico. Dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries have  been reported alongside widespread infrastructure damage all throughout  the Caribbean.   I received a text just this morning from members of my family who are  still looking for loved ones on the island of St. Croix. That is why,  in the days and months ahead, we must continue to work together to  ensure that the individuals and families impacted by these devastating  storms receive all the aid they need. The catastrophic destruction  caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria demands massive amounts of aid to  address the overwhelming needs of the countless victims who now face  the daunting task of rebuilding their lives.   FEMA has been on the ground in the Virgin Islands even before Irma  hit the islands of St. John and St. Thomas. There are now more than  12,600 Federal staff engaged in response and recovery operations from  Hurricanes Maria and Irma in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico,  representing nearly three dozen departments and agencies.   Storms of this magnitude require the full attention and support of  the entire Nation. The people of the Virgin Islands have lost their  homes and possessions. Businesses have been lost alongside hospitals,  schools, utility systems, and other vital infrastructure.   To give you an example, after Irma, Roy Schneider Medical Center, the  only hospital on the island of St. Thomas, was partially destroyed, its  roof ripped off, its walls caved in, windows blown out. Patients needed  to be evacuated to the island of St. Croix and to San Juan to be at  Juan Luis Hospital on St. Croix and additional hospitals on San Juan,  as well as the veterans facility there.   Of course, people were thinking that St. Croix, after Irma, would be  the base. As people on St. Thomas and St. John were reeling from the  devastation of Irma, post offices were gone, schools annihilated, mud  slides began after additional rains, people in Coral Bay on St. John  felt lost, isolated, trapped. Many people had days, almost weeks before  they could get out and be in the rest of the public population.   When Maria came, Maria struck what we thought would be our base camp,  the island of St. Croix, and as luck would have it, the only functional  hospital left in the Virgin Islands, the hospital of Juan Luis was  breached by Hurricane Maria and has now been condemned by the Army  Corps of Engineers.   What facility will Virgin Islanders use? Will we continue to be in  tents manned by the brave men and women of our military who have come  down to support us? Will we operate from an operating room, an  emergency room in a box, what they have given us thus far?   That can't be. We have one functioning operating room that is being  held together by the good graces and MacGyvering of the men and women  of Juan Luis Hospital right now. Should that be for American citizens?   I went on distribution lines. I went to grocery stores where people  were waiting for hours. I am telling you hours--3 hours to get gas; 3,  4 hours, the entire time of a curfew, to go on a distribution line to  get a couple of packs of  [[Page H7662]]  water and some MREs for a family, standing out in the hot Caribbean  sun. People were sharing umbrellas, sharing water, singing with each  other trying to keep their spirits up.   I met a man who had his veteran's cap on, Vietnam vet, people who are  members of The American Legion and asking me: ``I fought for this  country; I am an American citizen; do they think about us? I have not  seen us on the news. My family tells me that we are not on the news,''  because, of course, his TV is not working, because almost all of the  Virgin Islands is in darkness.                                time  2045    We have been able, through the valiant effort of our water and power  authority and the linemen and others who are out there, to bring power  to critical structures; to our government house; to the main blocks in  Christiansted; to parts of Charlotte Amalie, the capital of the Virgin  Islands; to the airport so that relief planes can come in and out. That  is who is in light right now.   But for so many others and children right now, it is darkness for  them. The couple of hours that they have outside of the curfew are to  be making the rounds to get ice, to keep insulin refrigerated in their  homes, to keep milk for children and formula for babies cold before it  goes bad. That is the daily struggle now of Virgin Islanders, American  citizens, veterans, people who pledge their allegiance to this flag,  people who are proud to say that they are American citizens.   As we saw on the mainland in the United States following Hurricanes  Katrina, Sandy, and, most recently, Harvey, Americans need to come  together again with compassion and care. I have heard commitment from  the President and my colleagues in Congress to the U.S. territories  receiving the support they need.   Moving forward, I am hopeful, but vigilant, and I will make sure that  they keep to their promise and their commitment that President Trump  and this Congress delivers on the promises to support their fellow  Americans in the Caribbean region. This is a plea by me on behalf of my  people to keep us in your thoughts, prayers, and support in the coming  months and years. May our collective attention span endure enough  through the constant new cycle so that we can come together to move  beyond relief to healing and prosperity.   This is an opportunity. I keep trying to tell our young people on the  islands who are in despair, who have low morale, that this is an  opportunity for us to leapfrog technology, to create the kind of Virgin  Islands, for the Virgin Islands to be the beacon in the Caribbean  region, the beacon of what American might can do when it does what it  is supposed to do.   It is this Congress' constitutional responsibility to the  territories. The benign neglect that this Congress has gotten away with  for the last 100 years needs to stop right now. They need to stop  wagging their finger and telling Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands  that they have not done what they are supposed to do when this Congress  knows that they are not doing the right thing by those territories. Our  formulas are different. The money that we receive is different. We get  the short shrift on every bill that comes on this floor. Yet, still,  you expect us to stretch that out like the poor stepchild that you  think we are to make do and keep quiet.   But it is going to stop right now. We cannot be quiet anymore,  because not only are we hungry, 30 percent of the children of the  Virgin Islands live in poverty, but now we are blind as well. There is  no cell reception in most of the areas of the Virgin Islands. While I  was down there last week, my staff and I roamed the islands with our  cell phones, sitting in bypasses, sitting in areas with others, trying  to get a signal to plead with the National Security Council, plead with  FEMA, and others to do the right thing by the Virgin Islands.   Given the enormity of the challenges ahead, the Virgin Islands will  require the coordinated and sustained financial commitment of the  United States. For this reason, I ask that Members of Congress fully  support inclusion of funding in forthcoming disaster supplemental  packages that will aid in short-term as well as long-term relief,  recovery, and reconstruction of the Virgin Islands. The international  community, including the United States, has an obligation to work with  affected governments to restore infrastructure, provide critical  relief, and help recovery and build back our islands. We must act  quickly to save lives, ensure that those in the Virgin Islands are back  on the road to swift recovery.   Listen, I know we are hearing that FEMA is on the ground, that  supplies are there, and that things are moving along. I must admit,  FEMA is on the ground. I see the supplies in the cartons, in the  containers on our ports, and I hear the discussions at daily briefings  that go on at our local emergency management system to how they are  working hand in hand with FEMA. I believe that the Army Corps and the  Department of Defense and FEMA are there and they want to lend a hand.   But something is not working, whether it is in the local government,  a dysfunction there, or dysfunction in communications, or dysfunction  at the highest levels of the Federal Government. Because when I go to  neighborhoods like Whim, when I go to Tutu High Rise, when I go to  Coral Bay, when I go to Hannah's Rest, when I go to Frederiksted and  talk with people and they tell me they haven't had water in a week,  something is wrong, and something needs to be done by this Congress  that has the responsibility for the Virgin Islands.   How can a child in the United States say that they don't have water?  How can a child in the United States say that water is streaming over  them because many of the roofs in many of these areas are completely  gone?   So what I wanted to do was to walk the Members of Congress and you,  Mr. Speaker, through the destruction that I have seen with my eyes in  the Virgin Islands.   What you see right here is a home. This is a private homeowner's home  completely gone. It looks like a construction site. It looks as if they  are trying to start building when, in fact, this was someone's home  before.   Additionally, this is another home that now looks like a construction  site that people are living in. People can no longer be here. They have  abandoned--they have had to leave this home.   I have additional things that I would like to show you.   This is a line right now of people to fill up some containers with  gas so that they can keep generators going for a couple of hours a day  so that their children can read, so that they can wash themselves, so  they can find out what is going on in the outside world. People can  listen to a radio to find out what is not being said about them by  others.    Here is another home in the Virgin Islands. This is the kind of  destruction that took place on the islands that I represent, the  islands that are my home. This is all of St. John. Our transportation  system between the islands has been completely obliterated. This is a  ferry that was used between St. Thomas and St. John to bring goods, to  bring people between those islands. The islands of St. John, Cruz Bay,  Chocolate Hole, and Coral Bay now feel cut off, left out, because the  ferry system has been down for many weeks.   Look at this. This is what is happening in the Virgin Islands right  now. This is the main street in Christiansted. If you look over here,  this is the government house, and this is what our roads look like  after the hurricane. You can see that this roof is actually a part of  the roof over here that has completely been sheared off by Hurricane  Maria and strewn across the street. Lines are down and poles are down.   This is a commercial business on the island of St. Croix, a business  that will take months, if not a year, at least, to recover if FEMA  moves quickly on supporting a small business loan so that they can have  the support that they need to be able to do that.   These are the things that you don't see on the news that the people  of the Virgin Islands are dealing with right now. What is our greatest  asset--and has been for some years after our oil refinery was closed,  after this Congress in 2004 changed the rules for the American JOBS Act  that took away many of our knowledge-based businesses, our financial  services sector--is we have had to rely on tourism.   And this is a hotel room in one of our major hotels. This is what the  destruction of the hurricanes look like in the  [[Page H7663]]  Virgin Islands right now. This is a hotel room that will not be  available for the coming months for the people of the Virgin Islands to  be able to sustain themselves with employment.   What I am showing you now was, at one point, two homes, two  homeowners' families. You can see the two houses look literally as if a  hurricane just came across them and smashed them with a fist from the  top. You can barely make out what was once in these homes. These homes  no longer exist. These people have no homes.   There is no temporary shelter designation right now. People are  living in shelters in some of the few schools that are still intact,  which means: Where are our children going to go to school?   Many of our schools have also been destroyed. What will happen to the  children of the Virgin Islands? What will happen to us all?   Here is what some of the roads look like when we talk about the  utility system and the need--or why we are in the dark in the Virgin  Islands right now.   This is a major road. Can you imagine having this next to your house?  Can you imagine this amount of transponders, transformers, in front of  your home?   This is why most of the Virgin Islands are in the dark right now.  This is what is happening on these islands.   This is someone's home. This is our industry. This is tourism right  now in the Virgin Islands. This is a hotel room in one of our major  resorts. Places known over the world--Caneel Bay on St. John--are gone,  are obliterated, will be no more for 2 or 3 years.   What are the people of the Virgin Islands supposed to do? Are we  asking for much?   We are asking for support. We fight in your wars. We begged when we  became part of the United States to be part of the draft because we  want to take on the responsibility of American citizenship. But under  the Constitution, it is this Congress, Mr. Speaker, which has  responsibility for the territories: Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin  Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianas. And I have to  tell you that it has been a poor job that you have been doing of that  responsibility thus far.   We get the short shrift in Federal funding in formulas. Let's not  talk about the Affordable Care Act. We don't even have an exchange to  have been upset that we lost an exchange. That was never given to us.  The Virgin Islands, with 30 percent of the children living in poverty,  still don't get the disproportionate share for hospitals that the rest  of the United States get.   Why?   I can't get a straight answer about why we shouldn't have it, but we  don't. Neither do the smaller island territories.   This is what we are left with. And we are asking you for your  support. I am asking you for their support. I am begging for support  for the people that I represent, because many Virgin Islanders are not  going to beg you for support. That is not in them, that is not who they  are. The biggest phrase that people have right now when I go around the  islands after Irma and after Maria--both Category 5 when they struck  the U.S. Virgin Islands--and I ask people, ``How did you make out?''-- that is now our new greeting for one another: ``So good to see you. How  did you make out?'' And people's response is continually: ``Thank God I  have life. I am blessed I have life.''    And when you have to press them to ask them, ``What happened to your  home,'' then they will just shake their head, ``It is no more. My home  is no more. But thank God I have life. I am good. We are good.''   That is the kind of people who are the people of the Virgin Islands.  So they are not going to beg this Congress for support. I am going to  beg for them, because you haven't been doing it out of your own  volition or what you know is right to do. You haven't done it thus far.  What is happening in Puerto Rico is happening in the Virgin Islands  right now.   As the sole representative here in Congress representing the Virgin  Islands, I will continue the work that I have been doing in support of  the islands' overall recovery efforts, including facilitating  generators and security for local grocery stores, businesses so Virgin  Islanders can get fresh food and goods, working with local shipping  companies to clear the ports and bring commerce and relief packages to  the islands, coordinating with housing support for the Red Cross and  local shelters, as well as rebuilding efforts of the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers.   Additionally, I will continue to update my residents and businesses  around the ongoing efforts to make sure that the U.S. Virgin Islands  continue to receive the attention and support they need during these  difficult times.                                time  2100    While the devastation of this hurricane season has been felt in many  parts of our country, it is imperative that we make sure our Virgin  Islands continue to be remembered and supported as we begin the long  and arduous process of our recovery. We are hopeful. Virgin Islands'  motto is ``United in Pride and Hope.'' That is who we are.   I want to thank the Virgin Islanders who are living in the mainland  because they, through their efforts, have bridged the gap. Our office  gets calls continually from Virgin Islands associations in places like  Houston, Atlanta, New York, Tampa, Orlando, Miami, good Virgin  Islanders like Tim Duncan, who, through his own efforts, brought  planeloads of support to the people of the Virgin Islands because we  want to take care ourselves. We don't want to ask for your support. But  it is your responsibility, Mr. Speaker, it is the responsibility of  this Congress to ensure that that is done.   I think back on, as a child, hearing stories about Casper Holstein.  Many of you may not know the name, but many of you may know him from  gangster movies, discussions about New York at the turn of the 20th  century. He was a Virgin Islander who created something that everybody  calls the numbers system in New York.   After a hurricane and a tsunami in the Virgin Islands, he, of his own  pocket, reached in, commissioned a ship, and sent that ship filled with  goods for his fellow Virgin Islanders back home.   That is what is happening now because we can't always count on the  Federal Government to do what is right by us. We have to count on  ourselves. But I am going to make sure, and I will fight continually  with those colleagues on either side of the aisle, whomever is willing  to, to support the people of the Virgin Islands, to ensure that their  efforts are not in vain.   Let me give you a statistic when I talk about veterans and us willing  to fight. In the last five conflicts, Virgin Islanders have paid the  ultimate price, have greater casualties, three times the national  average per capita. We send our sons and daughters on the regular to  fight our wars. That is not a duty that we shirk from.   Are you shirking from your duty to us, of your responsibility to us?   I understand, as I have said, FEMA is on the ground, but there are  children who are not getting water. There are old people who are eating  MREs that others have brought back to them. Is that what should be  happening?   Not everybody can get to a distribution center. Not everybody can  carry packs of water on their shoulders, on their heads, on their back  a mile, whatever it is, to get back to their home because, as crazy as  it sounds in this day and age, not everybody owns a car, not everybody  can do that. So this Congress has got to figure out a way.   I know that Ranking Member Cummings and I issued a request on  September 29 for my good friend--and he is my friend, Trey Gowdy,  chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee--to express  our extremely grave concerns about the dire status of recovery efforts  in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, requesting that the  committee hold an emergency hearing this week with officials from the  Department of Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, as  well as from the White House.   The committee this week, I know, has no hearings, no business  meeting, no activity scheduled for the entire week, and this issue is  in desperate need of rapid and robust oversight. Millions of American  citizens residing in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are facing  massive calamities, widespread disease and death, and we need to help  them now.   Lieutenant General Russel Honore, who commanded Joint Task Force  [[Page H7664]]  Katrina, recently warned the administration's response to this  humanitarian crisis is replaying a scene from Katrina. Admiral Paul  Zukunft, the Coast Guard Commandant, warned this week that the victims  feel betrayed, they feel isolated, and they are probably getting a  sense of betrayal of ``where is the cavalry?'' Everybody else is seeing  what other individuals in Puerto Rico have said and their concern for  what is happening.   Now, I want my colleagues to know, I am not necessarily saying that  it is the Federal Government's fault. If it is the fault of local  government, then shame on them and let's expose that for what it is,  because all I am concerned about is the welfare of the people of the  Virgin Islands, not protecting local government, not protecting  bureaucracy, whether it be at the Federal level or at the local level.   Let's have this hearing. Let's get that information out.   The fact that there is no functioning hospital in the Virgin Islands  should scare the heck out of us. I was in the hospital at Juan Luis on  Wednesday and watched doctors and others creating lists of people, how  to get them off the island, how to get our disproportionate amount of  dialysis patients off the island, how they were going to deal with  those who have shunts, heart disease patients in the coming weeks with  one makeshift operating room that they were working out of.   How were they going to do that? How were they going to operate out of  a tent that the Army was setting up when we still have a month and a  half of hurricane season in the Virgin Islands, in the Caribbean? We  are not going to be able to continually ship people off the island, fix  them up, triage them, and get them off.   Our labor and delivery: What if there is a child with special needs  when they are born? What about neonatal services, if that is needed,  for a child that is born during this time? God help us. And if you  don't act, God help you in this time of need of your fellow Americans.   I want to thank those Members who have reached out to me and who have  expressed their desire to support and help us. Thank you. I am calling  on you now for that help to make sure that the people of the Virgin  Islands do not continually feel forgotten.   I want to thank House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who recently  issued a statement calling for the swift and immediate financial  commitment to help rebuild the Virgin Islands.    I want to thank my Republican colleague, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon of  Puerto Rico. She and I have been continually texting. I remember  texting with her through Maria as she and her brother were holding the  door of their home in Puerto Rico, trying to ensure that Maria did not  get in that house. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your  sisterhood as we both go through this, and how ever you need me, I am  there for you.   Republicans must join Democrats; Democrats must join Republicans in  Congress to address the needs of the communities in crisis by swiftly  passing a robust relief package that provides assistance not only  today, but throughout the long road to recovery. This is our chance in  the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico to show American might, to show  American technology, to show American strength.   President Trump, you have complained about the other islands not  wanting to support us when we go to the United Nations or the  Organization of American States against places like Venezuela or Cuba  or China. Show that they can vote with us because Americans do what  they are supposed to do for the islands that they have responsibility  over.   How are they going to trust us if we can't even take care of what  belongs to us?   Our fellow Americans in the Virgin Islands deserve to know that their  government will be there for them without question or hesitation.   I want to thank the country of Denmark, our previous owner. Many of  you know that the Virgin Islands have had seven flags that have been  flown over those islands. We are a very valuable place. We are  geographically situated in the mouth of the Caribbean Basin to support  the United States. That was why we were purchased in 1970.   But we have maintained close ties with Denmark, and I want to thank  the Ambassador and the Prime Minister, who reached out and said that  they wanted to support the territory and submitted the request of the  Danish Government to our own U.S. Government to bring their own  additional emergency management agency to the Virgin Islands in support  of ongoing efforts in areas such as healthcare, water purification  systems, and experts, command control support, logistics for clearing,  and security support. Thank you for your continued commitment to us.   Let that not be the only commitment that we have. I know that the  Federal Government, the executive branch, is doing its part. Let this  Congress do its part. Let this Congress show, in this time of crisis,  that it can rise above partisanship and support the islands of Puerto  Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   Let those 3.6 million Americans living in those territories--more  than many States in this country--know that they have the full support  of this Congress, of the American people, that they are not just a  sound bite, that they are not just a rum and Coke and a pina colada  when you decide that you want to get away from where you live, that we  mean more than that to you, that we are, indeed, full citizens in this  American experience, in this democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
