 Mr. President, I came to the floor to join my colleague  and friend Senator Murray to say that I, too, am ready for this fight  to oppose S.J. Res. 13, which would allow the discrimination against  Title X family planning providers. This is a misguided measure that  would leave millions of women and families with fewer healthcare  options. It would drastically decrease women's access to basic primary  and preventative health services, including lifesaving cancer  screenings and HIV testing.   Make no mistake, as Senator Murray said, the primary target of this  legislation is Planned Parenthood. For years now, Republican leaders in  Congress have tried to keep women from choosing Planned Parenthood as  their healthcare provider--this at a time when Planned Parenthood  serves millions of women nationwide, including nearly 12,000 women in  New Hampshire, my home State. Most of the women in New Hampshire have  incomes below or near the poverty line. Many of those women live in  rural areas where they don't have other options for healthcare  coverage.   The sad irony of this attack on Planned Parenthood is that study  after study has shown that cutting back access to birth control and to  other family planning methods actually increases the number of  abortions. So I understand that opponents are interested in supporting  this legislation because they think Planned Parenthood provides  abortions, but the coverage Planned Parenthood is providing to women in  New Hampshire and across this country with Federal dollars does not  allow for abortions. So what we are doing is taking away women's access  to contraception and to other family planning services and saying: You  have no choice now.   More than ever right now, facts matter. Research matters. Talking  away women's access to birth control and family planning will lead to  more abortions, not fewer abortions. Yet this legislation is part and  parcel of a broader national campaign against Planned Parenthood, whose  clinics have been the target of vilification, of threats, and of  violence. In October of last year, the Planned Parenthood clinic in  Claremont, NH, was vandalized not once but twice. The second attack, a  breaking-and-entering incident, caused extensive damage. It forced the  clinic to close for 5 weeks.   I have great admiration for the courage of doctors and other  healthcare providers at the Claremont clinic. Despite threats and  attacks, they are determined to continue serving women across the  Connecticut River Valley, many of whom have no alternative to the  Claremont clinic. They are typical of the dedicated healthcare  professionals at Planned Parenthood clinics all across our country.   The good news is that, according to poll after poll, the American  people across the political spectrum--from Independents, to  Libertarians, to Democrats, to Republicans--strongly support Planned  Parenthood and oppose efforts to take away women's ability to choose  Planned Parenthood as their healthcare provider.   At last night's Presidential address to Congress, I was honored to  have as my guest Jennifer Frizzell of Planned Parenthood of Northern  New England. Jen knows exactly what is at stake for women if President  Trump and Republican leaders succeed in closing hundreds of Planned  Parenthood clinics across the United States.   So let's be clear again: Supporting family planning clinics is not  about abortion, which by law is never funded by taxpayer dollars-- something that I think is often misrepresented by some of our  colleagues here in Congress. What this is about is ensuring that  American women have access to the basic healthcare they need. For 40  percent of women, their visits to a family planning center is the only  care they receive annually. In 2015 alone, Title X provided basic  primary and preventive healthcare services, such as Pap tests, breast  exams, birth control, and HIV testing, to more than 4 million women and  men at nearly 4,000 health centers.   I am sure that every one of our colleagues is receiving letters and  emails and phone calls from constituents on this issue. They are  pleading with us not to take away their access to Planned Parenthood  and the healthcare they trust and depend on.   I received this message from Caitlin Parnell of Hampstead, NH. She  said:         As a young mother of a 2-year-old, my husband and I knew we       wanted to wait to have more children. We were both working       full time but barely making ends meet. The companies we       worked for offered health insurance, but they were small       companies, and the monthly cost was well more than we could       afford. So we went without. With no insurance, I turned to       Planned Parenthood for birth control. With the sliding pay       scale, I was able to get exams and birth control within my       budget. We were able to decide the best time to have more       children, which also allowed us to responsibly manage our       finances as well. An unplanned pregnancy at that point would       have destroyed the little financial stability we had. I don't       know where our family would be without Planned Parenthood.    Karla Canderhoof is a stay-at-home mother in Newfields, NH. She wrote  this:         After being diagnosed with ovarian cyst issues that caused       debilitating pain, I turned to Planned Parenthood for       treatment. In my case, the treatment for ovarian cysts was       birth control. At the time (during my college years) I could       not afford the cost of birth control due to my lack of       insurance. But Planned Parenthood gave me birth control free       of charge.    Amanda Arel of Rochester, NH, sent this message:         During the ages of 22 to 25, I utilized Planned Parenthood       for my annual exams and birth control. As I did not have       insurance and was in college, I was not able to afford most       medical care. Planned Parenthood not only provided me with       essential care, they made it very comfortable for me and were       very knowledgeable and answered any questions I had. They       provided birth control for me that, if it wasn't for them,       I would not have been able to get, at a cost I could       afford.    I still support Planned Parenthood because they provide safe,  affordable healthcare for all, and that is so important.   We need to listen to our constituents, those who are speaking out in  passionate support of Planned Parenthood and other family planning  clinics.   As Senator Murray said so eloquently, this is about respecting  women's access to healthcare services, including those millions of  vulnerable women who have nowhere else to turn for essential care. This  is also about respecting women's constitutionally protected right to  make our own reproductive choices. We must not allow Congress to strip  away Federal investments in family planning clinics by allowing States  to discriminate against providers like Planned Parenthood.   I urge our Republican colleagues, don't bring S.J. Res. 13 to the  floor. If it does come to the floor, I certainly intend to join in the  fight with my colleagues--Senator Murray, Senator Blumenthal, and so  many other Democrats and, I believe, Republicans--to defeat this  legislation.   I yield the floor.
