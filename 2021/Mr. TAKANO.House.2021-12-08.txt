The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 5545, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5545, as amended, the  Responsible Education Mitigating Options and Technical Extensions Act,  or the REMOTE Act. This bill is an urgent extension of flexibilities  for student veterans using their educational assistance benefits as the  COVID-19 pandemic wears on.   H.R. 5545, as amended, extends the Student Veteran Coronavirus  Response Act of 2020 through the spring 2022 term.   When my Student Veteran Coronavirus Response Act was signed into law  in April 2020, I am not sure many of us would have foreseen that 19  months later the COVID-19 pandemic would still affect everyday life for  veterans and their families across the country.   And since then, we have extended these flexibilities for student  veterans three times as the pandemic remains a public health emergency  throughout the country and the world. Still, many college students  remain unable to return to campus.   H.R. 5545, as amended, would extend remote learning waivers for  student veterans through the spring 2022 term and ensure they will  continue receiving full housing benefits despite not taking on-campus  courses.   We have been negotiating this bill with the minority for months and,  while this bill is not the exact version that I would prefer, student  veterans are simply too important to let these benefits lapse.   A majority of students have already enrolled in their spring classes,  having signed up as early as this past October or November. They  selected their classes with the hope that we, in Congress, would act to  extend these flexibilities through the spring term. We cannot wait any  longer to pass this critical piece of legislation for our student  veterans.   New cases of the virus are up. There is a new variant, leading some  States to declare a new state of emergency, and it is clear, COVID-19  is not behind us. The emergency persists, and we cannot walk away from  our duty to assist student veterans now.   Without this legislation, student veterans who planned and started  out the school year remotely--reasonably thinking they would be able to  stay in status for the entire school year--will have to figure out a  plan to get back to taking on-campus classes in order to receive their  monthly allowance for housing.   This legislation is to address this specific emergency now. This is  not setting precedent for any future emergencies, nor is it setting a  standard for treating future education terms impacted by COVID-19.   Should we have to extend these provisions again next year, we should  use the same emergency designations we have used three times in the  past. We know these provisions are not for new benefits. They are to  maintain existing benefits and existing spending.   Additionally, this bill ensures student bodies at U.S. universities  remain diverse and allows for the continued recruitment of foreign  students. It also simplifies the verification process for tuition  reimbursement for certain educational institutions to minimize unneeded  paperwork for student veterans.   Student veterans should be able to focus on their studies, not on  whether they are going to receive their earned VA benefits. And that is  why I introduced this bill, with my House Veterans' Affairs Committee  colleagues, Representative Trone and Representative   Mike Levin, to  ease the burden on student veterans during these persistently uncertain  times.   Now, this legislation is endorsed by numerous VSOs, such as the  Student Veterans of America, the American Legion, the VFW, American  Council on Education, Tragedy Assistance for Survivors, Association of  Public and Land-grant Universities, and the National Association of  Veterans' Program Administrators, and countless others.   Finally, the legislation includes an additional provision from  Representatives Lamb and Mann. The text of this section of the bill  would help the Department address diversity and equity within the  workforce. It removes a 1997 law that limits the number of VA  counselors who can advise employees on equal employment opportunity  issues.   VA has roughly doubled in size since 1997, and VA requested for this  limit to be removed to allow the Department to hire additional  counselors to support the needs of a growing workforce and help ensure  that VA is a welcoming place for all employees.   I wish to thank Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer for bringing  this legislation to the floor; and I urge the rest of my colleagues to  support this legislation to ensure student veterans are able to access  the benefits they have earned and continue their studies during the  spring semester.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Trone), my good friend and the author of H.R. 5545, as  amended. He is a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and an  active member on the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity and the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work and cooperation of the ranking  member, and I appreciate that he stands squarely behind this  legislation.   What is at stake at the very end of this year is the housing of our  Nation's student veterans, numbering in the tens of thousands. We need  swift passage of this bill and the companion bill in the Senate.   I urge all Members of the House to support this bill, and I urge our  Senate colleagues to act on this expeditiously.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R.  5545, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.
