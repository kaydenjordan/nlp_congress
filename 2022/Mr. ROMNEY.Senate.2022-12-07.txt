 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Jewish Family  Service on their remarkable sesquicentennial celebration, an  organization whose spirited generosity and longstanding charity  continues to benefit the health and well-being of our Utah communities.   Over two decades before Utah statehood, a group of Jewish women  founded the Hebrew Women's Benevolent Society in 1872. During this  time, many families journeyed West to escape persecution and build new  lives, often with little to no resources. With open arms, the Hebrew  Women's Benevolent Society welcomed new arrivals at their most  vulnerable and ensured that their critical needs were met.   The organization abides by the same selfless mission today as Jewish  Family Service, still grounded in the traditional values of tikkun  olam, kavod, and tzedek--repair the world, honor, and justice. These  values translate into action while the group runs food pantries,  provides senior care, and offers mental health counseling to anyone in  need, regardless of religious affiliation or financial means.   Today, we recognize and thank Jewish Family Service for their  outstanding and indelible impact on Utahns as they continue to inspire  us to turn outward and serve our brothers and sisters.                            ____________________
