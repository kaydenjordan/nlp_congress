 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, after 2 years of the Trump administration trying and  failing in Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they have gone  to plan B. Plan B is to use the administrative agencies, the Department  of Health and Human Services, and the court system as a way of trying  to accomplish what they could not accomplish through the House and the  Senate in the 115th Congress.   Today, we are dealing with one of those efforts, which was an order  that was issued in October of last year, issuing new guidelines for  State waivers from the Affordable Care Act, repealing the ObamaCare  guardrails that  [[Page H3527]]  made sure that patient protections would not be affected by such  waivers--for example, protecting people with preexisting conditions;  the elimination of lifetime caps on health insurance; and the  protections that were built in for essential health benefits that  defined real healthcare, not the cheap healthcare that was being sold  before the ACA was enacted.   An intervening event occurred since last October. We had an election.  It was the largest midterm turnout since 1914. We had a new majority  that was elected with a plurality of 10 million votes, larger than any  flip election in the past, any wave election in the past. The number  one issue from the voters was healthcare and protecting their patient  rights to affordable and comprehensive benefits.   Mr. Chair, we are here today debating an issue that the patient  groups that represent people with chronic illnesses, with expensive  illnesses like cancer, have stepped up across the board, saying vote  for this legislation to overturn the Trump order that they are trying  to get through but that they cannot get through the U.S. Congress. Vote  for this bill.
