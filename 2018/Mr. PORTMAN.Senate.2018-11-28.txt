 Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to  legislative session, and Senator Sanders, or his designee, be  recognized to make a motion to discharge S.J. Res. 54; further, that  there be time for debate of the motion until 4 p.m. and of that time,  10 minutes be under control of the chairman and 10 minutes for the  ranking member, and the remaining time be equally divided between the  two leaders or their designees; that at 4 p.m., the Senate vote in  relation to the motion to discharge; that following disposition of the  motion, the Senate resume executive session and the time spent in  legislative session count postcloture on the Farr nomination.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I wish to speak tonight about the opioid  crisis that has gripped my State of Ohio and our country and talk about  some lessons learned.   There was an article in the New York Times that some might have seen  on Sunday about a town in Ohio--Dayton, OH--and the progress they have  made in combating this opioid crisis, including a reduction in overdose  deaths, which is really significant. Dayton is a city that has had some  of the highest overdose death rates in our entire State of Ohio, and  Ohio is No. 3 or No. 4 in the country in terms of overdose deaths. They  have seen in Dayton, OH, over the last year, about a 50-percent  decrease in overdose deaths. It is still totally unacceptable.  Unfortunately, there are still hundreds of people who are dying every  year. But from this high-water mark, progress has been made. Why is  that happening?   Well, I am going to talk a little bit about that tonight and talk  about some of the things that are actually working back in our  communities and perhaps give us a little sense of optimism about what  might be able to happen over the next couple of years as we try to turn  the tide on this epidemic.   For a little context, last year we had the highest rate of overdose  deaths in the history of our country. Some 72,000 Americans--72,000-- lost their lives to overdoses from drugs. In my State of Ohio, that  number is particularly high, to the point that it is the No. 1 cause of  death now in our State.   I met with the director of the CDC, or the Centers for Disease  Control, today and talked about the opioid epidemic and talked about  the tragedy he is seeing in places like southwest Ohio, Dayton, and  Cincinnati, my hometown, where we see incidences of hepatitis C  increasing and even hepatitis A. These are diseases that are primarily  increasing because of the sharing of needles and the opioid epidemic.   So we have our work cut out for us, don't we?   In Dayton, OH, by the way, over the last few years, the death rate  had gotten so high that the coroner's office was literally running out  of space. There wasn't enough room to put all the bodies.   I have held roundtable discussions in Dayton and Montgomery County,  which is the county around Dayton, over the past several years and  heard the bad news. I have often been with Montgomery County then- Sheriff Phil Plummer, who has been tireless in trying to focus law  enforcement, the social workers, the treatment community, the business  community, and other community leaders on how to respond to this  problem. Our first responders, of course, are as desperate as anybody  to address this.   It has been tough. Again, I have been in Dayton, OH, and had to talk  about the fact that we had the worst rates in the country of deaths  and, therefore, one of the worst in the entire country.   So what has happened? How has Dayton made this progress, this 50  percent reduction?   Well, the New York Times highlights a number of reasons for it. They  talk about greater community involvement, the ability for more Medicaid  recipients to get treatment, and more  [[Page S7176]]  Narcan being distributed throughout the community. Narcan, of course,  is this miracle drug that reverses the effects of an overdose.   They talked about helping to deal with the stigma. In other words, by  reducing the stigma that is associated with addiction, more people will  step forward to get treatment for it, and their families will be more  willing to push them forward. That helps to unite communities against  what is the biggest public health crisis we face in Ohio and around the  country.   I would like to highlight tonight some of the things we have done  here in this body just in the last couple of years that contribute to  some of the success that we are seeing.   Again, are we there yet? No, we are not. Last year was worse than the  year before, but I do believe that we are going to begin to make  progress, and, frankly, I think we would already have seen some of  these efforts at the Federal level, State level, and local level, which  are taking root, make a bigger difference but for one thing, and that  is this big influx of synthetic opioids--fentanyl. Fentanyl,  carfentanil, and other synthetics have taken over.   I remember being in Dayton, OH, the city we are talking about  tonight, about 4 years ago when, for the first time, I heard from a law  enforcement official that fentanyl was pushing out heroin. At that  time, the big issue was heroin. It wasn't fentanyl. In fact, very few  people knew about fentanyl. Fentanyl has hit my State and our country  so hard over the past several years--the last 3, 4, 5 years--that it  has sort of overwhelmed the system. So as we have begun to make  progress on better education, better treatment, better recovery  options, and more Narcan, we have also had this big influx of this  incredibly powerful drug that is 50 times more powerful than heroin on  average--an inexpensive drug.   We will talk in a minute about what we are doing about fentanyl, but,  again, I think if we had not seen that influx, we would already be  seeing more progress because of some of the things that we will talk  about that are happening in Dayton, OH.   Back in 2016, this body, after 4 years of work, passed legislation  called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. I was proud to  coauthor that with my colleague Sheldon Whitehouse. It was bipartisan.  It was nonpartisan. It was based on evidence. It was based on four  conferences we had here in DC. We brought in people from all over the  country to talk about this: What is the best treatment option? What is  the best way to ensure somebody gets through treatment successfully?  How can we do a better job with our veterans? How can we ensure that we  are bringing our first responders into this, working with them, and  helping them to be able to deal with this crisis? All of that led to  this Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act legislation.   The first thing the legislation did, actually, was it said: Let's  look at this like a disease. That may be--of all the things that are in  that legislation, including significant new funding for our  communities--maybe the most important thing, and it is beginning to  change the paradigm, so that we don't look at this as a moral failing  but rather look at it as something that is a disease. Something changes  in your brain when you become addicted.   I can't tell you the number of people I have met in my home State of  Ohio who because of an accident or an injury took an opioid, became  addicted--physically addicted--shifted to heroin or fentanyl because  the prescription drugs were hard to find or too expensive, and then  overdosed, and, in some cases, overdosed and died.   But having said that, this legislation--this Comprehensive Addiction  and Recovery Act legislation--focusing on prevention, focusing on  treatment, focusing on recovery, focusing on providing Narcan to our  communities, has made a difference. There will be $608 million spent  this year on these CARA programs. Our first year it was about $182  million. It has gone up every year since. Why? Because it is working.  It was based on good evidence, and it is helping to offer innovative  solutions to this stubborn addiction challenge we face in our country.   Dayton, OH, and Montgomery County have received $3.5 million in CARA  funding. So part of the reason they have had some success is that they  have taken this funding and used it in innovative ways. It includes $2  million for first responders and about $500,000 for the city of Dayton  to develop partnerships between first responders and treatment  providers responding to overdoses as a team.   Somebody overdoses, Narcan is applied, and their lives are saved.  Unfortunately, still in America in most cases, the person goes back to  the community, to the old team, the old gang, and often there is no  followup.    In Dayton, what they have said is this: Do you know what? If somebody  overdoses and Narcan is applied, we are going to follow up with them,  and the team will include law enforcement, but it also will include  treatment providers and maybe social workers. This funding has allowed  them to pursue that.   Also, there is $1 million from Montgomery County Public Health to  analyze substance abuse issues and identify potential solutions to come  up with more innovative and creative ways to deal with this.   Also, in 2016, this Congress passed another piece of legislation. The  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, remember, is funding that  goes straight to programs to help on prevention, education, and  innovative solutions. The second one was called the 21st Century Cures  Act, and this provides funding directly back to the States, and the  States then decide how it is spent. That funding is also making a big  difference.   In each of the last 2 years, Ohio has received $26 million in Cures  funding to affect the opioid crisis. All of your States have received  funding too. The funding is based on the degree to which you have a  problem. So the States like my State of Ohio, West Virginia, and  Kentucky have gotten significant amounts of money from this because we  need it.   Again, the Montgomery County Alcohol, Drug Addiction, and Mental  Health Services Board, or the ADAMHS Board, has received about $2  million in Cures funding over the last 2 years in Dayton, OH. I have  seen and heard about how that funding is being put to good use.   Just a couple months ago, I was in Dayton. I took part in a  roundtable discussion with the Montgomery County ADAMHS Board and  discussed how they are using their Cures money and their CARA money.  They are using their Cures money to fund a community-based treatment  team. They are partnering with Dayton and Montgomery County Public  Health Addiction Services to provide 24/7 ambulance withdrawal  support--a community treatment team to help people gripped by addiction  get treatment in their own homes and primary care for high-risk  addicts, including pregnant women and more.   They are finding that is working. It is working not just to have  people be saved from an overdose by Narcan but getting these people  directed into treatment to actually help them with their addiction  problem longer term.   They are implementing impressive programs to help with some of the  most vulnerable groups that are affected by this crisis, and that is  mothers who are addicted and their babies, who are too often being born  with what is called neonatal abstinence syndrome. Because the mom is  addicted, the baby is born with this syndrome which requires the baby-- tiny innocent babies--to go through withdrawal. It is a very sad  situation. It is happening in hospitals all over our country. Go to  your neonatal unit in your hospital, and you will find out that,  unfortunately, the numbers of these babies has increased dramatically.   We don't know the impact longer term on these babies who are born to  moms who are addicted, but there is a great risk there. What we do know  is that hospitals across the country are being filled up with these  innocent babies, and they need our help.   After these babies get out of the hospital, by the way, often they  can't go back to their moms or their dads because they are addicted,  nor should they.   The moms and dads sometimes are in treatment. They can't take their  babies with them. What happens to these kids? Well, there are some  groups that have started. Community volunteers have stepped up in  Dayton, OH, as an example, and started a group called Brigid's Path.  Brigid's Path is a shining example of an organization that is  [[Page S7177]]  dedicated to helping newborns who are dependent on drugs be able to  recover longer term. As these innocent babies are taken through the  withdrawal, they also need to be surrounded by love and support.   Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to visit Brigid's Path. It  provides short-term inpatient care in a home-like setting for these  newborns who are suffering from prenatal drug exposure.   A lot of volunteers are involved. Some of the volunteers do something  really important and really simple. You know what it is? They hold the  babies. Literally, it is the human contact. Based on all of the  psychological studies and looking at how you create a healthy, well- adjusted baby, you have got to have that human contact. For these  babies who can't be with their parents because their parents are  addicted or maybe the dad isn't around and the mom is addicted,  volunteers come in and literally hold the babies, love these babies,  and support these babies. We need to provide as much care and treatment  as possible to help these kids so that they can achieve their God-given  potential in life.   By the way, the opioid legislation that the President signed into law  just last month, which this Congress passed, provides for the first  time that organizations like Brigid's Path in Dayton, OH--entirely  funded up to this point with volunteers, with money from the community,  but, frankly, they don't have the resources they need to take care of  all the babies who need the help--for these babies whose families  qualify for Medicaid, will now be able to get Medicaid reimbursement  under what is called the CRIB Act, which the President just signed into  law.   It provides $60 million in funding for babies and recognizes  residential pediatric recovery facilities like Brigid's Path as  providers under Medicaid. This is a huge difference. It is going to  enable not just Brigid's Path but other organizations like this to pop  up around our State.   So that may not be affecting the overdose rate per se, but that is  affecting something really important, which is the ability for these  infants--these babies--to be able to have a normal life and to be able  to achieve whatever God has in mind for them in their life, which is  not to be growing up in a family with addiction but rather to be able  to escape the grips of addiction.   I believe, perhaps most importantly, that the legislation we just  passed in Congress recently--adding to Cures, CARA and the CRIB Act--is  dealing with fentanyl and will help in Dayton, OH, and around our  country.   I mentioned fentanyl earlier, a synthetic opioid 50 times more  powerful than heroin and inexpensive. Sadly, while, again, Dayton has  made progress, fentanyl remains the No. 1 killer in Dayton.   They told me when I was there a couple months ago that cocaine and  meth deaths--crystal meth--are rising in the Dayton area. That is  deaths from cocaine and crystal meth. Why is that?   Typically, you don't hear about people overdosing on cocaine, but you  certainly do when fentanyl is mixed in with cocaine, and that is what  law enforcement is telling me around Ohio is happening.   These drugs, often mixed with fentanyl, are now deadlier than ever.  Fentanyl was involved in more than 70 percent of Ohio's overdose deaths  last year. From January until April of this year, despite the overall  reduction in overdose deaths, about 77 percent of the overdose deaths  in Montgomery County, in Dayton, OH, involved fentanyl.   So, again, we are making progress, but not nearly as much as we all  want to make, and a major reason for this is this influx of this deadly  synthetic substance. Unbelievably, we know that fentanyl is mostly  manufactured in China, and mostly comes to our country through our own  United States mail system. Up to now, up until last month when the  President signed this legislation, we did not have a way to screen  these packages coming in from overseas, specifically from China, coming  in through the mail system into our communities, causing all of these  deaths and destruction. Now we have in place something that closes the  loophole in the international mail screening. It requires the post  office to do what the other carriers have had to do since 9/11, which  is to provide law enforcement with advanced electronic data to be able  to identify these suspect packages and get them offline. I think that  is going to make a huge difference, not just because it is going to  stop drugs from coming into our country but because, by reducing the  supply, you are going to see the costs go up on the street, which has  been one of our great challenges.    That is not the ultimate answer. The answer is prevention and  education, reducing the demand for these drugs, better treatment and  longer term recovery options--all of those things we talked about in  terms of taking care of those moms and babies. But we also have to do  everything we can to reduce the supply of these drugs, and that  legislation that the President just signed is going to help.   We are also going to be helped by a new law that the President just  signed last month which says that with regard to residential treatment  programs, they are no longer going to be capped by an arbitrary limit  of 16 beds. This is a vestige of the 1960s and 1970s, when we wanted to  deinstitutionalize these people, and we said: You can't get  reimbursement from Medicaid unless you have less than 16 beds for  mental health and substance abuse treatment.   Then the opioid crisis hits us, and suddenly we find ourselves with  no room at the inn. Literally, people are being turned away at  treatment centers and, in the period they are waiting to get in,  overdosing and dying. I have heard these stories. I have heard the moms  and dads talk about the pain of a child who finally says: I am ready.   In one case, a dad takes his daughter to a treatment center. This was  in a tele-townhall meeting I had. We have them every month, and I hear  these stories. These are people who aren't calling to tell these  stories, but they end up telling it because we are talking about this  issue. In this case, the dad's heart was heavy. He said: We took her.  She was ready. There was no room. They couldn't accept her in the  treatment center. So we took her back home.   In the 4 weeks that she was waiting to get a slot in the treatment  center, what happened? She succumbed, once again, to shooting up--in  her case, heroin--and an overdose in her own bedroom.   So this arbitrary limit doesn't make any sense. If the treatment  center is doing a good job, don't limit it to 16 beds. If it is not  doing a good job, by the way, it shouldn't be getting any  reimbursement. But if it is doing a good job and successfully helping  people to get beyond their addiction and into recovery, we shouldn't be  limiting it. This legislation does that. It actually takes off the cap.  It has a 5-year life because it has a cost to it, and I am convinced it  is going to work well. Five years from now, we will extend that even  further, but this is something some of us have been working on for many  years, and it is now done. So, again, progress is being made  incrementally. Some of this legislation we talked about tonight is  contributing to that.   We need to ensure that if we implement this, we cannot at this point  take our eye off the ball. I think when we look back at this year,  2018--and we are coming to the end of the calendar year now--we will  see for the first time in the last dozen years a reduction in overdose  deaths. I predict that is going to happen. I say that in part because I  spoke to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention.   I also say that because back in Ohio I am seeing these programs work.  I am seeing us finally beginning to turn the tide, despite the influx  of fentanyl. But I would just state tonight, if that is true, and if we  begin to see some progress--and I see it on the ground and see it in  reports from coroners and medical directors around Ohio--if that  happens, let's not take our eye off the ball. We succeeded. Let's move  on.   We did that back in the 1990s with regard to cocaine; we had solved  the problem. We never solved the problem. It is like the tide. It keeps  coming in. We have to be vigilant. We have to maintain the support we  have provided here in the U.S. Congress to push back against this  terrible addiction, this disease, and we have to ensure that we are not  just pushing down on one drug and having another drug pop up.   As we make progress on fentanyl or make progress on heroin, let's  also be  [[Page S7178]]  mindful of the disastrous impact of cocaine, crystal meth, and drugs we  haven't even heard of yet--the new synthetic drugs that are coming our  way.   I believe that Federal programs like CARA and Cures are making a  difference. We are working with our States that are passing their own  legislation and helping in many ways. Our local communities are jumping  in and figuring out innovative and creative ways of taking that Federal  dollar and leveraging it with private sector money and with State and  local money.   I believe we are going to make progress with the STOP Act in reducing  the supply and therefore raising the cost of the drug on the streets. I  think what you have seen in Dayton, OH, which was reported in the New  York Times, can continue--and not just in Dayton, but in Toledo,  Columbus, Akron, Cincinnati, and St. Clairsville--all over our State  and all over our country.   We have a role to play here, and that is to continue to be better  partners, as we have been over the last 2\1/2\ years here in Congress-- better partners with our States and with our local communities and with  our families because, ultimately, this is an issue of the heart, isn't  it? This is about the future.   We have some pages with us tonight. They are young people who are 16,  17 years old who come to this town because they are selected as bright,  young people. They are listening--at least they are acting as though  they are listening tonight; thank you. It is about you. It is about  what kind of future you are going to have and what kind of future we  are going to have, having safe and healthy communities.   Thank you.   I yield back my time.
