 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st  Century Act.   I urge all Members to vote for this bipartisan bill that allows our  educational institutions the ability to better adapt their programs to  the specific needs of their students. This bill will give States and  localities more flexibility in how to use Federal money for career and  technical education programs, which will ultimately help Americans find  the jobs they need.
