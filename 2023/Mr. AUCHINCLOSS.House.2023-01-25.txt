 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today because I am  planning to reintroduce the United States-Israel Artificial  Intelligence Center Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that will  cement a mutually beneficial partnership between the United States and  Israel on artificial intelligence research.   This is a critical step forward in an era where AI and its  implications are taking center stage in public discourse. We must  collaborate with international partners like the Israeli Government to  ensure that the United States maintains a leadership role in AI  research and development and responsibly explores the many  possibilities evolving technologies provide.   The United States-Israel Artificial Intelligence Center Act will  allow us to tap into the expertise of both countries and draw upon each  other's resources to explore and develop cutting-edge AI advancements.                            ____________________
