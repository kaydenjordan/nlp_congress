 Madam Speaker, just over a year ago, I stood right there  where you are standing today as we took the solemn step of impeaching  the President of the United States for pressuring a foreign leader to  take unlawful actions to help him in his reelection.   Just 1 week ago, almost to the hour, I laid right there on the floor  of the gallery above us. I heard gunshots in the Speaker's lobby. I  heard the mob pounding on the door. They were an angry mob, incited by  the President, trying to stop certification of a legitimate election.   It is clear the President learned nothing in the last year.  Yesterday, the President said again he did nothing wrong.   This man is dangerous. He has defied the Constitution. He has incited  sedition. And he must be removed.   We all took a pledge on January 3 to uphold the Constitution. We must  honor that oath. We must vote ``yes'' on this Article of Impeachment.
