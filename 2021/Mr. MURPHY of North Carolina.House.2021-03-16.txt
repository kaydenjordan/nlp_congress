 Madam Speaker, as we speak, at  President Biden's behest, thousands of migrants are crossing our border  illegally and being detained in facilities that are well over capacity.   Besides the many adults, the real victims are the thousands of  unaccompanied migrant children, many being  [[Page H1370]]  sent by drug cartels to this country. These children are often used by  cartels to smuggle drugs or money, and many are being sold into  essential slavery with the promise of easy and safe passage to the U.S.   Does the President not care about the problem of juvenile human  trafficking occurring at the border?   For years, Democrats and media types slammed the Trump administration  for keeping kids in cages. Their righteous indignation is conspicuously  absent from today's discourse, as they are now referring  euphemistically in the press to the ``migrant detention centers.''  Amazingly, you have to have a negative COVID test to fly into the  country, but you can be COVID-positive and enter illegally.   Madam Speaker, the basic reality is this: We need to know who is in  our country. We are a country of laws. ``Catch and release'' has now  become a national security threat. Even CNN is calling this a crisis.   I urge the Biden administration to admit this is a crisis and fix the  problem it has caused.                            ____________________
