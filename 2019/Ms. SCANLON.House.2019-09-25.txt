[[Page H7914]]      Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                time  1215                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 577, providing for consideration of  H.R. 2203, the Homeland Security Improvement Act; H.R. 3525, the U.S.  Border Patrol Medical Screening Standards Act; and H. Res. 576,  expressing the sense of the House of Representatives with respect to  the whistleblower complaint of August 12, 2019, made to the Inspector  General of the Intelligence Community, under closed rules.   For H.R. 2203 and H.R. 3525, the rule provides 1 hour of general  debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on Homeland Security for each bill. The rule  provides H. Res. 576 1 hour of general debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence.   The rule also provides blanket suspension authority for the  legislative day of Thursday, September 26, 2019, and standard recess  instructions for the district work period from September 30 to October  14.   At the end of this debate, I will be offering an amendment to the  rule to replace the text of H. Res. 576 with the text of S. Res. 325, a  bipartisan resolution that passed the Senate unanimously yesterday.  Both of these resolutions urge that the complaint be transmitted  immediately to the Intelligence Committees, as required by law.   In our Rules Committee meeting last night, several of my Republican  colleagues suggested that they would prefer that we take up the Senate- passed language. To ensure that this Congress speaks with one voice  clearly and unequivocally on this urgent matter, we will be amending  the rule to do just that.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to debate the rule for three important  pieces of legislative business, which I will address serially: H. Res.  576, with the text of S. Res. 325; H.R. 3525; and H.R. 2203.   By now, every Member of this body is well aware of the whistleblower  complaint that was filed to the intelligence community inspector  general following a call President Trump had with the President of  Ukraine. These types of complaints are far from unheard of, and the law  states that the complaint must be turned over to the House and Senate  Intelligence Committees. However, the inspector general has testified  that the Acting Director of National Intelligence blocked the  complaint, after consulting with the Department of Justice, from being  turned over to Congress, despite the complaint fitting the requirements  for being turned over under the law.   The way this complaint was handled by the Trump administration was a  stark violation of that whistleblower law, which states that the  Director of National Intelligence shall provide Congress with the full  whistleblower complaint. In addition to breaking the law, this  corruption sends a strong and chilling message to would-be  whistleblowers that their courage and sacrifice in speaking out against  impropriety and corruption will not be valued if it is not politically  expedient.   Yesterday, the Senate voted by unanimous consent to pass a nonbinding  resolution directing the Trump administration to hand over the  whistleblower report filed against President Trump, reportedly, to  House and Senate Intelligence Committees. The fact that Senator  McConnell allowed this resolution to go to the floor should show House  Republicans that there is a point where you must stop turning a blind  eye to this administration's betrayal of our Constitution, our country,  and our national security.   It is a sad day when Congress needs to pass a resolution to obtain  documents that we have an absolute right to see, but this type of  conduct is part of a pattern of obstruction by this administration that  we have seen time and time again.   Allowing the Intelligence Committees to see the complaints and  interview the whistleblower is essential to our national security.  Furthermore, this resolution serves as a show of support and solidarity  with whistleblowers. If we allow partisanship to deter whistleblowers  from acting, we risk undermining a necessary check on an unrestrained  administration. It is imperative that these brave Americans are  protected and that their concerns are heard.   It is also worth noting that these whistleblower protections were  negotiated and implemented with bipartisan support over multiple  administrations.   Protecting the integrity of our national security is vitally  important. I urge my Republican colleagues to follow the lead of their  Senate counterparts and join us in passing this resolution so that  Congress can properly meet its constitutional oversight duties.   Also subject to this rule are two homeland security measures.   First, H.R. 2203, the Homeland Security Improvement Act, is a timely  and necessary bill to address our Nation's immigration and security  challenges at the southern border in a responsible and humane way. This  legislation will ensure accountability, transparency, and oversight in  the agency responsible for monitoring and securing our Nation's  borders.   Further, the bill establishes an ombudsman for border- and  immigration-related concerns within the Department of Homeland  Security. This additional oversight in the Department of Homeland  Security will bring a much-needed level of independent accountability  to DHS and ensure that the agents and employees working at our border  are performing their duties to the highest possible standard.    There is no doubt that these border security jobs are demanding and  intense, and the creation of an independent, neutral, and confidential  process to address complaints will help both the agents and employees  working at the border, as well as the individuals they process.   This bill also creates a border communities liaison, appointed by the  ombudsman in conjunction with the Office for Civil Rights and Civil  Liberties at DHS, to operate in each Border Patrol sector along the  northern and southern borders. The liaison will be charged with  fostering cooperation between ICE, CBP, and surrounding border  communities, relationships that have become increasingly strained and  distrustful in recent months.   In addition, the ombudsman will be required to conduct annual  evaluations of all training given to ICE and CBP agents and officers.   One of the many concerns that I heard from ICE and CBP agents during  my trips to the border is that they are not given adequate training and  resources to properly do their jobs under current conditions. It is  clear that this administration is creating chaos at the southern border  by instituting policies that prioritize political fearmongering over  addressing the humanitarian crisis in Central America. This is  unacceptable given the complex challenges border agents face every day,  and an annual assessment of their training will serve to better equip  these men and women for their very difficult jobs.   Another area where DHS is lacking is utilizing advancements in  technology that could improve outcomes for both border agents and  migrants. This bill mandates that the ombudsman, in coordination with  the CBP Commissioner, ICE Director, and ORR, develop recommendations  for an electronic tracking number system to keep track of children in  U.S. custody. The wholly inhumane practice of separating children from  their parents is preventable, and tracking the location of a child who  has been separated from his or her parents or guardians will help  ensure that no child is ever again in custody alone and unaccounted for  at our southern border.  [[Page H7915]]    Finally, this bill requires the ombudsman to submit to Congress a  plan for requiring the use of body-worn cameras by U.S. Border Patrol  agents and ICE officers when they are engaged in border security and  immigration enforcement activities. This is a long-overdue step. Body  cameras are already used by State and local police departments around  the country and have served to improve justice outcomes for the  individuals who come into contact with the police and provide a level  of oversight that is greatly needed at the border.   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats are committed to passing legislation  that will improve conditions at the border and better ensure the safety  of agents and employees who work there, as well as the safety of  migrants they come into contact with. Increased accountability is  necessary to improving the situation at the border, a situation, I  might add, that my Republican counterparts continuously say needs  addressing. This bill is the chance for that added accountability.   I commend my colleague Representative Escobar from El Paso for her  hard work and dedication on this issue and Chairman Thompson and the  Homeland Security Committee for their thoughtful consideration of H.R.  2203.   The second Homeland Security bill in today's rule is H.R. 3525, the  U.S. Border Patrol Medical Screening Standards Act.   In December 2018, Jakelin, aged 7, and Felipe, aged 8, both passed  away in the custody of the U.S. Border Patrol. Following their deaths,  CBP announced new medical screening procedures for children. Despite  this, four more children have since passed away in Federal custody.   Let us be clear that we are addressing an issue that has emerged with  the implementation of the Trump administration's inhumane border  policies. No child died in CBP custody for the entire decade preceding  2018, but we have seen six in the last 10 months.   CBP facilities must be better equipped to provide medical attention  for individuals in U.S. custody, particularly children.   One critical component of addressing the new reality is an initial  health screening to identify acute or pressing medical issues that need  immediate or follow-up attention. H.R. 3525 builds upon legislation  passed by the House in July of this year by directing DHS to research  innovative approaches to address capability gaps for providing medical  screening at the border and mandates the implementation of an  electronic health record system.   DHS medical professionals and other medical caregivers at the border  have spoken of how much they need an electronic health system for CBP.  In fact, this was the genesis of the bill following Representative  Underwood's visits to the border.   This bill requires DHS to make concerted process improvements,  including research done in consultation with national medical  professional associations that have expertise in emergency medicine,  nursing, pediatric care, and other relevant medical skills.   Upon completion of this research, DHS must submit a report to  Congress on its recommendations for improving medical screening, access  to emergency care, and steps the Department plans to take in response.   Within 90 days of this enactment, DHS must establish an electronic  health record system that can be accessed by all DHS components  operating on our borders. ICE already has its own electronic health  record system in place, and it is time CBP upgraded its capabilities,  as well.   The deaths that have occurred on our borders are a stain on our  Nation, and current medical screening processes are clearly not enough.   An inspector general report, released a few weeks ago, highlighted  the challenges that ORR is having in addressing the mental health needs  of those children released by CBP to ORR. Though this bill deals with  CBP, many of the issues transfer from agency to agency with the  children. The trauma for these children begins when they are forced to  flee their birth countries and is exacerbated by the journey to the  U.S., which, for many, is marked by violence, sexual abuse, hunger, and  sleep deprivation.    Once they finally arrive in the U.S., they then may be separated from  their parents, if that didn't happen along the original journey,  causing further trauma. Medical professionals are clear that these  children are going to have lifelong trauma. They need a detailed  medical record of the care they receive or do not receive while in U.S.  custody so that they can receive adequate follow-up care.   The IG report noted, as well, that the facilities where we house  these children have not employed sufficient numbers of essential mental  health clinicians. This results in higher caseloads for staff and worse  outcomes for these afflicted children.   The electronic health record system required by this bill will ensure  that medical information does not get lost, help track when follow-up  appointments are necessary, and prevent duplication of medical services  due to lost or incomplete records once children are transferred to ORR  custody.   This bill is the result of Representative Underwood's leadership and  engagement with the treatment of migrants at our border, and I commend  her for her efforts.                                time  1230    These two Homeland Security bills provided for in this rule will  modernize the Department of Homeland Security and support better  outcomes for border agents, employees, and migrants who come into U.S.  custody.   House Democrats understand the need to provide the Department of  Homeland Security with the resources it needs to effectively do its  job, and I urge my Republican colleagues to vote for this legislation  to support all those who work and live by the border.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean.)    Mr. Speaker, I would ask if the Representative from  Arizona has more speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, but I believe my  colleagues have one more speaker, so I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the whistleblower resolution we will vote on later this  week is critical to the constitutional oversight responsibilities given  to us by the Constitution. Congress has a right to view this  whistleblower complaint, and it is important that we join our Senate  colleagues in a bipartisan statement to  [[Page H7919]]  this administration that Congress will not abdicate its  responsibilities.   Again, I urge my Republican colleagues in the House to join House  Democrats and a unanimous Senate to support the final resolution  affirming to this administration that we will perform our duty and to  reassure whistleblowers that their courageous acts will be valued and  welcomed by Congress.   Mr. Speaker, the two strong bills to protect children and families  from appalling conditions and treatment at our southwest border have  been sent to us by the Committee on Homeland Security and are  representative of the types of constructive and measured legislation  that comes from going through regular order.   These bills seek to address emergent conditions at our southern  border in a way that is thoughtful and practical and, if enacted, will  have a tangible impact on the day-to-day working lives of the men and  women who work at the border and the migrants and children who come  into U.S. custody.   Conditions at the border are unacceptable. I think both sides of the  aisle should agree on that. But what we would also likely agree upon is  that simply throwing money at this situation will not help. We talk  about the need for meaningful solutions a lot around here, and today we  present two of them.   The situation at the border is complicated and requires ongoing  attention, but we cannot let conditions at the border continue to  deteriorate. These two bills will provide meaningful and much-needed  reforms to our border detention system and help pave the way for larger  scale immigration legislation.                       Amendment Offered by Ms. Scanlon     Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the resolution, as  amended.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 577         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 11. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed on the consideration in the House of the       bill (S. 820) to strengthen programs authorized under the       Debbie Smith Act of 2004. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 12. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of S. 820.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the amendment and on the resolution.
