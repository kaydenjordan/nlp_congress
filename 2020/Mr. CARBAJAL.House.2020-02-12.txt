 Madam Chair, I thank Representative DeGette for  yielding and for her leadership on this very important legislation.    I am honored to represent the central coast of California, one of the  most beautiful districts in the Nation.   Places like the Los Padres National Forest and the Carrizo Plain  National Monument contain some of the most  [[Page H1061]]  stunning, unique, and diverse ecosystems found anywhere in North  America.   Today, I am pleased to support H.R. 2546, the Protecting America's  Wilderness Act. This bill would preserve the ecological beauty and  recreational activities available to communities in my district and  beyond as well as for future generations.   This legislation includes my bill, H.R. 2199, the Central Coast  Heritage Protection Act. I am proud to have worked with Chairman  Grijalva and Representative DeGette and local stakeholders to ensure  that California's central coast was included in this measure.   Title III of this legislation would designate and place into  conservation nearly 250,000 acres as wilderness within the Los Padres  National Forest and the Carrizo Plain National Monument as wilderness  areas, one of the highest forms of protections available.                                time  1245    This is a major step to preserve and protect our community's future  for future generations, allows for responsible forest management and  firefighting activities.   It also creates a 400-mile-long Condor National Recreation Trail,  connecting the northern and southern portions of the Los Padres  National Forest by a single hiking route.   This legislation has been the result of years of collaboration with  local stakeholders. It is supported by nearly 500 central coast  landowners, businesses, farmers, and local officials. This reaffirms  that protecting our environment and growing our economy are not  mutually exclusive.   Our public lands are an essential asset to our local economies. In  California alone, the outdoor recreation economy is worth $92 billion  and employs over 650,000 individuals.   I want to thank Chairman Grijalva, Representative DeGette, and the  committee for their support of this legislation.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and continue  uplifting local businesses and local economies that rely on outdoor  recreation.    Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Panetta for offering this  important amendment which further clarifies that nothing in this bill  would hinder any fuels management or fire suppression activities on our  public lands.   I represent the central coast of California, and we have seen our  share of wildfires. I believe that, if we can take preventative  measures to address any wildfire risks, we should.   As a former county supervisor for Santa Barbara County, I have  experienced firsthand the obstacles and challenges of balancing red  tape and coordinating amongst stakeholders. As a supervisor, I helped  implement the first community wildfire protection plan in Santa Barbara  County.  [[Page H1094]]    I support Representative Panetta's amendment because it reaffirms  that this legislation would not interfere with any firefighting or  fuels management activities. The underlying bill we are debating here  today would not do that. Specifically, section 305(b) of my bill  explicitly addresses these concerns.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment as well.
