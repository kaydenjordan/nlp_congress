 Madam Speaker, I realize that few policy topics are more  tenuous and challenging than immigration reform, but I believe, before  us now, is a unique window of opportunity that will allow us to solve  some of these complex problems.   We can make this a historic time for our country. As we come together  to find solutions for more than 800,000 DREAMers, we need to take  advantage of this moment to also address additional aspects of our  broken immigration system. My hope is that Congress will pass a bill  that provides certainty for DREAMers while also bringing meaningful  improvements to our visa programs for seasonal workers and our highly  skilled immigrants, along with providing resources for enhanced border  security.   We know that not every special interest group will get everything  they want, but I believe, if we work together, we can give the American  people exactly what they expect: an improved immigration system that we  desperately need.                            ____________________
