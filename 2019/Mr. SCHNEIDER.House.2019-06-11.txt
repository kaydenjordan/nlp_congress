 Mr. Speaker, in Illinois, the spring rains have meant  that less than one-half of the normal amount of corn had been planted  this year. We are seeing catastrophic floods, record-setting tornadoes,  and longer and more devastating fire seasons.  [[Page H4400]]    Climate change is not a future threat; it is a threat now, and we  need to take urgent action. The decisions we make today will determine  the future we leave to our children.   We also need to prepare for the consequences of climate change, which  are already affecting our environment, our infrastructure, our economy,  and, yes, even our health.   More frequent and intense heat waves are leading to higher rates of  heat stroke. Warmer temperatures are also directly affecting vector-,  food-, and waterborne diseases and causing longer allergy seasons.   We need to understand and prepare for these changes. That is why I  led a letter to the House Appropriations Committee urging support for  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Climate and Health  Program to help our city and State health departments address and  prepare for the effects of climate change.   I am pleased that funding for their important work has increased to  $15 million in this year's bill. I urge my colleagues to support this  provision to help vulnerable communities adapt to the health threats of  climate change.                            ____________________
