 Mr. Speaker, let me first commend Chairman Royce and  Ranking Member Eliot Engel for their strong bipartisan work on this  very important legislation that sanctions Iran's ballistic missile  program and the Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah.   Over the last several decades, the tyrannical regime in Iran has been  racing to develop a nuclear weapons program that could threaten the  United States and our allies and potentially spark an arms race in the  Middle East.   Unfortunately, the extremely flawed JCPOA kept parts of Iran's  nuclear infrastructure in place and strengthened the regime's leader  with a windfall of cash. Because this toothless deal failed to address  Iran's other malign activities, such as support for terror and their  intercontinental ballistic missile program, we must now find other ways  to apply new pressure.   Fortunately, the House is taking action today. One of the bills we  are considering will require the President to impose additional  sanctions on enemies and individuals supporting Iran's development of  ballistic missiles. I sincerely hope that we can soon add even more  pressure on Iran by designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  as a foreign terrorist organization, legislation I pursued in the last  two Congresses.   Going after state sponsors is an important part of winning this  fight, but we must fight also directly individual terror groups to  limit the resources to prevent future attacks. That is why I am pleased  that we also are considering measures to target Hezbollah.   This package would direct the President to impose new sanctions on  financial institutions and foreign governments that support Hezbollah  and affiliated organizations, as well as individual members of the  terror groups, that they have used civilians as human shields.                                time  1445    I will say it is Hezbollah that killed so many of our marines in  Beirut, Lebanon, let us not forget.   The chairman and ranking member and I recently visited Israel, Prime  Minister Netanyahu, who described the Shia Crescent of Iran going into  Iraq, into Syria, into Lebanon. He talked to us about the manufacturing  plant in Lebanon manufacturing rockets pointed straight at the State of  Israel.   These bills, I believe, will take us steps closer toward ridding the  world of this terrible threat posed by Islamic terror.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member.
