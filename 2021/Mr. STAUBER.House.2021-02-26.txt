 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the amendments  contained in this en bloc package, which includes three of my own and  two I offer on behalf of my good friend and colleague, Mr. Gosar.   The amendments I offer restore control to locals who not only  recreate in the areas impacted by the underlying bill, but live and  earn their livelihoods there, too. This is about northern Arizona and  western Colorado. This is about uranium formations in Representative  Gosar's district, and oil and gas in Representatives Lamborn's and  Boebert's districts. This is about local governance and listening to  those who live and work in the area, not just those who make it a short  weekend retreat.   The amendments I offer today move control of land back to those who  govern best. These amendments exempt the bill from taking effect in  Arizona's Fourth, Colorado's Third, and Colorado's Fifth Congressional  Districts, and require county input. Those who represent these  districts were not meaningfully consulted on these bills.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Mohave County  Board of Supervisors in support of Representative Gosar's amendment No.  7. These are the folks who know best for their families, their  neighbors, and their land.                                                 Mohave County Board                                                  of Supervisors,                                     Kingman, AZ, February 24, 2021.      Hon. Paul Gosar,      Washington, DC.        Congressman Gosar: The Mohave County Board of Supervisors       is writing to offer our support for your amendment to H.R.       803--Colorado Wilderness Act of 2021. As you know, the       passage of this legislation will have a grave effect on       Mohave County, Arizona, and our neighboring counties in Utah.       Uranium mining in the past has been the forefront of our       economic growth in Mohave County and if allowed to continue       will bring in nearly $29 billion to our local economy over a       42 year period. The passage of H.R. 803 would make permanent       a 2012 moratorium on uranium mining in our area. The language       of your amendment would help alleviate the permanent economic       loss we would sustain under the passage of H.R. 803. We       strongly support the passing of this amendment as presented       in the Rules Committee and the House of Representatives.       Without this amendment, the financial stability of our       economy in Mohave County would drastically suffer.        In 2012, the Secretary of the Interior imposed a 20 year       ban on over 1 million acres of land in the Arizona Strip Area       for the purpose of Uranium mining. This ban included both       public lands and National Forest System lands. This ban took       away much needed growth and jobs from our area. Secretary       Salazar at the time issued this withdrawal without complying       with the law requiring coordination with local governments.       The Federal Land Policy Management Act, 43 USC Section 1711       requires that the Secretary and his designees ``coordinate''       with local government as to development and implementation of       any plan or management action. Coordination is defined in the       Act as requiring prior notice of proposed plans and actions       to the local government officials (``prior'' meaning prior to       public announcements, and early enough to provide       ``meaningful'' participation by the local officials in the       ``development'' of the plan or action.). The congressional       mandate or coordination also requires the Secretary to use       all practicable means to reach consistency between the       federal plan/management action and local policy, plan or law.       All of which Secretary Salazar did not do.        Making this ban permanent based on misinformation will have       lasting effects on Mohave County. We respect and take a       responsibility for protecting the Grand Canyon, but saying       that the Grand Canyon will suffer because of mining is       inaccurate. Secretary Salazar's reasoning behind the       withdrawal was out of concern that it could damage the       region's drinking water and the park's water quality. Bureau       of Land Management officials contradicted those claims by       explaining that their Arizona Strip field office had no       evidence of contamination of water, and had no evidence of       problems with the safe operation of the uranium mines in       operation on the lands.        Uranium mining is important and useful for many reasons.       The lands in the ``Strip'' contain the nation's high grade       uranium deposits and enough uranium to provide power       generation for the state of California for over 20 years.       Uranium is useful in many ways. It is used by our military       for national security and defense. Uranium metal is very       dense and heavy. When it is depleted (DU), uranium is used by       the military as shielding to protect Army tanks, and also in       parts of  [[Page H752]]       bullets and missiles. The military also uses enriched uranium       to power nuclear propelled Navy ships and submarines, and in       nuclear weapons. A permanent withdrawal of uranium mining       from the ``Strip'' harms the American people by removing       between 326-375 million lbs (the equivalent electricity       generating capacity for the entire state of California's 40       million people for 22.4 years) of uranium.        From a national security standpoint, domestic utilities now       import 90% of the uranium used to operate America's 104       nuclear reactors. Thirty years ago, these reactors used U.S.       mined uranium for 100% of electricity production. The nation       cannot be pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear fuel. In sum, these       deposits represent the last available use of our public lands       for economic growth in our region.        The opponents of uranium mining have chosen to ignore the       fact that mining with environmentally sound reclamation was       conducted from the early 1980s until the price of uranium       collapsed in 1993. No mining at all occurred from 1993 until       2010, and the Denison mine which is now operating, is       following and often exceeding all environmental and safety       laws.        Arizona needs to go back to the roots that led to Arizona       being developed, and that is mining. The strict federal and       state environmental laws already on the books will protect       the public from environmental damage to the Grand Canyon       watershed. The mining of uranium however does not affect       ground water nor destroy the natural resources of the land.       It does not require open pit mining. Upon completion of       mining one Breccia Pipe (4 years) the land is placed back       into its native state.        We want to thank you for putting forward this amendment.       Nuclear energy can be the future of clean energy. We have the       resources in this Country to ensure that happens and we have       the technology and means to ensure mining that energy is both       environmentally safe and protects our natural resources. We       stand in support of the amendment.            Sincerely,                                                 Buster Johnson,                                                           Chairman,                                Mohave County Board of Supervisors.     Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this en bloc, and  a ``no'' on the underlying bill.    Madam Speaker, I am disappointed because we are again on  the floor in a closed rule, where zero Republican amendments were made  in order because, again, we are here voting on a package that has  hundreds of billions of dollars in non-COVID-related spending.   Again, I am down here on the floor, disappointed that the majority  disallowed my amendments.   One of my amendments would have reported on the impact the Biden job- killing Keystone XL order would have on small businesses.   My other amendment, which was denied, prevented taxpayer dollars from  funding child slave labor. No, you did not hear that wrong. In fact,  this is the fifth time the Democrats have blocked this type of  amendment from me. What is the issue with being anti-child slave labor?   Like I said, I am not sure how this is controversial, but when faced  with the binary decision to source these minerals from human rights  abusers in Africa and China or source them from Minnesota under the  best labor standards and the best environmental standards in the world,  I will take made in America 150 percent of the time.   I join my constituents' disappointment in this process. This is very  concerning.                                time  2115
