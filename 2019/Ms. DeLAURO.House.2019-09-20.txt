 Madam Chair, forced arbitration is one of the central  ways that corporate America has rigged the system against middle class  families and working people. It undermines our democracy.   With forced arbitration, employers can force an employee to waive  their right to seek justice in court. They need to accept arbitration,  which is a private legal process, without a judge or a jury.   The Economic Policy Institute predicts that by 2024, 80 percent of  nonunion private sector workers will have lost their right to seek  justice in court.   With forced arbitration, working people lose the ability to file an  individual class action lawsuit if their rights are violated. They lose  the ability to hold bad acting employers to account in an open and  impartial forum. And they often lose in their fight for justice.   Let's level the playing field, restore justice for millions of  working people,  [[Page H7844]]  pass the FAIR Act, and prohibit forced arbitration agreements from  being valid or enforceable if they require arbitration of employment,  consumer, antitrust, or civil rights disputes. No one should have to  give up the right to justice. Let's pass the FAIR Act.
