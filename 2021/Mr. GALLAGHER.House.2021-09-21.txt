 Madam Speaker, I stand before you today in proud  support of this bipartisan bill, which is a reflection of the hard work  of both sides that went into this. This process remains some of the  most gratifying work that we do in Congress and a testament to the way  in which this institution can work when we put our mind to it.   The FY22 NDAA includes a top-line budget that restores funding for  shipbuilding, procurement, missile defense, and a number of other  priorities that will help ensure the national defense of our great  Nation.   The bill that was voted out of committee continues to support and  improve the lives of those who sacrifice for our country on a daily  basis by authorizing a military basic pay raise of 2.7 percent.   This bill reinforces the committee's longstanding commitment to the  military family by requiring the Department of Defense to increase  parental leave, expands the in-home childcare pilot program, and  improves support available to military families with special needs  children.   This bill also addresses the threat of COVID-19 by prohibiting the  use of DOD funds to conduct research, including biomedical, infectious  disease, and genomic research in China or with any entity controlled by  the Chinese Communist Party. It requires DOD to report to Congress on  the number of military personnel infected with coronavirus at the 2019  Military World Games in Wuhan, China, and requires DOD and the Director  of National Intelligence to assess the involvement of the Chinese  Communist Party in the origins of COVID-19.   I thank the chairman and ranking member for an outstanding bipartisan  bill. I thank them both for their work on it, and I am proud to be a  member of this committee.   Let's do our duty. Let's support servicemembers, military families,  and retirees. Let's pass this bill.
