 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for the  House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Senator Tester asks the House managers:         Yesterday Mr. Dershowitz stated, ``If a President does       something which he believes will help him get elected in the       public interest that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that       results in impeachment.'' Do you believe there is any limit       to the type or scope of quid pro quo a sitting President       could engage in with a foreign entity, as long as the intent       of the sitting President is to get reelected in what he or       she believes is in the public's best interest?     =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S695, January 30, 2020, first column, the following  appears: Senator TESTER asks the House managers: Yesterday Mr.  Derschowitz stated, ``If a President does something which he  believes . . .

Mr. Chief Justice, Senator.   There is no limiting principle to the argument that we heard last  night from the President's team; that is, if there is a quid pro quo  that the President believes will help him get reelected and he believes  his reelection is in the national interest, then it doesn't matter how  corrupt that quid pro quo is. It is astonishing that on the floor of  this body someone would make that argument.   Now, it didn't begin that way, in the beginning of the President's  defense, but what we have seen over the last couple days is a descent  into constitutional madness because that way madness lies. If we are to  accept the premise that a President, essentially, can do whatever he  wants, engage in whatever quid pro quo he wants--I will give you this  if you will give me that to help me get elected. I will give you  military dollars if you will give me help in my reelection, if you will  give me illicit foreign interference in our election.   Now, the only reason you made that argument is because you know your  client is guilty and dead to rights. That is an argument made of  desperation.   Now, what is so striking to me is almost half a century ago we had a  President who said: ``Well, when the President does it, that means it  is not illegal.'' That, of course, was Richard Nixon. Watergate is now  40 to 50 years behind us. Have we learned nothing in the last half  century? Have we learned nothing at all? It seems like we are back to  where we were: The President says it is not illegal or Donald Trump's  version under article II, ``I can do whatever I want,'' or Professor  Dershowitz' point, if the President believes it helps his reelection,  it is, therefore, in the national interest; he can do whatever he  wants.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S695, January 30, 2020, second column, the following  appears: . . . says it is not illegal or Donald Trump's version  under article II, ``I can do whatever I want,'' or Professor  Derschowitz' point, if the President believes it helps his  reelection, it is, therefore, in the national interest; he can do  whatever he wants.

And I would argue, we may be in a worse place  because this time--this time that argument may succeed.   That argument--if the President says it, it can't be illegal--failed,  and Richard Nixon was forced to resign. But that argument may succeed  here now. That means we are not back to where we were; we are worse off  than where we are. That is the normalization of lawlessness.   I would hope that every American would recognize that it is wrong to  seek foreign help in an American election; that Americans should decide  American elections. I would hope--and I believe that every American  understands that, and every American understands that is true for  Democratic Presidents and Republican ones. I would hope that we would  understand it. I would hope that this trial would be one conducive of  the truth.   The Senator asked what witnesses could shed light on when the  President ordered the hold and why. Well, we know Mick Mulvaney would.  That instruction came from OMB. You remember the testimony of  Ambassador Taylor, the shock that went through the National Security  Council and the shock he experienced in that video conference when it  was first announced, and the instruction was, this comes through the  President's Chief of Staff, OMB, but it is a direct order from the  President.   Well, Mick Mulvaney knows when that order went into place and he  knows why that order went into place and he made that statement  publicly, which he now wishes to recant. I am sure he got an earful  from the President after he did, but, apparently, it doesn't matter.  None of that matters because if the President believes it is in his  interest, it is OK.   Now, there was an argument also, what if it was a credible reason? Of  course, there is no evidence that this was a credible reason to  investigate the President's political rival, but let's say it was a  credible reason; does that make it right?   What President is not going to think he has a credible reason to  investigate his opponent? What President is going to think he doesn't  have a credible reason or wouldn't be able to articulate one or come up  with some fig leaf?   They compounded the dangerous argument that they made that no quid  pro quo is too corrupt if you think it will help your reelection. They  compounded it by saying, if what you want is to target your rival, it  is even more legitimate. That way, madness lies.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from North Dakota.
