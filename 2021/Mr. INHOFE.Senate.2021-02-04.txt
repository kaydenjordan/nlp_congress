 Mr. President, I call up amendment up No. 786 and ask it  be reported by number.    Mr. President, I yield 15 seconds from our time to our  friend, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Hagerty.    Mr. President, this amendment shouldn't be controversial  to anyone. It has been our position in the United States for 25 years  that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, and we should have our Embassy  in Jerusalem.   This is not controversial. In 1995, the same amendment was 93 to 5.  In 2017, it was 90 to 0.   With that, I retain the balance of my time                          Vote on Amendment No. 786     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my  amendment.
