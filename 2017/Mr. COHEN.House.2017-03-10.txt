 Mr. Speaker, when President Trump was campaigning, he said  that these were the worst of times for African Americans, conveniently  or ignorantly forgetting slavery and Jim Crow. He said it couldn't get  any worse.   Well, it is getting worse with a Justice Department that has already  retreated on voting rights and that has empowered private prisons to  take advantage of people which are disparately proportionate to African  Americans for prison incarceration; a HUD department where the  Secretary has said slavery was akin to immigration and where $6 billion  is to be cut from the budget; an education department that doesn't  believe in public education that has given African Americans a chance  for the American Dream; and a healthcare bill that takes away health  care from the poorest and makes it to where many will not have health  care, and Medicaid will be decimated and possibility eliminated.   These are the worst of times and President Trump, Mr. Speaker, is  showing African Americans things can get worse. They are getting worse,  and they are on a daily basis.                            ____________________
