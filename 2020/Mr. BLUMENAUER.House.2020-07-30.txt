 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, since 1996, when California voters made  that State the first in the country to legalize medical marijuana, we  have seen a revolution taking place in cannabis policy. This has been  driven almost entirely by advocates and activists mounting successful  campaigns to have voters in 33 States legalize medical marijuana.   Starting in 2012 in Washington State, in Colorado, followed quickly  by Oregon and Alaska, voters legalized adult use. Today, 10 States, and  the District of Columbia, have legalized adult use. In all, 47 States  have legalized some form of cannabis use. This year, voters in 6 more  States will decide on future progress.   Through this revolution, we have watched, across the country,  shifting attitudes and moving forward. The Federal Government, sadly,  is still trapped by the dead hand of Richard Nixon's ``war on drugs,''  declaring cannabis a Schedule I controlled substance--wait a minute-- despite objective evidence that it is not highly addictive and it does  have therapeutic benefit.   That is why we are making progress in this Congress to catch up with  the rest of America, and the multi-billion dollar--$12 billion by some  estimates this year--industry, which pays $2 billion to State and local  governments, much of it, sadly, with $20 bills in duffel bags.   Mr. Speaker, we passed the SAFE Banking Act on the floor of this  House earlier in the Congress with 321 bipartisan votes. Sadly, it is  still languishing in the Senate, but luckily, it is in the HEROES Act  that we passed over to them. We have passed out of the Committee on the  Judiciary, the MORE Act, which would fully legalize cannabis. And make  no mistake, that day is coming.   Over two-thirds of the American voters support it, including a  majority of Republican voters, and that support is what fueled a  situation today when 47 States have some form of cannabis that is  legalized.   In the meantime, until that day of reckoning comes, we must pass this  amendment to assure the Federal Government does not interfere with  State-legal cannabis activities, and that we extend those same  protections to Tribal interests.   This modest extension of existing protections, which we have achieved  through the appropriations process in the past, is critically important  we retain and continue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would respectfully disagree. As a  practical matter, it is easy to verify that it does have therapeutic  value. That is why voters in 33 States have approved it.   I have had experience with what has happened with our veterans, who  make the strong argument that this has actually saved their lives:  People with extreme nausea from chemotherapy. Babies with extreme  seizure disorders are being tortured, and the only relief comes from  the use of cannabis. That is why even States that haven't approved  medical marijuana have passed it, because it works.                                time  1315    The existing scheduling is an outright lie. That is why we have  problems, a Federal policy that is so out of touch with a majority of  the American public, with objective evidence, what people have seen  with their own eyes, protecting babies from being tortured or veterans  with PTSD. That is one of the problems we have, a policy that is so out  of sync that it is hard to convince children that they should believe  the admonition.   We ought to legalize it, tax it, regulate it, keep it out of hands of  kids, but don't deal with what is, for many adults, a medicine or a  choice in terms of what they want to do. This is where the American  public has been going. The existing policy of prohibition is an abject  failure.   In the gentleman's home State, we watched, just this last week, a  veteran from Phoenix driving to North Carolina was discovered to have  medical marijuana in his possession and subject to a 5-year prison  sentence.   That is outrageous. That is not where the rest of America is. That is  one of the reasons people are outraged in terms of Black Lives Matter.  This selective enforcement of nonsensical policy has posed huge  problems for Black Americans.   I strongly urge approval of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to join my friend, Ms.  Ocasio-Cortez' leadership and partnership stopping the Trump  administration's reckless attack on fair housing.   For a century, housing discrimination against Black Americans and  people of color was rampant. They were shut out of programs. It has  been a struggle to be able to engage in fair housing practices.   The Obama administration reversed this disparate treatment by  strengthening the Fair Housing Act. But the current occupant of the  White House has, instead, rescinded the rule with his thinly veiled  racist tweet suggesting that individuals in suburbs will no longer have  to be ``bothered or financially hurt by having low-income housing built  in their neighborhoods.''   This continues a pattern for over a century, one of the reasons that  people of color have been denied housing opportunities and an escalator  to the middle class.   We ought to approve this amendment, push back, and recommit ourselves  on the day that we lay our friend, John Lewis, to rest that we  recognize his commitment to fair housing.
