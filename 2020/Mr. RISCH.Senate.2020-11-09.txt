 Madam President, I am pleased to recognize and  honor the 20th Anniversary of the John William Jackson Fund and their  contribution to the State of Idaho.   Bill ``Action'' Jackson, of Boise, established the John William  Jackson Fund 20 years ago to honor his son, John, who died in a  climbing accident in Central Asia. John William Jackson was known for  his sense of adventure and passion for academic excellence, performing  arts, and outdoor sports. He challenged himself and those around him to  believe in themselves and take advantage of their full potential.   The John William Jackson Fund supports Idaho youth through academic  scholarships and grants for performing arts organizations, outdoor  sporting experiences, and the purchase or rental of musical  instruments. Just as John encouraged others to believe in themselves  and reach for their dreams, the John William Jackson Fund provides the  support and assistance needed to make these dreams a reality. Since  2000, the fund has awarded more than 300 grants and given over $1  million to Idaho's youth.   In addition to monetary donations, the Idaho Youth Education  Recycling Partnership--(iYERP)--was established in 2007, creating a  revenue stream for the Fund via metal recycling. This initiative seeks  not only to fund scholarships for Idaho's youth, but also create a  sustainable environment for these dreams to be met.   Bill Jackson, the fund's cofounder, will be recognized at an upcoming  Idaho Philanthropy Day celebration. He will be honored as an  outstanding partner in the community as an ``Outstanding Adult  Philanthropist'' on November 13, 2020.   I am proud to recognize the John William Jackson Fund and their  contribution to the State of Idaho. Your great commitment to inspire  Idaho's youth and honor the memory of John is commendable.                            ____________________
