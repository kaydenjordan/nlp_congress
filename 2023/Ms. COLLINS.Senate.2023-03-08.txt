 Mr. President, I rise with my colleague from Michigan,  Senator Peters, to introduce the Animal Freedom from Testing,  Experiments, and Research Act, known as the AFTER Act, to promote the  adoption or retirement of animals used for research by Federal  Agencies.   In fiscal year 2021, the Federal Government experimented on  approximately 45,000 regulated animals for research purposes. These  experiments occurred across 14 different Federal Agencies. The animals  used were mainly cats, dogs, monkeys, and rabbits. Tracking these  animals following experimentation is challenging. In many instances,  sadly, animals no longer needed for research are killed since many  Agencies lack formal retirement or adoption policies. Recent peer- reviewed studies indicate that research animals that are adopted,  however, often thrive in their new environments.   In 2013, led by Senators Harkin, Alexander, Cantwell and myself, the  Senate passed the CHIMP Act, which allowed for the retirement of  hundreds of primates that were formerly used in National Institute of  Health, NIH, experiments. In addition, the Department of Defense DOD,  Veterans Affairs, VA, Federal Drug Administration, and NIH recently  enacted successful animal retirement policies. While I am encouraged by  the Senate's past work on primates and the recent policies developed by  a few Federal Agencies, there are many other Federal Agencies,  including the Agriculture Department, National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency, that lack  formal policies for animals used in experiments.   The AFTER Act would build on successful policies at DOD, VA, and NIH  by directing all Federal Agencies to promulgate regulations that would  facilitate the retirement of laboratory animals. The bill would provide  flexibility for each Agency to devise its own policy, with the goal of  ensuring that such animals, whenever possible, are retired and not  killed. Additionally, the AFTER Act would require that animals be  evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and pronounced both mentally and  physically healthy before leaving an Agency. This will help ensure a  smooth transition to a new environment.   Our legislation would also encourage Federal Agencies to work with  nonprofit organizations to help place retired animals in sanctuaries  and shelters across the country, not just those closest to the research  facility. This would allow State like Maine, which does not have  Federal research labs that use animals, to play a role in retiring  these animals and providing homes for them.   Mr. President, animals that are suitable for adoption or retirement  should not be killed by our Federal Government. The AFTER Act would  provide the necessary direction Federal Agencies need in order to move  forward with developing retirement policies. I urge all of my  colleagues to join in support of this important bipartisan legislation,  the Animal Freedom from Testing, Experiments, and Research Act.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise with my colleague from Michigan,  Senator Peters, to introduce the Animal Freedom from Testing,  Experiments, and Research Act, known as the AFTER Act, to promote the  adoption or retirement of animals used for research by Federal  Agencies.
