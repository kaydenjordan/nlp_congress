 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Build Back Better Act.   This bill increases access to affordable healthcare by expanding  Medicaid in States like Georgia and significantly reducing the cost of  health insurance premiums on the exchange.   With this bill, we will finally ensure that every Georgian has access  to quality, affordable healthcare.   This bill will also ensure that nearly 200,000 additional 3- and 4- year-olds in Georgia will have access to universal pre-K.   The Build Back Better Act is the largest effort to combat the climate  crisis in American history and realigns our tax code to support  economic growth in our clean energy economy.   These are just some of the highlights in this critical bill that is  fully paid for and makes long-overdue investments in our community and  in our country.   I urge the Senate to act swiftly to pass the Build Back Better Act  and invest in the future of all Americans.                            ____________________
