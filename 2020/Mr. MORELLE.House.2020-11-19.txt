 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1224 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1224         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 8294) to       amend the National Apprenticeship Act and expand the national       apprenticeship system to include apprenticeships, youth       apprenticeships, and pre-apprenticeship registered under such       Act, to promote the furtherance of labor standards necessary       to safeguard the welfare of apprentices, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on Education and Labor now       printed in the bill, modified by the amendment printed in       part A of the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying       this resolution, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and       Labor; (2) the further amendments described in section 2 of       this resolution; (3) the amendments en bloc described in       section 3 of this resolution; and (4) one motion to recommit       with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  After debate pursuant to the first section of this       resolution, each further amendment printed in part B of the       report of the Committee on Rules not earlier considered as       part of amendments en bloc pursuant to section 3 of this       resolution shall be considered only in the order printed in       the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, may be withdrawn       by the proponent at any time before the question is put       thereon, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be       subject to a demand for division of the question.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time after debate       pursuant to the first section of this resolution for the       chair of the Committee on Education and Labor or his designee       to offer amendments en bloc consisting of further amendments       printed in part B of the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution not earlier disposed of.       Amendments en bloc offered pursuant to this section shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for 20 minutes equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Education and Labor or their       respective designees, shall not be subject to amendment, and       shall not be subject to a demand for division of the       question.        Sec. 4.  All points of order against the further amendments       printed in part B of the report of the Committee on Rules or       amendments en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution       are waived.        Sec. 5.  House Resolution 967, agreed to May 15, 2020 (as       most recently amended by House Resolution 1107, agreed to       September 15, 2020), is amended--        (1) in section 4, by striking ``November 20, 2020'' and       inserting ``the remainder of the One Hundred Sixteenth       Congress'';        (2) in section 11, by striking ``legislative day of       November 20, 2020'' and inserting ``remainder of the One       Hundred Sixteenth Congress''; and        (3) in section 12, by striking ``legislative day of       November 20, 2020'' and inserting ``remainder of the One       Hundred Sixteenth Congress''.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1224, providing for consideration of  H.R. 8294, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2020, under a structured  rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Education and Labor  and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule self-executes a manager's amendment by Chairman Scott, makes  in order 17 amendments, and provides en bloc authority.   Additionally, the rule provides one motion to recommit and extends  recess instructions, same day and suspension authority through the  remainder of the 116th Congress.   Before I begin my formal remarks, I would like to take a point of  personal privilege to thank Mr. Woodall for his friendship during my  time on the Rules Committee. We don't always agree, but even in our  disagreements, he is never disagreeable. I admire his wit, his passion,  his love for this institution, and his love for our country.   I wish him the very best in the future and hope this is not the end  of his public career. I am always delighted to spend time, not only in  our lengthy Rules Committee discussions, but also on the floor with  him, so I thank Mr. Woodall so much.   Madam Speaker, the National Apprenticeship Act is critical workforce  development legislation that will invest $3.5 billion to create nearly  1 million new apprenticeship opportunities over the next 5 years.   This is an historic investment in workforce training, and I am so  pleased to support this effort. Amid this challenging and catastrophic  pandemic, I am grateful that this body is not only addressing the needs  of the American people as they grapple with the COVID-19 virus, but  also looking ahead and preparing for the challenges our Nation will  face as we recover economically.   Skilled workers are the backbone of our economy, and apprenticeships  provide a unique opportunity to grow and expand access to this  workforce. The success of apprenticeship programs is  [[Page H5943]]  well-established. According to the Department of Labor, 94 percent of  apprentices are employed after completing apprenticeship programs,  earning an average starting wage of $70,000.   Not only do apprenticeship programs provide pathways to meaningful  and sustainable careers, they are critical to expanding our Nation's  skilled workforce.   When I meet with local business leaders in my district of Rochester,  New York, I regularly hear that their greatest challenge is finding  skilled labor to fill positions and keep their businesses thriving.  Apprenticeships provide an invaluable pathway to engage workers,  establish connections with high-demand industries, and set workers on a  path to a rewarding and sustainable career.   I am proud that a bill I introduced with my colleague, Congresswoman  Trahan, H.R. 8317, has been included in the text of the National  Apprenticeship Act. Our bill helps scale up participation among  populations not typically engaged in apprenticeships, particularly  small- and medium-sized businesses. Together, we can create new  opportunities in high-demand industries.   This critical piece of legislation will bolster our Nation's  apprenticeship programs, build up a much-needed labor force, and open  doors for businesses and workers alike.   Through my position on the Education and Labor Committee, I have seen  the months and years of bipartisanship that has led us to this day.  While we don't agree on every aspect of the bill, I believe the  legislation before us is the best course of action to support  apprenticeship programs that have proven the most successful for both  working families and employers. Now, more than ever, these programs are  critical to grapple with the long-term economic impacts of COVID-19.   I applaud my colleague, Congresswoman Davis, for her work on the  National Apprenticeship Act. This comprehensive legislation is a  testament to her leadership as chair of the Higher Education and  Workforce Investment Subcommittee, and she will be sorely missed in the  days and weeks and years ahead as she leaves us at the end of this  term.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying  bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   There are just a couple of points that I would make. First of all,  with regard to amendments, I do note that there were substantial  amendments made in order that were offered by Republicans. I do know  that some amendments offered by Republicans where withdrawn because  they are essentially part of the large amendment in the substitute bill  which will be on the floor. So there will be, I think to Mr. Woodall's  point--and I appreciate his sentiments here--I think there will be an  opportunity, given the way we structured this rule and given the  latitude that I think the majority gave, in making certain that there  will be an adequate opportunity for a real debate about some of the  distinctions between the minority's and the majority's perspective on  this particular bill.   So I actually think this was an opportunity and will be an  opportunity for Chairman Scott and Mrs. Davis who is the chair of the  subcommittee and I suspect will be debating the bill and amendments in  just short order. So I think there will be that fullness and that  richness of debate that my good friend from Georgia has talked about.   I do want to just make a point, though, about the process over the  last several years plus. I think in the last year and a half there were  four different hearings held by the Higher Education and Workforce  Investment Subcommittee which Mrs. Davis heads, there were months of  intensive negotiations. There was a bipartisan Member-level roundtable,  there were at least four hearings on the subject, and there was a real  effort and I believe even an opportunity for us to reach bipartisan  compromise to expand access to these high quality apprenticeship  programs.   Unfortunately, I think, at what I would describe as nearly the  eleventh hour, the White House made clear it would not support the bill  unless the Department of Labor and the White House were granted a much  broader opportunity to approve apprenticeship programs in ways that we  don't believe safeguard the interests of businesses or the people who  would apply for those apprentice programs.   It brings to mind an experience I had--I think I have shared it on  this floor, and certainly with Mr. Woodall in Rules Committee  meetings--my experience previous to this in the State legislature. One  of my responsibilities during my career there was to chair the  committee on insurance, and I often would find myself in the position-- even though I had a friendly Democratic administration--where the  legislation would have, sort of at the end of it, sort of a blanket  ability for at the time the superintendent of insurance to do whatever  he or she felt was appropriate and give wide latitude. I would always  strike that from the bills before passage saying that I thought it was  the responsibility of the legislature to set policy to enact  legislation.    So what I believe we ought to be doing here--and I think Mr. Woodall  would generally agree with me--relative to our Article I  responsibilities of legislation being passed by both Houses of the  Congress that giving, in my view, too wide a latitude to the Department  of Labor, whether it is in the current outgoing administration or the  incoming, makes little sense, that it is the rule and the  responsibility and the duty of the Congress to make sure that those  standards are set in law, in statute, not in rule, not in regulation,  and not at the whim of the Department of Labor or any other agency of  the government.   So I think what we seek to do is not only to promote and expand  apprenticeship opportunities, because--for all the reasons my  distinguished colleague from Georgia and friend mentioned, the ability  for apprentices to make more during their career, the quality of those  programs--we believe standards need to be continued, that they need to  be strengthened, that we can expand these programs into the kinds of  industries that heretofore have not really availed themselves of  apprenticeship opportunities, that we can do that, meet all of those  goals, still set those standards and make sure that they are delineated  in statute.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate his comments, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I do want to note that we are here to discuss the  National Apprenticeship Act, and that is the subject of the discussion  in front of the House.   But I would note, parenthetically, however, the irony in the subject  that was brought up by my dear friend from Texas. The President of the  United States has not met with his own coronavirus task force in 6  months and has barely spoken in the last 2 weeks while this Nation is  engulfed with the virus' spread throughout the Midwest. We have now  surpassed 250,000 Americans dead of the coronavirus. One-quarter of one  million Americans have lost their lives, and yet there is no discussion  out of the White House.   I would encourage perhaps my colleagues to ask the President if he  might meet with Dr. Fauci and the leaders in this country who are on  the front lines of fighting this illness.   I do also note, also parenthetically, that 7 months ago this House  passed the $3.4 trillion Heroes Act to address contact tracing,  testing, and support for our frontline workers, hospital systems, and  State and local governments. We had no action from the United States  Senate.                                time  1245    We came back and, about 6 weeks ago, took up the updated Heroes Act-- $2.2 trillion--again, to try to address the suffering of millions of  Americans. Yet, no action from the United States Senate. So I think we  have more than stepped up to address the concerns of the American  people as it relates to the issue not before the House right now.   I do understand that the good people of Georgia, my dear friend, will  go home in a few weeks, and the great folks in the State of Georgia  will perhaps have something to say about the direction of the United  States Senate going forward. But I do note that I think this House's  record has been exemplary in addressing this. I now get back to the  issue at hand.   Madam Speaker, for the purpose of further discussion, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I just want to note that I feel a little bit like  Alice in ``Alice through the Looking Glass,'' where in is out and up is  down. I just reiterate that this House has addressed in a significant  way reform for policing. We have, indeed, in this House, addressed on  two separate occasions the impact of COVID on healthcare workers and  State and local governments and the millions of Americans who struggle  to put food on the table and face unemployment.   So all of the things that my friends on the other side of the aisle  have just discussed are things that this House has done. And it is  really the recalcitrance of the United States Senate and their  unwillingness not only to not adopt our measures, but adopt their own  that would allow us to then settle into a conversation or discussion  about the differences that separate us and to try to reach that  bipartisan/bicameral compromise that I know Mr. Woodall very much  believes in.   Madam Speaker, I also want to make one other point, if I might, which  is the Apprenticeship Act that we have before us, if you had dropped in  from somewhere and saw on our program that we were discussing the  National Apprenticeship Program and listened to my friends on the other  side of the aisle, you would be confused why they weren't on the  subject. But I do want to get to the subject, which is that this is, in  part, a response--not certainly totally a response to, because we were  working on this for some time before COVID, but this has, at its heart,  a response to the economic fallout of the virus and is entirely on  point because the economic impacts will be felt for years.   Some economists are saying this country will feel the impacts of  COVID for another 3 or 4 years. The apprenticeship programs and the  reason we are here having this conversation is to be able to expand  them dramatically and give people who are either in transition from  other careers or getting into careers will give them the opportunity to  earn not only a living wage,  [[Page H5947]]  but to advance, get career opportunities on a career ladder,  particularly to those industries that have really not been involved in  the apprenticeship program in the past.   Madam Speaker, again, I reiterate what we are doing here, the  importance of what we are doing, how critical this is. Obviously, we  always want to seek a bipartisan compromise, because, as my dear friend  from Georgia rightly points out, it is not about what we pass in this  House, it is what we pass in the Congress and send to the other end of  Pennsylvania Avenue, hopefully, for signature.   So it is very much the conversation here, and I hope that not only my  colleagues here, but our friends across the floor and in the Senate  will take up this much-needed legislation before we are done, in a  lameduck session, the session in front of us, and that the President  can be persuaded to act on it. That is the work before us and it is  critical and important work, indeed.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Just to take a moment to wax philosophical on bipartisanship, I think  I agree with almost everything my distinguished friend had to say.   If you are frustrated, Mr. Woodall, imagine our frustration that, for  the last 7 months, we have continued to try to engage in conversations  with the other House, only to be met with silence.   We hear, as you do, when you go home, from thousands of constituents  in each district, millions of Americans who struggle because they have  lost their job, because they have lost their restaurant, as a small  business owner that they struggle. We have heard from healthcare  workers who continue to struggle to have personal protective equipment.  We have talked to people who desperately need stimulus checks or some  other support to put food on the table.   So we hear all of that, and I wish that the conversation that could  happen between both sides of the aisle here in this Chamber would  answer those questions. They can't, because we do need to have support  and engagement and a dialogue with our friends in the other House. So I  understand and feel your frustration.   Our frustration is even greater. I would love that we could work out  the issues here in this Chamber, you and I and the members of the Rules  Committee and all of the Members of the House, and have that be a  settled question. I think we would be in a better place   Having said that, Madam Speaker, let me just, again, note, this is  perhaps the last time I will have the great opportunity to serve on  this floor and have a discussion on a rule with my distinguished friend  from Georgia. Again, I want to just indicate how much I appreciate him  and how much admiration and affection I have for him and wish him all  the best.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank all of the colleagues who have spoken  in the various committees for their words in support of H.R. 8294, the  National Apprenticeship Act. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a  ``yes'' vote on the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1224         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6.

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
