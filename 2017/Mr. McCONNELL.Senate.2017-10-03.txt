 Mr. President, this morning our thoughts and prayers  continue to be with those in Las Vegas who suffered a horrendous  massacre. We will all be praying for them and hoping they can recover  from these grievous wounds.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, last  week the chairman of the Budget Committee unveiled a comprehensive  budget for fiscal year 2018 that the committee will consider this week.  This comprehensive budget resolution provides a path to balance by  restraining Washington's spending, by reducing the tax burden, and by  putting our country on a trajectory for better economic growth. I look  forward to considering it on the floor after the committee finishes its  work.   Not only will this budget put our country on a better fiscal track,  with reduced spending, it will also provide Congress with legislative  authority to enact much needed tax reform for hard-working American  families.   The tax framework released by the administration and Congress's tax- writing committees is a template that will guide these committees as  they work toward producing pro-American tax reform. The framework  envisions a 21st-century tax code that is built for growth, that  supports middle-class families, and that promotes American workers and  American jobs. It is the framework our committees will look to as they  work through a transparent and inclusive process in pursuit of its  important goals, such as more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks.   Basically, here is what our framework envisions: We want to take more  money out of Washington's pocket and put more in yours, simply put. I  know the chairman of the Finance Committee is committed to goals like  those. I know I am. I hope our friends across the aisle will work with  us in a serious way to achieve them as well because after decades of  lost economic opportunities, it is time to get our economy on the right  track again so it can finally grow at its full potential.   Let's shift our economy into high gear with pro-jobs tax reform.  Let's put our finances on a better path with Chairman Enzi's budget.  Let's watch the good work of each initiative advance within the Finance  and Budget Committees this week, including the Finance Committee  hearing on tax reform this morning.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, last week Congress  passed legislation to reauthorize the FAA, including its authority to  collect and spend money for repairs and replacement parts for our air  traffic control system. I am proud that we worked together to get this  bill over the finish line. Now the FAA can continue to play a critical  role in the Federal Government's response to the powerful hurricanes  that have hit our country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the President is on his way to Puerto  Rico  [[Page S6268]]  to survey the hurricane damage personally and see how the Federal  Government can continue to assist in the recovery efforts.   Our thoughts remain with the hurricane victims as they continue to  piece their lives and communities back together.   During his visit, the President will have the opportunity to see the  resilience of the Puerto Rican people. He can also witness the  overwhelming support of their fellow Americans who have volunteered to  help deliver relief. Much of that support has come from the military,  including the men and women of Kentucky's own Air and Army National  Guard, who have helped bring relief to Texas, Florida, the Virgin  Islands, and Puerto Rico. Just last week, the 101st Airborne Combat  Aviation Brigade deployed from Fort Campbell in my home State to help  support relief efforts in Puerto Rico.   President Trump will also have the chance to see the groundswell of  generosity from our communities. Many donated money, food, and other  essentials. Other brave Americans left their homes behind to go to the  disaster sites to offer aid.   I am especially proud to recognize some of the Kentuckians who have  volunteered to join the relief efforts in the wake of these storms.   The Kentucky Board of Emergency Medical Services selected eight fire  departments from around my State to send to Florida to assist local  operations after Hurricane Irma. Working 12-hour shifts, these  firefighters responded to 911 calls in Tampa as residents began to move  back into their homes.   Throughout my State, churches and nonprofits sent volunteers to help  however they could. One religious organization arranged more than 200  volunteers to help flood victims in Texas and Florida. In all, they  served over 78,000 meals, helped with laundry, and distributed many  bottles of water.   The Kentucky Humane Society stepped in to care for pets that were  affected, and chapters of the American Red Cross from across the  Commonwealth have mobilized to help where needed.   The Kentucky Association of Electric Cooperatives sent dozens of  linemen to Georgia to help restore power after Hurricane Irma. The  joint effort from 17 of our State's electric cooperatives represents  one of the largest mutual deployments in Kentucky's history.   These Kentuckians, along with so many more, have generously given  their time and labor to help their fellow Americans during this time of  suffering. And they aren't alone. Compassionate men and women from  around the country have joined the cause to help ease the pain of the  victims.   Along with my colleagues in the Senate, I am committed to continuing  to do our part to support relief efforts with FEMA, the Department of  Defense, and the rest of the administration. We will soon receive a  supplemental funding request from the administration. When we do, I  expect Congress will act quickly to ensure that the men and women  providing critical support in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands  have the resources they need. The Senate will continue to stand with  those suffering from these devastating storms.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.

This will allow debate time on all of the pending nominations and  accommodate important committee hearings that will be occurring off the  floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following nominations:  Executive Calendar Nos. 351, 352, 353, 354, and 355.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I wish to mark the 30th  anniversary of the University of Kentucky's Maxwell H. Gluck Equine  Research Center. The city of Lexington, KY, known as the Horse Capital  of the World, is the proud home to the Gluck Center dedicated to  scientific research and education. Because of its cutting-edge  research, the center is internationally renowned and a destination for  students, faculty, and members of the equine industry.   Since the center's founding in 1986, it has made significant  contributions to the field of equine study. As part of the university's  College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment, the faculty at the Gluck  Center are also committed to the education of the next generation of  veterinarians and researchers.   The Gluck Center's success would be impossible without the vision of  its founder and namesake, Maxwell Gluck. With his wife, Muriel, the  Glucks encouraged the university to establish the center and grow UK's  connection to the equine industry, which is vital to the economy and  culture of the Commonwealth.   I would like to extend my congratulations to the director of the  Gluck Center, Dr. David Horohov, and the chair of the Gluck Foundation,  Dr. Stuart Brown. Under their leadership, this center has continued to  grow and earn acclaim from all levels of the equine industry. Their  efforts, along with those of UK's administration, including President  Eli Capilouto and college dean Nancy Cox, have helped to fulfill  Maxwell and Muriel Gluck's vision.   To mark this milestone, the center is hosting a seminar and open  house featuring the inaugural ``Teri Lear Memorial Lecture,'' which  will honor the life and scholarly legacy of Dr. Teri Lear, a beloved UK  professor of veterinary science who passed away last year. Dr. Lear was  one of the foremost experts of equine cytogenetics and helped lead the  Horse Genome Project. This lecture series will continue to build upon  the center's reputation for excellence in research.   In addition to the lecture, the Gluck Center will also host a  celebration to honor one of its faculty members, Dr. Peter Timoney, for  a career of international accomplishment in the field of equine  infectious disease treatment. Dr. Timoney previously served as the  director of the Gluck Center from 1989 to 2006 and is also the past  president of the World Equine Veterinary Association. I would like to  add my voice to the chorus of congratulations to Dr. Timoney for his  accomplished career, and I look forward to his continued contributions  to his field.   For 30 years, this center has helped lead in equine research. I am  proud to join the UK community to celebrate the Gluck Equine Research  Center and its many contributions to the Commonwealth of Kentucky and  to the industry. I urge my colleagues to help me commemorate this  occasion, and I look forward to many more achievements from the Gluck  Center.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m. on  Wednesday, October 4; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that  following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and  resume consideration of the Hargan nomination, with the time until 11  a.m. equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:24 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, October 4, 2017, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
