 Mr. Speaker, Russia's assault on Ukrainian freedom and  democracy is an assault on freedom and democracy everywhere. That is  why America and our allies are linking arms and engaging in  unprecedented cooperation. President Biden has marshalled the world to  impose severe consequences on Putin and the Russian economy.   Because of these crippling sanctions, Russia now stands at the  precipice of a punishing financial crisis. American troops, many from  Fort Bragg and elsewhere in North Carolina, are already in NATO  countries in Eastern Europe, and more are on their way.   The international community is also sending support to countries  neighboring Ukraine, including North Carolina's close partner, Moldova.  As we continue to work on a robust new aid package, the prayers and  admiration of the people of my district are with the brave Ukrainian  freedom fighters risking their lives to defend their homeland.                            ____________________
