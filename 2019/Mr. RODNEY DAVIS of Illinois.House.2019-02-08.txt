 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in  opposition of H.R. 1, legislation that was introduced by the Democratic  leadership that they claim is for the people.   Let me be clear: There are some voting and election reforms where I  believe Republicans and Democrats can find common ground; however, H.R.  1 abuses taxpayer dollars, criminalizes free speech, and encourages  voting irregularities. I cannot support it in its current form.   One of the most egregious provisions in H.R. 1 creates a 6-to-1  government match to small donor campaign contributions up to $200. This  means for every $200 that a political candidate receives, the Federal  Government, with your tax dollars, is giving $1,200 to a politician's  campaign.   Since when does the Federal Government become a congressional  candidate's ATM?   This is only one example of how H.R. 1 legislation is not designed to  serve the people but to serve the Democratic majority.   This House should work in a real bipartisan fashion to create  election reform that the American people deserve, and I am willing and  ready whenever my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are willing  and ready to talk.                            ____________________
