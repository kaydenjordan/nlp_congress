SEC. 4. EVENT PREPARATIONS.         Subject to the approval of the Architect of the Capitol,       the sponsors referred to in section 3(b) are authorized to       erect upon the Capitol Grounds such stage, sound       amplification devices, and other related structures and       equipment, as may be required for the Memorial Service and       Exhibition.       SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT OF RESTRICTIONS.         The Capitol Police Board shall provide for enforcement of       the restrictions contained in section 5104(c) of title 40,       United States Code, concerning sales, advertisements,       displays, and solicitations on the Capitol Grounds, as well       as other restrictions applicable to the Capitol Grounds, in       connection with the events.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 16.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 16. H. Con. Res. 16  authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds this May for the annual  National Peace Officers Memorial Service and the National Honor Guard  and Pipe Band Exhibition.   The use of the Capitol Grounds is a worthy recognition of the  honorable sacrifice of our Nation's brave first responders and their  families.   This year, the National Peace Officers Memorial will honor 228 women  and men, including 158 officers who were killed in the line of duty  last year and 59 officers who responded to the attacks of September 11  and recently succumbed to illnesses resulting from their service on  that tragic day. There are an additional 11 officers, as defined by the  Honoring Hometown Heroes Act, being memorialized who passed away  between 2014 and 2018.   Unfortunately, this year's honorees also include two officers from  Minnesota: Corrections Officers Joseph Gomm and Joseph Parise.   Officers Gomm and Parise's deaths are a clear reminder of the  sacrifices that law enforcement officers make every day, putting their  lives on the line to keep our communities safe.   My sincere condolences to the families of these fallen officers who  have had to endure the tragedy of their loved ones' deaths.   I have a deep appreciation for all of these fallen officers being  honored and the ultimate sacrifice that they have made on behalf of  their local communities.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this resolution and urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this tribute to law enforcement  officers who died in the line of duty.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 19) authorizing the use of the  Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 19         Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring),       SECTION 1. USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR SOAP BOX DERBY RACES.         (a) In General.--The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby       Association (in this resolution referred to as the       ``sponsor'') shall be permitted to sponsor a public event,       soap box derby races (in this resolution referred to as the       ``event''), on the Capitol Grounds.        (b) Date of Event.--The event shall be held on June 15,       2019, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration       of the Senate jointly designate.       SEC. 2. TERMS AND CONDITIONS.         (a) In General.--Under conditions to be prescribed by the       Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board, the       event shall be--        (1) free of admission charge and open to the public; and  [[Page H3108]]         (2) arranged not to interfere with the needs of Congress.        (b) Expenses and Liabilities.--The sponsor shall assume       full responsibility for all expenses and liabilities incident       to all activities associated with the event.       SEC. 3. EVENT PREPARATIONS.         Subject to the approval of the Architect of the Capitol,       the sponsor is authorized to erect upon the Capitol Grounds       such stage, sound amplification devices, and other related       structures and equipment as may be required for the event.       SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS.         The Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board       are authorized to make such additional arrangements as may be       required to carry out the event.       SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT OF RESTRICTIONS.         The Capitol Police Board shall provide for enforcement of       the restrictions contained in section 5104(c) of title 40,       United States Code, concerning sales, advertisements,       displays, and solicitations on the Capitol Grounds, as well       as other restrictions applicable to the Capitol Grounds, with       respect to the event.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 19.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 19 authorizing the use  of the Capitol Grounds for the 2019 Greater Washington Soap Box Derby.   This year's derby marks the 78th running of this event in the  District.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the gentleman  from Maryland, Mr. Steny Hoyer, who has been such a champion for this  event for his constituents.   The Soap Box Derby allows children to develop leadership skills and  highlight their creativity, dedication, and commitment to their  communities.   Not only are these youngsters competing for a trophy and the glory of  being the fastest car down the course, but the winners of each division  qualify to compete in the National Soap Box Derby at the Derby Downs  track in Akron, Ohio.   As with all events using the Capitol Grounds, this event is open to  the public and free of charge. Its organizers will coordinate with the  Capitol Police and the Architect of the Capitol.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support passage of this resolution and urge  my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1331) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to  reauthorize certain programs relating to nonpoint source management,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1331         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Local Water Protection       Act''.       SEC. 2. NONPOINT SOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS.         Section 319(j) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act       (33 U.S.C. 1329(j)) is amended by striking ``subsections (h)       and (i) not to exceed'' and all that follows through ``fiscal       year 1991'' and inserting ``subsections (h) and (i)       $200,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2020 through 2024''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1331.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1331.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1331 is a bipartisan bill to reauthorize  appropriations for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's nonpoint  source management grants program.   I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast), for  introducing this bill with me. I also thank the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Napolitano) for her support in moving this legislation  through committee.   The Clean Water Act was enacted in 1972 to restore and maintain the  chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters. In  1987, the Clean Water Act was amended to add section 319 to create a  nonregulatory program through which EPA administers annual grants to  help States develop and implement their own programs for managing  nonpoint sources of water pollution.   Under EPA's 319 program, States retain the primary role for  addressing nonpoint source water pollution caused by snowmelt and  rainfall runoff, which they do largely through monetary means and  financial incentives. However, according to the Government  Accountability Office, the extent of available incentives has declined  in recent years, as grants to States under the section 319 program have  declined by more than 30 percent from a high of about $240 million  annually in fiscal year 2004.   The section 319 program was initially authorized at $70 million  annually in fiscal year 1988, and its authorization level steadily  increased to $130 million in fiscal year 1991, the last year of  authorization for this program.   This bill, H.R. 1331, would reauthorize $200 million annually for the  319 program's grant fund, which gives local and State governments the  flexibility to make conservation practices improvements aimed at  decreasing water pollutants through partnerships within their local  communities.   In Minnesota, we take the quality of our 10,000 lakes very seriously,  and we all want to preserve the quality of these important waterways  for generations to come. We also know that local communities are the  experts on the most effective and innovative ways to keep these  waterways clean.   That is why this bill is so important. It gives local and State  governments authority to create best voluntary conservation programs  that work for their communities.   Here are just a few of the examples of section 319 grants in action  from Minnesota's Second Congressional District.   The Scott County Soil and Water Conservation District saved native  plants and the shoreline protecting McMahon Lake. The grant also  significantly helped reduce pollution throughout the county by planting  filter strips, building control grade structures, lining waterways with  grass, and planting native grass.   Dakota County created and implemented projects to validate,  demonstrate, and refine best management practices for nitrogen  fertilizer for corn production that will lower nitrate levels in Dakota  County's groundwater and surface water.   The Goodhue County Soil and Water Conservation District is currently  working to reduce pollutants in the Mississippi River-Lake Pepin  watershed by 20 percent.   In Wabasha County, the Whitewater Watershed Project worked with  communities to increase awareness of water contamination and provided  low-interest loans to improve residential infrastructure and help  farmers come into compliance with pollution standards.   The South Washington Watershed District integrated a storm water  reuse plan that captures roadway storm water in two existing ponds.  This integrates into two golf course irrigation systems and provides  new water amenities with the public golf courses. This is estimated to  reduce potable water usage by more than 40 million gallons annually.   Finally, in Rice County, the Cannon River Watershed Partnership is  working to engage local, regional, and State programs and organizations  to develop a way for their local community to engage in pollution  reduction in a meaningful and long-term way.    Again, I thank the gentleman from Florida for introducing this  bipartisan bill with me. This legislation passed out of committee with  bipartisan support. It is a good bill, and I am pleased to support it.  I urge my colleagues to do so as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support  for H.R. 1331 from Trout Unlimited.                                                Trout Unlimited,                                       Arlington, VA, April 8, 2019.      Re Trout Unlimited supports HR 1331, The Local Water           Protection Act.       Hon. Angie Craig,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Brian Mast,      House of Representatives.        Dear Representatives Craig and Mast: On behalf of Trout       Unlimited (TU), I am writing to strongly support the above       referenced bill, to urge its swift passage through the House,       and to thank you for introducing it. Section 319 of the Clean       Water Act has provided our field staff with valuable funds       which they have leveraged many times over to accomplish a       number of valuable nonpoint source pollution projects across       the nation. But as you know there is much more work to be       done, and passage of this bill will be a big step in a       positive direction for the health of the Nation's watersheds.        Trout Unlimited has over 300,000 conservation-minded       members and supporters, organized into 380 chapters in 35       state councils. Our mission is to conserve, protect and       restore the Nation's trout and salmon fisheries and their       watersheds. We have 250 staff spread across America who work       with our members and a wide variety of partners--including       farmers, ranchers, miners and state and local agencies--to       accomplish our mission. Section 319 has become an       increasingly important tool for our work.        Working with our partners, we have used Section 319 funds       in a variety of ways to control nonpoint pollution. Of       special note is our recent use of funds to control abandoned       mine pollution in Pennsylvania and Colorado. Abandoned mine       pollution is especially insidious problems in coal country       and in the mining regions of the Rocky Mountain West, but we       have developed a number of techniques which are restoring       formerly dead streams to healthy streams.        TU and other conservation groups are pressing Congress to       provide more funding for natural infrastructure funding and       projects. Section 319, and your bill, are delivering on that       request.        Abandoned mine cleanup, sediment control, and nutrient       runoff control, are model examples of natural infrastructure       projects.        Thank you again for introducing this bill. We urge its       speedy passage.            Sincerely,                                                    Steve Moyer,                                                     Vice President,                                                Government Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Napolitano).                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time and  urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 639) to amend section 327 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster  Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to clarify that National Urban  Search and Rescue Response System task forces may include Federal  employees.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 639         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FEDERAL EMPLOYEES AND NATIONAL URBAN SEARCH AND                     RESCUE RESPONSE SYSTEM TASK FORCES.         Section 327 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and       Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5165f) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(p) Federal Employees.--Nothing in this section shall be       construed to mean that a task force may not include Federal       employees. In the case of a Federal employee detailed to a       task force, the sponsoring agency shall enter into an       agreement with the relevant employing Federal agency.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 639.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 639 introduced by the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).   H.R. 639 is a technical correction bill which will amend section 327  of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act  to explicitly clarify that Federal employees are able to participate in  the National Urban Search and Rescue Response System task forces  coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.   FEMA has developed the National USAR Response System over the last  several decades to act as a force multiplier for disaster rescue  missions. The system is comprised of 28 task force teams from across  the country and includes highly skilled volunteers who are constantly  training for a variety of hazard scenarios, both man-made and natural.   Task force teams have proven their effectiveness time and again  across this Nation.   Following enactment of the National Urban Search and Rescue Response  System Act at the end of the 114th Congress, certain Federal agencies  that employ members of some of these task forces have, unfortunately,  been misinterpreting language that granted liability protections for  non-Federal task force members equal to Federal first responders only  when their task force was called into Federal service, resulting in an  impediment to those Federal employees serving on a task force.   This bill will simply clarify that nothing in section 327 of the  Stafford Act shall be interpreted to mean that a task force cannot  include Federal employees and that, in instances where a Federal  employee is detailed to a National USAR Response System task force, the  sponsoring agency shall enter into an agreement with the relevant  employing Federal agency.   The critical emergency services provided by the National USAR  Response System and these highly skilled operators are too important  for us to delay this fix any longer. I strongly support this bill and  urge my colleagues to join me.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this,  and I reserve the balance of my time as well.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Meadows), and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
