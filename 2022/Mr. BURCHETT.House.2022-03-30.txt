 Madam Speaker, the inflation rate in the United States  currently stands at 7.9 percent. That is the highest it has been since  January 1982.   As prices continue to rise, thanks to the unfavorable financial  conditions created by President Biden's agenda, these companies should  rebrand themselves to reflect the state of our economy.   Whole Foods Market will need to change its name to Piece of Food  Market. Pretty soon, that is all shoppers will be able to afford.   When Americans take their next family vacation, they might need to  rent a car from the airport. Hertz Your Wallet has vacationers covered.   Then there are the big box stores, long cherished for bulk purchases  at low prices. Those days, of course, are gone in President Biden's  economy. Enjoy a trip to Costgoing Up Wholesale or Targetting More  Expensive.   When we have an administration that is putting forward $5.8  trillion--that is trillion with a t--budget requests, that says  everything you need to know about their attitude towards inflation.   Madam Speaker, this group is simply out of touch with the financial  pain felt by American families because of rising prices. I hope the  next inflation report on April 12 contains some good news from  consumers. Of course, if it doesn't, I have no doubt that the Biden  administration will deny responsibility and shift blame to Big Oil, big  agriculture, or big something. One thing is for sure. President Biden  will never blame Big Government for his administration's economic  failures.      Celebrating Former Tennessee Supreme Court Chief Justice Gary Wade     Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate former Tennessee  Supreme Court Chief Justice, my good friend, Gary Wade, and recognize  his long and distinguished career in Tennessee law.   Born and raised in east Tennessee, Chief Justice Wade made the  indisputably wise decision to attend the University of Tennessee, my  alma mater, and graduated with his law degree in 1973. I would like to  note that I was in the third grade at that time. A couple years later,  Chief Justice Wade decided to pursue public service and became the  youngest-ever mayor of Sevierville, where he served for five  consecutive terms while simultaneously practicing law.   In 1987, Chief Justice Wade joined the Court of Criminal Appeals  where he served for 19 years and was presiding judge for 8 of those  years. In 2006, he was appointed by then-Governor Phil Bredesen to the  Tennessee Supreme Court, and he served as the court's chief justice for  2 years.   Following his retirement from the court in 2015, Chief Justice Wade  became vice president and dean of Lincoln Memorial University's Duncan  School of Law, who is named after my predecessor. The school achieved  full accreditation from the American Bar Association thanks to Chief  Justice Wade's leadership. In 2020, he retired from that position and  joined the London Amburn law firm in Knoxville.   Outside of his legal activities, Chief Justice Wade leads several  charitable initiatives in east Tennessee. He started the Tennessee  Judicial Conference Foundation, a program that awards need-based  scholarships to students attending any of Tennessee's six law schools.  He is also a cofounder of Friends of the Great Smoky Mountains National  Park, which contributes funds to protect the park, and a cofounder of  Leadership Sevier, a leadership training program for young Sevier  County residents.   Congratulations on an impressive career, Chief Justice Wade.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        March 30, 2022, on page H3980, in the second column, the  following appeared: Leadership Sevier, a leadership training  program for young Sevier County residents.

We were in a  little bit of a state of panic. He saw us and passed us and called me  on my car phone to check on us and check how Daddy was doing. He is a  dear friend.                      Honoring Specialist 4 Victor Hodge     Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Specialist 4 Class  Victor Hodge, an American hero who served his country as Tennessee's  Second District's March 2022 Veteran of the Month.   Specialist 4 Hodge has battled health issues his entire life, but he  never let that break his spirit. One day when he was 17 years old, he  was out driving with his mother and saw an Uncle Sam poster on a  building in Maryville, Tennessee. He told her to stop the car because  he was joining the Army. She told him that they wouldn't take him, but  Specialist 4 Hodge got out of the car anyway. And on July 28, 1978, he  officially became a member of the United States Army, despite the  obstacles created by his health.   He received his initial military training at Fort Bliss in El Paso,  Texas, and then was assigned to a Nike Hercules as a missile crewman.  Upon completing his training, Specialist 4 Hodge was stationed at  Homestead Air Force Base in Florida. His duty location was in the  Florida Everglades, and he went on to become the leader of his squad.  He served in Florida for a year and a half before health issues forced  him to return to Fort Bliss.   Due to his health, Specialist 4 Hodge received a medical discharge  from the Army. One of his favorite memories from his service in Florida  was when he had the privilege of meeting General Bradley, the first  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   Since retiring from the military, Specialist 4 Hodge has been blessed  with three children, two stepchildren, and three he helps raise.  Specialist 4 Hodge is a man of strong faith and thanks God every day  for all the blessings in his life.   Despite persistent health struggles, Specialist 4 Hodge did not let  that stop him from serving his country. It is my honor to recognize him  as Tennessee's Second District's March 2022 Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
