 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 378, the Bonuses for Cost- Cutters Act, as reported by the committee. This legislation enhances  the existing award program for Federal employees whose identification  of waste, fraud, and abuse results in cost savings to an agency.   Every day, Federal employees across the country provide vital  services to the American people. They ensure that our veterans receive  the benefits to which they are entitled. They work to keep our air safe  to breathe and our water safe to drink. They spend long hours and put  their lives at risk to safeguard our national and homeland security.  And Federal employees are on the front lines in ensuring that these  important missions are carried out as effectively and efficiently as  possible.   I think we can all agree that no one benefits when taxpayer dollars  are wasted. This bill aims to increase government efficiency and save  taxpayer dollars by providing incentives to Federal employees to  identify wasteful spending. The legislation allows an agency head to  award an employee a bonus for the identification of wasteful expenses  that result in agency cost savings.   The bill also doubles the amount that an inspector general may award  an employee for disclosures of waste, fraud, and abuse that result in  cost savings from $10,000 to $20,000.   In addition, the bill contains several accountability measures so  that Congress and the American people can determine whether the  legislation is working as intended. First, agencies must include  information on disclosures of wasteful spending and awards distributed  under this legislation in their annual, publicly available, performance  report.   The bill also includes a requirement that the director of the Office  of Management and Budget submit a report to Congress each year  certifying that each agency's cash award program complies with the  bill.   In addition, the bill requires a GAO report on the operation of  awards program within 3 years, including any recommendations for  legislative changes. Democratic members of the Oversight and Government  Reform Committee raised concerns about prior versions of this bill, and  I want to thank Chairman Gowdy for working with us to address those  concerns. The bill we have before us today reflects bipartisan  concerns.   We must support Federal employees who identify ways to increase  efficiency and reduce waste. I believe this bill does that, and I urge  my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank Representative Steve Russell for introducing this  bill, along with Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking  Member Elijah Cummings, and Representative Stephen Lynch.   This bill would provide important protections to whistleblowers who  handle classified information and want to report waste, fraud, and  abuse.   Under this bill, an employee who is covered by the Whistleblower  Protection Act could disclose to any supervisor in his or her direct  chain of command classified information the employee reasonably  believes shows wrongdoing.   Under current law, if a whistleblower discloses classified  information, the whistleblower is protected only if he or she makes  those disclosures to the Office of Special Counsel, an inspector  general, the head of the whistleblower's agency, or an employee  designated by the head of the agency.   This bill would encourage employees who handle classified information  to use proper channels to blow the whistle on waste, fraud, and abuse.  Allowing employees to go to a supervisor with evidence of wrongdoing  may be less intimidating than going to the agency head or an inspector  general.  [[Page H7951]]    This bill is modeled on language in the Presidential Policy Directive  issued in 2012. That directive, PPD 19, provided whistleblower  protections to intelligence community employees who are not covered by  the Whistleblower Protection Act.                                time  1530    This bill will provide a more consistent approach for employees who  handle classified information by ensuring that employees who are  covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act will blow that whistle to a  supervisor, the same way that intelligence community employees who are  covered by PPD 19 can do so.   This is a good bill. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the All Circuit Review Act.   This week the House is considering several bills to strengthen  protections for whistleblowers. This is a bipartisan bill introduced by  Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Cummings and  Representative Blake Farenthold.   This bill would help level the playing field for whistleblowers by  making permanent a pilot program that allows  [[Page H7952]]  Federal whistleblowers to file appeals in courts where they work or  live rather than in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.   The Federal circuit has a terrible track record on whistleblower  cases. Allowing other courts around the country to hear whistleblower  cases will provide a check on the monopoly the Federal circuit has held  for many years.   The bill would also authorize the Office of Personnel Management to  appeal a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board to any appeals  court with jurisdiction.   This bill was listed on the Project On Government Oversight's list of  legislative reforms Congress should enact in 2017. Protecting  whistleblowers is not a partisan issue. It is a patriotic issue. Mr.  Speaker, I hope my colleagues will support this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), ranking member of the full  Oversight and Government Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the lead sponsor of this bill, Representative  Andy Harris, for working closely with me on the bill of which I am a  cosponsor, and I want to thank my good friend Representative Russell,  who is managing on the other side, for also being a cosponsor of this  bill.   My thanks also to Chairman Trey Gowdy, Ranking Member Elijah  Cummings, and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy for bringing this bill to  the floor in time to begin the commemoration, in 2018, of the  bicentennial of the birth of Frederick Douglass.   I am pleased that this bill has not only bipartisan, but bicameral  support. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin have introduced the  companion bill in the Senate.                                time  1545    The bill would establish a commission to plan and carry out programs  and activities, as well as to recommend to Congress programs and  activities that the Federal Government could undertake to honor and  celebrate the life of Frederick Douglass during the bicentennial of his  birth in 2018.   Frederick Douglass was born into slavery in 1818 on the Eastern Shore  of Maryland. He learned basic reading skills from his mistress and  continued to teach himself and other slaves to read and write despite  the risks he faced, including death. After two attempts, Douglass  successfully escaped to New York and went on to become this country's  leading abolitionist and antislavery lecturer.   He served in several administrations, including as close adviser to  President Abraham Lincoln, U.S. Marshal of the District of Columbia  under President Rutherford B. Hayes, and District of Columbia Recorder  of Deeds under President James Garfield. In 1889, President Benjamin  Harris appointed Frederick Douglass to be the U.S. Minister to Haiti.  He was later appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant to serve as  secretary of the commission of Santo Domingo.   Douglass dedicated his life to achieving justice for all Americans.  He lived in the District of Columbia for 23 of his 57 years as a free  man, and his home at Cedar Hill is an official National Historic Site  in southeast Washington, D.C. Every year, thousands of Americans and  others visit Cedar Hill. The Frederick Douglass statue that stands in  his honor in the United States Capitol is a gift from the nearly  700,000 residents of the District of Columbia.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3031, the TSP  Modernization Act of 2017.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, which would help  modernize the Federal Government's Thrift Savings Plan by aligning it  with current practices for private sector 401(k)s.   I thank Ranking Member Cummings and Chairman Meadows for their work  on this important, bipartisan bill that would give TSP participants  more flexibility in making withdrawals from their accounts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3031, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), who is the ranking member of  the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, H.R. 3243, the  FITARA Enhancement Act.   FITARA is bipartisan legislation that has made significant strides in  reforming government IT and making agencies more accountable. I thank  Representative Connolly for all his hard work on this bill, as well as  my good friend who has just spoken, Mr. Russell.   This bill would extend three provisions of FITARA that are set to  expire. These provisions include the provision on Federal data center  consolidation; transparency and risk management of major IT systems;  and agencies' IT portfolio, program, and resource reviews, also known  as PortfolioStat.   These provisions provide transparency and accountability for agencies  and should be continued. GAO reports that if we allow these provisions  to expire, we will miss out on major savings. IT spending makes up  roughly $100 billion of government spending each year. We cannot afford  to allow this legislation that will save funds and help modernize IT  assets to simply expire.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to strongly support this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
