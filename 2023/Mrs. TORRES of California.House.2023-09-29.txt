 Mr. Speaker, we are less than 34 hours  from a Republican government shutdown. This is not the time for  political theater or political grievances. We are spiraling toward a  shutdown that would devastate thousands of working families that I  represent throughout California's Inland Empire.   If extremist Republicans are allowed to continue their theatrics,  over 4,000 Federal employees in my district--mothers, fathers,  caretakers among them--could miss their next paycheck. TSA agents at  Ontario International Airport will have to work without pay. Over  25,000 women and children who rely on Federal food assistance could  miss their next meal.   It is beyond hypocritical that Republicans want to cut benefits for  hardworking families while making it easier for billionaires to cheat  on their taxes.   My Republican colleagues need to get serious about governing or get  out of the way.                            ____________________
