 Mr. President, as the Senate considers the National  Defense Authorization Act, or the NDAA, I rise today to discuss a  simple amendment in support of my constituents in South Dakota who are  military retirees, as well as those in many other States who find  themselves in a similar circumstance.   These retirees may be disproportionately and unfairly impacted by  increases in the TRICARE prescription drug copay increases that we find  within the bill that we are considering today. Specifically, provisions  in this bill will increase cost-sharing amounts for the TRICARE  pharmacy benefits program for the years 2018 through the year 2026.   Now, the rationale for the increases in the bill that we are  considering today are that the savings generated from pharmaceutical  cost-share increases can be used to improve healthcare outcomes and the  experience of care for beneficiaries in the military health system, and  I support that. I believe in improving the care for beneficiaries in  the military health system. But in this particular case, the increased  TRICARE pharmacy copays must be carefully considered to make certain  that they could not disproportionately impact one part of the  beneficiary population.   Unfortunately, that would be the case for South Dakota and for other  largely rural States with large military retiree populations that live  too far away from military treatment facilities to easily travel to  these facilities and to make themselves available for the prescriptions  that are available at those facilities. Instead, these military  retirees and their families are compelled to use the TRICARE mail order  system or the retail pharmacies in their local communities and, in both  cases, they would have to pay higher copays. In other words, if you  live close to the facility, you can go to the facility and receive  those medicines, those pharmaceuticals. But if you are farther away and  you have to use a retail shop in your own community or use mail order,  you would be subject, under this bill, to a higher copay cost.   For example, a copay for a generic drug ordered through the TRICARE  mail order system will increase by $10 in fiscal year 2018. Now, while  this does not seem like a lot of money, those costs can add up rapidly  if a military retiree or his family is required to make multiple copays  for multiple prescriptions. Simply put, our military retirees who live  more than 40 miles away from a military treatment facility should not  be unfairly forced to pay higher copays on prescription drugs just  because of where they choose to live.   Under my amendment, we would take a step back. The amendment would  freeze copay increases for TRICARE retirees and their families who live  more than 40 miles from a military treatment facility. Additionally,  the amendment would require the Department of Defense to actually  assess the financial impact of the higher copays on these  beneficiaries.   Now, the 40-mile figure that I have chosen was not done without some  thought. I think we were careful in how we chose the 40-mile figure.  Forty miles is the distance used by both the Department of Defense and  the Department of Veterans Affairs as a boundary for reasonable access  to a healthcare facility. The Department of Defense TRICARE Prime  program, in which care is primarily delivered through a military  treatment facility, is available to individuals who reside within prime  service areas, or PSAs. PSAs are locations that are within 40 miles of  a military treatment facility.   Similarly, the VA Choice Program, which allows veterans access to  healthcare in local communities rather than waiting for a VA  appointment or traveling to a VA facility, is available to those whose  residence is more than 40 miles driving distance from the closest VA  medical facility.   My amendment would also set a deadline of 60 days after the enactment  of this legislation for the Department of Defense to report on the  financial impact of the copay increases on military retirees and their  families.   With the information provided by the Department of Defense, Congress  can then rationally assess the impact of the copay increases on  beneficiaries who live distant from military treatment facilities and  incorporate appropriate provisions in future legislation.   I appreciate the opportunity to discuss my amendment, which would  rectify this unintended effect to military retirees and their families  who live in rural parts of our country.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the history,  culture, and community of Fort Pierre as we celebrate its bicentennial  anniversary.   Located at the confluence of the Missouri River and the Bad River,  the current location of Fort Pierre had long been occupied by Native  Americans, including the Lakota and Arikara. In 1743, the French  explorers Francois and Louis-Joseph Verendrye first encountered this  area. Six decades later, Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark  made their first contact with the Lakota Nation at the Bad River  Gathering in present-day Fort Pierre, and it soon became a prominent  fur trading center. Its proximity and ease of access to the Missouri  River helped Fort Pierre grow from a fur trading settlement into a  regional hub and a prosperous community.   Fort Pierre remains the oldest continuous area of European settlement  in South Dakota. Today Fort Pierre is still fiercely independent, the  place where the East meets the Old West. The rugged cowboy spirit  remains strong and cattle still outnumber people. The legacy of self- reliant pioneers and entrepreneurs who founded this community is  evident yet today. With its river breaks and wide-open plains, locals  enjoy many outdoor adventures, including fishing and boating, a weekend  rodeo, or conversations around the campfire. Hunting is a big part of  the culture, and Stanley County is home to some of the best hunting  land in the State.   As residents of Fort Pierre, Jean and I are happy to call this  vibrant community our home. I congratulate the city of Fort Pierre on  celebrating its 200th anniversary and wish it all the best in the years  to come.                            ____________________
