 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7622, the Small  Business Workforce Pipeline Act of 2022.   As we help small businesses navigate the labor shortage, it is more  important than ever that we support small businesses as they work to  find quality workers and fill positions.   I am a huge proponent of work-based learning opportunities like  apprenticeships that help small businesses fill job openings and help  their workers get the skills they need so they can support their  families. Work-based learning opportunities are a great way to attract  quality candidates who may not be able to attend traditional education  models.   The Small Business Workforce Pipeline Act of 2022 aims to empower  small business development centers, like the Aurora-South Metro SBDC in  my district, to help small businesses establish and improve their  apprenticeship, pre-apprenticeship, and job training programs.   This bill would help workers gain the skills they need for in-demand  jobs and help small businesses grow their business.   I thank Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking Member Luetkemeyer for  bringing this bill to the floor and Representatives Fitzgerald,  Houlahan, and Garbarino for their partnership on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  7622.
