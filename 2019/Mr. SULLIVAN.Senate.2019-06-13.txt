 Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague  from Georgia, not just for the great lunch that he put on today but for  his leadership and statesmanship.   I serve with him on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Talk about a  committee that is actually getting things done--bipartisan things done  for American veterans. He is chairman of that committee. He does a  phenomenal job. He is a great leader in the Senate, and I thank him not  just for the barbecue today but for his wonderful work for America and  Georgia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is Thursday, and it is one of my  favorite times of the week because it is the time that I take to come  down to the floor. The new pages are on the floor, and I think you are  going to start to see this as probably one of your favorite times as  well because it is when I talk about what we call the Alaskan of the  Week. It is an opportunity to highlight somebody in my State who has  done something great for their community, the State, and the country,  and to brag a little bit about Alaska.   Today I am going to talk about Jacob Adams from Utqiagvik, formerly  known as Barrow, AK. He has been a hero to so many in our State,  including me--a giant of an individual who has spent his whole life in  public service for his culture, for his community, for his State, and  for his country.   Before I get started about Jake Adams, let me talk a little bit about  what is going on in Alaska right now.   I know we all think we live in the best States. Each of us likes to  come down and brag. That is a good thing. But in Alaska, we certainly  have a lot of bragging rights on a whole host of issues and a whole  host of areas in which we are very unique.   Right now, it is a beautiful time to be in Alaska. We want tourists  and everyone watching on TV to come to our great State. Flowers are  blooming, and salmon are running up our rivers. Hundreds of thousands-- soon, literally millions--of salmon will be running. According to our  Alaska Department of Fish and Game, it is going to be a great season  for our reds.   Of course, the sun is our familiar friend this time of year. In the  northern part of my State, in Utqiagvik, the northernmost city in the  entire United States, it is not setting at all. The sun is not setting  at all. Midnight sun, pure energy--it is amazing to experience. We  experience it, but we want everyone else to come up and experience it.   Something else is going on in Alaska in villages in the northern part  of the State around this time of year, a very unique and special  cultural tradition. The spring whaling season in 11 communities on the  North Slope is wrapping up. This spring, those 11 North Slope  communities were able to land 24 whales, equaling somewhere between 300  and 400 tons of highly nutritious food for these wonderful communities.  That whale meat is then shared in villages throughout the whaling  communities. It is an incredible Alaska Native tradition that we are  all in awe of.   We are now heading into Nalukataq season. This is when communities  get together to celebrate this incredible bounty and harvest. It is a  special day, a time of celebration and sharing. On this day, successful  whaling crews share and feed the communities from morning until night-- whale, caribou soup, goose and duck soup, and fish is served to anyone  and everyone who comes. It is really, really special.   The community also celebrates with a blanket toss, where people are  tossed high into the air. The seal skins sewed together from the  successful whale hunts are used for the blanket. It is another  beautiful Alaska Native tradition that Natives and non-Natives in our  State cherish.   There is a long list of people to thank for keeping this incredible  whaling and Inupiaq culture and heritage alive in Alaska, but Jake  Adams is certainly on the top of that list. He is a proud whaling  captain himself and a founding member of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling  Commission, which has been the primary force in making sure that our  whaling communities continue to get the quotas they need from the  International Whaling Commission to continue the practice and to feed  their people and keep this amazing cultural heritage practice going.   It has not been easy, but they have fought for self-determination,  and they have won repeatedly, including at a big IWC meeting in Brazil  last year.   It is because of Jake Adams' incredible leadership that this  tradition is so far advanced and revered in Alaska, and, I would say,  around the world. Jake has done that and so much more for his community  and for people all  [[Page S3620]]  across the great State of Alaska. In one word, he is a legend--a true  legend--for Alaska, and I am proud to have him as a friend.   Jake's accomplishments are too long to list here, but let me spend a  few minutes highlighting just a few of those accomplishments. Let me  start with his background.   He was born to Baxter and Rebecca Adams in Utqiagvik in 1946. He was  raised in the tradition of the Inupiaq people--respecting their elders  and revering the land and resources for his spiritual, physical, and  emotional sustenance.   Like so many Alaska Natives, as a boy he was sent away to school--far  away--to a school in Alaska called Mt. Edgecumbe. It is thousands of  miles away, and it is a boarding school that was run by BIA. Then, he  went to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, until he got his first job  with BIA.   All of this was at a time of great change for the whole State of  Alaska and, particularly, for the Alaska Native people. While Jake was  still a young man, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, or what we  call ANCSA, was being debated in the halls of Congress and right here  on the floor of the Senate. This ended up being one of the largest  lands settlements anywhere in the world--literally, in the history of  the world. It was right here in the U.S. Senate. The story around the  passage of ANCSA in 1971, after decades of struggle, is certainly one  for the ages.   Jake Adams, among so many others, was highly involved in the passage  of this landmark legislation for Alaska, and he was even more involved  in the implementation of ANCSA, which set up shareholder-owned  businesses with land for the Alaska Native people, what we call  regional and village corporations, throughout the State. Stories abound  of him and other Native leaders knocking on doors throughout the  region, making sure that people were signed up as shareholders of these  new corporations.   When he was only 21, Jake was elected to the Barrow City Council, and  he began his long decades of public service for Alaska and for his  people. He then served as mayor of the city from 1971 through 1977.  Then, the North Slope Borough was incorporated, the borough on the  north part of Alaska--bigger than California. That was established, and  he was a leader for the North Slope Borough in our State.   The Alaska Native corporation on the North Slope, the Arctic Slope  Regional Corporation--or, as we call it in Alaska, ASRC--is one of the  great business success stories in our State and, I would say, in  America. Many people credit the work that Jake did at ASRC for making  it so successful. He worked closely with many other great leaders at  ASRC and on the North Slope.   Oliver Leavitt certainly is another great leader. In fact, the North  Slope Borough and the ASRC are organizations that have produced really  wonderful leaders for Alaska: Crawford Patkotak, Rex Rock, Tara  Sweeney, and Richard Glenn.   But I am digressing here a little bit. Let's get back to Jake.   He was on the board of ASRC from the very beginning and is still on  the board today, over 40 years. He was involved in the selection of  nearly 5 million acres of land for that corporation under the law  passed by the Senate and the House, with limited time and limited funds  to do this. But he is a wise man, and ASRC selected well. ASRC land is  rich in natural resources and abundant in wildlife. Jake has always  been a strong proponent of making sure those resources and that  wildlife form the basis for economic development and a sustainable way  of life. ``Our lands are the basis for all of our culture and all our  wealth,'' he likes to say.   Eventually, Jake became the president and CEO of ASRC. Under his  leadership, ASRC has grown and diversified in terms of one of the top  corporations, certainly in Alaska and, I would say, in the country,  with thousands of employees, not just in Alaska, but all over.   He was able to do all of this while still doing subsistence hunting  and raising a family of six with his wonderful wife Lucille. He often  conducted business on his boat, in the North Slope and overseas, while  whaling. Not many business leaders in America can say that.   Jake once told a reporter:         The land and a sense of place remain extremely important to       our people.        We truly do exist in two worlds. . . . Our culture and the       value of traditions are part of our life every day, even as       we pursue more Western business type of activities.    He has done so much more for Alaska, for his people, for our people:  supporting the Native sobriety movement and working to eradicate  illegal drugs from Native villages. He has been involved with the  volunteer search and rescue organization and is a huge advocate for  education.   In honor of Jake's commitment to education, the ASRC's Alaska  Educational Foundation created a scholarship award in his name. The  ``Anagi Leadership Award'' is given each year to a student, providing  up to $24,000 for tuition, fees, and college expenses.   At his retirement ceremony from executive leadership of ASRC in 2006,  the people of the North Slope Borough literally cried. He is that well  respected. For his many accomplishments last year, he was awarded an  honorary doctorate of law degree from the University of Alaska  Fairbanks.   Jake Adams is a man of wisdom. I have a story. When I was attorney  general, 10 years ago, I was dealing with a particularly difficult  situation. When I worked out what I thought was a good resolution, I  flew to Utqiagvik to meet with Jake to ask him if he agreed and,  importantly, if the community agreed. I explained the situation.  Importantly, when I asked him what he thought, he said he thought it  would be a just resolution and he would be supportive of it. That meant  so much to me, as Alaska's attorney general, getting his advice and his  wisdom.   Jake Adams is a man of few words, but when he speaks, it is powerful  and people listen. He is a man of deep, deep wisdom. Ask anyone who  knows him, and they will talk about his wisdom, his natural leadership,  his humility, and his abiding love of the land, the people, Alaska, and  his family, which now includes 13 grandchildren.   A few years ago at a celebration in his honor, John Hopson, Jr.,  another great Alaska Native leader from the North Slope, talked about  how much Jake had contributed to his community and Alaska.   He said:         Jake has also bridged the world between traditional whaling       captain and corporate leader. A highly successful whaling       captain, he has also provided guidance to our North Slope       Borough and Arctic Slope Regional Corporation as they matured       as institutions. He has filled these roles with deep resolve,       wisdom, and great foresight. And always, he has acted with       the highest honor toward his family and his community.    Well said, John Hopson, Jr., about Jake Adam.   Jake, thank you for all you have done for us, for your community, and  for all Alaskans. Thank you for your decades of service to Alaska and  your leadership.   Thank you, Lucille, for sharing him with us.   Congratulations, again, on being our Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor.
