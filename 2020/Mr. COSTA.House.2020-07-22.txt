 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the  escalating violence that is occurring in the Armenian-Azerbaijani  border.   Beginning July 12, the Azeri soldiers approached the Armenian border,  a place that has been one of contention, and opened fired on Armenian  civilians in the Tavush Province.   Since then, the conflict, sadly, has escalated. The Azeri armed  forces have been indiscriminate in attacking Armenian schools and  factories, factories producing personal protective equipment that is  essential during this pandemic.   Azerbaijan must be held accountable. In the midst of this global  pandemic, where supplies and resources are already stretched, it is  critical now more than ever that we work toward peace with Artsakh.   We must reevaluate the U.S. security assistance to Azerbaijan  immediately--they are not being appropriate in their actions--as well  as increase aid to Armenia to counter Azeri aggression.   In the appropriations bill yesterday, a $20 million augmentation was  made to the country of Armenia. I urge my colleagues to support that  and urge immediate action condemning Azerbaijan's disgraceful actions.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his efforts to bring  this legislation to the House floor.   I rise today to speak on the Great American Outdoors Act and the  importance of this legislation and why we should move on a bipartisan  effort to pass it.   This bill tackles a tremendous deferred maintenance backlog on public  lands, including our national parks, our treasures, the great American  national parks.   This funding will contribute towards making our parks safe and  enhance the recreational access, such as the great Yosemite National  Park, the crown jewel in California, as well as Kings Canyon and  Sequoia National Parks and many others--not only in California, but  across our Nation--that are  [[Page H3647]]  part of America's heritage and a part of our lasting legacy for future  generations to come.   This bill funds the Land and Water Conservation Fund annually at $900  million and creates a $9.5 billion fund for deferred maintenance on  public lands.   We are way in arrears in terms of deferred maintenance that we need  to do not only for our national parks, but for our public lands. That  is why this is so important.   Let me respond to the issue of our deficit.   Our deficit is a problem. I am a Blue Dog. But let's be clear. After  16 years here, I have come to the conclusion that trying to address  incremental issues as they relate to our national deficit is not going  to get us there.   Until Republicans are willing to address the issues of revenues and  Democrats are willing to address the issues of expenditures together  and jump off that cliff holding hands to balance revenues and  expenditures, we are just not going to get there. Okay?   So we should not use that as an excuse not to do what we should do  for today's generation and future generations. The creation of this  permanent funding highlights the need for Congress to address the  deferred maintenance backlog.   I will admit that we are not doing more to provide funding for our  aging Federal water infrastructure that also needs to be invested on.   So let me close. Let's take the moment of this bipartisan success to  redouble our efforts to address the need for maintenance on federally  owned projects.                                time  1245
