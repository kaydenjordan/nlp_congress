 Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2476 would, for the  first time, formally authorize the Department of Homeland Security's  Nonprofit Security Grant Program.   This important grant program makes funding available to nonprofit  organizations that are at risk of a terrorist attack.   Increasingly, nonprofit organizations throughout the United States  and abroad have experienced an alarming increase in violence and  threats of violence.   In just the first six months of 2019, the level of bloodshed in  places of worship have shocked the world.   In addition to the April 27th shooting, where a gunman opened fire on  congregants at a Passover celebration at a California synagogue, there  was the April 21st coordinated terrorist attack on churches and hotels  in Sri Lanka that killed nearly 250 people and the March 15th live- streamed mass shooting at a mosque in New Zealand, where 50 people were  killed.   The horror of these attacks was compounded by the three church  burnings in Louisiana in April.   Prior to this year, there were the 2018 ``Tree of Life'' synagogue  shooting in Pittsburgh, where 11 people were killed; the 2017  Sutherland Springs, Texas church shooting, where 26 people were killed;  and the 2012 shooting at a Sikh Temple in Milwaukee.   These attacks amplify the need for religious and other nonprofit  organizations to have access to resources to keep themselves safe from  bad actors.   Enactment of H.R. 2476 will help non-profits and places of worship  take steps to be safer.   I introduced this legislation to authorize $75 million in grants with  Representatives Peter King (R-NY), Max Rose (D-NY), Steve Stivers (R- OH), Bill Pascrell (D-NJ), and Troy Balderson (R-OH) in early May and,  to date, it has over 100 Democrats and Republicans.   H.R. 2476 was endorsed by The Jewish Federations of North America.   I truly appreciate their support and commitment to this vital  homeland security program.   Prospects for enactment of this legislation are good, as a bipartisan  companion bill has been introduced.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 2476.    Committee on Homeland       Security. Supplemental report on H.R. 2621.
