 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on  this important bill.   Yes, I came from the small business world. Let me tell you, in my  district, the small businesses are back, and I am proud to support tax  reform 2.0, legislation that will build upon the tremendous success of  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law last year.   After 31 years under an old, outdated, and burdensome Tax Code that  stifled our economy and plagued our job creators, America simply needed  a change. I am happy to say that we delivered on our promise of  comprehensive tax reform to the American people, and we are seeing new  levels of economic growth and optimism around the country--and we are  not done yet.   In the month of August alone, Georgia added over 12,000 jobs, and the  unemployment rate fell below 3.8 percent. We are committed to keeping  this momentum going.   Tax reform 2.0 will lock in the middle-class and small business tax  cuts permanently, allowing families to more easily save their hard- earned money for retirement, helping local businesses promote  retirement plans to workers, promoting startup businesses, and much  more.   As a cosponsor of tax reform 2.0, I encourage all my colleagues to  join me today in supporting this important legislation that will  unleash the economic engine that is the American family and small  business.
