 Madam President, I rise today to express my opposition  to Mike Pompeo serving as the Nation's top diplomat.   As I stated earlier this week in committee, I am generally  disappointed to be casting a vote against a Secretary of State nominee.  I believe the United States needs an effective leader on the global  stage. But at the end of the day, as I considered Director Pompeo's  nomination, including his hearing, his past statements, and recent  revelations, I have lingering concerns along three broad themes. Mr.  Pompeo failed to express any tangible diplomatic strategies for which  he would advocate to advance American interests; he failed to be  forthright with the committee; and, finally, I don't have a  satisfactory answer to the question: Which Mike Pompeo am I asked to  cast a vote on?   Unfortunately, during his nomination process, in which he had an  opportunity to address all of these concerns, Director Pompeo offered  contradictory statements and was less than forthcoming when pressed on  a number of issues.  [[Page S2403]]    Given the opportunity to outline the strategies he would advocate  with the administration to deal with the challenges of Russia, Iran,  North Korea, China or Venezuela, to mention a few, he failed to exhibit  the depth of knowledge or thoughtfulness about what those strategies  would be. Granted, he is under the constraints of this administration,  which has failed to offer a strategic vision for American diplomacy, a  White House that has failed to effectively outline policies or  strategies to achieve a series of ever-changing goals and objectives.  But I expect our chief diplomat to have a vision for diplomacy.   A meeting is not a strategy. Airstrikes are not a strategy.  Unilaterally walking away from an international agreement is not a  strategy.   Beyond his lack of strategies, I fear Mr. Pompeo was less than  transparent through his confirmation process. Truthfulness and  willingness to be forthcoming to the Foreign Relations Committee are  essential in a Secretary of State nominee. But in his refusal to answer  questions about the Russia investigation, in which he was interviewed-- a critical issue before the committee--and in his failure to disclose  any information about his trip to North Korea, which he could have  disclosed even in a classified setting, although we got to learn about  it through the press--both critical issues before the committee--he  exhibited that he was more suited to the clandestine nature of the CIA  Director than the transparency of a Secretary of State.   I don't expect a Cabinet Secretary to publicly disagree with the  President; indeed, it is his or her duty to carry out the President's  agenda. But as policies are being formulated, I remain skeptical of  whether he will be forthcoming with Members of Congress, how he will  approach complex issues, and what that means for our foreign policy.   This lack of forthrightness ultimately leaves me wondering whether he  would be willing to push back against the President's worst instincts,  whether he would be willing to say no to advance a different course or  whether he would simply be a yes-man.   When the President blames Russia's aggressive behavior on Democrats-- pretty amazing, on Democrats--will Director Pompeo remind him that  Russia's aggressive behavior is caused by Russia and no one else? As  our Nation's top diplomat, would Director Pompeo, as he said in his  confirmation hearing, value diversity and demand every employee be  ``treated equally with dignity and respect''? Does he believe, as he  said in his hearing, in ``promoting America's ideals, values, and  priorities,'' including our collective identity as a nation of  immigrants and refugees fleeing oppression who have made the United  States a bastion of hope in the world? Or will we be represented by  Congressman Pompeo, who voted against the Violence Against Women's Act  to deny support to victims of gender-based violence and who sponsored  legislation to roll back marriage equality, or Congressman Pompeo, who,  as recently as 2016, sponsored legislation to immediately halt refugee  resettlement in the United States until ill-advised reforms were made?  These concerns are beyond policy disagreements, which alone are not the  basis for rejecting a nominee. Rather, this legislative history paints  a troubling picture of how the United States and our diplomatic efforts  will be conducted and received by our allies and adversaries alike.   Will the Department seek to roll back programs advancing women's  access to healthcare and justice systems--programs that have  significantly improved the lives not only of women all over the world  but, by extension, improved stability, prosperity, and governance  reforms? When we talk about promoting universal human rights in  countries that seek to oppress people based on their sexual  orientation, what will our Nation's top diplomat credibly say?   As we work with our allies who are absorbing literally millions of  refugees from profoundly devastating crises all over the world and as  families in my own State of New Jersey and throughout the country open  their hearts and their homes, what will he credibly say as this  administration slashes our own refugee program, once a crown jewel of  our foreign policy, both in establishing our moral leadership and in  supporting our partners globally?   On our own border, we simply cannot address the threat of drug  traffickers or opioids without productive collaboration with Mexico.  When the President wants to call Mexicans drug traffickers and rapists,  as our Nation's top diplomat who, during his confirmation hearing,  insisted his ``record is exquisite with respect to treating people of  every faith with the dignity they deserve,'' would Mr. Pompeo advise  the President not to call Mexicans drug traffickers and rapists or  would the Pompeo who once called an Indian-American political opponent  a ``turban topper'' prevail?   How would he explain this kind of rhetoric to people of myriad  different faiths who wear turbans, whether they are millions of Sikhs,  Punjabis, or Muslims in India--a critically important ally--or Orthodox  Christians in the Horn of Africa or tribal leaders in Afghanistan with  whom we are trying to build constructive relationships based on values  of democracy and human rights?   What impact would his accusations that Muslim leaders in the United  States are somehow ``complicit'' in devastating terrorist attacks have  as he engages with Muslim leaders and citizens around the world? Nearly  2 billion people in the world adhere to the Muslim faith, many in  countries with which we have relationships critical to protecting and  promoting our national security, with citizens who have suffered the  most from brutal terrorism.   Similarly, part of the exceptionalism of the United States comes from  the power of our diaspora communities, which serve as critical cultural  and public diplomats to the rest of the world. How can someone who has  made such derogatory and uninformed remarks conduct effective  diplomacy?   As I have said before, I believe it is imperative for the Secretary  of State to be forthright, to be someone with whom the American people  and our allies can invest faith and trust, someone who will  unequivocally champion our values to assert our global leadership.   Our global leadership comes from our investment in diplomacy and  development as our primary policy drivers abroad. Unfortunately, I  don't believe that Director Pompeo is someone who will always  prioritize diplomacy over conflict, particularly in the context of the  aggressive foreign policy voices growing around him. I am particularly  concerned by his past comments on regime change in North Korea and  Iran. Look, I abhor both regimes, but our national security is a little  different.   While he said during his confirmation hearing that war is ``the last  resort,'' Mr. Pompeo's past statements calling for military action and  regime change in Iran, for example, will surely follow him as we work  with our allies to build on multinational agreements to prevent Iran  from getting a nuclear weapon. His offhand remarks about regime change  in North Korea will be ever-present as we pursue negotiations to roll  back North Korea's nuclear weapons program and seek dismantling.   With all of these concerns of mine, ultimately, I simply do not  believe that Director Pompeo is someone who can genuinely represent all  Americans and best promote American foreign policy interests. It is for  these reasons, among others, that I will be voting against Director  Pompeo. Let me be very clear. Despite what some of my other colleagues  may believe or tell the press, this is not a vote in the name of  political resistance to the President. I have voted for members of this  President's Cabinet, from the Secretary of Defense, to the former  Secretary of Homeland Security and now the President's Chief of Staff,  to our Ambassador to the United Nations, to mention some.    I will never hesitate to agree with a sound policy or criticize a  misguided one, regardless of which party is in the White House. I think  history will certainly prove that and judge it to be true. I will  always put patriotism and our national security interest over  partisanship--always.   I also reject the notion that we should confirm a Secretary of State  based on world events outside of our control, whether that be a NATO  summit or a meeting with North Korea. Nobody forced the President to  fire his former Secretary of State at the time  [[Page S2404]]  he did. And unless Kim Jong Un is unilaterally dictating the terms of  our relations, we should wait until we have the appropriate people and  dutiful preparation to achieve the success that we and the world need.   In closing, as we consider this nominee and the nominee for Germany  who is also subject to cloture, let me be clear. Despite what the White  House wants to claim, Democrats are not obstructing nominees through  this body. The facts are simply not on their side. Of 172 positions at  the State Department and USAID critical to advancing U.S. interests,  the administration has failed to even nominate 77 of those positions,  including 45 ambassadorial positions in critical countries, including  South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, to mention a few. I could go on  and on.   Lest we all forget, Republicans control the votes on the Senate  floor. Republican leadership can bring up any nominee, once they have  passed the committee, at any time. That is their prerogative.   The Founders recognized that an effective democracy needs coequal  branches of government to operate in a system of checks and balances.  The President has the right to nominate whomever he wants, but the  Congress has a responsibility to ensure that person is best suited for  the job at hand--we have already seen challenges to some of these  nominees in that process--and in the case of our Secretary of State,  one who will prioritize diplomacy instead of war and promote  fundamental values.   If and when he is confirmed, as someone who has served on both the  House and the Senate committees tasked with overseeing foreign policy  administration, I am more than willing to work alongside the nominee to  provide advice and input as he and the President seek to advance  American interests and values on the global stage. I will, of course,  in my capacity as ranking member, work alongside him in pursuit of  comprehensive and coherent strategies that promote American interests.  Despite my misgivings, I will always have an open door and seek  opportunities to advance our shared objectives. We stand ready and  willing to take any and all actions in the interest of peace, security,  and all Americans. That has always been my North Star, and it will  always be.   Madam President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I wish to call attention to what has  been called the world's most neglected humanitarian crisis and call  upon the administration to play an active leadership role in helping  bring a sustainable peace to the Central African Republic, CAR.  Diplomatic attention, especially from the United States, has waned over  the past 2 years. If we fail to commit diplomatic attention to CAR, we  risk increasing threats to regional stability, U.S. investments, and,  most tragically, the lives and livelihoods of millions of Central  Africans.   CAR has long been beset by political and social upheaval. Since  independence in 1960, the country has endured coups, military mutinies,  rebellions, and incursions by the infamous Lord's Resistance Army. The  most recent civil war accelerated in 2013 after rebels opposed to the  government of Francois Bozize took over the capitol. Their campaign to  seize the capitol and the response by resulting self-defense militias  were characterized by widespread violence against civilians. France,  the European Union, and the African Union all deployed troops to  prevent further bloodshed, and in 2014, the U.N. deployed a  peacekeeping mission mandated to protect civilians and prevent further  intercommunal fighting. The State Department's Atrocities Prevention  Board identified CAR as a country at risk, and the United States took  action accordingly, working on the ground to support interventions to  prevent mass atrocities.   These vigorous diplomatic actions ushered in a period of relative  calm. In the wake of Pope Benedict's visit in 2015 and peaceful  elections in 2015-2016, the situation on the ground appeared to  stabilize. President Faustin-Archange Touadera was elected in what was  arguably the most competitive contest of any leader in the central  Africa region. Donors pledged $2.2 billion to support stabilization and  postconflict reconstruction in late 2016.   However, in 2017, security in the country began to precipitously  decline. Militia and criminal gangs in the north and eastern parts of  the country began fighting each other in a quest for control over  territory and resources, threatening the fragile peace. Entire villages  have been destroyed, civilians targeted and killed. While the  government and 13 armed groups signed a notional peace deal in June  2017--the fifth disarmament agreement signed by armed groups in 4  years--renewed fighting quickly followed.  [[Page S2432]]    Some armed groups have targeted United Nations peacekeepers, a  potential war crime under international law. On April 3, members of  ``anti-Balaka'' militias attacked a United Nations Multidimensional  Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic,  MINUSCA, base, killing 1 peacekeeper and injuring 11 others. On April  8, MINUSCA troops came under fire as they were conducting a joint  operation with CAR state security forces aimed at disarming and  detaining the leaders of what they referred to as criminal groups in  Bangui's last remaining Muslim enclave, the PK5 neighborhood. Two days  later, armed groups levied a sustained attack against a MINUSCA base in  downtown Bangui, resulting in the death of one peacekeeper.   The resurgence of militia violence has made CAR one of the most  dangerous countries in the world for humanitarian workers, leading aid  agencies to reconsider their operations there. Six aid workers were  killed in February this year alone, and attacks and threats continue.  In November 2017, Doctors Without Borders shut down a major operation  after a string of attacks and threats.   Some may ask why the United States should care about what happens in  a small landlocked country in Africa with a population of just under 5  million. I give you three reasons.   First, as members of the community of nations, we have a moral  obligation to take action when we see mass violence and human  suffering. United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian  Affairs Stephen O'Brien warned in August 2017 that the renewed clashes  were early warning signs of a possible move towards genocide. While  thankfully that scenario has not unfolded, violence continues to play  out along ethnic and sectarian lines, causing social profound  cleavages. Armed groups of various stripes carry out atrocities,  including widespread sexual violence, against innocent civilians. In  2014, largely Christian anti-Balaka militia groups, waged a systematic  campaign in 2014 forcing most of CAR's Muslim citizens to flee their  homes. Many of those Muslim communities remain largely confined to the  rebel stronghold of the northeast and small enclaves in the capitol and  other population centers. We must do our part to bring this kind of  horrific violence to an end. History offers brutal reminders of what  happens when the international community fails to intervene on behalf  of persecuted minorities.   We must continue to help those in need. The number of internally  displaced persons in CAR has increased by more than 70 percent over the  past year. Of an estimated total population of 4 million, approximately  681,000 Central Africans are internally displaced--the highest number  reported since the height of the conflict in early 2014--while an  estimated 568,000 more are sheltering as refugees in neighboring  countries. Over 87,000 children are at risk of acute malnutrition. Yet  the U.N. has received only 5 percent of the $515.6 million it has  requested for its 2018 humanitarian response plan. The World Food  Program was forced to cut rations in half for the most vulnerable  families nearly a year ago, due to lack of funding. Earlier this year,  U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy  Emergency Relief Coordinator Ursula Mueller stated unequivocally: ``If  we do not receive funding, people will die.''   Second, lack of stability in CAR has implications for broader  regional instability. CAR is located in a volatile and impoverished  region with a long history of development, governance, and human rights  problems. Violence in CAR only adds to the enormous human suffering in  neighboring countries such as Democratic Republic of Congo and South  Sudan. Other countries bordering CAR continue to struggle against the  Boko Haram insurgency. We know that instability throughout the world  can directly impact U.S. interests. It is in our interests to promote  stability and peace throughout the region.   Third, the U.S. has invested $1 billion in CAR in the past 2 years;  promoting lasting stability and governance is the surest way for our  investments to yield positive results. Our Permanent Representative to  the U.N., Ambassador Nikki Haley, has spent considerable time focusing  on cutting peacekeeping costs, and the administration has signaled its  desire to limit funding for U.N. peacekeeping missions. However, it has  spent precious little time investing in diplomatic strategies and  initiatives to end the conflicts that have necessitated these missions  and would support their success. Doing so would be more cost effective,  as well as having a positive impact on those impacted by conflict.   The situation is dire. In the absence of action by the  administration, along with our partners in the international community,  the risk of the CAR fully collapsing is high, but while it might be  difficult to turn back the increasing tide of violence facing the  country, it is not impossible. I urge the administration to take the  following steps: fully staff senior leadership positions at the  Department of State and USAID. It is well past time for this  administration to put our foreign policy house in order to best advance  American interests. The administration has not nominated an ambassador  to CAR, leaving the post vacant for over 6 months. It also has not  nominated an Assistant Secretary of State for Africa to coordinate  policy and engage with counterparts in the region and among our  partners in Europe and elsewhere. There is no Assistant Administrator  for Africa at USAID at a time of unprecedented humanitarian needs on  the continent. We need high-ranking diplomats and aid officials to  bring fresh ideas and energy into policy discussions in Washington and  galvanize action in capitols of other countries. Quickly filling  vacancies is an easily accomplished task that would have a significant  impact; formulate an updated strategy for CAR. Fully staffed or not,  given the situation on the ground, the administration must act. Three  years ago, the Obama administration put forward such a strategy in  response to legislation. This administration should follow up and  respond to changing conditions on the ground by putting in place a  multiyear, comprehensive strategy to support greater peace and  stability in CAR as a foundation for future development and prosperity.  Such a plan should include humanitarian and development goals in  addition to plans for diplomatic actions and engagement; work with  other donors and the United Nations to incentivize greater progress on  disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and security sector  reform. The 2015 ``Bangui Forum'' called for all combatants to give up  their weapons prior to national elections in 2016. This process was  never undertaken. A renewed effort a year ago has yet to yield  significant results. We must continue support for rule of law and  accountability. Financial and diplomatic support for CAR's nascent  special criminal court is also critical to fulfilling this process.   Finally, we must signal our intention to follow through with  commitments to the people of CAR and to our international partners by  sending a high-level delegation from Washington to CAR and inviting  President Touadera to the United States for an official visit.   None of the policy recommendations I am suggesting are particularly  difficult. All it takes is time, attention, and, to be frank, an  interest in being involved to devise a strategy and determine how to  adequately fund it. I urge the administration not to let a tragedy  occur due to indifference.                            ____________________
