 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for up to 6 minutes  of debate prior to the rollcall vote.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 926 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I want to say a few words in support of this  bipartisan bill. This is a Cruz-Manchin-Ernst-Fetterman bill, which  demonstrates the breadth of agreement we can have in this body.   This amendment would prevent the sale of our Nation's emergency crude  oil stockpile, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to four countries that  are unequivocally U.S. adversaries.   We know that China has been amassing the largest stockpile of crude  in the world. At the same time, our own reserves have fallen to only  347 million barrels--the lowest since 1983.   Last year, the United States sold off part of our reserves to China.  One would think that existing law would prevent this, but that isn't  yet the case.   For some time now, Senator Manchin and I have been working together  to try to fix this issue. Our amendment prevents the Federal Government  from selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China, to  Russia, to Iran, or to North Korea and their related entities, while  giving the Department of Energy flexibility to waive these restrictions  in the event doing so serves our national security interests.   I want to thank Senator Manchin for working closely with me on this  amendment and also Senators Ernst and Fetterman.   I also want to note briefly--I know there are some Members of this  body who believe we should ban all oil sales overseas. I would note  that doing so would be spectacularly harmful not only to U.S.  interests, but it would also hurt our friends and allies. It would hurt  Ukraine, it would hurt Europe, and it would benefit our enemies,  including Russia, to force our friends to have to purchase oil from  Russia.   I urge adoption of the amendment.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
