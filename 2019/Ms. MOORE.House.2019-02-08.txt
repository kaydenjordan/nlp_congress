 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I will be brief. The lack of childcare is a  serious barrier to workforce participation. But the lack of childcare  is also a significant barrier to obtaining good healthcare, which is  why I am so grateful that we are taking this step today to make it less  so for our Nation's veterans who are in dire need of critical services  at their VA.   My amendment is simple, Mr. Chairman. First, it requires the VA to  report on the use of this new benefit broken down by region. We need to  have hard data about usage to gauge the effectiveness of this program.   Secondly, it requires a biannual report from VA on other childcare  barriers besides the financial assistance we are providing today that  may be hindering veterans' access to care.   Now, while this bill may get us down the road on improving care,  there may be other barriers to childcare that remain: the lack of  transportation, as an example; availability; or access to providers.  While this bill is progress, we can't rest until all of the barriers to  quality and affordable childcare for veterans seeking services has been  addressed.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano), the distinguished chairman of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chair, I do want to thank the chairman for his  support, and I want to thank Members of the minority for their support.  This is so very important.   I look forward to working with the chairman in this Congress to  continue to ensure that the Veterans Administration has the capacity  and the resources to do right by our veterans, to respect the rights of  its union employees, to provide the needed services, and as you  mentioned earlier, to make sure that they get critical healthcare.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
