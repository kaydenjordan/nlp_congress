 Mr. President, for the October Granite Stater of  the Month, I would like to recognize an extremely thoughtful and  motivated young woman who has made it her mission to address bullying  in our school communities, Hannah Guillemette. Hannah, a high school  freshman from Bedford, NH, started her anti-bullying and kindness  campaign ``I've Got Your Back,'' also known as IGYB, when she was in  middle school just over a year ago. She began by distributing 600 IGYB  wristbands with a mission tag prompting her peers to include, be kind,  and respect each other in her community, and the effort quickly grew  and has touched almost 30,000 people across New Hampshire and 14 other  States.   Hannah was inspired to act after witnessing bullying in her own  school and  [[Page S6961]]  being bullied herself for standing up for friends. She recalled one of  her middle school friends, who was bullied so badly that he would ride  his broken bicycle to school in the depths of the New Hampshire winter  rather than take the bus. Hannah helped get him a new bicycle, but she  was also inspired to do something more to stop the bullying that  impacted him and others in her school.   The summer before her 8th grade year, Hannah came up with the IGYB  program that includes a wristband, a parent hand-out, and video that  explains IGYB and how participating students are pledging to stand up  against bullying and spread kindness in their schools. Now, Hannah  travels across New Hampshire giving talks to school assemblies and  recruiting ``ambassadors,'' both student and adults, in school  communities to help spread the message of IGYB. She is currently  working with New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu and other New  Hampshire officials to implement her program in all New Hampshire  schools.   Hannah says that she wants to be a voice both for those who need one  now and for those who needed one but are no longer here. She hopes that  her IGYB movement will let students know that people support them and  have their backs. For her dedication to making her community a better  place and the work she has done to prevent bullying and spread kindness  in New Hampshire schools, I am proud to recognize Hannah as our October  Granite Stater of the Month.                            ____________________
