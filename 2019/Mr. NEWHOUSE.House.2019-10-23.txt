 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life and service  of Assistant Fire Chief Christian Johnson of Okanogan County Fire  District 3. Chief Johnson recently passed away due to injuries he  sustained while fighting the Spring Coulee fire in north central  Washington last September.   Mr. Speaker, Chief Johnson is an American hero. He served our country  honorably, retiring from the Army after 22 years before joining the  fire department nearly 20 years ago to serve his local community. His  wife, Pam, described him as selfless, kind, and always ready to help  someone in need. He was well-known and well-loved in Okanogan County,  which is clear from the community's outpouring of support in recent  weeks.   I encourage all in north central Washington to pay their respects at  Chief Johnson's memorial this Thursday, October 24, at 1 p.m. at the  Okanogan County Fairgrounds.   My deepest condolences go out to Pam and the Johnson family. The  people of central Washington are eternally grateful for his selfless  service to protect our communities.   Chief Johnson, may you rest in peace.         A Renewed Vision for Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud and thank the U.S.  Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Forest Service for their recent  announcement renewing their commitment and vision to the Job Corps  Civilian Conservation Center program.   Operated by the USDA and the Forest Service, Job Corps Civilian  Conservation Centers, or CCCs, serve rural communities across the  country by training the next generation of America's workforce to carry  out a unique  [[Page H8394]]  and particularly important mission: conserving our Federal lands,  mitigating fire threats, and suppressing active wildfires.   My central Washington district is home to two of these centers:  Columbia Basin in Moses Lake and Fort Simcoe in White Swan. At these  centers, students learn hands-on skills that they utilize to expand  public access to Federal lands, improve campsites in national forests  throughout Washington State, and serve as impactful stewards of our  environment.   I have strongly supported and defended Job Corps Civilian  Conservation Centers because I have witnessed firsthand how these  programs act as catalysts for the young people I represent, giving them  a chance to give back to their community while learning life-changing  skills.    I was sincerely grateful to Secretary Perdue for committing to work  with me and my colleagues in Congress to help improve CCC programs  across the country instead of transferring operations to the Department  of Labor earlier this year. Now, with this recent announcement,  Secretary Perdue has followed through on his word.   Under the Secretary's direction, Forest Service Chief Vicki  Christiansen announced a recommitment to Job Corps CCC students by  realigning the mission of these centers with the Forest Service's own  motto, which is ``Caring for the Land and Serving People.''   The U.S. Forest Service is uniquely qualified to administer Civilian  Conservation Centers, which play a critical role throughout the United  States and go above and beyond traditional Job Corps programs. Under  this new vision, these specialized Job Corps programs will better  prepare both urban and rural youth to become the next generation of  responsible land managers.   The Forest Service has committed to revamp the CCC's curriculum to  meet the needs of Forest Service regions across the United States.  Focusing on regional performance targets will allow the agency to  increase student learning opportunities while making much-needed  improvements to forest conditions. By strengthening the alumni network  and supporting a pipeline between CCCs and the Forest Service, these  centers can focus on jobs in forestry, firefighting, and conservation,  which are all critical careers throughout the rural West.   In the words of Chief Christiansen: ``Our Job Corps faculty and  students embody the Forest Service values of service, interdependence,  conservation, diversity, and safety.''   As I have seen firsthand, these students and our public lands deserve  this investment.   So, Mr. Speaker, I thank Secretary Sonny Perdue and Chief Vicki  Christiansen for their commitment to rural America, our national lands,  and the students of the Civilian Conservation Centers.                            ____________________
