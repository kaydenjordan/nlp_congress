 Last night, five people were killed by a Palestinian  gunman outside Tel Aviv. It was the fifth time in just 2 weeks that  unprovoked violence has shattered lives on Israel's streets. Eleven  innocent victims are now dead. They include people of different faiths.  Several were Arab Israelis.   As Jews, Christians, and Muslims prepare for some of the holiest days  of the year, families in Israel are in mourning. I know I speak for all  of our colleagues in offering them the Senate's deepest sympathies.   America, like our Arab and Israeli friends, must remain clear-eyed.  The war against terrorism will not fight itself. We cannot afford to be  complacent; we must continue to invest in the common mission of  security and peace; and we must always stand firmly with our ally  Israel.
