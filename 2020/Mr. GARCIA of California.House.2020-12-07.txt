 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  a dear friend and to honor the life of someone very special to my  hometown of Santa Clarita.   Ms. Cheri Fleming, a radiant mom, a beautiful wife, a savvy  businesswoman, and an avid philanthropist, passed away on November 16.   Cheri was an icon in the Santa Clarita Valley. She was the brilliant  and shining essence of everything that is great about my hometown. She  led with grace. She succeeded in business with humility. She supported  charities with endless generosity. She loved her friends and family  intensely, always giving one of the most warm hugs you can imagine.   As a philanthropist, Cheri was one of the primary reasons why so many  nonprofit organizations in our district are  [[Page H6862]]  thriving and providing services and hope to countless thousands.   Today, she is with God, but she will always remain in our hearts, Mr.  Speaker.   My deepest condolences go out to her family and especially her  husband, Don, who is also one of the greatest Americans I have ever  known.   May God bless the Cheri Fleming family, and may God bless Santa  Clarita in the wake of her loss.                            ____________________
