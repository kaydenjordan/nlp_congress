 Madam President, most of Europe--indeed, most of the  civilized world--does not require three COVID vaccines for adolescents.   We are admonished by those on the left to follow the science. The  science is pretty clear on this as well. The FDA committee on vaccines,  as well as the CDC committee on vaccines, voted, and they said that it  would be advisable--not a mandate, but that it would be advisable--to  give a booster vaccine to those 65 and older. Adolescents were never  addressed in this.   In fact, one of the members of the committee, Paul Offit, is a  renowned scientist--infectious disease, Philadelphia Children's  Hospital. He is pro all vaccines. He is pro the COVID vaccine. I think  he probably doesn't even have trouble with the mandate, and yet he said  the risks to the vaccine for adolescents are greater than the risk of  the disease.   We address diseases based on the individual and who they are and what  their risks are. You base the risks and benefits of treatment versus  the disease.   The risks of COVID, particularly in 2021, for a 70-year-old, were  maybe a thousand times more than for a teenager. In fact, when we have  looked at some countries' statistics, the entire country of Germany had  no deaths among healthy children between the ages of 5 and 17.   If you take out children who are very, very ill in our country and  look at only healthy children, there is no measurable risk of dying  from COVID in our country for the youth. Yet we still have a policy  here, and this policy originated not with scientists nor with the  scientific committee. The policy that they are adhering to here to  force our Senate pages to have three vaccines actually comes from  political appointees in the Biden administration.   It is not just a fact or a matter of whether or not the vaccine is of  benefit to them. It is also a question of whether or not the vaccine is  actually potentially harmful to them. We do know that there is a side  effect to the vaccine, particularly in young people--particularly boys,  but it can happen in girls--primarily between the ages of 14 and 24. We  know that that risk increases with each successive vaccine because kids  have a stronger immune response. We know this because even the CDC  recommended that if you just had COVID recently, you shouldn't get a  COVID vaccine because you have already gotten a heightened immune  response from the disease itself.   But we know with certainty that none of the vaccine committees  recommended that Senate pages have three vaccines. Yet that is still  the policy.   We finally have come to the realization that almost everybody has  either been vaccinated or had COVID and that, actually, natural  immunity is about five times more potent than the vaccine.   We finally have come to a sensible policy with regard to our  military. We are no longer mandating the COVID vaccine in the military.  Yet one of the few places left on the planet where we are mandating it  is in the Senate.   Now, admittedly, there are not that many Senate pages. But should we  be lacking in science and ignoring the science to force them to do  something that is actually potentially deleterious to their health.   Even the council for the District of Columbia recently voted  unanimously to repeal the requirement that students receive a COVID-19  shot to attend public school.   Some on the other side will say: Well, we need to force the Senate  pages to take these three vaccines because that is what the DC schools  are doing.   The DC schools are no longer doing this.   The entire world admits that the vaccine does not stop transmission.  So you can't make this indirect argument: We need to vaccinate them to  save the old Senators. That is not true. It doesn't stop transmission.   We do believe that still, for vulnerable crowds, vulnerable age  groups--over 65--there may be some reduction in hospitalization and  death. There is no measurable benefit for adolescents, and there  actually is a greater risk of myocarditis from the vaccine--admittedly  still not a high risk but about between 4 and 6 out of 15,000--of an  inflammation of the heart. But we do know the risk for a child or for  an adolescent--a Senate page--dying is zero. If they have particular  health problems and they want to take a vaccine, nobody is stopping  them, but we shouldn't be mandating something that the science doesn't  support.   So just before Thanksgiving, the Mayor of DC actually signed the  legislation that gets rid of DC's mandate. There is no more excuse that  the DC schools are requiring this. The council and Mayor of one of the  most liberal cities in the United States are all of one mind: We have  had enough of COVID vaccine mandates. We have had enough of students  missing school for noncompliance. We have had enough of kids falling  behind in their studies for the sake of a misguided mandate. Yet, to  become a Senate page, you still to this day must get a COVID-19 booster  shot. This requirement in the Senate persists despite the fact that  study after study demonstrates that the risks posed by the vaccine for  young and healthy people are greater than the risks posed by COVID. In  addition, all sides acknowledge that the vaccines do not prevent  transmission.   Study after study shows that it makes no sense to mandate COVID  vaccinations for teenagers who are healthy and that such a mandate  could be dangerous.   A myocarditis study published last year in the Journal of the  American Medical Association Cardiology examined 23 million people ages  12 and up across Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. This study of 23  million people found that after 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine, the risk of  myocarditis was higher compared with being unvaccinated and higher  after the second dose of the vaccine.  [[Page S5944]]    Almost all of the myocarditis came after the second vaccine. With  each vaccine, it increases the risk because the kids, or younger  people, make an amazingly strong immune reaction to the vaccine. The  risk was highest among males ages 16 to 24.   That is why many of us argued until we were blue in the face that  mandating it for our young soldiers was wrong and actually malpractice.  We finally did succeed in removing that mandate, and that was actually  passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President. Yet the  same risk exists for the Senate pages, and the mandate continues.   This is exactly why several European countries--including Germany,  France, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway--all restrict the use of  mRNA vaccines for COVID for young people. Yet the policy for Senate  pages blindly commands vaccines for young, healthy people.   A study published in December 2022 in the Journal of Medical Ethics  found that per 100,000 third doses of mRNA vaccine, up to 14.7 cases of  myocarditis may be caused in males ages 18 to 29. Up to 80 percent of  those diagnosed with vaccine-induced myocarditis or pericarditis  continued to struggle with cardiac inflammation more than 3 months  after receiving a second dose.   Also in December 2022, Dr. Vinay Prasad and Dr. Benjamin Knudsen  published a review in the European Journal of Clinical Investigation  that examined 29 studies across 3 continents. Madam President, 6 of the  29 studies showed that after 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine, more than 1 in  10,000 males between the ages of 12 and 24 would experience  myocarditis.   A study published the same month in the Annals of Internal Medicine  found that, regardless of sex, among those ages 5 to 39, myocarditis or  pericarditis occurred in 1 in every 50,000 after a first booster.   With statistics like that, why would anyone think that it is a good  idea to insist upon boosters for our young pages, who are in their  early teenage years?   It is the height of malpractice to subject young people to the  greater risk of vaccination simply to satisfy the hunger for mandates.  But even the bureaucrats are finding that they can no longer credibly  impose COVID mandates. There is a growing movement among scientists and  doctors across the country to think more rationally about this.   We have always had this. For example, the flu vaccine was never  mandated on children. Children survived the flu and developed immunity.  How long does your immunity last? Curiously, they found a woman who had  survived the Spanish flu who was still alive just a couple of years  ago. She actually still had antibodies to the Spanish flu although it  had been nearly 100 years since she was infected. We know that people  who had the first SARS in 2002 and 2003 still have antibodies nearly 20  years later.   People have learned to live with COVID. Even the DC Council, which  governs one of the most liberal, mandate-happy cities in the country,  knows that their constituents will no longer tolerate mandates,  particularly those imposed on children, but the Senate COVID vaccine  mandate remains.   Will this mandate continue indefinitely, and if so, based on what  data? What if someone can come let's say 5 years from now and say: I  have had COVID 15 times, and the last 8 times, it was minor cold  symptoms. Yet you are still mandating I take a vaccine that doesn't  stop transmission and has no benefit to hospitalization or death for  young people?   You know, when they approved the booster for kids--it was never  recommended, but they approved it for kids--they could not come up with  data showing reduced hospitalization or death. Why? Because young  people aren't going to the hospital or dying from COVID. They simply  have it from the beginning, and they don't now.   The only way they could actually try to prove efficacy--and not  really efficacy but to prove some kind of effect from giving a  booster--is they said: If you give these kids a vaccine, they will make  antibodies.   Well, my response to that is, you can give them 100 vaccines, you can  give them 1,000 vaccines, and they will make antibodies every time.  That is proof of the concept of the way vaccines work, but it doesn't  mean you have to or need a vaccine.   Public health measures should be backed up with proof that the  benefits outweigh the burdens. There is no evidence of that when it  comes to vaccination and booster mandates, especially for teenagers,  who, as a group, are less vulnerable to this virus than any Senator. In  fact, it is a little-known fact but absolutely true that the seasonal  flu, or influenza, is more deadly than COVID for people in the  ``young'' category. In the category for the age of the Senate pages,  the seasonal flu is more deadly than COVID.    Now, this isn't to downplay COVID; it is just to say that COVID had a  very targeted mortality and lethality. Its target was generally over  65. It was also those who are obese at almost any age. But it  specifically was not fatal for young, healthy people.   I merely ask that the Senate open its eyes to what several other  countries are doing, what the rest of the country sees: that COVID  vaccine mandates on children are harmful, counterproductive, and must  be put to an end. That is why I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  pass my resolution to end all COVID-related vaccination mandates for  pages who serve in the Chamber.   So therefore I ask, Madam President, unanimous consent that the  Committee on Rules and Administration be discharged from consideration  and the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 336; further, that the resolution  be agreed to and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Nothing in our proposal bans future vaccines. So it is a  spurious argument to say that somehow, this would prevent a future  vaccine. Ten years from now Ebola erupts, and everybody is getting  Ebola, and we have a great vaccine--nothing prevents that.   Now, he mentioned whether or not the children, the kids, the  teenagers, might have a preexisting condition. We don't know that; you  are right. So the people who take care of minors are their parents, and  they would make a decision.   Nothing in this resolution prevents anybody from getting a vaccine.  In fact, I would recommend you ask your doctor. That is the way you are  supposed to do it: Ask your doctor and your parents and decide whether  you need a vaccine. So, really, there are no real arguments here being  made.   It is important to know that no one would be prevented from getting a  vaccine, and no one would be prevented from having a new vaccine policy  later on.   The question of who is dying from this is an important one because  the question is whether for healthy kids, whether the risks of the  vaccine are greater than the risks of the disease.   This is something people are going to have different conclusions on.  But the science shows at this point that the risks of the vaccine are  greater than the risks of the disease for healthy kids.   Now, if your kid is not healthy or had a kidney transplant and you  want to talk it over with their doctor, by all means they can get a  vaccine if they want. But realize that the other kids getting vaccines  is not protecting your child because the vaccines don't stop  transmission.   And this is admitted by everyone. Even the Biden administration  admits this. Everyone admits they don't stop transmission.   So what we are doing here is going against all science. We are going  against all freedom. We are taking the freedom away from our Senate  pages and their parents to make this decision. And we are actually  using faulty science. The two main vaccine committees that have looked  at this voted to recommend this for only people over 65, where the  evidence was that in that age group the risks of the disease were  greater than the risks of the vaccine. I acknowledge that.   For children, teenagers, for adolescents, it is the opposite. The  risks of the vaccine, while small, actually exceed the risk of the  disease, which are virtually zero, if not zero, for healthy kids.   And so I find it elitist. I find it the height of arrogance that some  people will want to make those decisions for others. In a free country,  each individual should be allowed to make these decisions. You  shouldn't have some nonscientist Senator coming forward and saying: You  must do as I tell you, particularly when all of the science actually  goes against that at this point.   But even if you disagreed with my point of view, I am not here to  tell you that you have to take my point of view. Go get a vaccine for  your kids if you want.   But the interesting thing is, people are smarter than you think they  are. If you look at the statistics on vaccines, there will be people  lamenting: Oh, if we only had more people vaccinated, we would have  done so much better.   It is, actually, really not true. Over age 65, it is somewhere  between 97 and 98 percent of people over 65 who chose to get  vaccinated. People read the news. People are smarter than you think.  People see someone their age dying, and they are like, I think I might  get vaccinated.   But do you know how many people are vaccinating their teenagers? It  is about 3 percent because people are reading the news that teenagers  don't die from this disease. They also know that kids probably had  COVID-19 already. They may have already had the test.   And what we do know from looking at millions of people in large  studies, that if you have had COVID, your protection from getting it  again or getting seriously ill is about 5 times better than the  vaccine.    Now, that is not an argument for not getting the vaccine if you are  in an elderly category or if you are in a high-risk category. But it is  certainly an argument against getting it if you are a young person and  you have already had COVID and now you are being forced to get this.   The other thing is, is the current Senate policy and page policy  isn't taking into account the fact that if one of the pages had COVID 2  weeks ago and now they want to be a page and we won't let them come up,  are they advising getting a vaccine if they only had COVID 2 weeks ago?  I don't think there is any allowance for that. That is actually against  medical advice to take a vaccine very quickly after you have already  had COVID, because their immune response is so extraordinary, they get  a heightened response. And that is when you get this overlap or  overlay, which causes an inflammation of the heart.   So what I would find today is that the Flat Earth Society still just  wants you to do as you are told. The Flat Earth Society doesn't believe  in your medical freedom. And, yes, we will come back--and I will  continue to come back--until some sense is finally jogged into the  minds of those who want you to blindly just do as they are told--do as  you are told, don't think about it, don't make your own decisions, do  as you are told.   I think that form of elitism and arrogance will eventually backfire  because there are a lot of people out there who made the decision that,  you know what, I am not vaccinating my child because it is still under  emergency use; it has some unknowns; and I know my kids have already  had COVID. And I don't see any kids dying from COVID unless they are  extraordinarily ill.   When the Senator says: Oh, they are the leading cause of death among  children, they all have significant other terminal illnesses. None of  them are healthy children dying from COVID.   Entire countries have released their statistics. There is even more  that the government is hiding from us, frankly. The vast majority of  people over 65 who took at least two vaccines: 97, 98 percent. So if  you have taken two vaccines and you have gotten COVID twice--which is  the average person over 65 because it doesn't stop transmission--you  have had two vaccines and COVID twice, what are your risks of going to  the hospital or dying?   That is what you want to know. Do you need to take a vaccine every 3  [[Page S5946]]  months? Do I want to keep being vaccinated? Tell me what the statistics  show, and I will make a rational decision based on that.   The CDC won't release this because the CDC, essentially, have become  salesmen for Big Pharma. They want you to get vaccinated.   Big Pharma is complaining they are not making enough money on the  vaccine because you are not rushing out to get another vaccine.   Wouldn't you want to know: Am I going to get sick and die if I  already had COVID twice and I have already had two vaccines?   They have the statistics. So all I ask for is there ought to be a  little more consideration for freedom. And I bring this up for the  Senate pages because I do care about their medical freedom. And I care  about their right to be left alone. And this is not the end of this  debate.    Madam President, I raise a point of order that section 7902  of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2670, the National Defense  Authorization Act, violates rule XXVIII.    During the 1960s, the FBI spied on Martin Luther King and  other civil rights protestors. The FBI spied on Vietnam war protesters.  The Church Committee was formed in the 1970s and detailed these abuses,  and the response by Congress was to pass something called the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. FISA was ostensibly passed to  limit spying on Americans. It was supposed to be a reform, but as far  as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allows government to spy  on U.S. citizens without a warrant, it is unconstitutional.   As Dr. John Tyler from Houston Christian University points out, ``the  FISA text, the Constitution's text, and the relevant opinions by the  U.S. Supreme Court conclusively demonstrated that FISA, and its secret,  ex parte''--meaning you only hear from one side of the court--these  ``courts are unconstitutional for three reasons.''   ``First, the secret, ex parte courts violate the case or controversy  requirement of Article III.''   Courts are about deciding disputes between two parties. They aren't  originated just to say: This is a pronouncement. There has to be a  dispute, and in the FISA Court, it is more about having a generalized  comment.   ``Second, FISA violates Fourth Amendment liberties from unreasonable  searches and seizures.''   ``Third, FISA and its secret ex parte courts violate the due process  guarantees of the 5th and 14th Amendments.''   Dr. Tyler goes on to say that ``lastly, the Supreme Court has ruled  that national security does not require secret courts or justify  ignoring the Fourth Amendment liberties.''   This unconstitutional government spying has been further authorized  by adding section 702 to FISA. That law entrusts America's intelligence  Agencies with broad authorities, supposedly to surveil foreigners  abroad. But time has proven, again and again, that America's  intelligence Agencies cannot be trusted with this immense power and  responsibility.   Section 702 expires at the end of this year. We have known this for 5  years, and yet somehow the Senate has no time to debate this and wishes  to simply extend it.   Members of Congress anticipated using this deadline as an opportunity  not just to make meaningful changes but to reform FISA generally to  better protect Americans' civil liberties, but it doesn't appear to be  allowed to happen at this point. Everything is rush, rush, rush; let's  pass it without debate. But they have known for 5 years that it was  going to expire at the end of this year, and yet they just want to punt  it with the hope that they will never have to debate it.   Extending this section 702 robs Congress of the ability to make  reforms now and likely robs Congress of the opportunity to make reforms  any time in the next year. That means that, once again, the  intelligence Agencies that ignore the constraints on their power will  go unaddressed and unpunished, and the warrantless surveillance of  Americans in violation of the Bill of Rights will continue.   Using 702, Americans' communications, content, and metadata is  inevitably swept up and kept in government databases without a warrant.  Law enforcement Agencies then access Americans' communications, once  again without a warrant. In other words, your texts, your emails, and  your phone calls are collected into this massive government database,  without a warrant, and then searched willy-nilly by thousands of  different employees without a warrant.   As Judge Andrew Napolitano points out, ``the Constitution requires  probable cause of a crime to be demonstrated to a judge before a judge  [grants] a warrant. That was the law of the land until FISA.''   But now FISA has set up a special court that meets in secret, the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and it  [[Page S5954]]  authorizes ``judges on that court to issue search warrants based on a  lower standard of probable cause.''   The Fourth Amendment says you have to prove to a judge probable cause  of a crime. This says you only have to prove probable cause of an  association with a foreign entity. This is contrary to the  Constitution. This is not the Fourth Amendment.   The Constitution requires that warrants be issued on probable cause  that a crime has been committed, but as Judge Napolitano makes clear,  ``FISA established probable cause of foreign agency.'' So it lowered  the standard. It is not probable cause of a crime. It is probable cause  of association with a foreign agency.   But even that standard ``morphed [down] into probable cause of  speaking to a foreign person,'' which then again morphed even further  down to ``probable cause of speaking to any person who has ever spoken  to a foreign person.'' All of that happened in secret and without  Congressional approval.   With this weakened standard to order surveillance, these FISA judges,  who meet in secret, grant 99.97 percent of all warrants. They are a  rubberstamp for whatever they want to do. The left-leaning Brennan  Center for Justice further explains why a law designed to protect the  Fourth Amendment has led to their dissolution.   The Brennan Center states that ``dramatic shifts in technology and  law has changed the role of the [FISA] Court since its creation in  1978.''   ``The fundamental changes not only erode Americans' civil liberties,  but [they] likely violate Article III of the U.S. Constitution, which  limits courts to deciding concrete disputes between parties rather than  issuing opinion on abstract questions.''   According to the Brennan Center, ``today's FISA Court does not  operate like a court at all, but more like an arm of the intelligence  establishment.''   ``The FISA Court's wholesale approval process also fails to satisfy  standards set forth by the Fourth Amendment, which protects against  warrantless searches and seizures.''   Some people issued prescient warnings about the destruction of civil  liberties and constitutional rights at the time. At the time, then- Senator Joe Biden stated that he was voting no on this section 702,  this expansion of FISA powers. Senator Joe Biden said it ``would be a  breathtaking and unconstitutional expansion of the President's powers  and it is wholly unnecessary to address the problems the administration  has identified.'' Then-Senator Biden added that he would ``not give the  President unchecked authority to eavesdrop on whomever he wants in  exchange for the vague and hollow assurance that he will protect the  civil liberties of the American people.''   Boy, I wish that Joe Biden were still around and remembering his  comments about FISA.   Patrick Eddington of the Cato Institute has dedicated his career to  exposing the abuses of surveillance authorities. He argues that section  702 of FISA and its predecessors comprise the ``biggest  unconstitutional mass surveillance dragnet in American history'' and  that ``we have documentary evidence from the federal government's own  records of repeated, systemic abuses'' of this authority.    Even the FISA Court itself, in 2018, held that the FBI's procedures  for accessing Americans' communications that are incidentally collected  under 702 violate both the statute and the Fourth Amendment. Even the  FISA Court, which rubberstamps these warrants like there is no going  away, says that they believe they are violating the Fourth Amendment.   But this warrantless surveillance on Americans goes on. In 2021  alone, the FBI conducted 3.4 million warrantless searches of Americans'  communications. Like the spying on Martin Luther King and Vietnam war  protesters, the FBI still targets individuals for their beliefs.   The FBI accessed the 702 database without search warrants to access  the information of 19,000 political donors. They accessed the records  of those involved with a protest on January 6. They accessed the  records of a Member of Congress and ``Black Lives Matter'' activists.   You might think, oh, I have got nothing to hide, no big deal. You  might think that if you avoid political activity, you can avoid the  long arm of the government.   But think again. If you call a merchant in England or text a family  member in Germany or email a friend in Israel, the feds can seize and  search your communications without permission, without a warrant, and  without due process.   But that is not all. The Federal spies can then capture all the  communications of the persons you subsequently reached out to and all  the persons they reached out to. It goes on and reaches its tentacles  out, such that it gathers millions of communications.   Imagine a Senator or a Congressman who talks to a Prime Minister  overseas. Their communication is in the database.   To allow this to happen--imagine all of the people who are in  international business and who make international phone calls. Their  phone calls are in the database.   And it would be one thing if we were just collecting this to look at  terrorist activities, but, no, we let the FBI search any American's  name in there. They can go in under any pretext.   We told the FBI: You have to list why you are searching the name. And  they didn't do it. They actually go around some of the rules by saying:  Oh, let's search 10,000 things and call it 1 query.   We cannot trust them. You cannot trust the fox to be in charge of the  henhouse. We need controls, and Congress needs to do their job.   We had 5 years to think about this. It comes up, and we are just  going to airdrop it in and say: Sorry. We haven't had time to think  about this. We don't have time to reform it. We don't care about  Americans' privacy.   That is what the majority, who will vote to just drop this in and  turn the other way, will do.   It would be bad enough if the FBI limited itself to eviscerating the  Fourth Amendment and indiscriminately collecting and searching the  private communications of millions of Americans, but it is far worse  than that.   As we all know, the FBI abused the immense power conferred to it by  FISA to subvert a Republican Presidential campaign. In its zeal to  investigate Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to Candidate Trump,  the FBI sought to obtain permission to conduct electronic surveillance  on Page, not by going to a real judge, in public, in an article III  court, but by going to a secret judge.   Imagine the chilling effect, if you can try to get beyond the  politics of whether he is a Republican or a Democrat. Imagine the  chilling effect of the government investigating political campaigns.  How could anybody think that that is a good idea?   To eavesdrop on Page, the FBI needed to get approval from the FISA  Court, not a real warrant but just a warrant that he was associated  with a foreign government. The secretive court that grants 99.97  percent of warrants gave it to them.   But the FBI also relied on information they were given by the Trump  opponent's campaign--Hillary Clinton's campaign. You have something  called the Steele dossier that was all over the news. That dossier was  given to the FBI by a political campaign. It was essentially opposition  research. Clinton's Presidential campaign and the Democrat Party  obtained the secret surveillance order by subterfuge.   But the FBI didn't verify or check the claims made in the dossier, as  it is required to do by law. To put it in plain English, the FBI was  able to spy on an American citizen because it presented the Democratic  Party's opposition research as evidence to obtain a secret order on a  campaign operative.   This was fraud. This was an abuse of power. This was an attempt to  undermine a Republican Presidential campaign.   People talk about election interference. My goodness, what could be  more of an interference in a campaign than getting a secret order from  your intelligence Agencies to spy on a political campaign.   The order was ultimately found to be misleading, and you would think  this would have led to scandal. You would think this would have led to  punishment, but no one, really, was ever punished for this.   Even the New York Times described the effort to wiretap Carter Page  as ``a  [[Page S5955]]  staggeringly dysfunctional and error-ridden process.''   But these are not errors. These are not honest mistakes. These are  abuses of power. The audacity to dupe and manipulate the secret FISA  Court demonstrates that the misconduct was not mere accident, but  rather demonstrates the arrogance that inevitably results when a  secretive, one-sided process all but assures these Agencies will never  be challenged.   And what are we doing? The Senate will sweep this under the rug. We  will have no reform. They have known for 5 years this is coming up, and  they are not going to do a thing to reform it.   Since the FBI demonstrated a willingness to evade the rules to spy on  an aide to a Presidential candidate, we should not be surprised that  Carter Page was far from the only victim of the abuse of FISA  authorities. A subsequent Department of Justice review reviewed 29  other FISA applications and found that each one contained factual  discrepancies and errors, at an average of 20 mistakes per application.   More recently, Special Counsel John Durham's report on the FBI's  probe into the alleged collusion between Donald Trump and Russia  revealed that at least some FBI agents abused America's surveillance  apparatus to open a groundless counterintelligence campaign against a  Republican Presidential candidate.   And yet despite the abuses, despite the years of calls for reform,  the Senate is presented with a defense bill that continues the status  quo. In 5 years, they have had no time to debate this because they  don't want to. They want to rubberstamp this, and they want to look the  other way. Not one reform is included in this conference report that  would address the neglect of the Bill of Rights. Rather, the only thing  this conference report ignores is the long record of abuse of the  Fourth Amendment.   The Fourth Amendment is no mere limitation of government power. The  Fourth Amendment is fundamental to the concept of American liberty.   Today, the elected representatives of our country, whose Founders  overthrew a King who claimed a mandate from Heaven to rule an empire,  cannot muster the courage to tell its own law enforcement Agencies that  we will not tolerate the evisceration of the Bill of Rights, nor the  destruction of our electoral process.   Why would any Senator vote to waive this point of order? How can you  look your constituents in the eyes and justify your vote to empower  government at the expense of American's individual rights?   Do not fall for the hollow and cynical retorts from the other side  who inevitably argue that the world is on fire. Those who make the lazy  and predictable argument that government is your only shield from  threats, always fail to mention that government itself is often a  threat.   I think it is high time we quit letting fear overrun our  constitutional duty. The Members of this body should do themselves the  honor of standing by their oath to the Constitution. To protect our  civil liberties and the integrity of the congressional conference  committee process, we must strip this extension of domestic spying  authority out of the Defense bill.    Madam President, I rise to honor a great Kentuckian,  Lloyd Kenneth Rogers, who passed away on December 8, 2023, at the age  of 90, following a recurrence of mantle cell lymphoma.   Lloyd was born on June 10, 1933, in Bracken County, KY. Early in his  life, he lost his father at a young age and spent time in an orphanage  with his brother. However, despite these humble beginnings and  challenges, he developed a resilience that would serve him well later  in life.   Lloyd was guided by his unwavering commitment to freedom and liberty.  He demonstrated this in his service with the U.S. Navy and later  through numerous leadership roles in his community. From his service as  judge executive of Campbell County, KY, to his role as director of  veteran Affairs for Congressman   Thomas Massie, to his advocacy of  legislative reform for veterans, Lloyd embodied service before self and  demonstrated his deep affection for this country and the men and women  of our armed services. He put the needs of those around him first, and  he never backed down when he believed he was fighting for what was  right.   Lloyd worked tirelessly to advocate for and encourage candidates for  public office that he believed in. In my first campaign, he spent  hours, braving all elements, putting up hundreds of signs supporting my  candidacy for Senate, and in 2016, he organized a nationwide veteran's  group for my Presidential campaign. I am grateful for the enthusiasm  and support he showed me throughout the years.   While we share in the great sadness of his passing, it is with great  joy we look back at his life, his many accomplishments, and the  positive impact he had on his community and Kentuckians across the  Commonwealth. We honor Lloyd and his family, and may he rest in  peace.                            ____________________
