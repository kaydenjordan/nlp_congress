 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I rise today because we must listen to  our children. Our children are calling out for us to take action to  address the epidemic of gun violence, which has spread to traditionally  safe places like schools, concert halls, movie theaters, and places of  worship.   Our children are growing up under the constant paranoia of gun  violence. Try, if you can, to imagine the depth of their fear and  anxiety. Nowhere is safe.   Last week, I visited seven schools in my district and spoke with  students who fear for their safety and stress over our inability to  take action on gun violence.   We are not even halfway through 2019, and there have already been 13  school shootings. Is there any mystery behind the student walkouts we  experienced last year in response to gun violence?   I was proud to support H.R. 8, back in March, in order to achieve  long-overdue universal background checks, a baseline measure to address  gun violence.   Now the Senate must act. I implore my colleagues in the Senate to  hear the young people of our country calling for change and to pass  H.R. 8. The time is now.                            ____________________
