 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to say what a pleasure it is to see  the Presiding Officer in the Chair and to know that, together, we have  the opportunity, the great privilege, to represent the greatest State  in America--the State of Colorado. And welcome to the Chamber. It is  great to have you here.                                S. Con. Res. 5    Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about our State. The last  time I was running for office, 2016, I remember I went to Rifle, CO,  which the Presiding Officer knows well, and I met there with a group of  moms who were showing off the early childhood center that was there. It  was newly created, and they were extremely happy to have it because  before that early childhood center was there, in order to get childcare  or early childhood education for their kids, these moms were having to  drive through the canyon to Glenwood Springs--about 35 miles away, I  guess, or so--and then go to work and then go back and pick their kid  up and bring them back. So they were very, very happy that it was  there.   But at a certain point during the conversation, one of the moms  looked at me, and she said: Michael, I work so I can have health  insurance. And every single dollar I make goes to pay for this early  childhood center so I can work--that triangle that she is trapped in  because of the compression of wages in this country that is a story  that millions of American families can tell about an economy that, for  50 years, has worked really well for the people at the very top but not  for anybody else.   Ninety percent of the American people, basically, for 50 years, have  not seen a pay increase in this country in real terms. That is terrible  for them, obviously, because they can't afford health care, housing,  higher education, or early childhood education. They feel like they  can't live a middle-class life or, if their kids are living in poverty,  they can't get their kids out of poverty.   It is a danger to our democracy because democracies do not do well  when prosperity is not shared and when you have one group of people at  the very top who are doing extremely well and everybody else is  struggling to get by, everybody else is struggling to get into the  middle class or stay in the middle class or lift their kids out of  poverty. That is where we have been as a country for a long time.   We have some of the lowest mobility rates of any industrialized  economy in the world, and it is taking its toll. It is taking its toll  on the American dream, and that is before COVID. COVID has made matters  much, much worse for families in our State--for families in urban parts  of the State and rural parts of the State.   Even before COVID hit, when people would ask me--I used to be the  superintendent of the Denver Public Schools--people would say: What has  changed in education since you were superintendent until now, what I  would tell people is mental health, mental health, mental health. That  is what teachers talk about in the meetings that I have with them--the  mental health of their students, the mental health of their families,  and their own mental health. It comes up in every single conversation  before class size, before how pitifully we pay teachers in this  country. We have to confront that as a country now, too, on to of  everything else.    And the economic inequality is greater. The folks who have been on  the frontlines during this pandemic have had the toughest time  economically of everybody. That is why I am so glad that the  administration has come with the package that they have to this floor,  $1.9 trillion--$1 trillion of which is direct aid to families and  another big piece of which is to support the public health  infrastructure in this country so that we can actually vaccinate people  in a timely way, so we can test people in a timely way, so we can  distribute PPE.   It has been shocking to see how poor the response has been from the  United States, a developed country unable to contend effectively with  this pandemic, and we have lost almost half a million Americans as a  result.   So that investment in our public health infrastructure--in effect,  the health force, like the one that Kirsten Gillibrand and I have  proposed--is something we desperately need if we are going to reopen  this economy quickly and if we are going to reopen schools and keep  them open.   There is one other piece of this I wanted to mention this morning on  the floor, and that is the provision in this bill that is based on the  work that I have done for many, many years with Senator Sherrod Brown  from Ohio. One bill is Bennet-Brown, and the other one is Brown-Bennet.  I love both of them the same, even though the order is different.   But the President has decided to include these bills in his package.  It is a dramatic increase to the child tax credit, a substantial  increase to what is called the childless earned-income tax credit, so  we will stop taxing working people into poverty, which is what we are  doing in this country today.   With the passage of the American Family Act, this child tax credit  alone, we will cut childhood poverty in the United States of America by  almost 50 percent. We will cut childhood poverty for Latino kids by 60  percent, for Black kids by more than 50 percent, for kids living in  Tribes by more than 60 percent without adding one bureaucrat to the  Federal Government, without creating one more program. Just by taking  the tax credit from $2,000 to $3,000, $3,600 for kids under the age of  6, by making it fully refundable, which means that the poorest people  in America who have been left out of this tax credit--23 or 25 million  children--now will have the benefit of the tax credit for the first  time, we will cut childhood poverty in this country by almost 50  percent. I can't think of anything that we could do that would better  recognize the structural nature of the challenges that the American  people are facing in this economy before COVID but, certainly, in the  wake of COVID.   I hope the proposal will be able to attract bipartisan support in  this Chamber, and that once we have done it, that we will make it  permanent, we will make it last, and that we will imagine that we could  live in a country in the United States of America that actually has  eradicated childhood poverty because it is no American's choice  [[Page S286]]  to be born poor. It is no child's choice to be born poor.   There are many things we can do to improve economic mobility in this  country, and I think that this new administration is going to create  the beginning of an era that is going to lead us to a place that, when  the economy grows, it grows for everybody--not just for people at the  very top--and that families can move themselves up through hard work,  save something for retirement, and leave something for the next  generation.   That is all anybody in this country has ever really wanted, and that  hasn't been true for most Americans for a very long time. This is the  beginning of change in that, and that is why this bill has my  enthusiastic support.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
