 Mr. Chair, H.R. 1 is not an all-of-the-above energy  bill that will help lower costs for Americans.   I rise today in opposition to this bill because it would worsen the  destructive effects of climate change and line the pockets of the  wealthy at the expense of the most vulnerable constituents in my  district.   Mr. Chair, my constituents are sick and tired of politicians in this  town using their positions of power to help corporations at the expense  of people.   Fossil fuel companies and the lobbyists want to lessen environmental  regulations so that they can pump massive amounts of greenhouse gases  into the atmosphere and cash in, all at the expense of the people.   In southwest Detroit, corporations continue to emit harmful and  unpleasant fumes around the low-income neighborhoods in the area. This  bill will help them continue to pollute and worsen environmental  injustice.   In my district, climate change has increased the rate and severity of  flooding. My constituents must endure property damage, water  contamination, and in some cases the loss of loved ones.   Last Congress, this body made historic changes by passing the  Inflation Reduction Act, reducing the pollution in our communities that  is disproportionately felt by low-income and disadvantaged communities.  We must not turn back.   I came to Congress to fight against bills like H.R. 1 because they  put my constituents directly at risk. It is absurd to lessen  environmental regulations at a time when corporations choose pollution  and profits over people. Please don't pass this disastrous bill.
