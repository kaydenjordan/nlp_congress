 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters and Chairman  DeFazio for their work.   Manufactured housing can be a critical tool to providing affordable  housing and a pathway to homeownership. But in Iowa, that option has  been abused by outside investors who have bought up mobile home parks  and promptly raised rents to Iowans by as much as 70 percent, and that  is simply unconscionable.   We must protect the residents in these communities and preserve these  homes as affordable housing. My amendment does exactly that. It  provides grants of up to $1 million for the good actors in this space  who will manage the community for the benefit of the residents for the  long term.   We all know that America needs more affordable housing, and we need  to do what we can to keep that now, not lose it to predatory landlords  who are solely looking out for their bottom line.   I urge the adoption of my amendment.
