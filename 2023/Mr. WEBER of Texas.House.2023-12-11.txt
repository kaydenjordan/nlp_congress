 Mr. Speaker, the reason we study the Bible is  because it is the history of God's creation of Earth starting in the  Book of Genesis and in the creation of man and his fall in Genesis  chapter 3.   Mr. Speaker, if you study the Bible, you will note that in Genesis  3:15, God promises to Adam and Eve that He will send someone to atone  for their sin. You might further note that God promises that the one  whom He will send will be wounded in the heel but that the atonement or  what I call the ``at one ment,'' which is to be one with God which is  Jesus, will crush the serpent or Satan's head.   Also note, Mr. Speaker, that He promises that the woman, or Eve's,  seed, will crush the head of Satan. This is the only time I know of in  God's Holy Word that the woman's offspring is referred to as the seed  because the term is usually for the offspring of men and not for women.   Understand the virgin birth: there was no man's seed involved with  the woman's pregnancy. It was the Holy Spirit of the living God. In  this way God was stating way back in the first book of the Bible that  Jesus was coming to atone for our sin.   Thousands of years later, Jesus shows up as prophesied by Isaiah in  Isaiah chapter 7 where under the influence of the Holy Spirit Isaiah  writes: Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign. Behold, a  virgin will conceive and bear a son and shall call His name Immanuel,  which is being interpreted as God with us.   This is the one in the New Testament whom John the Baptist pointed to  and said: Yes, this is the one.  [[Page H6808]]    Jesus did live a sinless life, and He did go to the cross to pay for  our sins. For me, he saved me on July 2, 1973, at 5:30 in the afternoon  in Pearland, Texas.   Jesus is the Holy One of Israel and the anointed one whom God uses to  save people from their sins.   That is why we study the Bible, Mr. Speaker. We pray for the peace of  Jerusalem. It is important to study the Bible. Merry Christmas.
