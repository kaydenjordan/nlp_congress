 Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleague, Mr. Lipinski, for  pulling this effort together this evening.   Mr. Speaker, climate change is real, and I applaud my colleagues on  the Climate Solutions Caucus for working together in a bipartisan  effort to try and find common ground and to seek to work together to  pass legislation to address this very real threat.   I believe the greatest opportunity we have here is to include efforts  to move our Nation toward a greener economy as part of a comprehensive  infrastructure bill.   We must address climate change for three reasons: first, the Earth is  part of the divine creation, and we have an obligation to preserve and  protect our precious gift; second, moving toward a green economy that  retrofits homes and buildings and installs solar and wind farms will  create good jobs at good wages that simply cannot be exported; and,  third, the main topic I wish to address this evening, is moving toward  a green economy, reducing our dependency on foreign oil, and addressing  climate change is essential to our national security.                                time  2030    Americans rarely talk about it and sometimes forget, but we supported  Osama bin Laden against the Russians in Afghanistan. We supported  Saddam Hussein in Iraq after we lost the Shah after the Iranian  Revolution. We supported the Assads in Syria. And we still maintain a  close relationship with the Saudis, despite their support for  Wahhabism. Why? Because our national economic strategy and security has  relied for decades on access to foreign oil.   Our meddling in local affairs to ensure the oil spigot flowed freely  has sowed distrust across generations throughout the Middle East.   By moving towards a green economy and eliminating our dependence on  foreign oil, we can clearly say to the Middle East: We never wanted  your land, we never wanted your money, and now we don't need your oil.  All we want is for people of the region to stop trying to kill each  other. It will take some time, but moving towards an economy  independent of foreign oil is the best way to get there.   In addition to eliminating our dependence on foreign oil, we must try  to stall the rapid rise in extreme weather events, droughts, and  desertification that is destabilizing huge swaths of the Middle East  and Africa. The number of refugees in the world has grown from 35  million only 10 years ago to 65 million today. War and violence are  exacerbated by the instability caused by climate change.   One of the most violent regions in the world today is Syria. The  instability in Syria began with droughts that destroyed the livelihoods  of the Syrian people that rely upon an economy which is 85 percent  agrarian. When people lost their farms, they fled to the cities looking  for work, but, of course, they could not find it. Then they looked to  the Assad government, but, of course, were ignored. Fomented by the  Arab Spring, they began to revolt. The result? The Syrian Government  has killed almost a half million of its own people and millions more  refugees. This story is being repeated throughout the region.   Although the people suffering are thousands of miles away from the  United States, our national security is threatened by these failing  states. The rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq is a prime example of the  impact of failed states on Western security. Mass migrations by those  seeking to alleviate suffering, millions seeking political and economic  reforms place pressure on corrupt and incompetent governments that are  unable to respond to the needs of a population seeking opportunity and  hope.   Our enemies who wish to foment instability--Russia, Iran, North  Korea, and violent terrorist factions--are aided by the effects of  climate change and the instability it causes. We must do everything we  can to stall the growth of this nefarious trend.  [[Page H8379]]    The good news is that there is a growing bipartisan consensus in the  Climate Solutions Caucus and the armed services community that we must  act. The Armed Services Committee in the 2008 National Defense  Authorization Act acknowledged that ``climate change is a direct threat  to the national security of the United States,'' and that ``the  Department of Defense must ensure that it is prepared to conduct  operations both today and in the future, and that it is prepared to  address the effects of changing climate on threat assessments,  resources, and readiness.''   Secretary of Defense Mattis has said, ``Climate change can be a  driver of instability, and the Department of Defense must pay attention  to the potential adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon.''   Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford has said  that climate change and rising sea levels pose serious long-term  threats to the country. The number of natural disasters will increase  in the coming years, along with ``the requirement for humanitarian  assistance'' and the response required for the military for civilian  disasters.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank again my colleagues for the work that  they have done to try and bring the issue of climate change to the  American people, and to try and find solutions to this very real  problem that is not only affecting us here at home, but our national  security throughout the world.
