 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for his  leadership and for yielding time.   I also want to recognize Congressman Kennedy for his tremendous  leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 124, rejecting the  President's discriminatory ban on openly transgender servicemembers in  the military.   Transgender servicemembers have served with honor and distinction in  the defense of our country for decades, yet President Trump announced  on Twitter that transgender servicemembers would no longer be allowed  to serve, despite the fact that many military leaders concluded that  being transgender does not impact our readiness. President Trump's own  Chief of Staff said he hadn't received any reports of problems with  unit cohesion or morale regarding transgender servicemembers.   The President's cowardly ban makes it clear that prejudice, not  patriotism, guides his decisions.   As the daughter of a career military officer who served in a  segregated military, I know what it is like for our country to betray  our American values. As a person of faith, I was taught to treat  everyone equally. As an African American woman, I will fight  discrimination wherever it surfaces.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution.
