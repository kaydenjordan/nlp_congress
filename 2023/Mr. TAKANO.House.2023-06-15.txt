 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the director of  Riverside County Department of Veterans' Services, Mr. Grant Gautsche,  on the eve of his retirement from public service.   Grant, a United States Navy veteran himself, has selflessly attended  to veterans throughout California's 39th Congressional District, as  well as the entire County of Riverside and beyond for the past 25 years  with esteemed honor.   Since beginning with the County of Riverside in 2014, Grant has  served local veterans, their dependents, and their loved ones in  obtaining the resources, guidance, and benefits entitled to them. He  has worked closely with my district office, ensuring those who have  bravely put their lives on the line receive the recognition and care  they deserve.   Grant's hard work and devotion are a testament to the way we should  all express gratitude to our Nation's veterans, and his retirement is  well deserved.                            ____________________
