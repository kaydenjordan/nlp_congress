 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ensure  Sarah Keys Evans' name is engraved in history forever.   We are taught about Rosa Parks, but Sarah Keys Evans' story occurred  well before Ms. Parks, and please allow me to share with you her story.   Mr. Speaker, it was August 1, 1952, when Ms. Evans, an enlistee in  the Women's Army Corps, boarded a bus for Washington, North Carolina,  on leave from Fort Dix to visit her parents.   It was a long trip, so she took the most comfortable seat she could  find. However, the bus driver demanded Ms. Evans give up her seat. When  she refused, the police took her into custody where she spent 13 hours  in jail in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, and paid a $25 fine for  disorderly conduct.   I recently introduced a bill that would honor Sarah Keys Evans with a  Congressional Gold Medal, an honor she is more than deserving of.  Indeed, she is a trailblazer, and this is a significant part of not  only women's history but American history.                            ____________________
