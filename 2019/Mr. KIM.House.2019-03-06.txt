 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the efforts in  Congress to clean up our democracy and deliver power back to the  American people.   I never thought that I would run for Congress. I never thought that I  would have the chance to stand right here on the floor of the House of  Representatives.   I am here today because I was tired of watching corporations and  special interests cutting to the front of the line ahead of the people.  I was tired of watching dark money grow, gerrymandering polarize our  politics, and the American people pushed aside.   Now we have a precious chance to fix this and to build the kind of  government the American people deserve. As we make up our minds and  cast our votes, I ask us not to think of this as a partisan issue. I  assure you that the people in my district on both sides believe that  the system isn't working for them.   I call on my colleagues to vote to pass H.R. 1 and deliver the change  our constituents demand and deserve.                            ____________________
