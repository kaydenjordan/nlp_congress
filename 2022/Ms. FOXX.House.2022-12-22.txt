 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Jerry Brooks, the chief  of the Clemmons Volunteer Fire Department in Forsyth County, North  Carolina. At the end of this month, Jerry will be retiring after 51  years of service to the Clemmons community.   Everyone who knows Jerry can attest to the caliber of his character,  his unwavering servant's heart, and his profound love for our great  country.   Since the September 11 attacks, Jerry has led the Clemmons Volunteer  Fire Department in honoring those who lost their lives that day by  displaying a magnificent 40- by 60-foot American flag every year.   Madam Speaker, I consider Jerry Brooks to be a true patriot in every  sense of the word.   I congratulate Jerry on his well-earned retirement. May God bless  him, his wonderful wife, Karen, and his entire family as he enters this  next chapter of his life.                            ____________________
