 Mr. President, I have listened to some of my colleagues  from across the aisle decry our desire to repeal and replace ObamaCare.  Yes, I do want to repeal and replace ObamaCare.   Why? Why are we doing this?   Repealing and replacing ObamaCare is a means to an end. This is what  I have heard from so many Montanans. Here is the end, and I will sum it  up into three items: No. 1, to lower costs; No. 2, to ensure that we  save Medicaid--protect Medicaid--for the most vulnerable in our  society; and, No. 3, to ensure that we protect those with preexisting  conditions.   Some of my friends across the aisle want to see more government  control of families' healthcare decisions--in fact, a complete  government takeover. I believe that we need less government control,  not more government control. Their gold standard for healthcare reform  is really socialized medicine. It is called various things. Some call  it government-run healthcare. Some call it single-payer healthcare.  Some call it Medicare for all. But, in essence, it is socialized  medicine.   The amendment that I am putting forward today is cut-and-pasted text.  It is the exact, precise language. It is a carbon copy--down to every  last comma and period--of Representative John Conyers' bill, who is the  Representative from Michigan, which has 115 Democratic cosponsors as I  speak. It is an impressive 60 percent of the Democratic caucus in the  U.S. House that supports and, in fact, has cosponsored this very bill-- this very amendment--that I am putting on the floor here today.   In addition to the 115 House Members, who on the Senate side supports  this bill? Well, moveon.org has circulated a petition in support of the  Conyers' bill, and the bill has been endorsed by hundreds and hundreds  of labor groups, medical groups, political groups, and civic  organizations.   Let me be clear. I believe that socialized medicine would be a  disaster for the American people. Last November, the American people  voted to make America great again, not to make America like England  again. Yet I believe that Montanans and the American people deserve to  see us debate different ideas right here on the Senate floor. This is  referred to as the greatest deliberative body in the world. Well, let's  deliberate, including the leading idea coming from the other side of  the aisle, which is why I have offered this amendment.  [[Page S4369]]         Yes, Mr. Chairman.    Yes, Mr. Chairman.    For those who are watching and observing, it is H.R. 676.  There are 115 Democratic cosponsors on that bill as we speak.    It is the Conyers' bill. I did not write this amendment-- this bill--that I am offering. We cut and pasted the precise text and  are bringing it over here and offering it today.    Mr. Chairman, in preparing this and in reading this bill,  for those who want to see the heart and soul--the vision--of the  Democrats, they can be found in this first paragraph of the bill. In  fact, I will read it. ``The bill establishes the Medicare-for-all  program to provide all individuals residing in the United States free  healthcare.''    It goes on to say a couple of paragraphs later: ``Health insurers may  not sell health insurance that duplicates the benefits provided under  this bill.''   If that is not a complete takeover of the healthcare system from the  government, then you tell me what is.    It is in the opening paragraphs of the bill, the preamble  part.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree with you. That is what I  am planning to do today.   I ask unanimous consent for an additional 6 minutes of debate equally  divided between the managers or their designees.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    As the chairman, the Senator from Kansas, just mentioned,  I believe that Montanans and the American people deserve to see us  debate different ideas. That is why I brought this amendment to the  floor today.   Earlier today, a couple of hours ago, my colleague from Vermont,  Senator Bernie Sanders, was on the Senate floor suggesting that my  amendment is intended to embarrass Democrats.   Senator Sanders, my amendment shouldn't embarrass anyone. I am trying  to show the American people--bring it out here in full light--who is  supportive of socialized medicine and who is not. If you are supportive  of that, why be embarrassed?   The Senator from Vermont announced that he wouldn't support the  amendment unless I voted for the amendment myself. But let me be clear.  I don't support socialized medicine. Senator Sanders does. It is time  to fish or to cut bait. Why are Senators on the other side of the aisle  running for the hills when they now have the chance to vote on the gold  standard bill their party supports?   Senator Sanders and the Democrats who support Representative Conyers'  bill shouldn't be dependent on my support. Senator Sanders said he  would vote for it if I voted for it. Guess what. Tell the American  people what you think. I think we should vote no on this. What say you?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?   If no one yields time, the time will be equally divided.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing Skip Walters of Great Falls for a tremendous radio  broadcasting career. Last week, Skip retired after providing over four  decades of entertainment to his fellow Montanans. It was great to be  interviewed by Skip on several occassions; he was always professional  and never pulled any punches.   Skip originally came to Montana while serving our Nation in the U.S.  Air Force during the early 1970s, and his media journey began in Miles  City on the same weekend as the annual Bucking Horse Sale in 1976.  During his early days in Custer County, he broadcast mostly rock-and- roll tunes and covered local sports, on KATL radio for the folks in  eastern Montana. Three years later, an opportunity in his industry  brought Skip to Great Falls. It was in Great Falls that Skip would  further refine his skills by broadcasting country music to the  listeners in Cascade County and the surrounding communities of central  Montana. His 41-year career in the radio business culminated at KMON  radio in Great Falls, where he broadcast for 27 years.   Among his accomplishments, Skip was recognized in 2008 by the  Journalism Education Association as a ``Friend of Scholastic  Journalism.'' When asked about the circumstances that inspired him to  begin a career in radio, Jim stated ``it's all about the music.''  Skip's love of music has been an acoustic blessing to many in the  Treasure State.   From helping to guard the intercontinental ballistic missile fields  in the center of the State, to broadcasting good tunes across an even  larger swath of the State, Skip has had a good journey. As he begins to  enjoy his retirement, I would like to offer my thanks for his service  to our Nation and appreciation for the artistic entertainment he  provided to our State.                            ____________________
