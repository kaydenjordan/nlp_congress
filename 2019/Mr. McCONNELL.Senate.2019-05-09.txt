 Mr. President, the Senate has continued to make  significant progress in the personnel business. After 2 years of  systematic heel-dragging from our friends across the aisle, even on the  least controversial nominations, the modest reform the Senate adopted  last month is helping us to get back on track.   Another slate of capable nominees is now on its way to work for the  American people. They are precisely the same sort of unobjectionable  sub-Cabinet nominees who, until very recently, would have been  subjected to 30 hours of debate. They would have tied up the floor for  days before being confirmed anyway. They are perfect examples of why  the Senate returned to our longstanding norms of processing lower level  nominations. Now the American people are getting the government they  elected at a more reasonable pace.   To be clear, the silly partisan games haven't all been cleared away  from our work on nominations. For example, just yesterday, we confirmed  Judge Joseph Bianco to serve on the Second Circuit by a relatively  close vote of 54 to 42. Remember, for a judge, in the scope of Senate  history, that counts as a close shave. So are we looking at a  controversial person? Are we looking at an individual whom the Senators  agonized over and painstakingly studied?   Judge Bianco brings a unanimous ``well-qualified'' rating from the  ABA, and he has already served as a judge for 13 years in the Eastern  District of New York. Oh, by the way, he was confirmed to that position  by a voice vote. In fact, back then in 2005, one of Mr. Bianco's most  vocal supporters in the Senate was none other than our friend the  Democratic leader. Here is how he praised his New Yorker to the  Judiciary Committee in 2005.   Senator Schumer said: ``I am proud to support someone as  outstandingly qualified and well respected as Mr. Bianco.''   Well, that was then and this is now.   The nominee is the same. Actually, he is not quite the same because  now he has been a very highly regarded district judge for 13 years, so  this nominee is actually even better. Yet the occupant of the White  House is different. In this political moment, as we know, my Democratic  colleagues' commitment to the ``outrage industrial complex'' seems to  crowd out reasonable judgment.   So now, this week, the Democratic leader lumped the same individual  he used to champion into what he described as ``hard-right nominees.''  Then the Democratic leader and almost every other Member of his  conference proceeded to vote against him. He voted against the same  nominee he praised in such generous terms before.   I can only conclude that now the ``outrage industrial complex'' comes  first, not the facts, not the nominee's qualifications. The ``outrage  industrial complex'' comes first. The individual whom the Democratic  leader used to champion and who passed by a voice vote in 2005 now  receives this partisan treatment. What was once a routine matter for  acclamation becomes a party-line vote just because this President is  the one who nominated him.   Look, fortunately, at the end of the day, the outcome is the same.  Judge Joseph Bianco, along with a slate of other well-qualified  nominees, is now on the job, and the Republicans will  [[Page S2752]]  continue our work to give the people the government they chose, the  government they deserve.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, as I mentioned, we  are in the middle of a historic economic moment for the American  people.   Last week, the nationwide unemployment rate fell to its lowest level  since December of 1969. In just the year and a half since the  Republicans passed comprehensive tax reform, 19 States have set new  alltime lows in their unemployment rates, including in the Commonwealth  of Kentucky.   If you compare today to November 2016, there are now nearly 70  percent more job openings in durable goods manufacturing and more than  twice as many job openings in construction. We are talking about  hundreds of thousands of new job openings in these sectors alone.   Overall, under the Republicans' policies of the last 2 years, for the  first time in recorded history, the number of job openings across the  country has surpassed the number of Americans who are looking for work.  Think about that. There is more than one job opening for every American  who wants a job.   So this economic moment, helped along by Republican policies, has  placed American workers in much higher demand, and we know what happens  when American workers are in high demand--they get paid more. Sure  enough, from late 2017 to late 2018, wage growth for U.S. workers  logged its fastest full-year growth rate in a decade.   What is more, the New York Times reported:         The recent gains are going to those who need it most. Over       the past year, low-wage workers have experienced the fastest       pay increases, a shift from earlier in the recovery, when       wage growth was concentrated at the top.    Of course, that phrase ``earlier in the recovery'' is code for during  the Obama administration.   How often do we hear the left invoke the stale talking point that  pro-growth policies only help wealthy people? Anyone who has cracked  open a history book knows it is absurd to say that American free  enterprise only helps wealthy people and that State-controlled  socialism helps everyone else. Anyone who has picked up a newspaper in  the last year and a half knows it as well.   Capitalism and free enterprise are the best tools humanity has ever  discovered for lifting up the vulnerable and for empowering people. It  was true in the 19th century; it was true in the 20th century; and it  is still proving to be true in 2019.   It has been on the Republicans' watch that we have actually seen low- wage workers and nonmanagement workers receive the fastest wage growth.  It has been on the Republicans' watch that the unemployment rate  specifically for Americans without high school diplomas has fallen to  its lowest rate since 1992. It has been on the Republicans' watch that  newspapers have described ``a wave of disabled Americans'' who have  been able to join or return to the workforce.   My Republican colleagues and I could not be more proud of the  conditions our policies have helped to create for all kinds of American  workers and their families, and we will continue to defend these gains,  to put pro-growth, pro-opportunity reforms in place, and to stand up  against the far-left grab bag of socialist ideas that would threaten  America's progress.
