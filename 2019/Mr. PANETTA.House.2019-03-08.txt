 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1 so that  more Americans can exercise their right to vote.   On election day of last year, voters in my district on the central  coast of California set a new record for turnout in a midterm election.   In San Benito County, we saw one of the highest increases in the  State for folks registering to vote.   In Monterey County, the majority of registered voters voted by  absentee ballot and by mail. These are servicemembers who filled out  their ballot from where they were stationed and also folks at home who  could take time to thoughtfully cast their vote.   Unfortunately, on that same election day, voters around this country  didn't have that opportunity, and they had to go to polling places  where they faced malfunctioning voting machines and found their  registration frozen or purged.   These instances left thousands of citizens without a vote and without  a voice in our democracy. That is why we need to pass H.R. 1.   The most important persons in our democracy are not those who hold  office, but it is those educated and informed voters who put us in  office. Let's give those types of voters more opportunity to  participate in our democracy and pass H.R. 1.                            ____________________
