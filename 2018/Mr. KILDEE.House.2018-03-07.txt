 Mr. Speaker, like my friend Mr. Perlmutter and my friend  Mr. Huffman and others, we didn't come to the Congress with the idea  that we were going to spend our time talking about Russian collusion  with a campaign to try to undermine our electoral system. We came here  to solve problems that Americans want us to take on, to deal with the  big problems that we face, whether it is infrastructure or education or  the environment or all the things that people actually worry about,  financial security for families.   But we do have an obligation to uphold the oath that we took. We  swore an oath to the Constitution of the United States. So while it is  not my preference, and I know from my friends it is not our preference  to have to deal with this question, we can't avoid it. We can't just  look the other way, particularly when it is very clear that not just  this President, but, sadly, some around him; and I think we have to  acknowledge some of our Republican colleagues seem willing to try to  interfere with or obfuscate what is a really important investigation.   Let's remind ourselves, Mr. Mueller, who is leading this  investigation, the special counsel, was appointed by the Republican  Attorney General, appointed by the President of the United States, both  Republicans. Bob Mueller  [[Page H1474]]  was appointed head of the FBI by a Republican President.   This is not a partisan question, certainly not a partisan witch hunt.  This is a question as to whether or not we are going to let this  investigation go to completion.   The President keeps saying no collusion. The truth of the matter is,  so far, there has been no conclusion. There is no conclusion to be  drawn yet from this investigation, other than 17 individuals have been  indicted. Several have pled guilty to very serious crimes, some people  who have been very close to the President of the United States, the  closest you can be, literally engaged in his campaign, side by side  with him every day.   So it begs the question and, really, the most important question:  What are they afraid of? What do they have to worry about?   If there is nothing to find, if there is no collusion, then let's let  the process complete itself. Let's let the process come to conclusion  and accept the result.   So this is really a fundamental question to our democracy: Are we  going to adhere to the rule of law, or are we going to allow a  President to rule by fiat and, essentially, dismiss or diminish or  discredit anyone who raises any question about his conduct coming into  or performing his duties?                                time  1745    That is not the America that we know, and that is not a standard that  we ought to allow: 17 people indicted, people at the top of his  campaign, including a whole group of Russians who clearly were engaged  in trying to affect our election.   You know, don't you remember the good ol' days? I think about some of  our friends on the other side, when the biggest scandal that they could  come up with was that the President of the United States wore a tan  suit. The outrage. Where is the outrage now when a special counsel has  been appointed and, at every moment, there is an attempt to try to  discredit the work that this individual is doing?   So I ask my Republican colleagues to stand up, adhere to the oath  that they swore, support this process, allow for your own good and the  good of the country, allow the investigation to be completed without  interference. Push back when the President tries to discredit this  process. There is just too much at stake. What are they afraid of? What  are they worried about?   This guy is a professional. When he was appointed, remember the  chorus of praise left, right, and center for Bob Mueller and the  integrity with which he has conducted himself in public life. He didn't  change. He is still doing that. Let's let him do his work.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Perlmutter for yielding, and I  want to just underscore a point he made in his opening remarks.   This is fundamentally about a principle that we hold pretty dear in  this country, and, that is, our freedom. Our freedom is rooted in the  assumption that our democratic systems actually work, that the process  of democracy has integrity, and that the choices that people make are  not the subject of interference by some foreign power.   We know that Russia interfered in our elections. There are only two  people I can think of who have denied that repeatedly. One of them is  President Trump; the other one is Vladimir Putin. Everyone else,  including our Republican colleagues and our intelligence community,  acknowledges that the Russians interfered with our elections.   Five people have acknowledged that they committed crimes as a result  of the investigations taking place; 12 other--15 others indicted. Why  on Earth would we not allow the investigation that is taking place  right now to determine the extent of that interference in order to  prevent it from ever happening again? Why would we not insist that we  protect that principle of democracy and that foundational principle of  freedom by letting this process complete? What are they afraid of? That  is the question: What are they afraid of?   That is why I am glad Mr. Perlmutter initiated this effort, and I  will continue to stand with him as he does it.
