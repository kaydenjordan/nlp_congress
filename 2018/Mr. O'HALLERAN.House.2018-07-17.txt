 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support and urge  passage of my legislation, H.R. 4032, the Gila River Indian Community  Federal Rights-of-Way, Easements and Boundary Clarification Act.   I was proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation along with  colleagues Congressmen Biggs, Gallego, and Gosar.   Mr. Speaker, as we all know, Tribal Nations were here prior to the  formation of the United States. However, throughout history, many  Federal laws were enacted that diminished land holdings and, as a  result, reservation boundaries were often incorrectly adjusted.   The Federal Government often lacked the mechanisms to effectively  keep track of the various rights-of-way that existed on Tribal lands.  These challenges remain today and can be serious barriers to Tribal  land use efforts for housing, economic development, and cultural  purposes.   That is why I introduced my bill, which simply finalizes the  settlement of longstanding issues related to the Federal Government's  management of Tribal trust assets on the Gila River Indian Community.                                time  1815    The legislation provides for surveys of all the Federal rights-of-way  on the reservation and establishes a map of those rights-of-way to aid  the community in planning land use, including building homes,  rebuilding schools, locating businesses, and ensuring access to  cultural sites.   H.R. 4032 also clarifies the northwest boundary of the reservation,  which will avoid a title dispute with the city of Phoenix. In exchange  for giving up lands that are currently within the reservation boundary,  the community will be able to purchase 3,400 acres of culturally  relevant lands from the Bureau of Land Management and have those lands  taken into trust.   H.R. 4032 is important to the Gila River Indian community, to local  landowners, and nearby communities.   I would like to thank my colleagues across the aisle for supporting  this legislation, as well as the chairman and ranking member. I look  forward to working with my colleagues in Congress and the  administration to ensure this settlement is fully implemented.   On behalf of our Arizona communities, I urge my colleagues to support  this commonsense, necessary legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, Arizona's First Congressional District is  home to the largest population of Native Americans and Indian lands in  the Nation.   Many of the Tribal governments that I represent face a public safety  crisis. Nearly every Tribal community I visit is caught in the justice  facility backlog, and it is having a serious impact on their ability to  protect and serve their communities.   The backlog in unmet need for Tribal justice facilities has grown  significantly since fiscal year 2014, when the Department of Justice  unilaterally stopped new and replacement construction of Tribal justice  buildings. All the while, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has kept  condemning these types of buildings. This negligent lack of Federal  coordination between agencies has resulted in communities being forced  to go without essential infrastructure.   Tribal justice officials dedicate and risk their lives to provide  basic law and order in Native American communities. However, as a  former police officer, I can tell you, no justice system can function  without a safe and secure facility to house these officers.   The San Carlos Apache Tribe's justice system is a devastating example  of the backlog for justice facilities in Indian Country.   The BIA condemned the San Carlos Police and Courts Building known as  BIA Building 86 in 2009. The Tribal police officers and courts worked  for 6 additional years in a condemned building, until the Bureau of  Indian Affairs provided them with temporary trailers, which had been  intended to be used as classrooms and temporary housing in 2015.   Here we are, 3 years later, and this temporary fix is failing the San  Carlos police and courts, as well as the entire community. The San  Carlos Police Chief works in an office with cracks in the wall where he  can see outside. The generator doesn't provide air conditioning to the  police patrol or court sessions of trailers, and that is in Arizona.  Water service is intermittent. There is not enough space for evidence  storage. The floors can't securely support storage safes that include  cash, drugs, and other evidence. I can go on and on.   It is clear that it is past time to provide the San Carlos Apache  Tribe, and Tribes across the country, a permanent facility to safely  house their police and courts.                                time  2115    I commend Appropriations for providing $18 million for replacement of  new public safety and justice construction.   My amendment demonstrates the reality that the need is greater. It  suggests a funding level of $36 million divided between replacement and  new construction. This would help provide for the needs of communities  like San Carlos, who have had their police and court facilities  condemned by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.   Every law enforcement officer at the local, State, Tribal, and  Federal levels risk their lives to protect and serve their community.  If we can't give them the basic tools to do their jobs, our communities  risk safety and justice for victims. We must do better.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment on behalf of  these brave law enforcement officials, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I just want to thank the chair and the  ranking member for all their commitment to Indian Country and for their  support of this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, across Indian Country, access to safe and  clean drinking water is a major issue that we are obligated to address.   In the northwest corner of my district, the Hopi Tribe has a water  system with over three times the Federal maximum standard for safe  drinking water for arsenic. Let me repeat that: three times the amount  of arsenic than the maximum standard considered safe.   Members of the Tribe have no choice but to use this unsafe water.  This is beyond unacceptable in any community in America, but it is a  fact of life for Tribes across the Nation.   No matter where you are born, no child or family in America should  have to risk their health because they can't access clean water.   This basic lack of water infrastructure has limited many Tribes'  ability to unleash their economic potential in rural communities across  the country.   The Hopi Tribe has limited financial resources. In fact, it has an 80  percent unemployment rate. Our country's unemployment rate is 4  percent. It also has a mine that is potentially going to close that  supplies 80 percent of its general funds.   They have not sat idly waiting for the Federal Government to fix the  problem it created. The Tribe has launched the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation  Project to directly address this challenge.   Through the project, the Tribe has identified arsenic-free wells and  mapped the pipeline route that will deliver arsenic-free water to  villages and towns across the reservation. All the Tribe needs to  complete the project is construction funding.   Unfortunately, funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs Construction  account has not been adequate enough to fund projects across country  like Hopi's. That is why I am offering a commonsense amendment to  increase BIA's construction funding by $10 million.   Increasing this funding for construction of water infrastructure will  enable the BIA to assist communities in building water systems that  will deliver clean drinking water to schools and homes, some for the  first time.   This amendment is not only a wise investment for Tribal communities  as they seek to develop their economies and attract investment, but it  is also a moral imperative.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to increase  access to clean water for tribal communities across the country.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I understand that this bill increases the  BIA Construction funding levels from last year, but I must remind the  gentleman that this program is still woefully underfunded considering  the tremendous needs across the West and in rural communities.   Although I believe this amendment's offset is reasonable considering  the basic immediate and dire needs of tribes across the country, I  appreciate the gentleman's comments and I hope he will commit to  working with me on a bipartisan basis going forward on this amendment  to ensure our communities have meaningful access funding for clean  water.   I clearly understand the impacts potentially to the Bureau, but I  also understand that when you have 80 percent unemployment and the risk  of losing 80 percent of your general fund, that there is no other  alternative than to look for money here, and I would appreciate  consideration in the future.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the Office of Navajo-Hopi Indian  Relocation was established to compensate and build homes for those  Navajo and Hopi impacted by the Federal Government's mandated changes  of the reservation boundaries, which resulted in families being forced  to move away from their homes.   My amendment opposes efforts in the underlying bill to prematurely  close the Office of Navajo-Hopi Indian Relocation. The bill  significantly cuts this office while preparing for its premature  closure. I strongly oppose these cuts.   The agency has not completed its mission, and families continue to  wait for the benefits they were promised. Closing the agency without  providing the benefits to the affected families entitled to them would  be a violation of our trust responsibility.   Once the agency's mission is complete, it is essential that the  remaining land management responsibilities are passed to capable and  responsible agencies that will work with stakeholders to ensure that  the trust responsibility is taken seriously.   For this to occur, a comprehensive plan must be developed, and the  plan must include meaningful input from both the Navajo Nation and the  Hopi Tribe, and a thorough audit of the Office of Navajo-Hopi Indian  Relocation.   I have concerns that preliminary discussions that have the Office of  the Special Trustee assuming land management are premature, as the  Office of the Special Trustee has no experience with land management or  building housing.   While the details of the closure plan are worked out, it makes sense  to continue funding the agency, so it can finish its mission and an  orderly and agreeable closure plan can be developed.   The families impacted by relocation have suffered enough, and we have  a responsibility to ensure that we solve the problem in an orderly way,  not simply shift the responsibility.   My amendment simply shifts the funds that were provided to the Office  of the Special Trustee, to assume land management responsibilities,  back to the Office of Navajo-Hopi Indian Relocation where it can be  used to build homes and review appeals until the agency mission is  complete or a comprehensive closure plan is developed with significant  Tribal input.   I thank the chairman and ranking member for their interest in this  important issue, and I look forward to continuing to work with them  toward a resolution that keeps the promises made and is inclusive of  all impacted parties.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I have personally gone around this  process for a long time now, both before I came to Congress and during  my tenure in Congress.   We have hundreds of families who still are in an appeals process. We  have homes throughout both reservations that are simply in a  deteriorated state. This is not spending more money. It is shifting  money from one agency to another to allow us to continue to make sure  that the needs of this relocation project are met.   The time limit of 5 years was extended time and time again because of  the technical nature of this process and the difficulty in our mandated  process to make this a whole system that worked. It hasn't worked. It  needs to be worked on, but not until we have a comprehensive plan.  There is no comprehensive plan. There is just an idea and a concept,  but no comprehensive plan.   I will be glad to work with anybody on a comprehensive plan, but the  idea that we just walk away from this right now without an agency that  really knows what it is doing makes no sense at all.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out the Navajo and  the Hopi have indicated precisely what  [[Page H6451]]  they want to do. They need the time to be able to recognize that there  is a comprehensive plan for their future and the families that are  impacted. It is not in place.   Mr. Chair, I request that my amendment be accepted, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
