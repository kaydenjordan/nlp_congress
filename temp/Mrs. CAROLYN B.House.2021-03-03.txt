 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on  behalf of New York's renters and the far-too-many families who are  struggling as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.   Hardworking New Yorkers who have lost their jobs and closed their  businesses, through no fault of their own, now are struggling, too, to  pay their rent.   The American Rescue Plan would provide more than $20 billion in total  for emergency rental and utility assistance. This is in addition to the  $25 billion provided in the December package.   The House took bold action last week by passing the American Rescue  Plan, and I call on the Senate to pass it immediately and get it to the  President's desk.   This is the lifeline our families and businesses so desperately need.  Hope and health are on the way.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, Eric Garner,  George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, all Black men and women who were killed  by police.   It is in their memory that I rise today in support of the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act, because we cannot live up to our ideals  of justice for all while BIPOC Americans are disproportionately killed  by police.   We need to pass this bill to save lives, to reform qualified  immunity, to ban no-knock warrants like the one that contributed to the  death of Breonna Taylor, to end the use of choke holds that killed Eric  Garner and George Floyd.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting to pass this long  overdue bill, to join me in this work to make this country a safer,  more just place for all Americans. I urge a ``yes'' vote.    MALONEY of New York:        H.R. 1582.
