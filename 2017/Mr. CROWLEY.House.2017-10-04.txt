 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, my friend and  colleague from Kentucky, for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, the Republican budget proposal is just cruel. It isn't  just cruel; it will set our country backwards. It is worse than cruel.   It puts more than $5 trillion in cuts on the backs of working and  middle class Americans. At the same time, it doles out billions of  dollars in tax breaks to wealthy individuals, while leaving everyday  Americans emptyhanded.   Are you a senior who relies on Medicare or Medicaid for important  healthcare needs?   Too bad, says the Republican budget. Your care will simply be cut.   Are you a student looking to get a good education and launch your  career?   Tough luck, says the Republican budget. Pell grants are on the  chopping block, if Republicans have their way.   Are you struggling to recover after a natural disaster?   Forget about it, says the Republican budget. Grants from FEMA and  other programs that help rebuild our Nation will be eliminated.   The facts are clear: this Republican budget does nothing to invest in  America, the American people, or our future. It cuts funds for our  crumbling infrastructure, rather than rebuilding our schools and roads  and putting millions back to work. It slashes investment in green  energy technology, rather than preparing a new generation of Americans  to lead us into the economy of tomorrow.   Worst of all, it ramps up funding for endless wars overseas while  gutting programs that help the brave veterans who served their country  so well.   Eighty years ago, then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt spoke of a  national nightmare when he saw a third of our Nation ``ill-housed, ill- clad, and ill-nourished.''                                time  1545    When you look at this budget, it is not hard to see why FDR's words  haunt us to this day, because this budget would take us back to that  terrible time when dreams were dashed, futures were uncertain, and hope  was all but lost, put back to a time when people were hurting.   That is not the America I want. That is not the America our  constituents deserve. They deserve a better deal for all Americans.    Mr. Chairman, Democrats believe that our constituents  deserve a better deal, a better deal for all Americans, a plan to bring  better jobs, better wages, and a better future to everyone, and a  vision to give every American the opportunity to prosper and to  succeed.   That is the kind of America we should be working towards. That is the  better idea that America should be working towards. That is why I will  vote ``no'' on this terrible plan.
