 Mr. President, on Friday I was made aware that due to an  administrative error, Senator Warren was mistakenly added as a  cosponsor to S. 2972, my bill to repeal section 230 of the  Communications Act of 1934. The error was made through no fault of  Senator Warren or her staff. I am working with the cloakroom to ensure  her name is removed from the bill as soon as possible.                            ____________________
