 Mr. Speaker, every single American who ever raised their  right hand, as I did, to serve in uniform signed a blank check to this  country, to lay it all on the line, if asked; to put this country  before their lives and their families.   America has a sacred obligation to all of us. And let me be clear:  The Republican plan to slash billions of dollars from veterans and the  VA is an absolute betrayal. It is a disgrace.   They are threatening to blow up our economy, to push us into default  unless we agree to cuts to the VA and resources for veterans, and so  much else.   There is not a single protection, not one for veterans in their bill.  It will mean massive cuts for veterans. Millions of veterans are going  to be screwed over by this plan. They won't get the care they have  earned. They are going to have to wait longer for their claims, and so  much else will happen.   My fellow veterans should know we are going to fight hard to protect  our healthcare, our VA, and the benefits they have earned.   Mr. Speaker, it is a BS plan.                            ____________________
