 Mr. President, on Saturday evening, President Trump  announced his nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Amy Coney Barrett of  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.   I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Barrett earlier today. I  left our discussion even more convinced that President Trump has  nominated exactly the kind of outstanding person whom the American  people deserve to have on their highest Court.   Americans deserve brilliant judges with first-rate legal minds. Judge  Barrett is that and then some. She attended Notre Dame Law School on  full scholarship, graduated No. 1 in her class, and was executive  editor of the Law Review.   She secured top-flight clerkships on the DC Circuit and the Supreme  Court. After a few years in private practice, she returned to academia  and built a national reputation as an award-winning professor and legal  scholar. Judge Barrett is brilliant.   Americans also deserve judges who are committed to fairness and  impartiality, to following the facts in every case. They deserve judges  who understand that their job is to interpret the text of our laws and  Constitution as they are written, not as the judge might personally  wish they had been written differently.   Again, Judge Barrett passes with flying colors. Her 3 years of  rulings on the Seventh Circuit are the record of a judge who sets out  to do impartial justice under law--nothing more and nothing less. This  nominee could not be more fully qualified to serve on the Supreme  Court.   Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman is a fierce critic of President  Trump. He was one of the House Democrats' star witnesses in their  impeachment. He has known Judge Barrett professionally for more than 20  years. Despite some philosophical differences, he went out of his way  this past weekend to write that she is ``highly qualified to serve on  the Supreme Court.''   Here is what Professor Feldman wrote:         I know her to be a brilliant and conscientious lawyer who       will analyze and decide  [[Page S5886]]       cases in good faith, applying the jurisprudential principles       to which she is committed. Those are the basic criteria for       being a good justice. Barrett meets and exceeds them.    And if you ``believe in an ideal judicial temperament,'' Professor  Feldman went on, ``then rest assured that Barrett has it.''   It is the same story from everyone--everyone--who knows Judge Barrett  well.   The dean of Notre Dame Law School says she is ``an absolutely  brilliant legal scholar and jurist [and] one of the most popular  teachers we have ever had here.''   One of her faculty colleagues said: ``She is a principled, careful  judge, admired legal scholar, and amazing teacher.''   Six young women who all studied under now-Judge Barrett say she  drilled into them ``the necessity of setting personal beliefs aside  when evaluating the answer to a legal question.''   These objective qualifications and credentials are what matter most.  Judge Barrett deserves to be judged by her record.   But a few more things bear notice. As our Nation continues to honor  the trailblazing life of the late Justice Ginsburg, it seems fitting  that President Trump has nominated another brilliant woman who has  climbed to the very top of the legal field. Young women who know Judge  Barrett well describe her as not just an excellent teacher but a  gracious mentor and an inspiring example of female leadership.   As the only congressional leader not from New York or California, I  applaud the President's decision to look to the heartland. If  confirmed, Judge Barrett would be the only current Supreme Court  Justice with a law degree from anywhere besides Harvard or Yale--from  anywhere besides Harvard or Yale. I would say this nominee would bring  welcomed diversity on multiple fronts.   As I predicted last week, the far left is rushing to make this  nomination about anything but Judge Barrett's qualifications. The  instant she was announced, they started with the same unhinged attacks  they have recycled for every Supreme Court nomination by every  Republican President since the 1970s.   Remember, the far left said Justice Stevens opposed ``women's  rights,'' that Justice Kennedy would be ``a disaster for women,'' and  that Justice Souter would put the ``health and lives'' of Americans at  risk.   Well, Saturday went like clockwork. The political left took one more  look at Judge Barrett's qualifications, gave up on debating the merits,  and headed right at the same old scare tactics. Our colleague, the  Democratic leader, informed Americans that this 48-year-old working  mother was going to ``turn back the clock on women's rights.'' This 48- year-old working mother was going to ``turn back the clock on women's  rights,'' so said the Democratic leader.   The junior Senator from California said the nominee would ``harm  millions of Americans.''   The junior Senator from Connecticut said ``Amy Coney Barrett would  create a humanitarian catastrophe.''   Well, here we go again. Here we go again. One of the preselected  scare tactics is that Judge Barrett is out to steal Americans'  healthcare coverage. That is the claim. This mother of seven, including  multiple children who were born or adopted facing preexisting medical  challenges, is just itching to block families like hers from accessing  medical care. What a joke. What a joke.   When Senate Democrats were trying to attack Chief Justice John  Roberts, long before ObamaCare even existed, they claimed he had sought  to ``put millions of American consumers and families at risk of losing  coverage.'' They have been recycling these same attacks since before  they even passed the law they now say they are worried about.   On this occasion, their entire argument seems to come down to a  technical analysis Judge Barrett put forward in a 4-year-old academic  paper about one part of ObamaCare, which Congress has already zeroed  out in the meantime. Let me just say that again. The entire argument  seems to come down to a technical analysis that Judge Barrett put  forward in a 4-year-old academic paper about one part--just one part-- of ObamaCare, which Congress has already zeroed out in the meantime.   These hysterical claims collapse under the slightest examination,  but, sadly, they are just beginning. Three years ago, Senate Democrats'  bizarre attacks on Judge Barrett's religious faith became a national  embarrassment for their side of the aisle.   The senior Senator from Illinois asked now-Judge Barrett: ``Do you  consider yourself an orthodox Catholic?'' This was actually during a  U.S. Senate hearing. The senior Senator from California told her that  ``the dogma lives loudly within you. And that's of concern.''   This was not, regretfully, an isolated incident. Over the past few  years, multiple Senate Democrats, on multiple different occasions, have  openly suggested that certain kinds of religious beliefs might  disqualify citizens from public service.   In 2017, the junior Senator from Vermont, Senator Sanders, told an  executive branch nominee that he had made an ``indefensible, hateful,  Islamophobic'' statement because he had articulated a personal belief  that Christianity gets things right which Islam gets wrong.   In 2018, the junior Senator from California, who is now asking for  Americans' votes to be Vice President, attacked a different nominee for  participating in the Knights of Columbus. The Knights of Columbus? This  is a massive, noncontroversial Catholic men's association that is known  for things like shoveling snow off church sidewalks and hosting pancake  breakfasts.    ``Were you aware that the Knights of Columbus opposed a woman's right  to choose,'' Senator Harris asked, as though it were remotely  controversial that a famous Catholic organization would subscribe to  Catholic teaching on the right to life.   The junior Senator from Hawaii suggested this nominee would need to  quit the organization, quit the Knights of Columbus to serve as a  judge. You would think the national backlash to all of this would have  taught the political left a lesson.   Here is what happened in just the past few days. The Associated  Press, Reuters, POLITICO, Newsweek, and the Washington Post have  already run up major stories on the Barrett family's private faith  practices. Each strongly implied there might be something worrisome or  disqualifying if a Federal judge were a faithful Christian with strong  ties to spiritual groups. POLITICO's contributing editor literally went  and peered around the physical grounds of a religious facility in South  Bend so he could report what the youth group had written on their  whiteboard. Less than 72 hours in, this is where we are. The elite  class is already treating Americans of faith like exotic animals on  display in a menagerie.   Look, I understand the far left had committed to opposing this  nominee before she was even named. I understand some politicians have  decided to oppose Judge Barrett before they even considered her record.  But every time they choose to use the nominee's personal faith as a  political weapon, they will only be reminding millions of Americans why  it is so essential to have judges just like Judge Barrett on the bench.   In this country--our country--citizens have religious liberty. In  this country--our country--there is no religious test for public  office. In this Country--our country--we have the right to seek the  protection of the courts when our free exercise of religion is  threatened. That is why we need judges like Judge Barrett who  understand our laws and Constitution and will uphold our freedoms  accordingly. If the reflexive opponents of Judge Barrett's nomination  want to argue otherwise, they will only be proving how much better she  understands our Constitution than they do.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 12 noon,  Wednesday, September 30; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day; further, that following leader remarks, the Senate resume  consideration of H.R. 8337; finally, that all time during recess of the  Senate and leader remarks count postcloture on H.R. 8337.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand in recess  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:13 p.m., recessed until  Wednesday, September 30, 2020, at 12 noon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week, the Senators who are sitting  down with Judge Amy Coney Barrett are meeting an incredibly impressive  jurist and highly qualified nominee. They are hearing from the  professor whom former colleagues call ``mind-blowingly intelligent,''  ``one of the most humble people you're going to meet,'' and ``the  complete package.'' They are meeting a law school valedictorian and  award-winning academic whom peers praise for her ``lucid, elegant  prose,'' ``piercing'' legal analysis, and ``absolute dedication to the  rule of law.''   Senators are meeting the distinguished circuit judge whom the liberal  law professor Noah Feldman says is ``a brilliant and conscientious  lawyer'' who is ``highly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.''   Some of our Democratic colleagues have decided they will refuse to  meet with Judge Barrett. Several have volunteered their votes will have  nothing to do with her qualifications, as though that were something to  be proud of. The Democratic leader says: ``It's not her  qualifications.'' The junior Senator from Delaware says: ``This isn't  about her qualifications.''   Certainly, every Senator may define ``advice and consent'' how they  wish, but I think it is telling to see Senate Democrats openly  affirming that Judge Barrett's actual judicial qualifications do not  matter to them. Our friends on the left really do mistake the Court as  an unelected superlegislature. They are not interested in Judge  Barrett's legal qualifications because they think  [[Page S5900]]  judges are there to dictate policy outcomes rather than following the  facts and text wherever they lead.   That is why we have had the same scare tactics for almost half a  century. John Paul Stevens was going to end women's rights. David  Souter was going to send vulnerable people into the Dark Ages. John  Roberts was going to declare war on health insurance.   And now our Democratic colleagues want Americans to believe Judge  Barrett is on a one-woman crusade to hurt Americans with preexisting  conditions. One Senator has literally claimed the nominee would--listen  to this--``create a humanitarian catastrophe.''   They are the same old scare tactics, totally predictable and totally  dishonest.   These baseless attacks over healthcare are supposedly founded on a  technical argument in a 4-year-old scholarly article. Then-Professor  Barrett analyzed the Supreme Court's ruling on one piece of ObamaCare-- the unfair, unpopular individual mandate penalty, which we have since  zeroed out. The constitutional arguments over whether that terrible  idea was a ``penalty'' or a ``tax'' are now moot because, whatever you  want to call it, Republicans in Congress zeroed it out 3 years ago.  Working Americans are no longer penalized by that Democrat policy.  Americans with preexisting conditions are still protected and that  specific legal question is moot.   Our Democratic colleagues are grasping at straws. Now they want Judge  Barrett to promise to recuse herself from whole categories of cases. Of  course, that is ridiculous. It is hard to think of anyone in the  country over whom a President has less leverage than a judge with a  lifetime appointment. Nobody suggested Justice Sotomayor or Justice  Kagan needed to categorically sit on the sidelines until President  Obama left office. This is just a backdoor attempt to impugn Judge  Barrett's integrity.   If Senators believe this nominee is committed to impartial justice in  every case, if they believe she will mean her oath when she takes it,  they should vote to confirm her. If they don't, they should vote no.   But only one of these arguments has any basis in Judge Barrett's  resume, her reputation, and the praise that has been showered on her  jurisprudence even by famous liberal lawyers.   Judge Barrett has already stated in writing to the Senate that she  has given nobody in the White House any hints or any assurances about  any kind of cases, real or hypothetical. It is only Senate Democrats  who are trying to extract promises and precommitments. It is only  Democrats who are trying to undermine judicial independence.   Last night on national television, former Vice President Biden  refused to rule out the radical notion of packing the Supreme Court. He  ducked the question. In Washington, when you duck the question, you  know what the answer is. That is exactly what they are up to. That is  exactly what they intend to do.   Last year, our colleague Senator Harris said explicitly that she was  open to it. That is another way of saying that is what they intend to  do. Numerous of our colleagues have refused to rule out this radical  institution-shattering step.   Now Senate Democrats are trying to make Judge Barrett precommit to  handle hypothetical issues the way they want--more disrespect for  judicial independence.   Judge Barrett understands a judge's only loyalty must be to our laws  and our Constitution. She understands our system would collapse if  judges do not leave politics aside. If the Democratic Party feels  differently, if Democrats have decided that judicial independence is  simply an inconvenience to their radical agenda, it shows how little  weight we should afford their criticisms of this outstanding nominee                            ____________________     If Senate Democrats were half as concerned as they say  about America's family healthcare, they would not have filibustered a  multihundred-billion-dollar proposal for more coronavirus relief just a  few weeks ago.   A Senate minority that was focused on America's health would have let  us fund more tests, treatments, and vaccine development, like  Republicans tried to do just a few weeks ago. A Senate minority that  was prioritizing wellness would have let us spend more than $100  billion to make schools safe for students, like Republicans tried to do  just a few weeks ago. A Senate minority that sought to protect citizens  with preexisting conditions would have let us reaffirm legal  protections for those Americans, like Republicans had in our bill just  a few weeks ago. A Senate minority that was serious about economic  recovery would have let us fund a second round of the Paycheck  Protection Program and continued the expanded unemployment checks, like  Republicans tried to do just a few weeks ago.   The Senate voted on all of this 3 weeks ago. Three weeks ago, every  single Senator cast a vote on preexisting conditions, money for  testing, money for vaccines, money for safe schools, money for small  businesses, and money for unemployed workers--just 3 weeks ago. Fifty- two Republicans voted to pass all of these policies and every single  Democrat who showed up voted to filibuster it dead.   The Democratic leader and the Speaker of the House were determined  that American families should not see another dime before the election.  This week, Speaker Pelosi is finally caving to months of pressure from  fellow Democrats who argue that her stonewalling is hurting our  country. House Democrats are trying to save face by introducing yet  another multitrillion-dollar far-left wish list with virtually all the  same non-COVID-related poison pills as their last unserious bill.   Speaker Pelosi's latest offering still does not include a single cent  of new money toward the Paycheck Protection Program to help small  businesses that are going under. It does nothing to help schools,  universities, doctors, nurses, or employers avoid frivolous lawsuits.  But the House did find room to provide special treatment to the  marijuana industry. Their bill mentions the word ``cannabis'' more  times than the words ``job'' or ``jobs.''   They still want to send taxpayer-funded stimulus checks to people in  our country illegally. They still want to hand a massively expensive  tax cut to millionaires and billionaires in places like New York City  and San Francisco, a pet priority of the Speaker and the Democratic  leader that would do nothing to help working families through this  pandemic.   All of these far-left poison pills are still in their recycled bill.  They have no intention of making bipartisan law for American families,  but there are a few changes from the last bill.   So get this. Now that supporting law enforcement has become less than  fashionable on the far left, the Democrats have actually taken out  hundreds of millions of dollars for hiring and assisting police  officers. Let me say that again. In this latest version, there were at  least some changes. Now that supporting law enforcement has become less  than fashionable on the far left, the Democrats have actually taken out  hundreds of millions of dollars for hiring and assisting police  officers. Their so-called sequel to the Heroes Act has decided that  cops are not heroes after all. Apparently, cops are not heroes after  all. The House Democrats couldn't miss a chance to defund the police.   This latest bill from the Speaker is no more serious than any of  their other political stunts going back months. If they continue to  refuse to get serious, then American families will continue to hurt.  Less than a month ago, every single Senator voted on providing hundreds  of billions of dollars for kids, jobs, healthcare, and reaffirming  protections for preexisting conditions. There were 52 Republicans who  voted to advance all of these things, but every single Democrat who  showed up voted to block them.   The American people are still hurting. The layoffs are still  mounting. Families still need more help, and the healthcare fight needs  more resources. One side voted to supply all of that help. The other  side decided to block it.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S5923]]     Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 2663.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on H.R.  8337.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the House message to accompany S. 178.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 178) entitled       ``An Act to condemn gross human rights violations of ethnic       Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, and calling for an end to       arbitrary detention, torture, and harassment of these       communities inside and outside China.'', do pass with an       amendment.     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the  pending motion to concur with amendment No. 2652.    Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment to the  motion to concur with amendment No. 2673.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading of the amendment be dispensed with.
