 Mr. Speaker, once again, we find ourselves in an  unguided, misguided debate about the fundamental concept of our nation  of immigrants. We find ourselves in a debate trying to deny what we  really are, a nation of immigrants.   Mr. Speaker, let me remind you, on average, TPS holders have lived in  the United States for over 22 years--many of them hailing from Latin  American countries. Redesignating and designating TPS would be a wise  thing for over 2 million people already residing in the United States  of America.   Mr. Speaker, in addition, families often have to wait decades before  they reunite with their family members; sometimes four decades, three  decades, before they reunite with their children.   Mr. Speaker, 4 million people are waiting to reunite with their  families. United families are stronger. United families make America  stronger. Let's unite the families. That is a family value. Unity of  the family is a family value that we must protect.   Mr. Speaker, we are a nation of immigrants.                            ____________________
