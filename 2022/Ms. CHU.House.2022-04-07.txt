 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation to  fulfill our commitment to the small businesses hardest hit by the  pandemic, like the many in my Los Angeles-area district.   The Restaurant Revitalization Fund and the Shuttered Venue Operators  Grant program have been crucial interventions to protect the industries  most reliant on in-person, indoor crowds. These were some of the first  businesses to close and among the last to return to full capacity.   That is why we must pass this legislation to fund $42 billion in  pending restaurant applications, give live venues and theaters more  time and flexibility to use their funds, and create a new program for  the hardest hit small businesses that still need help to keep their  doors open.   This bill would be paid for by going after funds stolen by  fraudsters, showing the American public that the U.S. will not tolerate  those who use the pandemic to take advantage of small businesses in  their most dire time of need.
