 Mr. President, I would like to discuss five topics this  afternoon: the President's remarks this weekend and the lack of  Republican reaction to them, his Executive order on Friday about  mortgage rates, the continuing nominations process here, the  President's withdrawal from TPP, and the Republican alternative to the  Affordable Care Act that was announced this morning.   First, the need for Republicans to speak out when President Trump  engages in the kind of rhetoric he engaged in this weekend. The first  few days of the new administration are traditionally a time for an  incoming President to call for unity and to try and bring the country  together. Instead, President Trump kicked off a bizarre first weekend  in office that alternated between braggadocio and furor. The President  quarreled over the size of inaugural crowds, bragged about his election  victory in a speech at CIA headquarters, with a wall commemorating  fallen American intelligence officers behind him, and then sent his  Press Secretary out to hold an emergency briefing to present  ``alternative facts,'' as one of President Trump's advisers described  them yesterday, about the size of the crowds again.   Whatever your politics, in order to debate, argue, compromise, and  get things done for the American people, we have to be able to agree on  a base line of facts. Facts aren't partisan. They don't have  alternatives. The alternative to fact is fiction. If this Presidency is  going to be based on ignoring the facts on the ground, we are going to  have huge problems. It is not that important when you are talking about  the number of people who attended an inauguration, but what about the  facts if Russia is doing something that is very bad or something  terrible is happening to our economy or something else? If the  Presidency looks away from the real facts, we have trouble. You cannot  govern a country like that.   So if the White House is ignoring the facts on the ground and is  willing to make up ``alternative facts'' about crowd size, what else  are they willing to stretch the truth about? National security? What  Vladimir Putin is up to? The implications are terrifying.   A White House that presents alternative facts needs to be called out  for doing so by both parties. The folks who can really help rein in the  President are the members of his own party who have a special  responsibility to do so, but they have been silent, totally silent when  President Trump has been saying and doing things they know are wrong.  They should be speaking out for the good of the country.   I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to help us hold the  President and his White House accountable for the truth; otherwise this  country is going to have a lot of trouble. Whether you are a Democrat,  Republican, liberal or conservative, you cannot ignore the facts and  govern and move the country forward.                            ____________________     Second, I want to address again the President's  Executive action on Friday that would make it harder for Americans to  afford mortgages. President Trump said in his inaugural address that  ``for too long a small group in our Nation's Capital has reaped the  rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.'' He  promised to combat that trend, but only 1 hour later--1 hour after that  speech--in one of his first acts as President, President Trump made it  harder for average Americans to afford a mortgage by reversing a recent  decision by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to reduce  annual insurance premiums that many borrowers pay, saving homeowners  about $500 a year. These are young families just starting out. They  want part of the American dream--a home. There is no need to raise  their mortgage rates, which is what was done 1 hour after those  populist words were delivered on the steps of the Capitol. Yes, it only  took 1 hour for those populist words delivered on the steps of the  Capitol to ring hollow. Actions speak louder than words.   So I will just say this. If Dr. Carson wants to earn my support for  his nomination to run HUD, he ought to reverse the President's decision  and reinstate the policy that makes mortgages more affordable for  working Americans.                            ____________________     Third, on nominations, the evidence continues to mount  that our Republican friends are trying to ram through the President's  Cabinet nominations without a fair and complete vetting process.  Totally different, I would say to my good friend the majority leader,  than what happened when President Obama took office. As I said, our  constitutional duty to advise and consent does not mean ramming through  nominees. Here are three instances, just new ones. They pile up.  Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson did not adequately respond to  our questions for the record, and a number of Democrats still await  more complete responses. Secretary of Education nominee Betsy DeVos  refused to return to the HELP Committee now that her ethics paperwork  is in, even though her ethics agreement gains her  [[Page S369]]  the ability to retain interest in companies that will be directly  affected by the policies of the Department of Education. Representative  Price, the nominee for HHS, refused to meet with several members of the  committee before his nomination is scheduled for a vote.   This is not how nominations should go. Now, I know--with a swamped  Cabinet of bankers, billionaires, more wealth, more potential conflicts  of interest, more positions way far over from what the American people  want--why our Republican colleagues want to rush these nominees  through. But let me reiterate that they will have tremendous power over  the lives of average Americans. A few extra days to examine and explore  what they believe to make sure that they don't have conflicts of  interest--who wouldn't be for that, unless they don't want the facts to  come out?   So we are not stalling nominations. This isn't sport. This is serious  stuff. We have genuine concerns about the qualifications and ethical  standards of these nominees, and we are going to continue to seek an  open, transparent, and thorough vetting process for the President's  Cabinet. These folks are going to be in power for 4 years, maybe. Then  they deserve a few days of careful vetting. They should not be all  rushed in a day, with hurried debate, hurrying them through in the dark  of night--no way. We are going to use whatever abilities we have here  to make sure that doesn't happen.                            ____________________     Fourth, on the Executive action that the President will  be withdrawing the United States from the TPP, or the Trans-Pacific  Partnership, as you know, my views on trade are probably closer to  President Trump's than they were to President Obama and President Bush.  I opposed NAFTA and TPP. But the fact that the President announced with  fanfare that he will be withdrawing the United States from the Trans- Pacific Partnership is not news. The Trans-Pacific Partnership was dead  long ago, before President Trump took office. That is why Leader  McConnell didn't bring it up on the floor in the lameduck session. It  didn't have the votes and was even further away from getting votes in  the Senate. It was over.   We await real action on trade, one of the President's signature  campaign issues. Now, what President Trump said in his campaign over  and over was that, on his first day as President, he would label China  a currency manipulator. That hasn't happened. Even though China is  letting their currency float at the moment, you can be sure they will  return to manipulating their currency--hurting our exports, helping  them unfairly compete with American jobs and businesses--as soon as it  is in their best interest to do so.   I worked, frankly, with the nominee for Attorney General, Jeff  Sessions, and with many others to try and get both President Bush and  President Obama to label China a currency manipulator. It didn't  happen, unfortunately. But President Trump promised that he was going  to do it on his first day in office, and it has not happened. If  President Trump wants to send a shot across the bow that he is getting  serious on trade, addressing the currency issue would have been a lot  more effective than a meaningless and redundant Executive order on the  TPP.   While we are on the subject of trade, I remind the President of the  two simple rules he laid out in his inaugural address: buy American and  hire American--two rules that his current businesses don't follow.  Trump shirts and ties are made in China; Trump furniture is made in  Turkey. While he is importuning others to ``make it in America''--I  don't disagree with that--he should start by demanding it of his own  businesses. How can he expect others to do something that he is not  doing? He wants the automobile makers to make cars in America. So do I.  Then he ought to stop making his ties in China and his furniture in  Turkey. He ought to set a good example. Until he totally and completely  divests himself from his businesses, which is the right thing to do, he  ought to start following the rules himself that he has laid out for the  country.                            ____________________     Finally, this morning, two of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle, the Senator from Maine and the Senator from  Louisiana, introduced a proposal purporting to be a Republican  alternative to the Affordable Care Act. While I sympathize with my two  colleagues, whom I respect a great deal and who understand that repeal  without replace would be devastating for our country, their proposal  would create chaos, not affordable care for millions of Americans. It  is much like the vague Executive order issued by the President on  Friday that my friend, the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, called  ``confusing.''   Their proposal today illustrates the dilemma that both the  Republicans and the White House are in. It is nearly impossible to keep  the benefits of the Affordable Care Act without keeping the whole  thing. There is an easier way out of the pickle our Republican friends  have created for themselves. Republicans can and should stop repeal  plans, which are disruptive, and work with Democrats to improve, not  gut, the Affordable Care Act and health care system for all Americans.   Thank you. I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
