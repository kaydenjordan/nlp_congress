 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 216) to provide for equitable compensation to the Spokane  Tribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation for the use of tribal land  for the production of hydropower by the Grand Coulee Dam, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 216         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Spokane Tribe of Indians of       the Spokane Reservation Equitable Compensation Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) from 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the       Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its       tributaries to determine sites at which power could be       produced at low cost;        (2) under section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C.       803(e)), when licenses are issued involving tribal land       within an Indian reservation, a reasonable annual charge       shall be fixed for the use of the land, subject to the       approval of the Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the       land;        (3) in August 1933, the Columbia Basin Commission, an       agency of the State of Washington, received a preliminary       permit from the Federal Power Commission for water power       development at the Grand Coulee site;        (4) had the Columbia Basin Commission or a private entity       developed the site, the Spokane Tribe would have been       entitled to a reasonable annual charge for the use of the       land of the Spokane Tribe;        (5) in the mid-1930s, the Federal Government, which is not       subject to licensing under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C.       792 et seq.)--        (A) federalized the Grand Coulee Dam project; and        (B) began construction of the Grand Coulee Dam;        (6) when the Grand Coulee Dam project was federalized, the       Federal Government recognized that--        (A) development of the project affected the interests of       the Spokane Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville       Reservation; and        (B) it would be appropriate for the Spokane and Colville       Tribes to receive a share of revenue from the disposition of       power produced at Grand Coulee Dam;        (7) in the Act of June 29, 1940 (16 U.S.C. 835d et seq.),       Congress--        (A) granted to the United States--        (i) in aid of the construction, operation, and maintenance       of the Columbia Basin Project, all the right, title, and       interest of the Spokane Tribe and Colville Tribes in and to       the tribal and allotted land within the Spokane and Colville       Reservations, as designated by the Secretary of the Interior       from time to time; and        (ii) other interests in that land as required and as       designated by the Secretary for certain construction       activities undertaken in connection with the project; and        (B) provided that compensation for the land and other       interests was to be determined by the Secretary in such       amounts as the Secretary determined to be just and equitable;        (8) pursuant to that Act, the Secretary paid--        (A) to the Spokane Tribe, $4,700; and        (B) to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation,       $63,000;        (9) in 1994, following litigation under the Act of August       13, 1946 (commonly known as the ``Indian Claims Commission       Act'' (60 Stat. 1049, chapter 959; former 25 U.S.C. 70 et       seq.)), Congress ratified the Colville Settlement Agreement,       which required--        (A) for past use of the land of the Colville Tribes, a       payment of $53,000,000; and        (B) for continued use of the land of the Colville Tribes,       annual payments of $15,250,000, adjusted annually based on       revenues from the sale of electric power from the Grand       Coulee Dam project and transmission of that power by the       Bonneville Power Administration;        (10) the Spokane Tribe, having suffered harm similar to       that suffered by the Colville Tribes, did not file a claim       within the 5-year statute of limitations under the Indian       Claims Commission Act;        (11) neither the Colville Tribes nor the Spokane Tribe       filed claims for compensation for use of the land of the       respective tribes with the Commission prior to August 13,       1951, but both tribes filed unrelated land claims prior to       August 13, 1951;        (12) in 1976, over objections by the United States, the       Colville Tribes were successful in amending the 1951 Claims       Commission land claims to add the Grand Coulee claim of the       Colville Tribes;        (13) the Spokane Tribe had no such claim to amend, having       settled the Claims Commission land claims of the Spokane       Tribe with the United States in 1967;        (14) the Spokane Tribe has suffered significant harm from       the construction and operation of Grand Coulee Dam;        (15) Spokane tribal acreage taken by the United States for       the construction of Grand Coulee Dam equaled approximately 39       percent of Colville tribal acreage taken for construction of       the dam;        (16) the payments and delegation made pursuant to this Act       constitute fair and equitable compensation for the past and       continued use of Spokane tribal land for the production of       hydropower at Grand Coulee Dam; and        (17) by vote of the Spokane tribal membership, the Spokane       Tribe has resolved that the payments and delegation made       pursuant to this Act constitute fair and equitable       compensation for the past and continued use of Spokane tribal       land for the production of hydropower at Grand Coulee Dam.       SEC. 3. PURPOSE.         The purpose of this Act is to provide fair and equitable       compensation to the Spokane Tribe for the use of the land of       the Spokane Tribe for the generation of hydropower by the       Grand Coulee Dam.

SEC. 9. ADMINISTRATION.         Nothing in this Act establishes any precedent or is binding       on the Southwestern Power Administration, Western Area Power       Administration, or Southeastern Power Administration.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 216, the Spokane Tribe of Indians of the Spokane  Reservation Equitable Compensation Act, will finally compensate the  Spokane Tribe of Indians for the flooding of their Tribal lands that  occurred with the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam more than 75  years ago.   Located in Washington State, the Grand Coulee Dam was built in the  1930s and 1940s. The reservoir it created flooded approximately 2,500  acres of the Spokane Indian Reservation. These lands held great  economic, cultural, and spiritual significance for the Spokane Tribal  people and included the Tribe's historic salmon fishing sites.   Around the time of the dam's completion, the Indian Claims Commission  Act of 1946 was enacted, which gave Tribal nations 5 years to file all  relevant land claims against the Federal Government. Although the  Spokane Tribe filed a claim before this deadline, which was settled in  1967, for around $4,700, lands related to the dam were not included.   The end result is that, more than 75 years later, the Spokane Tribe  has still not received just compensation for the seizure and  destruction of their lands. This has severely impacted the ability of  the Tribal government to provide for their people.   This is also an issue of fairness and equity. The only other Tribe  impacted by the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam, the Confederated  Tribes of the Colville Reservation, successfully secured a settlement  with the United States in 1994 and have been receiving compensation  ever since.   S. 216 will require the Bonneville Power Administration to make  annual payments to the Tribe starting in 2022 to match the company's  electricity sales, much in the same way the Colville Tribes are  compensated.   The legislation has the support of the surrounding counties and local  entities.   Additionally, BPA stated, at a recent subcommittee hearing on the  bill, that the annual payments to the Tribe ``will not result in  perceptible rate impacts to its utility customers.''   The Grand Coulee Dam and the energy it produces has been a financial  boon to the United States and the citizens of the Northwest. It is now  time to make whole the Spokane Tribe for their sacrifice.   I thank Senator Cantwell for her tireless work on this issue on  behalf of the Spokane Tribal people, and I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time and  would inquire whether my colleague has any remaining speakers on his  side.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just like to remind the House that  this is an important bill that would bring equity to the Spokane Tribe  of Indians, and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 722) to designate a mountain in the State of Utah as  ``Miracle Mountain''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 722         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Miracle Mountain Designation       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds as follows:        (1) On September 13, 2018, the Bald Mountain Fire burned       nearly 20,000 acres of land in Utah.        (2) Elk Ridge City, located in Utah County, was nearly the       victim of this fire.        (3) Suddenly, the fire halted its progression and, instead       of burning into Elk Ridge City, stayed behind the mountain       and spared the city.        (4) Congress, in acknowledgment of this event, believes       this mountain holds special significance to the residents of       Elk Ridge City and surrounding communities.        (5) The presently unnamed peak has been referred to as       ``Miracle Mountain'' by many residents since the fire that       nearly went into Elk Ridge City.       SEC. 3. MIRACLE MOUNTAIN.         (a) Designation.--The mountain in the State of Utah,       located at 39 59' 02N, 111 40' 12W, shall be known and       designated as ``Miracle Mountain''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, record, or other paper of the United States to the       mountain described in subsection (a) shall be considered to       be a reference to ``Miracle Mountain''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 722, introduced by Representative Curtis, would  designate an unnamed peak near Elk Ridge City, Utah, as Miracle  Mountain.   On August 24, 2018, lightning sparked the 20,000-acre Bald Mountain  fire, which expanded rapidly and eventually merged with the Pole Creek  fire, threatening the cities of Elk Ridge and Woodland Hills.   Fortunately, on September 13, the fire suddenly halted behind the  mountain, saving the communities of Elk Ridge and Woodland Hills.   To commemorate the peak that saved their community, many residents of  Elk Ridge City have adopted the name Miracle  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time and  would inquire whether my colleague has any remaining speakers on his  side.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just once more want to remind this House  how important this measure is, this bill that my colleague, Mr. Curtis,  has put forth, and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 50) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to assess  sanitation and safety conditions at Bureau of Indian Affairs facilities  that were constructed to provide affected Columbia River Treaty tribes  access to traditional fishing grounds and expend funds on construction  of facilities and structures to improve those conditions, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 50         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Columbia River In-Lieu and       Treaty Fishing Access Sites Improvement Act''.       SEC. 2. SANITATION AND SAFETY CONDITIONS AT CERTAIN BUREAU OF                     INDIAN AFFAIRS FACILITIES.         (a) Assessment of Conditions.--The Secretary of the       Interior, acting through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, in       consultation with the affected Columbia River Treaty tribes,       may assess current sanitation and safety conditions on lands       held by the United States for the benefit of the affected       Columbia River Treaty tribes, including all permanent Federal       structures and improvements on those lands, that were set       aside to provide affected Columbia River Treaty tribes access       to traditional fishing grounds--        (1) in accordance with the Act of March 2, 1945 (59 Stat.       10, chapter 19) (commonly known as the ``River and Harbor Act       of 1945''); or        (2) in accordance with title IV of Public Law 100-581 (102       Stat. 2944).        (b) Exclusive Authorization; Contracts.--The Secretary of       the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Indian Affairs--        (1) subject to paragraph (2)(B), shall be the only Federal       agency authorized to carry out the activities described in       this section; and        (2) may delegate the authority to carry out activities       described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (d)--        (A) through one or more contracts entered into with an       Indian Tribe or Tribal organization under the Indian Self-      Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5301 et       seq.); or        (B) to include other Federal agencies that have relevant       expertise.        (c) Definition of Affected Columbia River Treaty Tribes.--      In this section, the term ``affected Columbia River Treaty       tribes'' means the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes       of Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of       the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, and the Confederated       Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation.        (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized       to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior       $11,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2020 through 2025,       to remain available until expended--        (1) for improvements to existing structures and       infrastructure to improve sanitation and safety conditions       assessed under subsection (a); and        (2) to improve access to electricity, sewer, and water       infrastructure, where feasible, to reflect needs for sanitary       and safe use of facilities referred to in subsection (a).       SEC. 3. STUDY OF ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES.         The Comptroller General of the United States, in       consultation with the Committee on Indian Affairs of the       Senate, shall--        (1) conduct a study to evaluate whether the sanitation and       safety conditions on lands held by the United States for the       benefit of the affected Columbia River Treaty tribes (as       defined in section 2(c)) have improved as a result of the       activities authorized in section 2; and        (2) prepare and submit to the Committee on Indian Affairs       of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the       House of Representatives a report containing the results of       that study.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 50 authorizes the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the BIA,  to assess sanitation and safety conditions on lands that were set aside  to provide  [[Page H10302]]  Columbia River Treaty Tribes access to their traditional fishing  grounds. The bill also authorizes the BIA to enter into contracts with  Tribes or Tribal organizations to improve the conditions at those  sites.   The Columbia River Treaty Tribes, through a series of treaties in  1855, established their continued access to traditional fishing grounds  and to certain fishing facilities on the Columbia River. However,  starting in the 1930s, construction of the dams of the Columbia River  power system resulted in the flooding and destruction of Tribal  villages, homes, and traditional fishing sites, severely impacting the  ability of the Tribes to exercise their treaty rights.   The Tribes and their citizens have never been fully compensated for  these losses.   Starting in 1939, the Federal Government acquired and developed small  parcels of land to serve as in-lieu and treaty fishing access sites,  providing members of the Columbia River Treaty Tribes access and a way  to exercise their rights to fish in the Columbia River and to reside at  their traditional fishing places and stations.   Congress also enacted the Columbia River Treaty Fishing Access Sites  project in 1988, which authorized improvements for certain fishing  facilities and directed the Army Corps of Engineers to acquire new  lands to provide unencumbered river access for Tribal members.   Today, there are 31 Tribal fishing sites located along the Columbia  River, 27 of which are managed by the BIA. The sites were intended to  be used primarily for in-season fishing and some temporary camping.  However, out of both a need for housing and a desire to be closer to  their own traditional fishing areas, many Tribal members now use these  areas as permanent residences.   These sites were not designed for and cannot sustainably accommodate  this use. In fact, many people at these sites are living in extremely  distressed, unsafe, and unsanitary conditions as a direct result of  decades of unmet obligations by the BIA.   S. 50 will allow much-needed improvements to the conditions at these  sites.   I thank Senator Merkley for his work on moving this bill through the  Senate. I also thank our colleague from Oregon, Representative  Blumenauer, for being the champion in the House on this issue and for  tirelessly advocating for the Columbia River Treaty Tribes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge quick adoption of this legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 453) to take certain Federal lands in Tennessee into trust  for the benefit of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 453         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is one of three  federally recognized Cherokee Tribes. Their ancestral homeland includes  substantial parts of seven Eastern States, including Tennessee.   In 1979, the completion of the Tellico Dam by the Tennessee Valley  Authority, the TVA, caused large areas of their ancestral lands along  the Little Tennessee River to be flooded, covering many historic Tribal  sites. The Cherokee can never recover these flooded lands, but there  are other sites in the area that are in need of protection and  preservation.  [[Page H10304]]    H.R. 453 aids in this cause by transferring approximately 76 acres of  historically significant lands from the TVA's management to the United  States, to be held in trust for the Eastern Band of Cherokee.   Placing these lands into trust would give the Eastern Band greater  control over their historic homelands, as well as the opportunity to  memorialize the history and culture of the Cherokee people.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 453, and I urge my colleagues to vote in  favor of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  would inquire whether my colleague has any remaining speakers on his  side.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also wholeheartedly support this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3172.
