 Madam Speaker, tomorrow, May 15, is National Peace  Officers Memorial Day, a day to honor and remember the more than 22,000  brave law enforcement officers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the  line of duty.   Having served in law enforcement for 30 years, I am proud to see so  many of my colleagues recognizing the sacrifice of these brave officers  this week. They certainly deserve it.   But truly honoring their sacrifice means doing so every day, not just  on May 15 and not just this week. That means giving law enforcement the  tools necessary to keep our communities safe, pushing back against any  and all attempts to demonize and diminish their service, and doing  everything we can to reduce the attacks against law enforcement.   Now more than ever, law enforcement across our country needs true  Americans to boldly stand with them. That is what I am proud to do here  today. And I ask every one of my colleagues and the American people to  do so, as well.                            ____________________
