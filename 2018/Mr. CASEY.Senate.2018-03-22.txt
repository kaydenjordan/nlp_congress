 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about an  issue we have talked about a lot in Washington but frankly haven't done  enough about, and that is gun violence. In the next number of hours-- certainly all day Saturday--we are going have demonstrations across the  country. Young people will be going into local communities, as well as  coming to Washington, to march on behalf of those whose lives have been  lost and to urge us to take action. The exact name of the effort being  undertaken is March for Our Lives. We have never seen on this issue-- and maybe any other issue--this kind of intense activism that young  people have undertaken across the country.   This march on Saturday, March for Our Lives, will be unprecedented in  recent American history. I am going to be in the city of Philadelphia,  and I know some people will be marching in Washington, as well as in  communities across the country.   The focus of the work of young people across the country--starting  with the students in Parkland, FL, but growing all across the country  in these many weeks--will be taking action, demanding that the U.S.  Senate, the U.S. House, and any other legislative body that can have an  impact on this should take action. That is what they are demanding. I  think there are a number of folks in Washington who have wanted to take  action for years.   I hope, in response to that activism, in response to those marches,  when we come back after our break--and I hope days and weeks after  that--that there will be a response here in the Senate and that we will  debate the issue or debate one amendment or one bill and then vote on  it, and then take the next bill and vote on that, and keep going until  we have a number of votes. It doesn't mean that we can be certain of  the outcome. In my judgment, the reason to have a vote is to make sure  that the American people see us debating this issue and voting on it.   Otherwise, to take no action, to simply say that there is nothing we  can do about a uniquely American problem--the other option of course is  to surrender, to say that gun violence is just part of American life,  we have to get used to it, there is nothing we can do about it, and  surrender to the problem. I think most Americans don't want to keep  reading that number of deaths that pile up every year. At last count,  there were 33,000 gun deaths in 1 year. I don't think many Americans  want to settle for that. That is not the America I know. That is not  the America most people know.    In America, we take action on tough issues. We tackle them or try to  tackle them. We don't surrender to the problem. We don't surrender to  one political point of view and say that paralysis leads to no  solution. That is not American.   Back in December of 2012, when Sandy Hook Elementary School was the  scene of the kind of horror and carnage that we have rarely seen in  American history, there also was that predisposition to just move on  and do nothing, to say there is nothing we can do. I was confronted  with those questions that same weekend because I knew, in the months  ahead, there would be a series of votes. There turned out to be a vote  on background checks, a vote on the limitation of high-capacity  magazines--in essence, how many  [[Page S1902]]  bullets can an individual shoot at any one time. That is the reason for  the mass casualties. That is the reason we have so many people who die  in school shootings or in movie theaters or in nightclubs or in so many  other settings, and, most recently, in yet another school. The third  vote, of course, was a vote to ban military-style assault weapons.   Knowing I would be facing those votes, which turned out to be in the  early part of 2013, I had to ask myself a basic question, and I think  this is a question a lot of Americans are asking at times like this: Is  there nothing the most powerful country in the world, the most powerful  country in the history of the human race, could do to at least reduce  the likelihood that we will not have more mass shootings, we will not  have more school shootings, we will not go year after year, after  33,000 people lost their lives from gunshot wounds--a number that is  likely to grow if we don't take action. That is the choice: Do almost  nothing, nothing itself, or take action. That is the fundamental choice  we face. That is why we need votes and debates preceding those votes.   It is hard to comprehend that it has been half a decade--5 years-- since we had a sustained debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate on gun  violence. We have had intermittent debates. We have had limited  discussions. We have had some speeches. I guess all of that is helpful,  but we have had no sustained debate on one of the major issues facing  the American people.   They don't expect us to solve this problem in a couple of days or  weeks, but they do expect us to vote, and they expect us to debate.  After 5 years, it is about time we had a sustained debate.   Many of us receive letters on a range of issues, depending on what  the issue of the week is or the issue of the month is. I recently  received mail in a form we don't see enough of anymore--postcards.  These were written by students and individuals too young to even be  referred to as students. Here is one that is only age 5. His name is  Corey. He said in his note to me that he doesn't want to have guns in  his school, and he wants me to do something about it. It goes on from  there in the short note, and he attached some artwork in the back. That  is what Corey said; he doesn't want to have guns in school.   Then there is Mason, who wrote to me and said:         I want to feel safe in school. There should not be guns in       my school.    He goes on to talk about what he is worried about. He said: ``I want  to feel safe in school.''   Then, finally, probably the one who summed up these issues the best  was a young man by the name of Hayden. He wrote to me and said:         I am a 5th grader and I don't feel safe because it is too       easy to get a gun permit. I should not know about this stuff.       I don't feel safe.    Then he ended with this question: ``Am I worth it?'' Then Hayden  asked again: ``Am I worth it?'' He asked that twice in a postcard where  he is just writing a few sentences. Then he put a heart on the other  side. In a few sentences, Hayden is summing up the challenge we face in  the Senate and across the country. He said twice in the same letter:  ``I do not feel safe. . . . I don't feel safe''--something probably  most people my age or in my generation, so to speak, never had to worry  about.   We didn't think of going to school and being threatened by gun  violence. There might have been anxiety in school, there might have  been things we were worried about, but this wasn't one of them. This is  new, and this was a uniquely American problem. No other country in the  world faces this kind of a problem.   We have to ask ourselves if a young person in fifth grade doesn't  feel safe because of these mass shootings, and mass shootings in  school, and then asks us, ``Am I worth it,'' every one of us in both  parties should say: Of course, you are worth it, Hayden. Hayden is  worth the effort to try to keep him safe in school.   If the answer to that question is yes, that he is worth us doing  something about it, then you have to ask the question, What am I going  to do about it? Are we just going to do what we usually do around here,  just don't vote, don't have any sustained debate, and pretend it is not  happening because there are forces out there that have a stranglehold  on the process that say: You are not even allowed to vote, let alone  debate and pass a bill.   There are forces out there that don't even want us to debate the  issue, but I think we can do more to respond to Hayden's request and,  of course, respond to what young people across the country are  demanding.   You have young people who are not old enough to vote yet--and I am  not just talking about Hayden and his postcard but all those young  people who are coming to Washington and going to town squares in small  towns and big cities to march for their lives. Many of them are not 18  years old yet. They can't vote, and they are leading the country,  suggesting to us how to vote, demanding that we take action. It is  rather ironic that this problem has gotten so bad that young people who  still cannot cast a vote are asking us to do our jobs and to vote.   It is not difficult to vote in the U.S. Senate. Usually, you just  have to be standing and put your hand up or thumb up or some indication  to the individuals in the Senate who record those votes. It is not that  difficult. It doesn't require a lot of exertion. It doesn't require a  lot of energy. You just have to be on the floor, be standing, and say  yes or no. If someone wants to vote against all these gun measures, if  they want to vote against background checks and limitation on the high- capacity magazines and still let what we have in American law now,  which is a terrorist can get a gun in America--if you want to continue  that, fine. That is your choice. That is your choice, but at least  vote. At least have the sense of responsibility to vote on a tough  issue.   We will have an opportunity to answer the postcard and answer the  question Hayden asked--is he worth it? I think he is, and I think we  ought to vote.                  Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month    Mr. President, I will be brief. I just want to note one of the  recognitions of this month. I want to take a moment and remind everyone  that March is Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month.   In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated  that 14 percent of children in the United States have a developmental  disability; that is, almost 10 million children. Developmental  disabilities include autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, learning  disabilities, and many other congenital disabilities.   In the past, we took a rather paternalistic point of view with regard  to people with developmental disabilities--taking care of them but not  raising them up and fostering their skills and abilities. This was  shortsighted on our part.   Today, with the help of such laws as the Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act--we heard a lot about that referred to by  its acronym, IDEA--the Americans with Disabilities Act, so-called ADA,  and then my legislation from a couple of years ago, the ABLE Act, each  of these pieces of legislation are breaking down barriers to encourage  and support people with developmental and all types of disabilities.   People with developmental disabilities contribute numerous benefits  to our society. In Pennsylvania, thousands of people with developmental  disabilities are working in competitive, integrated jobs at such places  as SAP, FedEx Ground, PNC Bank, Giant Eagle grocery stores, and many  small businesses throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   People with developmental disabilities make our lives richer and  fuller. As we celebrate them, I pledge--I know this is a pledge many in  the Senate make--to protect their rights and the rights of all people  with disabilities to have equal access to all of our society.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I wanted to pay tribute to my colleague  Thad Cochran as he retires from the Senate after almost 40 years of  service.   Former Senator Margaret Chase Smith once said, ``Public service must  be more than doing a job efficiently and honestly. It must be complete  dedication to the people and the nation.'' Senator Thad Cochran brought  that dedication to the Senate every day. During his tenure, Senator  Cochran has served as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and  the Senate Appropriations Committee, using those positions to help the  people of Mississippi. The Senator's commitment to help alleviate the  poverty in the Mississippi delta is well documented.   As Senator Cochran ends this chapter of his life, I wish him well and  thank him for the decency and courtesy that he consistently brought to  the Senate. We are better for it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Liz Weintraub  of my staff be granted floor privileges for the duration of today's  proceedings.
