 Madam Speaker, I rise today in  support of my bill, the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor  Commemorative Coin Act, which is scheduled for a vote on the House  floor tomorrow.   George Washington himself created the Purple Heart in the closing  days of the Revolutionary War. Since it was  [[Page H7769]]  revived to honor veterans of World War I, it has been awarded to nearly  2 million brave service men and women, yet there is no comprehensive  list of Purple Heart recipients.   The National Purple Heart Hall of Honor located in my district in New  Windsor, New York, was created to collect and preserve the names and  stories of the men and women wounded or killed in service of our  Nation. The proceeds of this coin, which will be produced nearby at the  West Point Mint, will support the hall in its critical mission, along  with other programs that help veterans and their families.   Today, I am thinking of two men who inspired our work on this bill.  One was my dad, who was a Navy vet who was hurt on the USS Manchester  and who taught me the reverence we must have for our service men and  women. The other was Republican Senator Bill Larkin, a New York State  Senator, a dear friend who passed away just days ago. He and I worked  closely to advance the mission of the hall.   I also thank the Military Order of the Purple Heart and volunteers  like Stephanie Keegan, who helped round up 300 of our colleagues in  support of this important legislation and who will make tomorrow's vote  a reality.                            ____________________
