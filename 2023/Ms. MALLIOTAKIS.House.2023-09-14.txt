 Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about how the crisis  created at our border by President Biden's executive orders is  affecting my city and also the Senate's refusal to pass H.R. 2, the  border security act that we passed in May.   In addition, it is only exacerbated by Mayor Eric Adams' insistence  that these individuals who enter our country are entitled to free  housing at taxpayer expense. New York City has now over 200 shelters  and is housing more illegal immigrants than actual citizens of New  York.   Not all of these individuals are innocent asylum seekers. Let's be  honest and let's be clear. First of all, many of them are using the  generosity of this country to gain entry. We know that more than half,  between 50 percent and two-thirds, of these individuals are denied  their asylum cases when they come to court. There are also many who  have already been arrested for committing crimes in our community.   At just one of the 205 migrant shelters, the Roosevelt Hotel, there  have been dozens of arrests, mostly for domestic violence, robberies,  and assaulting police officers, as well. Earlier this year, four  individuals that were housed at the Watson Hotel were arrested for  shoplifting tens of thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise from  Macy's at Roosevelt Field Mall.   Just this week, an illegal immigrant, who was previously released  from Customs and Border Protection and the New York State Police was  arrested for a murder on September 2. He was in our country and on our  streets, despite having a warrant out for his arrest for a previous  stabbing.   There were two individuals who are accused of sexual assault in Erie  County in western New York. Even the Erie  [[Page H4302]]  County executive, an elected Democrat, has had enough of what is going  on, demanding that Mayor Adams pause putting more of these asylum  seekers in his community until these security threats are addressed.   Now, this Monday, we marked 22 years since the 9/11 attacks.  Democrats and Republicans say, ``never forget,'' yet here we are in a  situation with an open border that just in the first 10 months of this  fiscal year, 146 people who appeared on the FBI terror watch list were  apprehended at our southern border. Combined with the last fiscal year,  we are talking about 250 individuals.   What we should be more concerned about, however, are the 1.7 million  individuals who are the got-aways, meaning they had zero interaction  with our law enforcement or our government. They are in the interior of  the country. We don't know who they are. We don't know where they are.  We don't know what their intentions are. That is the estimate that CBP  is saying.   Yes, we have had millions of people cross our border, but guess what?  There are 1.6 million of them who we don't know who they are or what  their intentions are. This should be concerning, considering that the  FBI has just confirmed that ISIS is smuggling Uzbek asylum seekers  across our southern border. An Iranian national was caught in the  interior after Iran has threatened revenge and harsh retaliation  against the United States, and they said they are going to conduct  terrorism on our soil. Yes, the same Iran that Joe Biden just gave $6  billion to.   More than 107,000 Americans died from overdoses last year, and two- thirds of those deaths are attributed to mostly fentanyl. The DEA  recently made over 3,000 arrests of drug cartel networks operating  right here in the United States of America thanks to Joe Biden's open  border. The deaths are equivalent to a commercial airline crashing  every single day.   I ask my colleagues on the Senate side: When are you going to pass  our H.R. 2, our border security act? If the President is not going to  undo his executive orders, we need to take action. The House passed it.  Unfortunately, I think every Democrat in this Chamber voted against it.  Let's see the Senate do its job and pass H.R. 2. If the President is  not going to undo the crisis that he created, then we must do it for  him.                            ____________________
