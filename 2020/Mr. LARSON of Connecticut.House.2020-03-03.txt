 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the  Chamber about one of the most important issues that the Nation faces,  and that issue has only been underscored by the issue of the  coronavirus, and also by the issue of inequality that exists today in  this great country of ours, the wealthiest nation in the history of the  world.   I am pleased to announce the number of people who have risen and come  to support Social Security 2100. It is called Social Security 2100  because we address the needs of Social Security into the next century  so that Social Security will be solvent beyond 75 years and address the  vital concerns of each and every American.   In 2019, 64 million Americans received Social Security benefits  totaling over $1 trillion. For nearly one-third of our elderly  beneficiaries, Social Security benefits are 90 percent of their total  income. Two-thirds rely on Social Security for the majority of their  income. The average benefit in 2019 per American was $17,600 for  retired workers, and that works out to be about $18,000 for men and  $14,000 for women--not enough for most to live on.   Mr. Speaker, 178 million Americans are covered by Social Security  today; 10,000, baby boomers a day become eligible for Social Security.   Social Security helps lower and middle-income Americans the most.  More than 90 percent of benefits go to beneficiaries earning less than  $50,000. Let me repeat that again: more than 90 percent of all the  benefits of Social Security go to people earning less than $50,000 a  year.   That is why the following individuals have supported the Social  Security 2100 Act, including: Social Security Works, the National  Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, the AFL-CIO, the  Alliance for Retired Americans, Paralyzed Veterans of America,  VoteVets, the American Federation of Government Employees, the National  Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Latinos for a Secure  Retirement, the National Organization for Women, SAGE, the National  Education Association, The Arc of the United States, International  Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers representing the  Administrative Law Judges, Consortium for Citizens With Disabilities  Social Security Task Force, Justice in Aging, the Association of  University Centers on Disabilities, Senior Citizens League, the  National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives,  the EPI Policy Center, the National Retiree Legislative Network, Public  Citizen, CREDO Action, Progress America, Other 98, the Daily Kos,  People's Action, the Diverse Elders Coalition, the National Employment  Law Project, Freedom to Prosper, MoveOn, Union Veterans Council of the  AFL-CIO, just to name a few, Madam Speaker.   I want to start today by talking about having Secretary Mnuchin  before the Ways and Means Committee this morning.   I reminded Secretary Mnuchin and complimented the President for  saying in his last two State of the Union messages how he was committed  to protecting Social Security. While he is committed to protecting  Social Security, his budgets have not reflected that, which was a point  of concern we raised with Secretary Mnuchin especially since--to give  President Trump credit here--that during the campaign of 2016 when  faced with 16 other Republicans who tried to force him to say that  Social Security is an entitlement, President Trump, to his credit,  said: No, Social Security is an earned benefit.   I asked Secretary Mnuchin if he believed that Social Security was an  earned benefit, and he said: Yes, it was.   I also asked then, if that is the case, and it is an earned benefit,  it debunks a longstanding concern raised by the other side that Social  Security is somehow an entitlement program when, in fact, every  American citizen knows, because of FICA, exactly what Social Security  is.   FICA stands for the Federal Insurance Contribution Act, but anyone  can go to their pay stub and look at it. Federal Insurance  Contribution--whose contribution?   Your contribution; every American citizen's contribution. It is not a  tax. The tax that is paid by an employer to your benefit is fully  deductible. The employer gets to deduct it. The benefit for your  contribution goes directly to the employee, and they get that in the  way of pension guarantee, disability protection, spousal and dependent  coverage, and a death benefit.                                time  1430    The wisdom of Franklin Delano Roosevelt is also prescient because  they realized back in 1929, after the Great Depression, in this great  capitalistic and entrepreneurial society that we live in, that  sometimes, through no fault of your own, when something as disastrous  as a stock market crash or an unanticipated virus takes place, that  disaster can prevail, and all of a sudden, you would find yourself in a  situation where you had not the means.   Thus, Congress, because of President Roosevelt, adopted the Social  Security Act and paid for it through the Federal insurance  contribution. So this contribution, every citizen knows that it is  their contribution that they make.  [[Page H1466]]    I commended President Trump for having said that, debating his other  Republican opponents. But to date, the administration has not produced  a plan that will protect Social Security, that will, in fact, expand  Social Security the way it needs to be.   In fact, the last time Social Security was expanded, there was a  Republican President, a Republican Senate, and a Democratic House. The  Democratic Speaker was Tip O'Neill. He led that effort. The leader of  the Social Security movement was Robert Dole. The Senate majority  leader was Howard Baker. And the President was Ronald Reagan.   They understood, bipartisanly, that this is the American people's  number one insurance program, the number one antipoverty program.   You know what? We don't even have to go back to 1929 to understand  the impact and the need for Social Security. History and historians are  replete with the stories of the great crash. We have to go back only as  far as 2008 because, in 2008, this country experienced the Great  Recession.   Since that recession, many Americans saw their 401(k)'s become  101(k)'s, and 90 percent of the American people have not recovered  their wealth and assets that they lost in the recession of 2008. Let me  repeat that, Madam Speaker: 90 percent of Americans have not recovered  their wealth and assets from 2008.   During that time, when many lost everything, and companies turned  away from defined benefit contributions and were getting out of the  pension business, during that same time period, Social Security never  missed a payment. Social Security never missed a pension payment, never  missed a disability payment, never missed a spousal or dependent  coverage payment, because it is the full faith and credit of the United  States Government and the Nation's number one insurance plan and the  Nation's number one antipoverty plan.   Most recently, our dear colleague   John Lewis reminded us--and in  June 2019 he rolled out, along with   Danny Davis, Linda Sanchez, Terri  Sewell, Gwen Moore,   Jimmy Gomez, and other members of the Committee  on Ways and Means--the fact that Social Security is a civil rights  issue as well, a civil rights issue that has long gone unaddressed.   It has been more than 37 years since Social Security was last fixed,  and that was under Tip O'Neill, Ronald Reagan, and Howard Baker. It has  been more than 50 years since Social Security was enhanced. Do you  think things have changed for people in 37 years and in 50 years?   Every American listening to this understands that that is the case.  They have faithfully paid into this earned benefit and have gotten, in  return, a benefit, but one that needs to be changed and modified in a  way that is sustainably solvent into the next century and enhanced in  the following ways that people like   Danny Davis have advocated.   Here are the four ways that we enhance Social Security.   Number one, we make sure that no one can retire into poverty. In the  wealthiest nation in the world today, fellow American citizens who have  paid all their quarters into Social Security, who have worked all their  lives, receive a Social Security check that is below the poverty level.  Most of them happen to be women, and most of them happen to be women of  color.   It is the shame of this country that in the midst of the great  prosperity and wealth and, frankly, in the midst of handing out a $2  trillion tax cut of which 83 percent went to the Nation's wealthiest 1  percent, that we could not find the will and the way to help out those  who have worked all their lives and paid into the program.   This is no handout. This is someone who, by the sweat of their brow  and their work, earned a benefit that hasn't actuarially kept pace,  because, in 1983, they didn't index it the way they should have. No one  who has paid in their quarters should suffer for a mistake made by  Congress.   Congress needs to correct that so now the new floor for Social  Security will become 125 percent of what the poverty level is so that  no one who works their whole life and pays in their quarters can retire  into poverty.   The second thing we do is make sure that there is a 2 percent across- the-board increase. Nobody gets wealthy on Social Security. On average,  a male earns approximately $18,000 in Social Security payments and a  female $14,000. Nobody is getting wealthy on Social Security. It is the  subsistence amount of money necessitated to make ends meet. So, a  modest 2 percent increase will be spent right back into the very  communities that they live in.   On average, every congressional district has 145,000 people who  receive Social Security. In each one of our 435 districts, 145,000  people will be spending money back in those communities.   Recognize that this is an economic stimulus bill. In fact, most  recently, Jason Furman, coming before the Committee on Ways and Means,  talked about this as an economic stimulus, as has Larry Summers and  other economists who have taken a look at the ways we need to stimulate  our economy by making sure that those amongst us who need the money  most and who spend that money directly back in the community on the  necessities of life--like heating and cooling their homes, providing  the fuel that allows them to operate their automobiles, making sure  that they have food and nutrition and physical therapy, and paying for  doctor visits and also prescriptions--this is what we are doing to  expand this bill with a 2 percent increase and then also making sure  that there is a COLA that reflects the actual costs that people incur.    How so? A COLA, which the AARP calls CPIE, with ``E'' standing for  elderly, but I would also say standing for the essential benefits that  the elderly need. Again, heating and cooling your home, prescription  drugs, doctor visits, physical therapy, the very food that you put on  your table, these are essential for life. That is what should go into  figuring out what your COLA is, and that is what this bill reflects.   The bill also reflects the idea that a lot of people continue to work  beyond retirement age. But most people don't realize that if you are  single and making more than $24,000, your Social Security is taxed. If  you are a married couple and making more than $32,000, your Social  Security is taxed. Again, back in 1983, they didn't index this. We  changed that. We indexed Social Security. Now, 12 million Americans  will get a tax break because of that.   Making sure that no one can retire into poverty, having a modest 2  percent across-the-board increase, having a COLA that reflects your  actual expenses, and providing a tax break is at the core of this bill.   In the new and added improvements of the bill, including those led by    Danny Davis to make sure that grandmothers and grandparents, to make  sure that students, to make sure that widows are getting extra money to  raise the children that they are responsible for was also included in  this legislation, as well as introducing an earned income tax credit so  that nobody earning $50,000 and below will have to pay an increase in  taxes and in contributions, to make sure that the money is going where  it is needed the most, to help people at the lower end of the pay scale  to get the kind of benefits that the Social Security 2100 Act provides.                                time  1445    And with that, Madam Speaker, I am going to yield to the gentleman  from the great State of Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), as I like to  refer to him--as I have heard no better voice in Congress--the voice of  God.    He is a smart man.    Well, first of all, thank you very much. I  deeply appreciate your efforts, Mr. Davis.   And I love the story about your father, because that just  demonstrates the dignity and the worth of a lifetime of work. But,  still, he wanted to pay, he wanted to continue to contribute, because  he knew how important it was.   And it wasn't any handout. He worked for it all of his life. He  contributed into it.   Now we are faced with a decision in Congress on our watch, not  sometime down in the future, but now.   For you up there listening in the audience, as we speak, this year,  Social Security will start paying out more money than it is taking in.  It hasn't been adjusted in 37 years.   There is nothing that you can leave untouched that requires actuarial  attention--and, specifically, the attention of Congress--that, left  untouched, will continue to flourish. And yet Social Security has never  missed a payment, not for disability, not for spousal or dependent  coverage, and not for a pension. It is America's insurance plan. It is  our number one antipoverty program as well.   That is why I am so grateful that Danny and others have pointed this  out as a civil rights issue, as well, because of the way, for so long,  people of color, especially Black males, have been discriminated  against.   Also, when you look at women and you understand that, for women of  color, they are receiving 56 cents for every dollar their White male  counterparts were--80 cents for White women, 53 cents for Hispanic  women--that is simply unfair.   In this day and age, we can correct that, and we can do it simply by  doing what Roosevelt asked us to do: Make a contribution.   What does that contribution go towards? It goes towards a pension, a  disability payment, dependent coverage, and a spousal benefit.   That is a pretty good deal. You can't buy that anywhere in the  private sector.   I come from one of the insurance capitals of the world, where, when  you went to insurance school, they taught you about the three legs on  the stool; and the most important leg on that stool was Social  Security, because that was the floor, that was the safety net which  nothing could fall through.   We don't ever want to see another crash like 1929. But, again,  understand, since 2008, 90 percent of Americans are struggling because  they haven't recovered their wealth and assets. Sixty-eight percent of  all millennials, who will need Social Security more than baby boomers,  have only Social Security to rely on. They have no pension or 401(k).   While we should do everything to make that more possible, the  plausible reality and what government can do is at hand: First and  foremost, make Social Security solvent; and then, secondly, make sure  it is solvent for more than 75 years and addresses baby boomers and  millennials and future generations, and does so with modest benefits  that end the inequality that exists but also provides basic economic  sustenance so that our economies can thrive.    Both Jason Furman and Larry Summers, and, I think, Secretary Mnuchin  would even agree with this today. They were talking about, in the face  of the coronavirus--which, by the way, is age-related and will impact  the elderly and people in the age groups of 60 to 70 and 70 to 80 far  more than it will impact any other generation, and it will do so in a  way that they better have the wherewithal--they were talking about  means to stimulate the economy.   The number one way to stimulate the economy is to give those modest  benefits to the very people--145,000, on average, in every  congressional district--so those modest benefits are spent directly  right back into the communities that they live in for the necessities  of life that are needed to sustain their existence.   Would you agree, Dan?    Exactly.    We do, and it is on our watch.   I can't emphasize this enough. For every Member of Congress and every  person out there in America who is listening to C-SPAN right now or to  this program: It is on our watch. It is our responsibility. We cannot  continue to kick the can down the road.   Doing nothing means a 20 percent cut to people's benefits.   Let me repeat that again. Doing nothing means a 20 percent cut to  people's benefits.   Now, there are some who are fine with that, but most, on both sides  of the aisle, are not in favor of that.  [[Page H1468]]    Here is what the polling data shows. It shows that Social Security is  bipartisan. Seventy-seven percent of Americans--84 percent of  Democrats, 69 percent of Republicans, 76 percent of Independents--said  that they would be willing to pay a little more to make sure that their  benefits are not cut and that they are protected and expanded.   Also, 91 percent of workers and 94 percent of retirees would feel  betrayed--that is 91 percent of workers, 94 percent of retirees would  feel betrayed--if the money they paid into Social Security was not  available to them.   A Gallup poll found, this most recent one, that Social Security  ranked fourth amongst the things that keep people up at night and  worried with respect to their security, fourth in importance after  education, healthcare, and their financial security--and they often  lump financial security and Social Security together.                                time  1500    I would just like to close.   I mentioned Jason Furman, who was the former Obama National Economic  Council Adviser, and Larry Summers, the former Clinton Treasury  Secretary--both were serving up at Harvard--who have written  extensively about the importance of making sure, as an economic  stimulus and out of necessity, that we make the improvements that  should have been made 37 years ago but desperately need to be taken up  today, not only for current generations and baby boomers retiring, but  for millennials and future generations.   Alicia Munnell, the current Director for the Center for Retirement  Research, former member of the President's Council of Economic  Advisors, former Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy, and former  senior vice president at the Federal Reserve in Boston, said we have to  protect Social Security: Policymakers should fix Social Security by  raising, incrementally, over time, the money necessitated to do it. It  doesn't come from heaven.   We need to maintain benefits. People don't have anything else other  than their 401(k)s, and a specific portion of the population doesn't  even have those. Social Security is the forced savings plan that people  have paid into and have counted on, and, as I have said before, it has  never missed a payment.   Monique Morrissey, economist from the Economic Policy Institute:  ``Expanding Social Security . . . ensures steady contributions; it  keeps costs low and prevents leakage; and it pools longevity risk.  Moreover, Social Security's pay-as-you-go financing . . . provides an  internal rate of return tied to economic growth . . . but without the  gyrations.''   Dean Baker, senior economist for the Center for Economic and Policy  Research, if Social Security 2100 becomes law, ``it would both improve  the program's benefit structure and its financial picture. . . . After  adjusting for prices, wages have risen 1.5 percent annually over the  last 5 years.'' Social Security 2100 would only be a small impact on  the pay increase of a new FICA tax.   This was in Economy for All on November 12, 2019. The Congressional  Budget Office also reports this.   This will be the only bill that we will be able to vote on this year  that both reduces the national debt by $525 billion and expands and  improves Social Security.   Let me repeat that again.   CBO has said that Social Security 2100 is both PAYGO compliant and,  because the program is fully paid for, reduces the national debt by  $525 billion over time and enhances the existence of Social Security,  making it solvent for future generations beyond 75 years.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K.  Davis), if he has a final word.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time.                            ____________________
