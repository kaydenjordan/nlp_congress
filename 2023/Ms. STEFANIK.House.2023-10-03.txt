 Mr. Speaker, anyone and everyone who knows Kevin  McCarthy, whether they are a friend or foe, knows that Kevin McCarthy  is a happy warrior. He is tireless. He has that uniquely American grit.   Under Kevin's speakership, that lasted 15 rounds of him never giving  up, this Republican majority have exceeded all expectations:   We reopened the people's House.   We passed the strongest border security bill in our Nation's history.   We passed an energy plan to unleash American energy dominance.   We passed Defense bills to support our troops.   Under Kevin's leadership, he has brought hundreds and hundreds of  bipartisan Members of Congress to Israel, our greatest ally.   He elected the most diverse class of Republicans ever, with the  largest number of Republican women ever in American history.   This boy from Bakersfield, he cares deeply about his constituents,  his country, and the American people, and that includes each and every  one of his colleagues.   He has been to our districts, toasted at our weddings, celebrated the  birth of our children, mourned the loss of our loved ones, and has  cheered us when we haven't believed in ourselves, which is why the  Republicans strongly support Speaker McCarthy and are proud he is our  Speaker.   Now more than ever, the Republicans must unify. The stakes are too  high. We need to save our country, which is why this Conference is  proud to strongly support Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House of  Representatives.
