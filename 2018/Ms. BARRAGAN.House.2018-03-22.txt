 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Colorectal  Cancer Awareness Month. This type of cancer is the second leading cause  of death in the United States.   Each March, we raise awareness about this terrible disease and spread  the word about the importance of getting screened. If you are 45 years  or older, please get yourself screened early.   The disease poses an especially high risk to African-American men and  women who have the highest rate of death and the lowest survival rate  among all Americans. This is why I am proud to support funding for  programs like the Colorectal Cancer Control Program, which was  established specifically to address disparities in screening rates and  to improve access to underserved populations.   Along with the Affordable Care Act, which requires the coverage of  screening tests, we can provide the healthcare that Americans need to  stay cancer free.                            ____________________
