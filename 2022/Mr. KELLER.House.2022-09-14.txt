 Mr. Speaker, today, we recognize the late Ricardo  Marques, Jr., an outstanding American who passed away in July after  battling cancer.   Everything that Rick did in his accomplished life was done for his  family and in service to our great Nation. Rick was a marine who  defended our Nation honorably prior to joining the Bureau of Prisons.   Rick spent nearly 30 years with the Federal Bureau of Prisons,  working at both USP Lewisburg and FCC Allenwood in Pennsylvania's 12th  Congressional District prior to retiring.   Having toured both of these facilities, it is clear that the men and  women who work there are outstanding individuals. I can tell you, Mr.  Speaker, that it takes an enormous amount of fortitude and sacrifice to  do that work.   Everyone who knew Rick remembers him as a natural-born leader and as  a man who left a lasting impression of love and respect on everyone he  encountered. America is better off because of Rick's contributions and  work.   It is my hope that Rick's family finds comfort in his legacy and  lifetime of service.                            ____________________
