 Mr. Chair, I rise today to advocate for the Chemical  Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program, often referred to as CFATS,  and in support of my amendment included in the en bloc to improve  training for the facility inspectors who advance this critical work.   Since 2007, CFATS has helped thousands of sensitive chemical  facilities strengthen their security posture and reduce onsite risks.   I am particularly invested in the CFATS program because there are  four facilities covered by the program in New Jersey's Eighth  Congressional District, which is also home to what homeland security  experts call the 2 most dangerous miles in America.   For my constituents, it is vitally important to ensure that these  facilities, their workers, and surrounding communities are adequately  protected.   Two months ago, this Chamber passed a reauthorization of the CFATS  program to prevent its lapse at the end of July. Unfortunately, our  colleagues in the Senate have not advanced this critical national  security priority, and the CFATS program has lapsed.   We are no longer able to inspect the more than 3,000 high-risk  chemical facilities covered by this program, enforce security measures  at those facilities, or vet individuals who are seeking to access  dangerous chemicals.   It is also critical that the CFATS program is fully funded. My  amendment supports robust CFATS funding, particularly for improved and  regular training of facility inspectors.   This amendment builds on my earlier work on the Committee on Homeland  Security to update the CFATS program and improve training for facility  inspectors.   Our facility inspectors deserve our full support so that they can do  their best work to keep us safe. I will continue to fight for this  funding as we move forward in the appropriations process.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
