 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this morning, our Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee had a hearing, and one of the members  came up to me on the floor and said: That was the most civil hearing I  have attended in the Senate in a while. The truth is that most of our  hearings in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee are  civil. We have Senators of widely different points of view.   I thank Senator Murray, the Senator from Washington State, who is the  ranking member of our committee and a member of the Democratic  leadership, for the way that she and the Democratic members of the  committee worked with the Republican members so that we can have the  Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. Adams, and Dr. Francis  Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health, who is one of  our country's most esteemed scientists and the man who headed the human  genome project, there for 3 hours and we can ask questions. Virtually  every Senator participated, and we got some good answers.   I would like to report to the other members of the Senate about that  hearing. I began it by saying: I have been rereading the book ``Guns,  Germs, and Steel,'' a book by Jared Diamond, written in 1997, which is  as relevant today--maybe more relevant today--than it was when he wrote  it.   Mr. Diamond, who won the Pulitzer Prize and is a professor of  geography in California, said: There is nothing new about mass  epidemics that causes deaths and social upheaval that we are witnessing  today, and there is nothing new about where most of those epidemics in  history have come from. Diseases that caused those deaths for the last  10,000 years, he says, have come mostly from animals that transmit them  to humans, and during most of history, there were three ways to deal  with these epidemics.   One was to isolate the infected, as in, for example, leper colonies  to deal with leprosy. One was, according to Mr. Diamond, that over  thousands of years, there have been genetic changes in the human  population in response to the infectious diseases that have gone  through those populations, and they have produced a resistance to the  infectious diseases, as in the case of smallpox. Of course, that didn't  do much to help the Native Americans in this country when European  settlers, who had some resistance to smallpox, arrived here and gave  blankets to the Native Americans that were infected with smallpox or  contained smallpox and wiped out 90 percent of the tribes who received  them because they didn't have that resistance.   There is a third way of dealing with epidemics. Throughout most of  history, the most common way was to let the epidemic run through the  population until everyone had been either killed or recovered and  developed some resistance to the disease. Diamond says that the Black  Death killed about one-third of Europe's population between 1347 and  1351 as it ran through the population killing people.   Now, what is new about dealing with epidemics is modern medicine.  Modern medicine has given us ways to diagnose these diseases and to  create treatments to make it easier to recover from these diseases, but  the true miracle of modern medicine is the vaccine--a vaccine that can  prevent humans from acquiring the disease at all. The Senator from  Tennessee and I have actually worked together on that issue 2 or 3  years ago to encourage people, and, in her words, talk to your doctor  if you have a concern about a vaccine. That is what we want to talk  about today.   Today, in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, school children  are required to take vaccinations for a series of diseases--diphtheria,  tetanus, whooping cough, measles, rubella, and chicken pox--before  entering school.   That vaccination will protect the child from getting the disease,  which in turn prevents the child from infecting someone else--a pattern  that eventually causes these diseases to disappear.   Americans of my generation remember how polio terrified our parents  in the early 1940s and into the 1950s. Many saw their children die of  polio. When I was very young, I can remember classmates who were  strapped into iron lungs so they could breathe and were destined to  stay there for the rest of their lives. The lucky ones were like  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was left only with a limp after  having polio in the 1940s.   The disease terrified Americans until Dr. Jonas Salk discovered the  polio  [[Page S5491]]  vaccine in 1955. After the vaccine was developed, the United States  undertook a large-scale vaccination campaign, and polio was declared  eradicated from the United States by 1979.   The purpose of the hearing we had this morning was to explore the  remarkable progression that science is making toward a COVID-19 vaccine  and to remind parents to have their children get their childhood  vaccinations and to encourage as many Americans as possible to take the  flu vaccine this fall.   First, the progress toward the COVID-19 vaccination--Dr. Collins, the  Director of the National Institutes of Health, talked about that. He  talked about the vaccine research and development, including Operation  Warp Speed, which is working to develop, manufacture, and distribute  safe and effective vaccines as rapidly as possible.   He told us there are six vaccines currently under development. He  reminded us that the Federal Government, using taxpayers' money, has  helped accelerate this by providing money to manufacture these vaccines  before they are deemed safe and effective and that he does not  necessarily expect all of the vaccines to work. And if they don't work  or if they are not safe, they will be thrown in the dumpster. They will  not be distributed to anyone to use.   He pointed out that AstraZeneca announced today that 1 person in its  clinical trial--which probably has 30,000 people in the UK--had  developed an illness and they had paused the trial. In other words,  they stopped giving shots to the volunteers in the clinical trial until  they could see whether the illness is related to the vaccine.   Some people believe that Operation Warp Speed means cutting corners,  but it does not. It refers to the extraordinary investment in research,  development, and manufacturing scale-up for the COVID-19 vaccine.   Perhaps most significantly, the Biomedical Advanced Research and  Development Authority--we call it BARDA--has taken the unprecedented  step, as I mentioned earlier, to speed up manufacturing for hundreds of  millions of doses early in the process by buying those doses in advance  so they can be ready to distribute as soon as the vaccines are approved  by the Food and Drug Administration.   Several of our Senators on both sides of the aisle asked Dr. Collins  and Dr. Adams, the Surgeon General, whether they intended to let  politics play a role in the decision about whether a vaccine is safe  and effective and ready for distribution. They answered absolutely no,  that they would be no part of such a decision.   The same has been said by Dr. Stephen Hahn, who is the Commissioner  of the FDA charged with making that judgement. ``This is going to be a  science, medicine, data decision,'' he said. It ``is not going to be a  political decision.'' That means if it is not safe, it will not be  distributed.   At the same time, the Centers for Disease Control is working on a  plan to distribute the vaccine as soon as they are authorized or  approved, prioritizing vaccines for healthcare workers and vulnerable  populations. The CDC says its plan will be a fair system informed by  nonpartisan health experts from the National Academies of Sciences,  Engineering, and others.   Some have suggested--of course, this is a political season; we have  an election in 2 months--that the reason we are rushing, as a  government, to create the vaccine is so it will help President Trump  before the election in November, or that the reason the Centers for  Disease Control said to the States: Get ready now to distribute the  vaccine when it is effective and safe--that that is a political move.   Of course, I said that if Dr. Collins and Dr. Adams had come in and  said it would be 5 years before we had a vaccine, we would probably ask  the President to fire them, because people are dying, and we need  vaccines. We don't want the alternative, which is to run the disease  through millions of Americans until everybody either dies or is  infected and recovers, and we don't want to have happen again what  happened before with the H1N1 virus, where the vaccine was ready, but  the States weren't ready to distribute it. So we were pleased to see  what the response was   Americans are saying that they might not take the vaccine. The first  question people ask is, Are they safe? They are safe because they are  reviewed by the FDA, which is the gold standard for safety. Vaccines  are routinely given to children. They are specifically recommended by  an advisory commission that looks at it carefully, consisting of  doctors and physicians and scientists.   In a 2015 article for the Scientific American, a distinguished  scientist wrote:         By age two, most children will receive almost 30 shots       designed to boost a child's natural defenses against disease.       Yet at the same time, parents who take their children for       those recommended vaccinations might be inundated with Web       site and celebrity-espoused rumors making false claims that       shots are not necessary or cause autism.    This distinguished scientist wrote:         At best, navigating this landscape can be confusing. But       when weighing the risks of encountering life-threatening       disease against the benefits of receiving a vaccine there's       no contest. The vast majority of children do not experience       anything worse than short-lived redness or itching at the       spot of the injection.    I asked Dr. Collins this question, which I think is confusing to some  people: When you take the COVID vaccine, you don't get COVID? There was  a time in the old days when to get a smallpox vaccine, you, in fact,  got a little smallpox. But that is not what happens. As Dr. Collins  explained it, he said the vaccine creates a sort of machine within your  body and your immune system to fight the COVID. It doesn't infect you  with the disease.   Then there is the question about whether the vaccines are effective.  I talked about how polio is now eradicated. The number of polio cases  since the vaccines has fallen rapidly to less than 100 in the 1960s and  less than 10 in the 1970s thanks to the successful vaccination program.  According to the Centers for Disease Control, the United States has  been polio-free since 1979. Diphtheria was a terrifying prospect for  parents in the 1920s, but according to the scientific agencies and the  government, there are only a few of those a year.   Then there is the concern about whether the doctor's office is safe.  I have heard that from people, but the studies have shown that the  pediatricians--and we heard that testimony today--have made great  efforts to try to make their offices the safest places that a parent  can go with their child in order to get a vaccination.   Finally, I started my comments this morning with comments from Jared  Diamond, and I concluded with a warning he wrote for the Wall Street  Journal. He said in effect that the main thing that is different about  this disease, COVID-19, is not that it is more infectious; the main  thing that is different is the jet plane--the plane that can carry  people all over the world, all over our country, spreading whatever the  infection is. He said that as a result of that, the next pandemic could  be next year.   That is why I have introduced in the Senate legislation that would  help prepare for the next pandemic. It has support on all sides.  Senator Frist from Tennessee, the former majority leader; Senator  Daschle, the former majority leader on the Democratic side; many  experts--all say we have a problem in this country going from panic to  neglect to panic. While we have taken some important steps, as Senator  Burr pointed out today, to create the authority for the government to  build manufacturing plants, to manage stockpiles better, to be prepared  for pandemics, as soon as the epidemic is over, we move on to something  else. So the time to deal with the next pandemic is now.   There is specific legislation to make sure that we sustain funding  for onshore manufacturing so we are not relying on China, India, and  other countries to make our vaccines for the next pandemic. There is  money to make sure that the stockpiles are filled with protective  equipment so we don't have the kinds of delays that some people  experienced in this pandemic.   Former Governor Mike Leavitt said to our committee that we have  underfunded public health for the last 30 to 40 years, and when we  underfund public health and the next pandemic comes, we are not as  ready for it as we should be.   Fortunately, thanks to an unprecedented effort by scientists around  the world, preparation by Republican and Democratic administrations  over the  [[Page S5492]]  last 20 years and several Congresses, we have done a lot to be well  prepared for this pandemic, and we are moving more rapidly than we ever  have to create new diagnostic tests, new treatments, and new vaccines.  Some of the challenges that remain are how to distribute them, to whom  they should go first, and how to persuade Americans they are safe to  take.   But while we are in the midst of dealing with all of this, it would  be wise to remember that any legislation that we pass in Congress this  year dealing with this pandemic should also take steps to make sure  that our stockpiles are filled, that our manufacturing plants can stay  functioning, and that public health State by State is well funded,  because, as Jared Diamond said, the reason to do that now, while our  eye is on the ball, is because the next pandemic could be next year.   I yield the floor.
