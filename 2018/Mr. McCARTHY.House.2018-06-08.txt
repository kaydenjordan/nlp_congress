 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On  Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and at 2 p.m. for  legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On  Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour  and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9  a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no  later than 3 p.m.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  today. All of these bills will be focusing on one thing: fighting our  Nation's opioid epidemic.   America has the greatest mission statement in the world: form a more  perfect Union. This is our task here.   I am encouraged by all of the good things I am seeing around the  country. We have 6.7 million jobs open. We have just created our  millionth job since the tax cut has been passed. Unemployment is tying  a 50-year low. In fact, Mr. Speaker, in the last 49 years, there has  only been 7 months where unemployment has been below 4 percent, and two  of those months were April and May that we just went through.   Americans' net worth has increased to $100 trillion. That is $7  trillion since the election, the highest we have ever seen. We also  just passed last night, Mr. Speaker, the largest rescission package in  the history of Congress.   But I also know that it is our responsibility to work every day to  make our Nation even stronger. So, Mr. Speaker, we are in the middle of  the deadliest drug crisis in history. For the first time, drug  overdoses are now the leading cause of death for Americans under the  age of 50. 174 of our friends and family, our neighbors, are lost every  day to substance abuse. Simply put, we need all hands on deck to attack  this crisis.   That is why we will bring over 60 bills from eight different  committees to the floor in the coming weeks to combat this crisis and  save lives. This includes:   H.R. 5788, the Securing the International Mail Against Opioids Act,  sponsored by Representative  Mike Bishop. This bill will close  loopholes in international shipping to stop the flow of synthetic  opioids;   Next, H.R. 5735, the THRIVE Act, sponsored by Representative  Andy  Barr, which would establish a pilot program for evidence-based  transitional housing nonprofits that have experience in recovery and  skills training;   H.R. 2851, the Stop Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic  Analogues Act, sponsored by Representative  John Katko. This bill will  enable law enforcement to more swiftly respond to synthetic drugs and  keep our communities safe.   Along with numerous other bills, passing these will truly help us  form a more perfect Union.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my friend across the  aisle. We are no strangers to droughts in California, but a 44-year  championship drought is quite something. So congrats to my friend's  beloved Washington Capitals on finally winning Lord Stanley's cup. It  was a fun series to watch. It was a well-deserved victory for your team  and for all of the fans of this region.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The answer to the question is yes.   I believe the farm bill is incredibly important for so many reasons.  The food and agriculture industry drive more than 43 million jobs, over  a quarter of all American jobs.   And it is what you talked about earlier. Yes, the economy is moving  so well after the tax cut: more than 3 million new jobs, more than 1  million just since the tax cut bill went through, we recently reached.  [[Page H5002]]    And the other challenge we now find ourselves in, and it is an  interesting challenge we haven't found ourselves in in quite some time:  there are 6.7 million jobs out there, but only 6.3 million people  looking for them. It has been the reverse for quite some time, and we  are actually in a stronger position, so we need to have job training.   The uniqueness of this farm bill, it provides those able bodies who  do not have underage children, that we are going to give them the  training to help them get into the workforce. So it is just more good  news, and our intention is to pass that this month; and as soon as it  is scheduled, I will inform all Members.    Well, I thank my friend for yielding, and this is just  a clear example of the difference in philosophical opinion.                                time  1200    We had this same debate when it came to the tax bill--that it was  going to be Armageddon; if people got bonuses, it would be crumbs; and  that we would be in a really worse position than we are.   Well, as we found out, Mr. Speaker, that is totally untrue. The  economy is stronger. Again, in the last 49 years there has only been 7  months in the history of America where unemployment was below 4  percent. Two of those seven months are April and May of this year. We  just hit 1 million new jobs, based upon that tax cut. More so since the  election. Household wealth has increased by $7 trillion just since the  election.   Now, this is the philosophical difference. Currently, two-thirds of  able-bodied adults report no earned income at all. Why?   Because the SNAP program is letting them down. Not a single child or  family who currently qualifies will be cut off. Our proposal only  applies to those age 18 to 59. It exempts pregnant women, individuals  who are mentally or physically disabled, and the primary caregivers of  a child under the age of 6. What we do is give them the job training to  get back into the workforce.   Because of that, according to the Foundation for Government  Accountability, 83 percent of Americans support work requirements for  SNAP. That includes 71 percent of Democrats. Unfortunately, when that  bill came to the floor, every Democrat said no.   Mr. Speaker, that was the same thing that happened when we gave the  American public tax cuts and created new jobs and the lowest  unemployment--unemployment claims gives you the best projection of  unemployment--in 44 years. Forty-four years, Mr. Speaker.   Do you know another statistic that just came out?   Small businesses are the greatest creators of new jobs. Since 1974  they have always surveyed them and they asked them this question: Is  now a good time to expand?   Mr. Speaker, remember what a small business is. They don't have a  great amount of capital. It is at its highest level since they took  this poll.   So I don't mind having a philosophical difference of agreement,  because there is a contrast between us. There is a contrast in  philosophy. One believes it would be Armageddon if you let people keep  more of what they earn. The facts don't pan out. Thankfully, we were  successful, Mr. Speaker. The American people can keep more.   The other thing that happened, Mr. Speaker, is that 48 out of 50  States have a lower electrical bill. Also, in one company, 1.2 million  of their employees have longer maternity leave.   The sad part is, I wish I could have sat here and said: As America,  making it a more perfect Union, this whole body voted for it.  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, one side had to carry the load.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I would be upset, too, if I voted against every economic bill brought  to this floor that had the opportunity to grow America--and the  statistics prove it.   It is not me saying it. It is The New York Times. To be frank, Mr.  Speaker, I don't think they have ever said many nice things about  Republicans. But this is what they said about the economics of today:  ``We ran out of words to describe how good the job numbers are. The  economy is in a sweet spot, with steady growth and broad improvement in  the labor market.'' That is The New York Times.   I don't have a problem if you are upset by the fact that the economy  is exactly what we said would happen if we got the economic changes we  desired. Just as when we looked at deregulation, we will continue to  make this move forward.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I have heard many times on the other side of the  aisle in these colloquies: Work with us. Work with us on CHIP.   But, Mr. Speaker, they are being directed by people higher up not to  work with us in the committee, just as they said not to work with us on  the farm bill, when we were working together the whole time. But we  kept the things they wanted inside that bill.   Just as we voted on this floor a little earlier today, there was a  message that went out from the leader on the other side to not vote at  all. So they held their votes until it passed, and 23 brave, courageous  individuals on the other side broke from the letter that the leadership  asked them not to vote for.   What was it about?   It was about VA and veterans.   I think you have got to stop playing politics.   Just last night on this floor, Mr. Speaker, I heard from my dear  friend who was very concerned because there was an agreement and the  trust was going to be broken. Even though at the end of the day he  couldn't vote for that agreement and trust that we worked so hard  together on in an omni, that if we did anything in a rescission package  to cut funding that the taxpayers would want us to do, that he couldn't  deal with the omni.   So I took him at his word. He said: You had 1, 2, 3 years in these  committees. They just sat there in these programs.   There is a program in there that has $4.7 billion parked by the Obama  administration to help fund electric cars. What was the one automotive  company that went bankrupt and took the money as well? Fisker. That is  $4.7 billion. Nothing has been done on that since 2011.   So I took him at his word. We worked with the administration. We  brought the largest rescission package here, because, yes, we want to  take care of this debt. We think it is the responsibility of everybody  here. But, no, those words rang hollow that day. There wasn't a vote  for that, but we were able to pass it anyway.   I look right here at the Economic Cycle Research Institute in October  2016. It is their numbers. There was a 2 percent average growth under  Obama versus 2.7 under Bush. In terms of average pace of GDP growth,  Obama's was the slowest expansion on record. The numbers prove  otherwise on what you say, but the most important thing it proves is  that people are working. People care about the security of their job.  People care about the security and safety of the country.    I feel very thankful that next week our President will be sitting  down with the leader of North Korea with the hopes that we can make  this world more secure.   We are building the security of jobs. We are building the security of  the world. I would firmly believe: Let the American public judge  whether they are better off today than they were a few short years ago.   I don't need numbers to show it. I can just see every statistic, the  jobs, the people, and I am proud of that fact.   I ask, Mr. Speaker, the other side to follow through. I have heard  time and again: I would never shut the government down; we wouldn't go  that political. But when the day came, they did.   Politics and the election are over. Let's put people before politics.  Let's make sure this country is secure economically and secure with  safety around the world. And that is exactly what we are doing here.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I said it before, and I will say it again: Republicans are committed  to solving this issue for good, not passing a bill and patting  ourselves on the back, but for dealing with this issue in a meaningful  way that is beneficial to hardworking Americans.   As you know, my door is always open. You have been there many times.  I am committed to bringing all Members to the table and working  together to solve this problem.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, I need to go to a meeting dealing with this  subject. I am late to it right now. But we will continue to work to  solve this problem.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that, when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Tuesday, June 12, 2018,  when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.
