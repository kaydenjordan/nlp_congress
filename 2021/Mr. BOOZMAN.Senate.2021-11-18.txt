 Madam President, I rise today to recognize the  2020-2021 National FFA officer team who recently retired at the 94th  National FFA Convention and Expo in Indianapolis, IN. Team members  include president Doster Harper of Georgia, central region vice  president Paxton Dahmer of Missouri, eastern region vice president  Miriam Hoffman of Illinois, western region vice president David Lopez  of California, southern region vice president Artha Jonassaint of  Florida, and from my home State of Arkansas, National FFA secretary  Anna Mathis.   The Future Farmers of America was founded in 1928 by a group of young  farmers with dreams of developing an organization to address the  challenges of feeding a growing population. Their leadership was  founded on their experience and passion for agricultural pursuits. Now  known as the National FFA Organization to represent its diverse  membership, FFA grows the next generation of leaders, builds  communities, and strengthens agriculture. There are 735,038 middle and  high school FFA members in 8,817 chapters in all 50 States and Puerto  Rico.   Each year, six student members are elected to represent FFA as a  national officer. They serve the organization at the highest level,  promoting FFA and inspiring members, advisers, staff, teachers, alumni,  and supporters. These individuals pause their educational pursuits and  other commitments for an entire year in order to fully dedicate  themselves to bettering the organization and the agricultural industry.  National FFA officers spend time attending, speaking at, and  facilitating FFA camps, conferences, and conventions and often meet  with donors, stakeholders, and alumni. Additionally, national officers  serve as members of the National FFA board of directors, a testament to  FFA being a student-led organization. It is no secret that these young  leaders have a profound impact on the future of the organization and  agriculture.   The 2020-2021 National FFA officer team led the organization with  character, determination, and grit in the midst of a global pandemic.  During this year and a half when many schools moved online and  extracurricular activities at school, such as FFA, were unable to meet  and continue normally, it is remarkable that, under this team's  leadership, the number of FFA chapters in the organization increased  despite the hardships faced. Their tenure as a national officer  concluded after planning and leading the 94th National FFA Convention  and Expo. The largest youth convention in the country, this year's  convention drew over 60,000 registered attendees.   Behind every great team are hosts of people who support them. I  commend the families, staff, advisers, teachers, mentors, students,  alumni, and others who supported these leaders and FFA. Their tenacity  and leadership is encouraging to those they serve and to myself. I had  the opportunity to visit with these national officers during their year  of service. It has been an honor to meet and interact with this team. I  am ever-increasingly optimistic about the future of agriculture,  especially with passionate, dedicated leaders like themselves at the  helm. Doster, Anna, Paxton, Miriam, David, and Artha, I wish you the  best in your future endeavors and congratulate you for your year of  service as the 2020-2021 National FFA officer team.                            ____________________
