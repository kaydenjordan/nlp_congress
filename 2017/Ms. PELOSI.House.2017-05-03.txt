 Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished ranking member for  her recognition and her leadership on this legislation that we have the  opportunity to vote on. So I thank Ranking Member Nita Lowey.   I thank the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey, Chairman  Frelinghuysen, for his leadership as well. And I commend his staff,  Nancy Fox, and others for their hard work on this; and to Ranking  Member Lowey, Shalanda Young, Chris Bigelow, my own staff Richard  Meltzer, and House and Senate staff members for getting us to this very  important place.   The omnibus reflects significant progress defeating some dangerous  riders, which I think are dangerous, and securing key victories.   Here is the thing: I spent many years in the Appropriations  Committee. And I know, left to your own devices, the Appropriations  Committee can find your common ground. You appreciate each other, you  grant each other your positions on issues, and you understand the art  of negotiating in a successful way.   There were some items that were suggested other than from the  committee. From the White House, for example, a border wall,  deportation force, things like that, 160 poison pills, which were  ranging from undermining a woman's right to choose to dismantling Dodd- Frank, et cetera. But you all worked together to balance the equities  and come up with a bill that will have, I believe, broad support in the  Congress, certainly bipartisan support in the Congress.   But just not to speak about what we didn't like about the bill, there  are some very positive aspects of it that I want to recognize--some  nondefense increases in spending, which will save lives and create  jobs.   Coal miners' health. We were so proud to secure more than $1 billion  to deliver permanent health benefits to thousands of coal miners and  their families who stood to lose their health benefits this month. God  bless them for their advocacy. It was so important to our discussion.    Opioid epidemic. An additional $600 million for fighting the opioid  epidemic.   Protecting EPA. There was going to be a huge cut, and now just a 1  percent cut in the EPA. We see that as a success.   Year-round Pell grants. So important.   Science funding. The omnibus increases funding for energy efficiency  and renewable energy, the Department of Energy Office of Science, and  ARPA-E, all initiatives that some wanted to cut but were happy had  survived that interest in cutting.   Our colleague, Congresswoman Velazquez, has led us on the Puerto Rico  issue. The omnibus includes vital funds to stabilize Puerto Rico's  underfunded Medicaid program, which threatened so many of our fellow  Americans in Puerto Rico.   Democrats are very happy and give credit to, in a bipartisan way, led  by Congresswoman Barbara Lee, securing nearly $1 billion in  humanitarian assistance to alleviate famine resulting from more drought  and displacement in Africa and the Middle East, saving countless lives  around the world. Left without assistance, maybe 1.5 million children  would die of malnutrition in the next 6 months in Africa.   And then it takes us to biomedical research. I served with Mrs. Lowey  and others on the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee for many years.  And the National Institutes of Health is this place that has the  Biblical power to cure. It has scientific opportunity. And where there  is scientific opportunity, we want to place additional resources. Lives  depend on it.   So in stark contrast to the skinny budget that came out earlier, this  legislation increases funding for the National Institutes of Health by  $2 billion. And I want to say on that, as we relish that $2 billion and  what it could mean to the good health of the American people, we have  to protect our investments.   As we invest in new treatments and cures, we must also ensure that  all Americans have access to them. That is why it is curious to me that  on the same day that we vote on this omnibus bill and increase funding  for the National Institutes of Health, increase funding for our  veterans, and all the rest of that, Republicans are working furiously  to advance TrumpCare's devastating impact on America's health care. No  matter what anybody says to you about activities they are having today  to tweak one piece of the bill, it will still be a bill that has higher  costs, forcing families to pay higher premiums and deductibles and out- of-pocket costs. This will block some people from access to the  lifesaving cures that we are investing in the National Institutes of  Health to create.   Less coverage will take coverage from 24 million hardworking  Americans.   Higher costs.   Fewer people covered.   Veterans tax. TrumpCare will deny tax credits for health care to 7  million military veterans.   TrumpCare destroys protections for preexisting conditions. So many of  the investments at the National Institutes of Health that we are  talking about are to find cures and to find preventions. But when we  are trying to find cures, that means that the people we are trying to  cure have a preexisting medical condition. This would destroy the  guarantee protection for a preexisting medical condition and gut the  essential health benefits in the Affordable Care Act.   There is a crushing age tax. If you are 50 to 64, you will pay five  times higher than others pay for health care.   It undermines our investments in Medicare.   So I mention this because I have always thought, when I sat on that  committee year in and year out, day in and day out, hour on hour,  listening to the challenges facing America's families for illnesses  that they were suffering, a diagnosis that they were frightened by,  that what they wanted us to do was to invest in a cure, but that meant  access to that cure.   So they are trying to say: Well, we are going to help with high-risk  pools, and that is going to neutralize everything I said about higher  costs, lower coverage, et cetera. But the conservative Mercatus Center  said: ``The amendment at hand focuses on high-risk pools, but the $8  billion amount is a pittance.''   And said: ``Spread over 5 years, it's a fifth of a pittance.''   That was Robert Graboyes, a healthcare expert at the conservative  Mercatus Center.   Karen Pollitz, a healthcare expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation,  said that the additional $8 billion would likely not be enough to make  the high-risk pools workable. She said that would be enough money to  cover costs for only 1 percent of the individual market.   So, again, let us protect the investment that we are making. Let us  elevate it with pride and say $2 billion for the National Institutes of  Health.    But what does that mean to you, the average American, if you can't  have access to that in a way that is affordable?   Again, 51 years ago, Dr. King said, and I say again, because I say  this all of the time: ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in  health is the most shocking and the most inhuman because it often  results in physical death.''   So, again, this appropriations bill is a way for us to help meet the  needs of the American people. This Appropriations Committee did an  excellent job in resolving differences and putting forth a balance of  equities as we go forward.  [[Page H3298]]    But let us not give with one hand and take away with the other as we,  in the same 24-hour period, say: Aren't we wonderful. $2 billion for  medical research.   Under the Republican's healthcare plan, it will most likely benefit  the privileged few at the expense of America's working families.   That is not what we are supposed to be doing here. That is what we  are taking pride in. What we are taking pride in is of the great  possibilities, but let's make those possibilities available.   And I say that as one who served for many years on the Appropriations  Committee, one whose goal in life was to sit on the Labor-HHS  Subcommittee and to increase the funding of the National Institutes of  Health, but to do it for the purpose of all Americans having access.   Having said that, getting back to this omnibus bill, again, I am very  proud of the work of Nita Lowey, of the ranking members of the  subcommittees, and of the staff who worked so hard. I am especially  proud of the work, also, of our distinguished chairman, Mr.  Frelinghuysen. I join him in recognizing the work of his subcommittee  chairs on all of this. It is a product to be proud of. I thank Mr.  Frelinghuysen and Mrs. Lowey.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.                                time  1545
