 Mr. Speaker, I stand here in disbelief at how Washington  is trying to run this economy. That is the reason I ran for office  because things were so bad, and it was impossible to grow your  business.   I am reminded of what we actually did when we had the House, and the  Congress, and the White House. We passed the Constitutional Review Act.  Through that act, we got no help from the other side, and then we  passed some tax reform to give people more money to invest in their  businesses.   Let me tell you what happened. For the first time in my life we  became energy independent. For the first time we became an energy  power. We had more jobs than people looking for jobs. So what happened  now? Joe Biden was the Vice-President when I was elected. He is now the  President. All those executive orders he signed stopped everything we  did to put this country on the right track.   Mr. Speaker, I am tired of this. I demand immediately that we stop  this war on American energy that is driving up costs and stop  overregulating our ag producers.
