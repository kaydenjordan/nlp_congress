 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to continue my discussion about the  case for a bigger Navy, a bigger fleet, and to endorse the requirement  of the experts in the Department of Defense that we move to a 355-ship  Navy.   When a crisis strikes around the world, the President asks his  national security team: Where are the carriers? Where are the aircraft  carriers?   Each of our carriers is a 100,000-ton giant, accompanied by an entire  carrier group that consists of mighty warships and aircraft. The  carrier, itself, represents 4.5 acres of sovereign U.S. territory.   In early January of this year--and Senators do not know this--a  strange and profoundly disturbing thing happened. The answer to the  Commander in Chief's question, had it been asked at that point--where  are the carriers?--would have been that none of them had been  deployed--not a single one. For the first time since World War II, the  United States had no carriers deployed anywhere--not in the Persian  Gulf, not in the Mediterranean, not in the Western Pacific.   There is a gap in our global carrier presence, and there is a gap in  our fleet. This comes from years of complacency. Also, it comes from a  different set of facts that we are faced with and a different set of  challenges that we are faced with in our quest to make our presence  known and to protect our national security interests on the open seas.  We have ignored the great naval competition that is taking place  elsewhere--the fact that it is accelerating. We have taken our Navy and  our sailors and marines for granted.   Simply put, the Navy we have today is too small. We cannot accomplish  the critical missions that we have by preserving the status quo. Right  now, we have 277 ships, and we need to get to 355 ships. That was  reiterated today by the Chief of Naval Operations and the Secretary of  the Navy in a hearing before the full Armed Services Committee.   I will reiterate to my colleagues and to the American people what the  Navy does for America and why the current fleet is too small to meet  current and emerging challenges.   First, the global presence of the Navy ship matters to American  prosperity--to the quality of life of Americans. Ninety percent of  global trade is seaborne. Maritime traffic has increased by 400 percent  over the past quarter century. In addition to commerce, nearly all  intercontinental telecommunications transit via a web of undersea  cables. Undersea cables are responsible for nearly all of our  intercontinental telecommunications.   Second, a strong Navy deters aggressive behavior and reassures our  allies as the Nation's first-on-the-scene force. A strong Navy can help  keep bad situations from spiraling out of control and getting worse.  For example, the President recently dispatched multiple carrier strike  groups to the Sea of Japan following North Korea's missile tests. The  President asked where the carriers were, and he dispatched them to a  place of crisis. A mix of ships gives our Commander in Chief a range of  military options, and their deployments to areas of instability can  send a message of resolve to our friends and foes alike.  [[Page S3531]]    Third, if deterrence fails, our naval forces can provide a decisive  response to aggression. Surface ships, submarines, and the aircraft on  the carriers can launch missile strikes, control air and sea traffic,  and intercept missile threats. The recent U.S. action in Syria is a  good example, as the Presiding Officer knows. In using destroyers in  the Mediterranean, the Commander in Chief delivered precision strikes  against Syrian airfields. He enforced the redline against outlawed  chemical weapons, and President Assad has not crossed that redline  again.   Accomplishing these missions as the Nation's sentinel and first  responder requires a big Navy. Admiral John Richardson, the Chief of  Naval Operations, put it best in ``The Future Navy'' white paper that  was released last month. He said:         Numbers matter. The number of ships in the Navy's fleet       determines where we can be, and being there is a key to naval       power.    Again, the current fleet of about 277 ships is way too small. It is  important to remember that not all ships are deployed or deployable. In  fact, only about 100 ships out of the 277 are currently deployed. The  other two-thirds are undergoing heavy maintenance, routine sustainment,  or are training to deploy. The Navy recently validated its requirement  for 355 ships--a 47-ship increase over the previous requirement.   The lack of ships has created coverage gaps all over the world. I  will give two examples.   First, the commander of Pacific Command, ADM Harry Harris, recently  told Congress he has only half the submarines he needs. Admiral Harris  is responsible for deterring China and North Korea, but he is missing  half of the submarines he needs. Closer to home, the commander of  Southern Command, ADM Kurt Tidd, has zero Navy ships permanently  assigned to his area of operations. These are just two of the many  alarming instances where the lack of ships is having major  consequences.   While we watch our edge erode, America's real and potential  adversaries are building the size and capability of their fleets. They  are on the field competing while, in America, many of our players are  still in the locker room.   China is building a modern navy capable of projecting global power.  China is modernizing every type of ship and submarine in its fleet.  China commissioned 18 ships last year. In April, China launched its  first domestically built carrier and plans to build at least six more  carriers. By 2030, China will have more than twice as many attack  submarines and four times as many small surface ships as the United  States. Beijing is developing its first overseas naval base in the Horn  of Africa. China's naval buildup may attempt to push the United States  first out of the Western Pacific, away from critical trade chokepoints  and our allies in South Korea and Japan.   I would call the attention of Members to the poster that I have, and  I hope it is printed large enough for my colleagues to see. In terms of  five types of ships, it compares where we were in 2000, where we are  today, and where we are projected to be if current trends continue.   For example, on the farthest column shown on the chart, in attack  submarines--and the black portion of each circle represents China's  capability, and the blue represents our capability in the United States  of America. In 2000, it was 64 to 55 in favor of the Chinese. In 2016,  as we can see, 56 to 57. But under current projections, by the year  2030, when it comes to attack submarines, the Chinese will have 87 and  the United States will have only 42--a disturbing trend which the Navy  would like to reverse if we have the ability and the wisdom to give  them the requirement they have said they need.   With regard to ballistic missile submarines, in 2000, quite a  mismatch--only 1 for China as compared to 18 for the United States;  then, only last year, 4 for China and 14 for the U.S. Navy; and then  projected for 2030--and really that is in only 13 short years, which is  hard to believe--there will be more Chinese ballistic missile  submarines than American ballistic missile submarines unless we take  the Navy's requirement to heart and take action beginning this year to  rectify that situation.   With regard to small surface ships, as we can see, there was a 79-to- 62 advantage in sheer numbers in 2000 and a 103-to-23 advantage of the  Chinese in 2016. In 2030, there will still be a mismatch, in terms of  numbers, of 123 small surface ships compared to only 40 for the United  States of America.   With large surface ships, it was 20 to 79, then 19 to 84, and by the  year 2030, as we can see, the Chinese are projected to have 34 large  surface ships.   With regard to aircraft carriers, as I pointed out, they were not in  that game at all in 2000. They delivered their first last year, and  they are projected to go to four by the year 2013.   It all adds up to 260--a 260-ship fleet for China and only 199 for  the United States unless we act, and act responsibly, in response to  what the Navy and the Marine Corps and the best military minds in the  Pentagon are telling us, and I hope we will do that.   An increasingly aggressive Russia is also modernizing. The Kremlin is  pouring money into new attack and nuclear ballistic missile submarines.  Russian submarine patrols have doubled, and those patrols are  stretching closer to the U.S. homeland. The Russian Navy's operating  areas have expanded to include regular operations in the Baltic, Black,  Mediterranean, and Caspian Seas. Russia is also exploiting new  opportunities in the Arctic by building naval bases in the High North.   So both China and Russia are investing heavily in their fleets and in  new ballistic and cruise missiles that can target U.S. naval forces.   And, of course, we need to turn to the subject matter of North Korea.  Kim Jong Un will stop at nothing to develop a nuclear weapon that can  strike our allies and that can strike deployed U.S. forces and  eventually our homeland. A nuclear ballistic submarine would  essentially make North Korea impervious to threats of preemption. North  Korea is building fortified submarine bunkers and began testing  submarine-launched ballistic missiles within the last year.   Iran is another rogue state developing a massive fleet of fast attack  boats and mini-submarines to deny the free passage of ships through the  vital Strait of Hormuz.   Naval competition is a fact. China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran  have clearly been building up the size and the sophistication of their  fleets. The Chief of Naval Operations has a word to describe the pace  of competition, and that word is ``exponential.'' The CNO puts it this  way:         Time is an unforgiving characteristic of the maritime       [environment]. Things are moving faster, including our       competitors.    So let's start competing again. Building a larger fleet is a national  project. It will require sustained commitment by the President, the  Congress, and the Department of Defense. As chairman of the Seapower  Subcommittee, I intend to begin laying a firm foundation this year for  a significant buildup in the future, and I hope my colleagues will join  me.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
