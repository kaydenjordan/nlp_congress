 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R.  2, for added flexibility to funding that goes to local Economic  Development Administrations.   As we fight this pandemic, our communities have relied on EDA funding  in regard to other revolving loan funds. As we progress through this  crisis, however, those same communities will start to look at forms of  economic recovery and should be able to use those same funds to repair  roads, bridges, and water systems; to support downtown revitalizations;  and to help market tourism.   That is where H.R. 2, with my amendment, can help all of our  communities, by allowing recipients of these revolving loan funds to  first lend out those funds and then, after those loans have been  repaid, to repurpose that money and use it for new infrastructure  projects that initially were outside the purpose of the revolving loan  fund.   This type of flexibility will allow our communities to best target  Federal dollars as needs change over time.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I urge passage of this amendment and passage  of H.R. 2.
