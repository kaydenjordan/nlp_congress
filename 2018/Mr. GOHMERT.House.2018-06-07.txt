 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment prohibits the use of funds  to prepare, propose, or promulgate any regulation or guidance related  to the social cost of carbon.   Social cost of carbon metric was a tool, and is a tool, used to  bolster many Obama-era regulations. They supposedly targeted vague,  ambiguous, and unverifiable costs.   In an article this week, The Wall Street Journal points out that by  introducing ``social costs'' and ``social benefits,'' the EPA began  factoring in speculation about how regulatory inaction would affect  everything from rising sea levels to pediatric asthma, EPA optimists  even including their guesses about how domestic relationships could  have a global impact.   Meanwhile, the Agency ignored the best practices from the Office of  Management and Budget, juking the numbers to raise the cost of carbon  emissions. This proved as politically useful as it was scientifically  imprecise.   Months before introducing the Clean Power Plan, the EPA suddenly  raised these social costs of a ton of carbon emissions to an average of  $36 from $21, completely unverifiable.                                time  2230    Now, the regulatory specifics will be hashed out in coming months,  but there is really potential here to curb the distortions that mask  bad policy.   If Mr. Pruitt succeeds, future cost-benefit analyses will be more  consistent and transparent. The reform would help to ensure regulation  is based on sound, scientific analysis instead of wishful bureaucratic  thinking.   Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, this is ultimately a tax on the Nation's  poor. The rich, they can handle these added, superfluous costs that  come out of the nebulous areas of bureaucrats' minds, but the real  ultimate cost is actually to the Nation's poor.   I can't help but go back to a woman, an elderly lady that lived  outside of Carthage, Texas, that said: ``You know, I keep having these  costs go up and up and up. I am afraid I am going to end up in my home  going back to a wood-burning stove because of the Federal Government.''   And I said: ``I really hate to be the one to break this to you, but  your wood-burning stove you used when you were growing up that your  mama used probably wouldn't be allowed today.''   Anyway, there is no reason to have this kind of cost, and I would  urge a passing of this amendment. Let's quit adding nebulous,  unverifiable costs.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I really have such great respect for my  friend across the aisle, and I do truly mean that. But when I hear talk  about what Republicans did to our Nation's poor and our seniors, I keep  coming back to the ObamaCare vote, without a single one of the  Republicans voting for that bill. Democrats have to take full credit.  They passed it without a single Republican vote and cut $716 billion  out of the healthcare of seniors.   Now, President Obama told them: Seniors, you don't have to worry. It  will only come out of the pockets of the rich, greedy doctors.   Well, what our folks have found out is that is not the case at all.  It has affected the elderly completely. It has been a real problem for  them, because what they have seen is that, actually, if their  healthcare provider doesn't get paid, they don't get their healthcare.   So I would just like to say again, I need to urge people to vote for  this amendment. Making our Nation's poor pay for ambiguous, unverified  costs and saying we are somehow making the world better while they are  making the poor poorer is absolutely unsubstantiatable, and I would  urge a ``yes'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
