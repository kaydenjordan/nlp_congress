 Mr. Speaker, April is Financial Literacy Month, the perfect  time to remind Americans just how financially irresponsible Democrats  are. Democrats have used the pocketbooks of hardworking Americans to  fund a multitrillion-dollar spending spree and now have the audacity to  deny responsibility for the inflation crisis. This includes extending  the student loan repayment moratorium three times, costing taxpayers  over $150 billion.   Democrats are financially irresponsible and are dragging student  borrowers along with them. In January, the administration announced it  would no longer require borrowers to sign an online acknowledgment  about their total student debt each year before taking out additional  loans. We should make it easier for student borrowers to understand the  gravity of taking out tens of thousands of dollars in student loan  debt, not hiding it from them.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats' policies don't promote financial literacy,  they promote financial illiteracy.                            ____________________
