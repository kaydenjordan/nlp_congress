 Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator  from Alabama. Before I start, I should note that we have votes  scheduled for 12 noon, and I may go a little bit over that, so I ask  unanimous consent that I be allowed to finish my whole statement.    Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama and I have been  friends for decades. Our wives have been friends, as the Presiding  Officer knows. We have different political philosophies, but we join  together in wanting to make the Senate work the way it should work and  the way it used to work. We have done that in these appropriations  bills. It means that the Senator from Alabama has had to decline some  things in this bill that he might have liked otherwise, but I have had  to do the same. That is why we are here today.   The two bills in the package before us--the Defense bill and the  Labor-HHS-Education bill--are a product of hard work and bipartisan  cooperation. I am pleased that those of us working together have been  able to work out the differences between the House and Senate bills. It  goes way beyond the procedures, way beyond working together.   These bills make important investments not only in our national  security but also in the future of our country for us, our children,  and our grandchildren. They demonstrate the importance of the  bipartisan budget agreement we reached earlier this year.   The Labor-HHS-Education bill makes new investments in healthcare and  education. We increase funding for the National Institutes of Health,  the jewel that we have here in this country. We invest in working  families by improving access to childcare and promoting college  affordability. We provide new resources to combat the opioid epidemic-- something that hits every single State represented in this body. The  Defense bill provides critical resources to support our men and women  in uniform and their families and invest in national security.   I am glad we do not have controversial poison pill riders on either  the right or the left in here. What we did is we did our job. We  focused on what we should be doing--making responsible, thoughtful  decisions on how to fund these Federal agencies. We left controversial  policy issues out of it. If people want to have debates on those, then  bring up separate bills and debate them up or down.   We have a continuing resolution to keep Federal agencies up and  running through December 7. That is to make sure we don't face a  government shutdown in the event we don't finish our work on the  remaining bills. We never want to fund the government by continuing  resolution; that is inefficient and actually wastes money. That is why  Chairman Shelby and I have worked so hard to get the appropriations  process back on track. We have more work to do. We are still in  conference on a four-bill minibus. We should finish that work and send  it to the President's desk before the start of the fiscal year so we  won't have a CR on those agencies.   This will be a far more effective, cost-saving, efficient way of  doing things, and it can be done. In fact, I think the chairman would  agree we are very close to an agreement. Most of the funding issues  have been resolved. We do have some controversial poison pill riders.  We shouldn't delay this package over unrelated policy matters that have  no place on must-pass spending bills. Get the poison pills out and pass  the bills.   There are four bills--the Interior bill, the Financial Services bill,  the Agriculture bill, and the Transportation-HUD bill. These are  programs that are important to the American people. They should not be  frozen at fiscal year 2018 funding levels--not even for a few months.   The rest of them are so close. Look at the Agriculture bill. It  provides critical support for our farmers all over the country and  rural communities through investments in rural development and housing,  agriculture research, and clean water programs. Every State in this  Nation has rural communities--and I think of especially my own State of  Vermont--and farm economies that benefit from these programs. They  shouldn't have to operate under a CR.   The Financial Services bill supports regulatory agencies that the  American people rely on to protect them from unfair, unsafe, or  fraudulent business practices. We should fund these agencies in a  responsible way, not put them on autopilot.   I am also pushing to include cost-of-living adjustments for Federal  civilian workers in the final bill. That is not provided for under the  CR. Failure to pass this bill on time and with a cost-of-living  adjustment included will mean 2.1 million Federal workers will not see  a pay raise, including doctors and nurses serving our veterans and FEMA  employees responding to Federal disasters.   The Interior bill is important. It means our children and  grandchildren will enjoy clean air and clean water. It supports  important conservation programs, including funding for our national  parks. It also provides funding for fire suppression. We just had a  fire season that has been one of the worst in recent memory.  [[Page S6208]]    Finally, we are close to a deal on the Transportation, Housing and  Urban Development bill. I hope we can finish negotiations on this bill  this week. This is our Nation's infrastructure bill. I worked very  closely with Senator Shelby on this. We want to rebuild our crumbling  bridges and roads. We want to invest in our communities and create jobs  for thousands of workers across this country.   Funding the government is one of Congress's basic responsibilities. I  would urge my friends in the other body to do what Senator Shelby and I  have done. Drop poison pill riders so that we can send this bill to the  President before October 1. We can do it. I realize we need 60 votes in  the Senate. We don't have poison pill riders, so that should be easy to  do. We can get 9 of the 12 bills across the finish line by October 1.   I am pleased we are going to be voting on the Defense and Labor-HHS  package today. I thank Chairman Shelby and the chair and ranking  members of the subcommittees, Senators Blunt, Murray, and Durbin, and  the staff of the Appropriations Committee. We never could have done  this without the hard work of both the Democratic staff and the  Republican staff.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the names of all those staff members.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Charles Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jessica Berry, Jay       Tilton, Jean Kwon, Erik Raven, Alex Keenan, David Gillies,       Brigid Houton, John Lucio, Andy Vanlandingham, Mark Laisch,       Lisa Bernhardt, Kelly Brown, Catie Finley, Teri Curtin,       Shannon Hines, Jonathan Graffeo, David Adkins, Mary Collins       Atkinson, Brian Potts, Laura Friedel.        Mike Clementi, Colleen Gaydos, Katy Hagan, Chris Hall, Hanz       Heinrichs, Kate Kaufer, Jacqui Russell, Will Todd, Carlos       Elias, Michael Gentile, Ashley Palmer, Jeff Reczek, Courtney       Bradford, Robert Putnam, Christy Greene, Jenny Winkler, Clint       Trocchio, George Castro, Hong Nguyen, Valerie Hutton, Elmer       Barnes, Penny Myles, Karin Thames.     Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I think we are ready to vote.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, as a member of the British-American  Parliamentary Group, I would like to take a moment to recognize the  70th anniversary of the creation of the United States-United Kingdom  Fulbright Commission.   In the aftermath of the Second World War, Congress took steps aimed  at creating a more peaceful and prosperous world. The Fulbright  Program, along with the World Bank and the IMF, are reminders of the  importance of collective action for the common good. Since 1946, the  Fulbright Program has fostered bilateral relationships through  educational exchanges with postgraduate and postdoctoral scholarships.  In the words of Senator J. William Fulbright, ``the vital mortar to  seal the bricks of world order is education across international  boundaries, not with the expectation that knowledge would make us love  each other, but in the hope that it would encourage empathy between  nations . . . .'' Those words are as relevant today as they were back  then.   Over the last 70 years, thousands of students from the United States  and the United Kingdom have crossed the Atlantic to deepen their  understanding of each other's countries and cultures. Fulbright  scholarships have not only been the catalysts for great artists,  journalists, scientists, lawyers, independent scholars, and many  others; they have cemented friendships around the globe for  generations.   I invite my fellow Senators to celebrate the many Fulbright scholars  and emerging leaders who have worked in countless ways to foster  tolerance and understanding in their communities, countries, and around  the world. In my 44 years in the Senate, I cannot think of a time when  those attributes were more needed than they are today.                            ____________________
