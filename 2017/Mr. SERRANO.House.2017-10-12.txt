 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   This bill is a first step in helping Puerto Rico and the Virgin  Islands recover from the devastation of Hurricane Maria. It will  provide FEMA and the governments of the islands with the funds needed  to address immediate relief needs and begin the recovery process.   I do want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their  commitment to this issue and for taking my phone calls at all different  times, on weekends. You have been very helpful and very supportive.                                time  1230    Both will be visiting the island tomorrow and will be able to see  firsthand the dramatic and comprehensive needs that Puerto Rico is  facing.   Right now, 85 percent of the island still lacks electricity more than  3 weeks after the hurricane hit. One-third of the island doesn't have  access to clean drinking water. Most of the island still lacks cellular  service, hampering the vital information to deliver assistance in the  areas that are needed.   Federal employees on the island now are doing important and vital  work, but we need more boots on the ground. This funding provides them  with the resources needed to do that in the short term.   But to succeed, there needs to be a commitment from the highest  levels of government to ensure the recovery of all areas that are part  of our Nation, including its territories. Unfortunately, given the  President's latest Twitter rant this morning, it seems unlikely that we  have that focus and commitment.   So it is up to us in Congress to make sure that the Federal  Government doesn't forget about Puerto Rico, and that is what I intend  to do in the days and months ahead. But to both of you and to our  membership here, thank you for not forgetting Puerto Rico. This is an  ongoing battle and an ongoing issue.
