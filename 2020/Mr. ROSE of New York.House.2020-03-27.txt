 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  bill because each and every day new workers, people in my own  community, are dying.   I rise today in support of this bill because our front line soldiers  of this war--our nurses and our doctors--need masks.   I rise today because days from now, weeks from now, New Yorkers will  need thousands of more ventilators.   I rise today because hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers have been  laid off.   And I rise today in support of this bill because this virus doesn't  see party affiliation. Today, we rise as Americans, not Democrats or  Republicans.   Mr. Speaker, lastly, I rise today in support of this bill because  this is just the beginning. More work will need to be done. New York  needs more help, but we are Americans, and we can get the job done.
