 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Lucas for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the CHIPS Plus Act.  This legislation has the potential to bring transformational  investments to my district in central New York and will take long  overdue steps to shore up our domestic supply chain for semiconductors.   Significantly, this measure has the support of pillars from the  previous administration on national security and economic matters: Mike  Pompeo, former Secretary of State, supports it. Wilbur Ross, former  Secretary of Commerce, supports it. Mark Esper, former Secretary of  Defense, supports it. Robert Lighthizer, former U.S. Trade  Representative, supports it. And Robert O'Brien, former National  Security Adviser, supports it.   That is impactful to me, and it should be impactful to all Americans.   All of these former administration officials recognize the inherent  danger of ceding ground on technological development to the malign  Chinese Communist Party; and like me, I am sure none of these officials  will support the partisan reconciliation package the Democrats are  cooking up to raise taxes.   We can't control that. We are not in the majority. This is a separate  bill, and we need to focus on what we are voting on today, not  tomorrow, not next week, not next month. It is vital that we pass this,  and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting CHIPS Plus.   I will note this in closing: Whatever we invest in today we will get  back many times more by the private investment and all the economic  growth it is going to spur.
