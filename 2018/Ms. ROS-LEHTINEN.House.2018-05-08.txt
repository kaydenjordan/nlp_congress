 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Casa  Familia, a nonprofit organization in my congressional district  dedicated to serving individuals with special needs.   Casa Familia was founded by eight families with special needs  children, and I am proud to have known one of the founders, Lourdes  Sanchez, for many, many years. They came together to solve a very real  problem in south Florida: the lack of affordable, quality housing for  individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, or IDD.   Sadly, close to 1 million Floridians are diagnosed with an  intellectual or developmental disability and are unable to live  independently. That is where Casa Familia comes in. This outstanding  organization provides affordable housing solutions, vocational  [[Page H3788]]  training, and employment services for adults with IDD.   Casa Familia is also planning an integrated residential community  that will offer a variety of recreational activities and educational  programs to ensure that residents continue to grow and develop.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank everyone at Casa Familia for all  that they do to improve the lives of so many individuals and help them  achieve their full potential.                            ____________________
