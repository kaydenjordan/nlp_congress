 Madam Speaker, for hours at Sea-Tac International  Airport on Saturday, I worked with colleagues from the Port of Seattle,  the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, the ACLU, and our Governor to  get people who were being held to be released because of President  Trump's Muslim ban.   In the utter chaos, I found a gentleman who had come from Somalia to  be reunited with his wife. He had all of his legal papers; but,  instead, he was blindly turned away without any due process. We were  able to get two other individuals released--one from Yemen and one from  Sudan--after a brutal and determined effort to literally stop the plane  that they had been boarded onto in order for them to be deported.   This wasn't just in Seattle, Madam Speaker. This happened at airports  across the Nation. Our office has been contacted by dozens of people  who are absolutely terrified. These are students, legal permanent  residents, and businesspeople who do not know anymore what their place  in this country is. Simply put, this is un-American and  unconstitutional.   I, myself, immigrated when I was 16 years old, and it took me 19  years to become a citizen. I am intimately familiar with the barriers  that people face in our immigration system, and I hope that all of the  Members of this Chamber will welcome immigrants the way we always have.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask that this House bring up H.R. 724,  which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban on children, like 16- year-old Afghani boy Sardar Hussein, who lost his family in a car bomb  and now hopes after nearly 2 years of ordeal to get on his flight to  America.
