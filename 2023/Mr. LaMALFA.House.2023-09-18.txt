 Mr. Speaker, during the month of August, we had several  wildfires break out in my district up in Siskiyou County at the top of  California.   As you know, our Federal wildland firefighters are on the front lines  battling the blazes and preventing them from spreading to populated  areas and burning down all of our forests and the habitat that is in  them.   They are doing their jobs, working 16-hour days often, grueling heat,  remote rugged terrain, and what happens?   The new food vendor for the Forest Service tried serving them beans  and rice on bread on the far side there and then moldy cheese  sandwiches for our firefighters that we ask to be out there in risky  conditions and tough, hot conditions as well.   What an insult. What a slap in the face as they have a national food  vendor trying to provide meals like that that actually would cause harm  to their health as well as just the sustenance they need to work hard.   In light of all this, we also find that the Klamath National Forest  supervisor who fired this food service vendor was later investigated by  the Forest Service higher-ups, and they only backed off because a  scandal was made public.   Since then, it has been corrected, thanks to that Klamath Forest  supervisor, and these unacceptable conditions are not going to  continue.   The American people expect accountability for our firefighters and  for our workers.                            ____________________
