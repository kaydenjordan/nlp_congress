 Madam Speaker, as the sole Florida Member serving on the  house Small Business Committee, I rise today in support of replenishing  the Paycheck Protection Program.   While the program is far from perfect, it has been undeniably  effective. Before the original funds were exhausted, 88,000 businesses  in my home State of Florida received almost $18 billion in forgivable  loans, money that saved jobs and businesses, all in just 13 days.   Beyond numbers, what is important is the people that this program  serves. I think of a family-owned bowling alley that has been in my  district for almost 30 years, one that I took my kids to when they were  growing up. With their PPP loan, they are now able to keep and pay  their 90 employees and stay in business, so now my grandchildren can go  there, too.   I think of a home healthcare provider that cares for senior citizens.  With their PPP loan, they have kept a dozen employees on the payroll  and can continue to care for our Greatest Generation.   While no government program is perfect, this one undeniably helps  people in difficult times, and for that I support it.                                time  1345
