 Madam Speaker, I have heard stories from people across  Alaska, some of the most rural and distant parts of our country, of  about 20 people sharing a house with only three bedrooms and one  bathroom. They sleep in shifts because they don't have enough space.   Without enough places to live, people are being forced out of their  communities, the communities they love and the Native cultures they  were raised in.   The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act, or  NAHASDA, is called the backbone of Indian housing for the essential  support block grants and financing it guarantees in order to develop  critical affordable housing and community facilities. However, 15 years  of inflation since the last reauthorization has decimated housing  production.   I am asking Congress to reauthorize and properly fund NAHASDA. We  cannot force Alaska Natives to make a choice between the communities of  their place-based cultures or a roof over their head.                            ____________________
