 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 852 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 852         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (S.J.       Res. 33) joint resolution relating to increasing the debt       limit. All points of order against consideration of the joint       resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Ways and Means or their respective designees; and (2) one       motion to commit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman  [[Page H7809]]  from Texas (Mr. Burgess), my distinguished colleague from the Rules  Committee, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, today, the Rules Committee met and reported  a rule, House Resolution 852, providing for consideration of S.J. Res.  33, a joint resolution relating to increasing the debt limit, under a  closed rule. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Ways and  Means, or their designees, and provides one motion to commit.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to adopt the rule and  support lifting the Nation's debt ceiling.   Failing to lift the debt ceiling and defaulting on our debt is not an  option. If we do not act, a default could result in the loss of  millions of jobs and $15 trillion in household wealth, according to  nonpartisan Moody's Analytics economist Mark Zandi. Mr. Zandi has  characterized a default as ``financial Armageddon,'' and JPMorgan Chase  CEO Jamie Dimon has gone even further, stating that a default ``could  cause an immediate, literally cascading catastrophe of unbelievable  proportions and damage America for 100 years.''   Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of former Treasury Secretaries  wrote to Congress arguing that protecting U.S. creditworthiness is a  ``sacrosanct responsibility.'' I couldn't agree more.   Let's be clear about what we are talking about here today. The debt  limit is the total amount of money that the United States Government is  authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations, including  Social Security and Medicare benefits, payments to veterans and  servicemembers, and tax refunds. The debt limit does not authorize any  new spending; it simply allows the government to pay its bills for  obligations it has already incurred.   Mr. Speaker, much of this debt was accrued on a bipartisan basis. It  includes emergency measures to combat the pandemic and increase defense  spending. While many on the other side of the aisle have tried to tie  raising the debt ceiling to our efforts to pass the President's agenda,  it should be noted that 97 percent of the total national debt accrued  before President Biden even took office.   Since 1960, Congress has acted 78 times to address the debt limit, 49  times under Republican Presidents and 29 times under Democratic  Presidents. In the last 10 years, the debt limit has been addressed  seven times on a bipartisan basis, including three times under the last  administration, during which, I would like to remind my Republican  colleagues, $7.8 trillion of the total national debt was incurred.   Arguments about raising the debt ceiling have become nonsensical. In  the current discourse, both sides of the aisle have agreed to spend  Federal dollars on important programs, but only one side of the aisle  believes that we should actually fulfill our obligations to pay our  creditors for those very same programs.   Mr. Speaker, if we choose not to honor our obligations to creditors,  what message does that send to the American people and, frankly, the  rest of the world? Everyday Americans pay their bills and honor their  commitments. Why shouldn't we do the same?   Mr. Speaker, it is frankly outrageous to hold the position that we  shouldn't be held to the same standard as families who work hard to  find a way to pay their bills every day.   I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying  legislation to raise our Nation's debt ceiling, ensuring that America  can continue to pay its bills and honor its obligations.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Those who know me know I am not a very sophisticated guy, and they  also know I am not a financial wizard; but I will tell you this: I  would love to have a philosophical debate, maybe sit down, have a cup  of coffee with the distinguished gentleman from Texas, and we might  even find some common ground about what our practices ought to be  relative to spending and taxing and all those things.   But to be clear, none of what Dr. Burgess just talked about has  anything to do with what we are doing here today. Ninety-seven percent  of the debt that we have incurred as a Nation happened before Joe Biden  took office.   As for Build Back Better, which many on our side of the aisle are  working to try to enact, that is something that is prospective. We are  talking tonight about paying the bills of things that we have already  agreed to pay for. It has absolutely nothing to do with it.   I appreciate the distinguished gentleman because he is trying to  bring into this debate many things which have no relevance here,  apparently to make a better case, but the truth is we have a decision  before us that is a serious one. It not only affects the  creditworthiness of the United States, but it affects global markets.  This would be, as I indicated earlier, catastrophic. This is Armageddon  if it doesn't happen.   Just to note, in 2016, prior to the election of the previous  administration, the national debt was $19.5 trillion or 105 percent of  GDP. In 2020, when the administration's time had run its course, the  debt had risen to $27.7 trillion or 129 percent of GDP, a $7.8 trillion  increase. Included in that was a $1.9 trillion tax cut, which hasn't  paid for itself, which has added dramatically to the debt. But the debt  has been accumulated during decades of real need by the American  public.    So we could have a conversation; and, frankly, the discussion about  spending takes place in the Appropriations Committee, it takes place in  the Budget Committee, taxation takes place in the Ways and Means  Committee. What we are doing now is making a decision to pay our bills.  Fundamentally, bottom line. It doesn't require a whole lot of  sophistication or talk about financial markets. It is clearly a simple  question, are we going to pay for the things that we have agreed to  buy, and that is it. It is as simple as can be.   Every household in America makes those decisions. You get something,  you get a bill in the mail, you pay for it. Even if you have buyer's  remorse, even if your wife says to you that fine exercise thing that  you bought, which is going to be the most expensive coat hanger in the  house because you are not going to use it, we still pay for it because  it is in the house, and we bought it. That is as simple as it can  possibly be.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate Mr. Smith's enthusiasm and exuberance. The arguments  that folks would make that House Democrats are responsible for the  spending of the Trump administration and the Trump White House, that  argument is, frankly, absurd and happened during a global pandemic, so  we had much work to do to spare the American public.   But I am going to do this: Moved by the spirit of the season, I am  going bestow a gift on Members, and I am not going to rebut point by  point but rather reserve the balance of my time and allow my colleague  to speak.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I wonder, when the gentleman finished his home's renovations if he  paid the contractor or refused to pay because he might be tempted to do  renovations in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First, let me echo Dr. Burgess' comments about the vaccine. I want to  encourage every American to get that vaccine. We still have far too  many people who have chosen not to get the vaccine and the third dose,  for those who are eligible, under the messenger RNA, to do a third  shot. But we encourage every single American to do it, and I want to  make sure to repeat that. I join with my colleague in thanking those  who made that possible.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank all of my colleagues for their work in  support of the rule before us today. As I mentioned earlier, protecting  U.S. creditworthiness is a sacred responsibility, and it would be an  abdication of that  [[Page H7812]]  sacred responsibility to fail to address the debt limit and ensure that  the United States Government pays its bills.   We have heard a lot of rhetoric today, but we all know that the  measure before us today is not about new spending. No matter how many  times it is said, it is not about new spending.   We are acting today to ensure that America can pay its obligations  that we have already agreed to incur. Pretending otherwise is a  disservice to the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 852         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. The provisions of Senate Concurrent Resolution 14       shall continue to have force and effect for all purposes in       the House, except with the following revisions:        (1) In title II--        (A) strike ``increase'' in each place it appears and insert       ``decrease'';        (B) strike ``by not more than'' in each place it appears       and insert ``by at least'';        (C) strike each dollar amount and insert ``$,100,000,000'';       and        (D) strike ``September 15, 2021,'' in each place it appears       and insert ``December 31, 2021,''.        (2) By adding at the end the following:         TITLE V--POLICY STATEMENT ON INFLATION AND RECONCILIATION       SEC. 501. POLICY STATEMENT ON INFLATION AND RECONCILIATION.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following as it relates       to the inflationary impact of the policies of the Democrat-      controlled Congress and Biden Administration:        (1) President Biden's Fiscal Year 2022 budget request       assumed inflation, under the Administration's policies, would       amount to two percent in 2021, 2022, and over the next       decade.        (2) Actual inflation under the Administration's policies       has totaled more than three times these estimates.        (3) Since Joe Biden took office, inflation has increased at       an annualized rate of more than seven percent, the highest       level in 40 years.        (A) Gasoline prices have increased by 58 percent on an       annualized basis.        (B) Household energy prices have increased by 13 percent on       an annualized basis.        (C) Meat prices have increased by 14 percent on an       annualized basis.        (D) According to the Congressional Budget Office,       `Inflation has eroded the purchasing power of families'.        (4) There is a clear link between the Democrats' reckless       out-of-control deficit spending and the inflation crisis       Americans currently face. After one year of Democrat control,       House Democrats have passed $7.5 trillion in new spending--      more than the Federal Government has ever spent in any year       in American history--$3 trillion of which has been enacted.       This amounts to nearly $60,000 per American household. This       includes Public Law 117-2, Public Law 117-58, and as       confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office, the $5 trillion       reckless reconciliation spending plan--the largest spending       bill in United States history, and the direct product of the       prior reconciliation instructions previously enacted.        (b) Policy on Halting Out-of-Control Deficient Spending and       Promoting Policies To Address the Inflation Crisis.--It is       the policy of this concurrent resolution to adopt       reconciliation instructions that instruct authorizing       committees to produce legislation to:        (1) Cut Washington spending to reduce the deficit and       combat governmental fueled inflation.        (2) Address the crisis of rising prices currently facing       American families by providing solutions to bring down the       cost of goods and get more Americans back to work.        Sec 3. H.R. 5376 is laid on the table.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
