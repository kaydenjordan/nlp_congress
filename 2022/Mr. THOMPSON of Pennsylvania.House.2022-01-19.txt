 Madam Speaker, House Democrats this  past week passed a bill to nationalize elections. On a party-line vote  Democrats, led by Speaker Pelosi, passed a bill nationalizing elections  in an attempt to maintain power.   If ultimately enacted, this would consolidate power and control of  all elections in the hands of Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic Party.   This bill is an attack on election integrity.   Their claims of voter suppression could not be further from the  truth. The 2020 election had the highest turnout in 120 years.  [[Page H226]]    A poll by Pew Research Center found that 94 percent of those asked  said it was easy to vote. Thankfully there appears to be no path to get  the votes needed to pass this danger to democracy bill in the Senate.                   March for Life is a Celebration of Life     Madam Speaker, later this week, tens of  thousands of Americans will travel to D.C. to take part in the 48th  March for Life.   They will not be alone. Across the country, Americans will march to  their State capitals in protest of the Roe v. Wade decision.   This march is a celebration of life. It is a march full of joy. It is  inspiring, it is peaceful, and it is welcoming to all who wish to  attend.   Today, it continues to be the largest annual human rights  demonstration in the world. The goal is simple, to celebrate life with  the hope that one day we live in a world where every life is  celebrated, valued, and protected.   This year's theme is equality begins in the womb. As Jeanne Mancini,  president of the March of Life said best, ``As our country continues to  advance along the path to a more just society, we cannot ignore the  discrimination that is taking place against vulnerable unborn babies. .  . . ''   In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson penned three  unalienable rights, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   As Members of Congress, it is our job to uphold those rights.   Since coming to Congress in 2009, I am proud to be a strong proponent  of standing for life and giving a voice to the voiceless.   Many of my colleagues have introduced legislation to advance the pro- life cause. I am proud to cosponsor many of these bills, including the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, the Defund Planned  Parenthood Act, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, the Sanctity  of Human Life Act, the Protecting the Dignity of the Unborn Children  Act, and the Life at Conception Act.   In addition, I proudly stand on this House floor advocating for these  policies and thwarting any attacks on the unborn.   Madam Speaker, our country is at a turning point. Right now we are  experiencing the most pro-abortion administration in our history.   For the first time in over four decades, Democrats removed the Hyde  amendment from legislation. This amendment is a bipartisan agreement  which prevents direct taxpayer funding of abortion and is supported by  77 percent of Americans.   As pro-abortion advocates continue to try to stifle one of our  unalienable rights, I know this House will continue to work tirelessly  at the Federal level to put the health and safety of women and children  first.   As long as the cloud of abortion looms over our country, we must  continue to be the shining light for those who cannot defend  themselves.   Now I am proud of the brave women, men, and children who will travel  to Washington this week.   We must always be a voice for the voiceless. And we must continue to  build a culture that values life and respects mothers and their  children.   Ahead of this year's march, I stand here and redouble my commitment  to protecting the most vulnerable among us, the unborn.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Venango Area Chamber Citizen of the Year, Dr. David Wagner.
