 Madam Speaker, to Speaker Pelosi, Chair  Nadler, and Chair Lofgren, my colleagues Representative Roybal-Allard,  Representative Velazquez, Representative Jayapal, and Representative  Chu, their leadership has been tremendous in bringing forth H.R. 6, the  Dream and Promise Act.   2.5 million, this is how many of our neighbors, our friends, and our  family members will be able to officially call themselves American  citizens because of the Dream and Promise Act as they obtain legal  permanent residency on the pathway to citizenship.   I am proud to sponsor H.R. 6, the Dream and Promise Act, which  provides 2.5 million Dreamers, persons with temporary protected status,  and deferred enforcement departure recipients with a pathway to  citizenship--2.5 million people who already call America home and are  mightily contributing to our society.   As chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Immigration Task Force and  as a second-generation American myself, it is my passion and my duty to  stand up for immigrants.   From rural America to urban America, like in my district in Brooklyn,  New York, immigrants are part of all of our communities. Immigrants  own, operate, and shop at our corner shops and bodegas; immigrants  cheer on their kids at neighborhood soccer games; and immigrants  worship with us at our places of worship. Simply put, immigrants are  woven into the fabric of our society.   The Dream and Promise Act is commonsense immigration policy,  commonsense immigration policy that recognizes today's immigrant  dilemmas--Dreamers and TPS and DED recipients who are contributing to  our communities and are part of our blended status families--and  provides them with a long, overdue pathway to citizenship.   In New York City alone, where my district is located, more than  109,000 people are eligible for the Dream and Promise Act. That number  balloons to more than 180,000 people when you take into account the  entire State of New York. These immigrants are not only a part of our  social fabric, but they directly boost our economy.   I look around in this Chamber and I would be hard-pressed to find  anyone who hasn't been positively impacted, directly or indirectly, by  the multitude of ways that these immigrants have added value to our  communities.   For example, in my home State of New York, immigrants eligible for  the Dream and Promise Act own 9,500 homes and pay $228,300,000 each  year in mortgage payments. These same immigrants contribute more than  $1.6 billion each year in Federal taxes and more.   Having said that, Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand shoulder to  shoulder with my colleagues.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
