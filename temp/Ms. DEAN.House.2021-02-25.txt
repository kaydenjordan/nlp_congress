 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember a community leader,  a constituent, and a friend, Ms. Valerie Ward, who passed away January  6, at the age of 80.   Ms. Ward devoted her life in service to others, as president of the  Willow Grove branch of the NAACP, and as an Abington PAL board member.   Val had the heart of a teacher, spending her time mentoring younger  generations well into her own retirement. Clipboard in hand, Val could  be found most weekends spearheading community events, always leading by  example.   Val was a woman of great faith, leading several ministries at her  beloved New Bethel AME. As a life member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority,  she was proud to share her sisterhood with Vice President Kamala  Harris.   She was known for her direct, no nonsense approach and her dry sense  of humor, warm smile, and infectious laugh.   I join Ms. Val's family, friends, and the wider Abington community in  mourning the loss of an incredible woman. The world is a better place  for her life.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank our chairman, and I thank  Representative  [[Page H650]]    David Cicilline for his tireless leadership in leading us to this  day. All Americans deserve to be treated equally regardless of their  gender identity or sexual orientation.   I do have to wonder, Mr. Speaker, what are those on the other side  who are arguing against this wise legislation afraid of? Equal  treatment for their LGBTQ family and friends? Why would they make such  arguments?   We must continue to strive for the equality of the LGBTQ community.  Voting ``yes'' on the Equality Act furthers this fight and helps us  live up to the promise of this Nation. As Bayard Rustin, an openly gay  Black civil rights leader, said: ``Let us be enraged about injustice,  but let us not be destroyed by it.''   The Equality Act is a necessary step in addressing injustice by  advancing the rights of Americans nationwide because we are all God's  children. The passage of this legislation is an important step in  forming a more perfect Union.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jones).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Ms. Bush).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Craig).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Hampshire (Mr. Pappas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi).    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Nadler), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  control the balance of the time on our side.
