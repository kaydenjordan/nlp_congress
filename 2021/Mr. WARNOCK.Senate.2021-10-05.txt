 Mr. President, as a proud son of the great State of  Georgia and a voice for our State here in this Chamber, I am deeply  honored to join my colleagues here today to introduce this important  legislation in honor of one of Georgia's and America's most influential  public servants.   I am grateful for the comments of Senator Blumenthal, and I want to  thank Senator Leahy and all of my colleagues for their leadership in  introducing this bill that carries on the legacy of Congressman Lewis's  pivotal  [[Page S6919]]  work to protect the sacred right to vote.   John Lewis was my parishioner, and as I stand in support of this  legislation named in his honor, I think of the many conversations I had  with him over the years. I think of the Sunday mornings we boarded a  bus, taking souls to the polls because I believe that voting, as he  did, is a sacred undertaking. At root, it is about people's voice. And  in that sense, it is about one's humanity.   I learned so much from Congressman Lewis and the lessons from his  lived experiences working deep in the trenches to defend and advance  voting rights. He laid it all on the line. When President Johnson took  his pen and signed this legislation, making it law in a real sense,  what he etched had already been affirmed in blood--the risk that John  Lewis took, the ultimate sacrifice that others made as they lost their  lives fighting for the vote, the voice, the humanity of every child of  God.   And one of the most important tools that came out of that activism,  that came out of that human sacrifice--one of the most important tools  in this legislation is the process of preclearance. This process  required that jurisdictions with a proven history of voting rights  violations get approval from the Department of Justice or our Federal  courts before making changes to local voting administration.   And, for decades, this was the tool that helped enfranchise countless  voters, ensuring that they would have access to the ballot to exercise  their constitutional right, and it kept some of the worst voter  suppression efforts at bay.   And then, in 2013, the Supreme Court, in Shelby v. Holder, asked the  Congress to update the coverage formula that determines which States  are subject to preclearance. The Supreme Court said that this  preclearance formula had somehow been outdated and Congress ought to  bring it up to date. That is what they asked us to do in 2013.   Since then, Congress has been unwilling to act. Preclearance has been  allowed to atrophy. And we have seen the results not only in Georgia,  but in Texas, in Arizona, in Pennsylvania, all across our country.  Earlier this year in Georgia, State leaders enacted a voter suppression  law that will undoubtedly make it harder for some people to vote. If  the tool of preclearance were in place right now, SB202 in Georgia  likely would not even be on the books.   I think of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her dissenting opinion.  When that decision came down, she said:         Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is       continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like       throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are       not getting wet.    We threw away our umbrella, and we have found ourselves in the midst  of a torrential rainstorm. Voter suppression laws are mushrooming all  over the country. We are witnessing right now what happens to our  democracy without the protections of preclearance and the other vital  provisions of the Voting Rights Act.   The lack of robust voting rights protections has ramifications for  every American, as we have seen efforts ramp up this year at passing  sweeping, State-level voter suppression laws--not laws that only impact  Black people and people of color, to be sure, but also students,  seniors, whomever certain politicians are afraid of will somehow get in  the way of their craven march to power.   And so this bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, is  about Congress finally doing its job--finally doing what the Supreme  Court asked us to do in 2013. It should have been done a long time ago.   The updated Voting Rights Advancement Act we are introducing today  restores the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It strengthens our democracy by  reestablishing preclearance, and it makes it better by updating it to  also protect against specific practices we know suppress the vote, like  polling place closures and new types of voter roll purges happening not  only in the South, but all over the country.   Our bill also restores Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to protect  minority communities from discriminatory voting practices after the  Supreme Court diminished Section 2 earlier this year.   Mr. President, just like the Freedom to Vote Act me and many of my  colleagues introduced just a few weeks ago to set national standards  for voting so every eligible voice is heard, the John Lewis Voting  Rights Advancement Act we introduce today is designed to meet future  challenges and address additional antidemocratic efforts aimed at  suppressing the vote all over our country.   Since I was elected on January 5, since that terrible day on January  6, when this very Capitol was assaulted, we have seen more than 400  proposals in 49 States. So the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act  builds for us a fire station to protect against future fires, but the  house of democracy is already on fire. And so we need the John Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act, but we also need the Freedom to Vote  Act. We have got to put out the fire. We have got to build a fire  station for future fires.   Mr. President, I know there is a lot on our plate, but we can't waste  any time getting these bills passed. We can walk and chew gum at the  same time.   John Lewis walked across a bridge in order to build a bridge to a new  American future. We already had infrastructure. He understood that the  infrastructure of our democracy was in trouble, and so he walked across  a bridge in order to build a bridge.   So the House has already passed a version of this act. And I know my  friend, Senator Joe Manchin, has been having conversations about the  Freedom to Vote Act with our friends across the aisle. We are happy to  talk to anybody on both sides of the aisle. A similar version of this  legislation has been voted up by this Chamber repeatedly in the past  with strong bipartisan support. Some 16 Republican Senators who were  either here or in the House when it passed in 2006 98-0 are here today,  and I ask them: What is the difference?   Voting rights are not just another issue. Voting rights are a  preservative of all other rights. Voting rights are about the  foundation of our democracy. And I believe that if the world's greatest  deliberative body can't find a way forward to get this done, history  will judge us harshly, and rightly so.   Reinhold Niebuhr said that humankind's capacity for justice makes  democracy possible, but our inclination to injustice makes democracy  necessary. This work, this assignment, which we have right now, is both  possible and necessary. We can do it, and we must do it. It is the most  important thing we can do this Congress, and I hope we will do it now.
