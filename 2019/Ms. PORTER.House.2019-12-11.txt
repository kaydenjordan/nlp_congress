 Mr. Speaker, I was present but my vote did not register  on rollcall No. 668 on December 11, 2019 due to a machine malfunction.  I voted by inserting my machine card into the machine with several  minutes remaining. The system apparently did not record my ``yea''  vote. I was present on the House floor for the duration of the vote.  Had my vote been recorded, it would have been recorded as ``yea.''
