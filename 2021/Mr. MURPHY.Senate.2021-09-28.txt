 Mr. President, I come to the floor to offer some brief  remarks today in the wake of the Armed Services Committee hearing today  on the evacuation of Afghanistan and the end to U.S. troop presence  there. I watched it with some interest. I watched it knowing that three  out of four Americans support President Biden's decision to bring U.S.  troops home from Afghanistan.   We learned some new things today in the hearing. Others were  confirmed. First, we learned, once again, of the extraordinary bravery  and capability of our diplomats and our soldiers, who worked under  incredibly difficult conditions for a period of weeks to airlift almost  130,000 individuals out of Afghanistan. That is absolutely remarkable,  especially given, as we heard today in testimony, that the goal at the  outset, in the best case scenario, was to get 60 to 70 to 80,000 people  out. In the end, the United States of America, our military and our  diplomats, got 130,000 people out.   We heard, also, about the impossible position that President Biden  inherited; that there was a commitment made to withdraw American troops  by President Trump but no plan with which to do it safely. We heard  about how the Doha agreement decreased the readiness of the Afghan  forces, how it weakened their position internally.   We heard about the choice that faced President Biden when he came  into office. We heard about the fact that, had we chosen to stay, we  would have had to surge troops; that the Taliban, having gotten to the  precipice of provincial capitals, would have engaged in a level of  urban warfare that would have required the United States to increase  our troop presence there in order to be able to stand up an effective  resistance to the Taliban.   To the extent that Republicans view this as a political game and they  were looking for points to be scored today, I guess the one point they  feel they scored was an admission by the generals who testified that  some of them had recommended staying in Afghanistan.   Now, I have tremendous respect for our generals. I think they get it  right more than they get it wrong. They provide very able advice to the  Commander in Chief. But for 20 years, in Afghanistan, our generals  recommended staying, in the face of mounting evidence, year after year,  that it was going to be impossible to be able to stand up an Afghan  military that could protect the country and an Afghan Government that  could govern the country. Our generals recommended staying--year after  year after year, month after month after month--despite the fact that  many analysts told us that as soon as we left and the Taliban took  over, the Afghan Government and the military would fall.   Now, they did it because our military is bred to believe that  anything is possible. It speaks, in some part, to the best of American  military ethos, the idea that there is no obstacle that cannot be  surmounted, that cannot be climbed by U.S. forces. But the task they  were given by President after President was one that could not be  carried out.   And to simply believe that because the general said ``stay another  year'' or ``stay another 5 years,'' this Commander in Chief should have  listened, despite the fact that it had been proven that the mission  that we were given in that country was impossible, is to compound a  mistake--an unnecessary mistake--that the United States engaged in for  far, far too long.   And so my hope is that moving forward, this Congress and this Senate  are going to engage in real oversight. There is no doubt the evacuation  could have been done better. There is no doubt that, in a mission this  complicated, the Biden team would have done things differently. But the  real question is, Why did we stay in Afghanistan for 10 years too long?  Why did we keep believing that we could train-up a military that would  be capable of defending the country?   It is time that we have a deep inquiry in this Senate about the  limits of American military power overseas and how badly misresourced  we are when we spend 10 to 20 times as much money on military power as  we do on other means of projecting American power.   It is also important for us to understand the cost of getting bogged  down in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. It is not a coincidence that  shortly after withdrawing from Afghanistan, we were able to announce  this new partnership with Australia and Britain to better protect our  mutual interests in the Pacific theater.   It is because, when the entirety of the U.S. defense and foreign  policy infrastructure is so trained on unwinnable contests in far off  places like Afghanistan, it doesn't allow us the capacity and the  creativity to be able to design new systems and new structures with  which to protect the country.   China celebrated every single year that we remain bogged down in  Afghanistan. Russia celebrated every single year that we doubled down  on that mistake. Now we have the ability to turn our attention to  fights that truly matter.   We learned some things in the Armed Services Committee today. I think  what we learned confirms that the decision that President Biden made to  pull our troops out was the right one. It is a decision supported by  the American people because it allows this country, finally, to focus  on fights that are winnable in reality, not just on paper.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I have a request for 7 committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
