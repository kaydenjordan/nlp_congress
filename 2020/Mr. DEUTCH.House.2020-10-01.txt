 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California for  yielding.   I stand in strong support of H.R. 6813, the Promoting Alzheimer's  Awareness to Prevent Elder Abuse Act. This bill is as simple as it is  bipartisan.   Too many of the folks who are charged with protecting older Americans  don't have the specialized knowledge and training needed to assist  people with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. This knowledge gap  will be a growing problem as our Nation's population continues to age.   In 2019, there were about 5.8 million people in the United States who  were living with Alzheimer's. By 2050, the population is estimated to  grow to close to 14 million people. And while not all of those with  dementia are seniors, 81 percent of people living with Alzheimer's in  the United States are 75 years of age or older.   People living with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia are  especially vulnerable to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and they are  frequent targets for fraud and other scams. This means more  interactions between people with Alzheimer's and first responders,  adult protective services, the courts, and others in the community.   Families and other caregivers know the challenges of dementia. These  diseases steal so much from their loved ones, but caregivers step up  every day to help people with dementia stay safe and stay healthy.  Unfortunately, the strategies and caregiving practices that they use  aren't known by others who are charged with preventing elder abuse and  fraud.  [[Page H5162]]                                     time  1445    This bill will close that gap in knowledge.   The bipartisan Promoting Alzheimer's Awareness to Prevent Elder Abuse  Act will ensure that first responders, court officers, and other social  services personnel have access to the best practices and necessary  training to assist people with Alzheimer's.   This bill will bring everyone together--the Department of Justice;  Department of Health and Human Services; State, local, and Tribal adult  protective services; law enforcement, aging, social, and human services  agencies; and nonprofit associations--to develop best practices and  training materials to get everyone on the same page to help.   By ensuring that everyone knows how to support people with  Alzheimer's, we can better protect against fraud and abuse.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Congressman  Reschenthaler, for his strong work and strong support of this bill. We  have built a strong, bipartisan coalition that supports this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to extend appreciation to the Alzheimer's  Association for their expertise and for their advocacy. They have done  so much to support people with Alzheimer's and their caregivers. This  bill will put Federal Government support behind their important work.  It will help to support people with Alzheimer's and other forms of  dementia. It will help their caregivers who look out for this  vulnerable population.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge passage of this bill.
