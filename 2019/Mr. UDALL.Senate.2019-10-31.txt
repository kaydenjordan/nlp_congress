 Mr. President, I just want to follow on the comments by my  good friend Senator Shaheen with regard to Kay Hagan. We came to the  Senate together with Senator Shaheen. We were all in that class of  2008. It was a big class. We traveled extensively with Kay Hagan. We  got to know her very well.   It was really good to hear--I talked to her husband Chip on the  phone. We call him Chip; he is Charles. He told me that up to the very  last, she was extremely busy. They were traveling around North  Carolina. They were doing things. She actually had a very special visit  with Vice President Biden before she passed away.   Our heart goes out to the whole family--to the three children. We  very much miss her and will miss her a lot. We missed her a lot in the  Senate. We are going to miss her.   I will put in a more extensive statement about Kay Hagan.                              Amendment No. 1209    Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Lee amendment and efforts to  undermine the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This amendment would  prohibit the Department of Interior from using land and water  conservation funds to acquire Federal lands and waters.   The underlying bill actually increases funding for the Land and Water  Conservation Fund by $30 million, and it does so with deep bipartisan  support from a majority of Senators. The crucial point here is that  this bill passed the Appropriations Committee 31 to 0, so this is a  broadly supported program and a broadly supported bill. I urge the  Senate to send another strong message today to support the LWCF.   There are many bipartisan land-acquisition priorities that are funded  by this bill. They include things like funds to improve access to the  Aravaipa Canyon in Arizona; preserve wildlife habitat in the Everglades  Headwaters and St. Marks Refuges in Florida, I would let the Presiding  Officer know. There is also money to protect the Palo Alto Battlefield  in Texas and other historic battlefield sites, as well as funds to  expand the El Malpais National Monument in my home State of New Mexico.  These are just a few of the projects that our constituents back home  are expecting the Department to fund. They would all be stopped in  their tracks if this amendment were adopted.   We need LWCF to establish better access for Americans to their own  public lands. This program works with private landowners and willing  sellers to continue to protect special places for generations to come.  I know a bipartisan  [[Page S6320]]  majority of this body understands that, and I ask my colleagues to  stand with me to defeat this amendment.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to former  Senator Kay Hagan, who left us this week, much too early, at the age of  66. Kay and I entered the Senate together, in 2009. Our class of  freshman Democratic Senators was very close, and I spent a lot of time  with Kay. She was warm and vivacious and 100 percent committed to her  home State of North Carolina.   Kay was the first woman Democratic Senator elected from North  Carolina, and she beat a formidable incumbent. By the time she entered  the Senate, she had already gained a reputation in her State as a  leader and a fighter, having served in the State senate for 10 years.   Kay was a woman of great strength, grace, and accomplishment. She was  a lawyer, a banker, a legislator, a mother of three, and grandmother of  five. Kay came to the Senate to get things  [[Page S6329]]  done for North Carolina and the Nation. To be effective, she worked  across the aisle to find solutions to the everyday problems facing  Americans. When she entered the Senate, she said, ``We have a Congress  now that is kind of divided, and I want to be one of the ones that  helps bring people together.''   Kay was a woman of principle. She was a key vote in support of the  Affordable Care Act--that resulted in millions of Americans gaining  access to health care. She stood in favor of choice for women, gay  marriage, equal pay for women, the Violence Against Women Act, and  expanding background checks on gun sales.   She was a fierce defender of military families, of which there are so  many in North Carolina, and served on the Armed Services Committee. In  hearings, she pressed the Army on the unexplained deaths of 11 infants  at Fort Bragg and pushed for full disclosure of documents related to  contaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune. And before many others,  she supported women serving in combat zones. ``Anybody's who qualified  should be able to serve,'' she said.   Kay fought for the ``little guy.'' She used her banking expertise to  fight against payday lending. She wanted a fairer minimum wage, so  families can support themselves. She supported job creation and small  business. ``For me in North Carolina, it's jobs, jobs, jobs,'' she  said.   She understood that big money in politics was drowning the voice of  regular Americans and that access to the ballot box is being blocked.  After her Senate loss, Kay went on to serve as resident fellow at the  Institute of Politics at Harvard University with a focus on money in  politics and voting rights, saying, ``We need to encourage young folks  across the country to go exercise their constitutional right to vote.  It is something that our Constitution gives us, but not enough people  exercise it.''   Kay wanted to inspire young people--especially young women--to vote,  to be informed, to run for office. Kay did inspire. And she leaves us  with a legacy of integrity, commitment, and civility. I was proud to be  her colleague, but I was even more proud to be her friend, and I send  my heartfelt condolences to her family.
