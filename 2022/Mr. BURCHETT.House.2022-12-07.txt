 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about  immigration. The Democrats and the mainstream media need to take  responsibility for their cover-up of President Biden's border crisis.   The liberal media hasn't made a peep about the fact that over 4  million illegals have been encountered at our southern border since  President Biden took office. That is a record number, Madam Speaker, 4  million people. We have never seen this before.   They also kept the Biden administration's dirty little secret when it  started flying illegals into Knoxville, Chattanooga, and all over the  country in the dead of night without telling anyone, without telling  the State authorities, and definitely not telling the Congressman from  the Second Congressional District about it.   But then the media had a field day when Republican Governors sent a  few buses of illegals to New York and Martha's Vineyard. I kept waiting  for one of them to say, Buffy, quick, we have got illegals out here.   This administration is trying to keep us focused on things like  climate change and woke social programs instead of their disastrous  handling of our southern border. Of course, the media follows the  Democrats' lead like a lost puppy dog. They cover what the Democrats  want them to cover, and it is a shameful way to do journalism--a once  respectable occupation.                                time  2030    It is a disgusting cover up of a very simple truth. We desperately  need to close the dadgum border, Madam Speaker, and strengthen our  immigration laws.   We need to reform our asylum system, which is a total joke, so  illegal immigrants aren't eligible if they travel through a safe third  country. We need to clarify in our laws that gang and domestic violence  are not grounds for asylum; those are grounds for moving neighborhoods,  not moving countries, Madam Speaker.   We also need to fully implement some policies like the Remain in  Mexico policy, which is a reasonable policy, and which is critical to  our national security, Madam Speaker.   Our liberal media need to stop kowtowing to the Democrats and start  reporting on the facts. The American people deserve to know what is  going on. And I guarantee you, the more they know, the more they will  demand these kind of real changes from the disastrous Biden  administration.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Johnson for his more-than-lackluster  attempt at democracy tonight. I, for one, enjoy it, and these young  people over here seem to be enjoying it themselves, all five of those  young people.
