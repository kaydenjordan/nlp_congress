 Mr. Speaker, this past weekend the Guam National Youth  Football Federation held its championship on Saturday. After an  exciting season, three teams won their respective division championship  games and are officially known as the 2023 GNYFF champions.   Under this historic dome of democracy, I congratulate the following  youth football championship teams: the Guam Eagles for winning the  Manha Division championship, the Hal's Angels for winning the Metgot  Division championship, and the Guam Eagles for winning the Matua  Division championship.   I also congratulate the coaches, trainers, sponsors, and families of  all the teams for their many efforts and sacrifices and for instilling  in the kids the values of sportsmanship, character, and teamwork.                            ____________________
