 Mr. Speaker, our country and the American people are in  crisis, and it requires our action now.   To be clear, this is not a perfect bill, but it is the bill that  America needs today. It will provide immediate relief: direct cash  payments to millions of Americans to pay rent, to buy food, and to pay  their mortgages, and over $370 billion to our small businesses in  immediate grants and loans.   There is much more that needs to be done, but we will work together  to do it and improve, moving forward. We will get through this  challenging time as a country because that is what America does. We are  at our best when we come together and meet our common challenges, and  that is exactly what we will do.
