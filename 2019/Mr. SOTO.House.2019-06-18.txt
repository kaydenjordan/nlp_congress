 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Visclosky) for yielding.   Madam Chair, I want to express my gratitude to the committee for the  inclusion of report language in the bill noting the importance of  obtaining advanced microelectronics manufacturing, in support of the  defense industrial base, from trusted domestic suppliers.   Ensuring quick, reliable, and secure access to leading-edge  microelectronics is often a challenge. The changing global  semiconductor industry and the increasing sophistication of U.S.  adversaries require us to update our domestic microelectronics security  framework by establishing a comprehensive, public-private partnership- structured microelectronics cybersecurity center.   This center can provide the defense industrial base with access to  manufacturing resources to support antitamper devices, hardware  security, and other evolving new concept technologies that support  trusted and assured manufacturing, combined with advanced system  integration and packaging technologies.   The Defense-Wide Manufacturing Science and Technology Program enables  the Department of Defense to advance reliable and secure state-of-the- art technologies. The funding increase provided in this legislation,  along with the increased funding for advanced manufacturing, will  facilitate America's innovative, secure, and domestic foundry  operations and greatly contribute to our national defense through the  establishment of a microelectronics cybersecurity center structured as  a public-private partnership.
