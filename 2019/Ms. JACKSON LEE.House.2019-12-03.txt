 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  4803, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil  Servants Act.   I applaud Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and House  Judiciary Ranking Member Doug Collins (R-GA) for introducing this  bipartisan legislation aimed to fix a problem in current citizenship  laws.   The current citizenship law implemented by this Administration in  October, serves as a disadvantage to certain children who are born  abroad and reside with a parent serving overseas in the military or as  a federal government employee.   Under current law, such children are required to establish U.S.  residency in order to obtain citizenship, which can be difficult when a  parent is stationed overseas.   This small but important change is the necessary fix for U.S. armed  forces and in federal government positions overseas.   I am glad we could work together to introduce this bipartisan  legislation that provides greater flexibility and support to those who  have dedicated their careers to serving our nation.   American citizens who are deployed members of our military or  government officials working abroad should have confidence their  children will receive U.S. citizenship.   Military families are already making tremendous sacrifices to serve  our country abroad and the children should not have to be penalized.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4803 because our  military families should not have to deal with the bureaucracy of this  Administration for their children to be United States citizens.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 565,  ``The Advancing Mutual Interests and Growing Our Success Act'' or  AMIGOS Act.   Despite deep ties with Portugal, it remains one of only five EU  countries whose citizens are ineligible for E-1 and E-2 visas.   Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, nationals of countries  with which the United States maintains a treaty of commerce and  navigation may be admitted temporarily to the United States to engage  in international trade, an E-1 visa, or to develop and direct an  investment enterprise, E-2 visa.   E-1 and E-2 visas may be granted to individual traders and investors  or to employees of organizational traders and investors.   Applicants for E-1 and E-2 visas must generally demonstrate the  existence of a bilateral treaty of commerce and navigation between the  applicant's country of nationality and the United States.   Some treaties allow for the admission of both E-1 and E-2  nonimmigrants, while others allow for the admission of only E-1 or E-2  nonimmigrants.   In addition, the visa applicant must be a national of the treaty  country.   If the applicant is an employee of an organizational trader or  investor, both the applicant and the organization must possess the  nationality of the treaty country.   The nationality of the organization is determined by the nationality  of the individual owners--at least 50 percent of the organization must  be owned by nationals of the treaty country.   The enterprise must be more than marginal and must generate income  beyond that which is required to provide a minimal living for the  investor and their family.   An individual investor must be coming to the United States to develop  and direct the business.   An applicant who is an employee of an organizational trader or  investor must be coming to the United States to fulfill an executive or  supervisory position or possess skills that are essential to the firm's  U.S. operations.   Spouses and minor children accompanying or following to join the  principal E-1 or E-2 nonimmigrant will be admitted for the same period  of stay as the principal trader or investor.   Congress has the ability to take action to improve the historical  relationship between the United States and Portugal.   If H.R. 565 is enacted, Portuguese nationals would become eligible  for E-1 and E-2 visas, but only after an agreement for reciprocal  treatment between Portugal and the United States is finalized.   In 2012, Congress passed--and the president signed into law--H.R.  3992 to permit Israeli nationals to participate in the E-2 treaty  investor program. However, Israeli nationals did not have the ability  to apply for E-2 visas until May 1, 2019, when an agreement with Israel  was finalized and took effect.   It was favorably reported by the House Judiciary Committee without  amendment by voice vote; passed by the House on motion to suspend the  rules (371 to 0) and passed by the Senate, without amendment, by  Unanimous Consent.   Similarly, S. 2245, the ``Knowledgeable Innovators and Worthy  Investors (KIWI) Act,'' became law on August 1, 2018, but New  Zealanders were unable to apply for E-1 and E-2 visas until June 10,  2019 when an agreement for reciprocal treatment took effect.   It was Discharged by the Senate Judiciary Committee by Unanimous  Consent and passed by the Senate without amendment by Unanimous  Consent; passed by the House on motion to suspend the rules by voice  vote.   The last two bills to add countries to the E-1 and E-2 visa programs  passed Congress without controversy.  [[Page H9191]]    Portugal is a longstanding United States ally, with ``bilateral ties  dating from the earliest years of the United States, when Portugal  recognized the United States in 1791 following the Revolutionary War.''   The United States is also Portugal's largest trading partner outside  the European Union (EU), with bilateral trade in goods and services  reaching $8 billion in 2018, a 9 percent increase from the previous  year.   Similarly, U.S. direct investment in Portugal reached $2.1 billion in  2017, with U.S. companies playing a significant role, investing in the  Portuguese banking, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries.   Both countries have also agreed to a bilateral income tax agreement  to prevent double taxation.   Portuguese participation in the E-1 and E-2 visa programs will deepen  an already strong bilateral trade and investment relationship, and  benefit business communities in both countries.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 565,  ``The Advancing Mutual Interests and Growing Our Success Act'' or  AMIGOS Act.    Madam Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in the  Congressional Black Caucus to celebrate and recognize the importance of  educational opportunities at the Historically Black Colleges and  Universities, creating opportunities for thousands of young men and  women, many of them first-time college attendees. I am delighted to  have Texas Southern University in my congressional district and, as  well, to have Prairie View A&M in the near area.   I was very instrumental in getting Hurricane Harvey relief dollars  and financial aid relief for students at the campus of Texas Southern  University in the amount of $13 million and to be able to help digitize  the projects for former U.S. Members of Congress Barbara Jordan and  Mickey Leland.   As well, I remember working with Prairie View A&M when they helped  establish a very grand criminal justice center that is educating many  young people.   But I am really here to support the FUTURE Act, Fostering  Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education, supported by  the House and passed out of the House on September 17, 2019.   Unfortunately, this bill is held up in the Senate. This House bill is  much better. We support the House bill and would ask the Senator from  Tennessee to do what he should do, which I believe he has done: to make  sure that bill goes out, and goes out as the House bill.   This is a bill to focus on STEM and to create opportunities for our  young people. I support HBCUs and opportunities for those young people.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues in the  Congressional Black Caucus to celebrate and recognize the importance of  educational opportunities that HBCU institutions create for thousands  of young men and women from all walks of life.   I am a member of the Bipartisan Congressional HBCU Caucus because it  promotes and protects the interest of HBCUs by: creating a national  dialogue, educating Members of Congress and their staffs about the  issues impacting HBCUs, drafting meaningful bipartisan legislation to  address the needs of HBCUs, and supporting students and graduates of  HBCUs by increasing access and career opportunities.  [[Page H9218]]    One important solution must be access to affordable 7 quality  education for every person in this nation.   I am proud to count Texas Southern University as a constituent, a  great HBCU--located in my home city of Houston.   I routinely partner with Texas Southern University to promote  education opportunities and collaborate on community projects  routinely.   In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, I led the initiative to get  financial aid relief for the students and campus of Texas Southern  University in the amount of $13 plus million dollars.   I continue to keep the university community informed about major  issues impacting citizens of my city of Houston, Texas.   Issues like Health Care, Economic Development, Education, and Social  Security are of great importance to TSU academic programs.   I initiated the digitization projects for former U.S. Members of  Congress Barbara Jordan and Mickey Leland who both have permanent  archives at Texas Southern University.   I also assisted with the establishment of several scholarship  Endowments at Texas Southern University.   I helped create a partnership with Comcast at TSU's School of  Communication, which offers scholarships, internships and in-kind  marketing.   I helped establish the Center for Transportation, Training and  Research in TSU's College of Science, Engineering, and Technology.   On September 17, 2019, the House passed House H.R. 2486, the  Fostering Undergraduate Talent Using Resources for Education (FUTURE)  Act, which I cosponsored and supported.   Title III, Part F of the Higher Education Act (HEA) provides funding  to HBCUs, HSIs, TCUs, and MSIs to improve their self-sufficiency and  strengthen their ability to serve low-income students, particularly in  the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)  professions.   These funds advance these institutions' academic quality and fiscal  stability.   Unfortunately, funding for these institutions, as authorized by the  HEA expired on September 30, 2019.   It is crucial that these funds do not lapse.   H.R 2486, the FUTURE Act, ensures that this will not happen.   Under the FUTURE Act, HBCUs, HSIs, TCUs, and MSIs will continue to  receive $255 million for the next two years.   Without this funding, these institutions will suffer, particularly  smaller institutions that will have to lay off staff and faculty and  possibly face imminent danger of closure.   Additionally, H.R. 2486 is completely paid for by eliminating Account  Maintenance Fees, a proposal supported by Democrats, Republicans and  the White House.   It is time that the Senate takes up this important bill and pass it  so that HBCUs can continue to do the important work of educating the  next generation.   HBCUs are more than just places of higher learning that are part of  the nation's economy by contributing 15 billion dollars to the national  economy annually.   HBCUs provide pathways of opportunity for millions of Americans, many  of whom are first generation college students.   This underscores the need for the government to engage with HBCUs and  other MSIs, and ensure these schools have the resources they need-- after a legacy of discrimination and neglect.   The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for  Education (FUTURE) Act reauthorizes crucial mandatory funding for HBCUs  and all Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) for the next two fiscal  years; $255 million a year, in total.    Sustaining these funds is critical to supporting HBCUs and the  students they serve.   The FUTURE Act is intended to prepare HBCU students for careers in  STEM professions--at a time when diverse representation is low in the  STEM economy.   Additionally, without this funding, small schools with small  endowments will have to lay off staff and faculty in order to stay  afloat; other schools will face imminent danger of closure.   This bill represents the number one priority of all HBCUs in the  country.   This bill passed the House by a unanimous vote on September 17, 2019  but is being held up by the Senate due to the objections of Senator  Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the Chairman of the Senate Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee.   Senator Alexander has claimed he has a bill that will permanently  reauthorize FUTURE Act funds.   He did not offer his bill until FUTURE passed the House of  Representatives.   The Senate has failed to come to an agreement on comprehensive  reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA).   In contrast, the House Education and Labor Committee has advanced the  College Affordability Act, which will incentivize states to lower the  cost of college tuition, strengthen federal financial aid programs, and  simplify income-based repayment plans for student loan holders.   The HEA contains all the federal programs that provide a pathway for  low-income, first generation students into college.   Senator Alexander's bill in total is a micro-version of HEA  reauthorization that does very little to reduce the cost of college or  address rising student loan debt.   For example, Senator Alexander's bill would raise the maximum Pell  Grant award by $20--and not index the award to inflation.   Currently, the maximum Pell Grant award is $6,195.   The average tuition at a public college is approximately $15,000.   The purchasing power of the Pell Grant has decreased by 70 percent  since 1979.   Senator Alexander has packed his bill with a lot of other priorities  because he's attempting to leverage the fate of 4 million students of  color to create a legacy for himself.   Senator Alexander has also said he does not like the way the FUTURE  Act is paid for.   The bill is paid for with the elimination of Account Maintenance Fees  paid to Guaranty Agencies; an offset that is supported by Democrats and  Republicans in Congress, as well as the White House.   Given the significantly pared back services provided by guaranty  agencies, and their ability to generate significant fee income through  debt collection activities, this funding is no longer needed.   Guaranty Agencies generate around $4 billion in annual revenue.   They can fulfill their mission without these funds.   Finally, Senator Alexander and the Department of Education has  claimed they have funds to continue awarding grants through the end of  Fiscal Year 2020.   But that's only true because the Department has failed to award all  Fiscal Year 2019 funding.   In any case, institutions of higher learning need to budget at least  a year in advance--without certainty, staff layoffs and a paring back  of services will accelerate.   On September 14, 1927, the Houston Public School Board agreed to fund  the development of two junior colleges: one for whites and one for  African-Americans.   On September 14, 1927, the Houston Public School Board provided  $2,800 in seed capital to form a Junior College for African American  students.   The initial enrollment for the first summer was 300 students.   On June 1, 1951, the name of the school was changed from Texas State  University for Negroes to Texas Southern University after students  petitioned the state legislature to remove the phrase ``for Negroes.''   When the university opened its doors in September 1947, it had 2,300  students, two schools, one division and one college--the Law School,  the Pharmacy School, the Vocational Division, and the College of Arts  and Sciences.   In 1973, the 63rd Legislature designated Texas Southern University as  a ``special purpose'' institution for urban programming, which added  four more academic units: the College of Education, the School of  Public Affairs, the School of Communications and the Weekend College.   Today, Texas Southern University offers bachelor's, master's and  doctoral degree programs in the following academic colleges and  schools: the College of Liberal Arts and Behavioral Sciences; the  College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences; the College of Science and  Technology; the College of Education; the Barbara Jordan-Mickey Leland  School of Public Affairs; the School of Communication; the Thurgood  Marshall School of Law; the Jesse H. Jones School of Business; the  Thomas Freeman Honors College; and the College of Continuing Education  and the Graduate School.   Currently, Texas Southern University is staffed by approximately  1,000 faculty members and support personnel.   HBCU's have come a long way to be where they are today.   The most significant milestone for HBCU's was the 1954 Supreme Court  decision in Brown v. The Board of Education.   Howard University School of Law graduates successfully argued against  the constitutionality of ``separate but equal,'' opening the door for  greater access to resources for institutions dedicated to education was  a critical step forward.   However, it was not until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of  1964, that the federal government had the capacity and focus to enforce  desegregation.   On the 50th Anniversary of Rev. Martin Luther King's ``I have a  Dream'' speech given at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial were we able  to understand the long road to freedom.   In that speech Dr. King spoke of a world where race would mean much  less than the content of a person's character.  [[Page H9219]]    Martin Luther King said, ``The function of education is to teach one  to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus  character--that is the goal of true education.''   HBCUs do not just educate--they build character.   The Bipartisan Congressional HBCU Caucus will create and explore  legislation that will increase support for HBCUs, such as the Higher  Education Act, America COMPETES, and Appropriations.   The Bipartisan Congressional HBCU Caucus will also work to connect  HBCUs to funding opportunities that ensure schools have the resources  needed to educate and prepare students for the global workforce.   My focus in joining with my colleagues this evening for this special  order is to support and continue my work with Texas Southern University  and other HBCUs by: finding growth opportunities for HBCU students and  graduates; working with private industry to connect students to jobs,  internships, and scholarships; and opening up doors to HBCU students  interested in coming to Capitol Hill.   Each Congressional Black Caucus member works to expose HBCU students  to global experiences to learn about other cultures.   My office worked to assist students in my district in going on a trip  to China--for many it was their first travel outside of the state of  Texas.   That one experience transformed their lives--by expanding their  horizon from being local to global.                            ____________________
