 Madam Speaker, I rise today to deliver the 22nd installment  of my farm bill impact series to discuss Congress' willingness to  invest in agricultural research, which supports our Nation's food  security and, ultimately, our national security.   According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, for every public  dollar spent, agricultural research returns $20 benefit to the economy.  Despite this, Federal funding for agricultural research has declined in  real dollars over the past two decades.   When you take a bird's-eye view of our investment in agricultural  research, you see that the impact of the  [[Page H3214]]  investment is much larger than it initially seems. This isn't just  about new laboratories and equipment. This is about a vision for the  world where America is the undisputed leader in food science  technology. It is just like when we invest in international food aid,  and the return is staggering. We feed hungry people with American  commodities, but we also stop wars before they start and create new  international trading partners.   Agricultural research investment is the same story. The impact is  wide-reaching, and the return on investment is enormous.   Just a few months ago, the U.S. Department of Agriculture officially  opened its new state-of-the-art National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility  in my home State of Kansas, where scientists will conduct research into  serious animal disease threats. It will be an important backstop in  protecting our Nation's food supply. I am proud to have this facility  in my district and right down the street from my alma mater, Kansas  State University College of Veterinary Medicine and the Biosecurity  Research Institute, creating a scientific hub that will lead the world  in agricultural research and health.   In Congress, I am proud to represent Kansas State University, the  first land-grant university created under the Morrill Act, and also  Haskell Indian Nations University, which was granted land-grant status  by an act of Congress in 1994. The idea for land-grant universities was  originally proposed in the 1850s to educate students and increase  agricultural expertise and U.S. productivity.   Over the years, these universities have surpassed that original  vision and now represent the cutting edge of the agricultural research  that supports food security around the globe. The faculty, staff, and  students at K-State and Haskell have made it clear that we must support  agricultural research, development, and innovation. When we do so,  agricultural producers in the U.S. and abroad gain access to the  technologies that increase their production even when challenges arise.   Earlier this summer, I co-introduced the Augmenting Research and  Educational Sites to Ensure Agriculture Remains Cutting-Edge and  Helpful Act, or the AG RESEARCH Act. This legislation would address the  deferred maintenance at agricultural research facilities to ensure that  America remains the world leader in research and innovation, instead of  bowing to our adversaries and competitors.   Our work cannot stop there. Congress must also make strong  investments in leveraging public-private partnerships to support  research addressing the biggest food and agricultural challenges and  quickly react to any research shortfall.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with Members of this  Congress to ensure that this farm bill prioritizes research and  innovation. I will be back on the floor soon to deliver another  installment of my farm bill impact series and highlight more programs  and titles within the bill that I believe Congress must understand and  support to ensure that agriculture continues to thrive right here in  America.                            ____________________
