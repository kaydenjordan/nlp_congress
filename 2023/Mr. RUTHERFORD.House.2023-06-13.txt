 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the Second Amendment, which undergirds all the other  amendments, is the only amendment in the U.S. Constitution to include  the following four words: ``shall not be infringed.''   As a lifetime law enforcement officer and former sheriff, I have seen  firsthand how law-abiding citizens using legal firearms protect  themselves, their families, their neighbors, and other innocent persons  from those who would do them harm. Mr. Speaker, any crime I have ever  seen, I have never seen a stabilizing brace used.   While we are prioritizing safe gun ownership and work to keep  firearms out of the hands of criminals and those with mental illness,  the Federal Government shall not infringe on the rights of legal gun  owners.   That means that the executive branch must not use this administrative  rulemaking to rewrite the bounds of the Second Amendment--all without  even a vote from Congress.   That, Mr. Speaker, is exactly what the Biden administration is trying  to do. They legislate by fiat, through rulemaking.   Earlier this year, the ATF finalized a rule that redefines these  pistols with attached stabilizing braces as a short-barreled rifle.  After decades, they changed the interpretation.   Mr. Speaker, this insidious rule would turn millions of law-abiding  gun owners--including many disabled veterans, as we have heard--who  rely on these stabilizing braces into criminals simply for possessing  firearms with a legal accessory.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor this important resolution, and I  urge my colleagues to support its passage.    Mr. Chair, like my good colleague here from Kentucky,  I rise today to remind this Chamber that our Founders put Congress in  charge of writing our laws, not unelected bureaucrats at Federal  agencies.   Yet, since taking office, President Biden has signed more than 100  executive orders and insidious rules fast flowing from executive branch  agencies creating miles of red tape and running up American taxpayers'  tab by $1.5 trillion.   My constituents back home are struggling to make ends meet, and it is  a direct consequence of this administration's misguided policies and  their insidious rulemaking. It is past time that we put a stop to the  President's abuse of executive power.   Last fall, House Republicans made a commitment to our constituents  that this Congress would hold the government accountable. This week,  with the REINS Act, we have an opportunity to show the American people  that we are keeping that commitment.   The very first bill I cosponsored 6 years ago when I first came to  Congress was the REINS Act. The REINS Act stops Federal agencies from  legislating by fiat by requiring Congress to approve all major rules  before they can be enacted.   This bill returns Congress' Article I legislative authority back to  where it belongs, and it will protect hardworking, taxpaying Americans.   The REINS Act is a strong start, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes.''                                time  2000
