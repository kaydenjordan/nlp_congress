 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate that admonition. I promise you, you won't  have to repeat that again on my time.   I appreciate my friend from Massachusetts yielding the time.   I had a whole wonderful opening statement planned, Madam Speaker. It  was going to be our first time down here on the floor together during a  rule.   Janet Rossi, on my team, put together all the great stats and  statistics, many of which you heard my friend from Massachusetts  reference.   And then, as happens to me so often on the Rules Committee, I show up  in a good mood, I show up in a great place, and then folks just poke me  in that way that gets me going.   For my friend from Massachusetts to close with the Republicans have  turned this into a partisan exercise frustrates me to no end.   If there is one thing I have learned in my 9 years in Congress, Madam  Speaker, it is that when it comes to American national security, it  never gets turned into a partisan exercise.   I don't know how your election went, Madam Speaker, or what it was  that your constituents said to you. Mine talked to me a lot about  congressional dysfunction.   ``Why can't they get anything done, Rob?''   ``Why in the world can't you all get together and cooperate?''   And I always respond with the bill that we are looking at today, the  National Defense Authorization Act. I say: In six decades of working,  depending on who was in the White House, who was leading the House, who  was leading the Senate, six decades of working on National Defense  Authorization Acts that need to be passed every single year, how many  times do you think we have actually successfully gotten that done  together?   You know how that conversation goes, Madam Speaker.   ``Rob, I think you guys have gotten it done once in 60 years.''   ``Rob, I think it has happened 4 times, maybe 12 times.''   Madam Speaker, you know what I know, which is that, over these  decades, every single year, without fail--it does not matter who is in  the White House; it does not matter who leads the U.S. House; it does  not matter who leads the United States Senate--we come together as a  Nation to support our men and women who are standing on the frontlines  for us.   So, no, this is not a partisan exercise today, nor should it be from  the Republican side of the aisle.   But I am mystified, Madam Speaker, as to why we have taken what  should have been this continuation of decade upon decade upon decade of  bipartisanship and seemingly gone out of our way, as a new Democratic  majority, to make it partisan.   I know the policy isn't. I know the policy isn't. I can go right down  the line, man after woman, woman after man, on the Democratic side of  the aisle and find patriots who love this country and who will do  whatever it takes to defend it. That is the conversation we had in the  Rules Committee last night.   But I will take you back to my freshman year in Congress, Madam  Speaker. I came in with that rabid class of freshman Republicans, that  largest freshman class in American history. You would think, if we were  going to find partisanship, we would find it in that class.    We all came in on that big Tea Party wave, folks wanting to shake  things up, change things. Do you know what the National Defense  Authorization Act looked like coming out of committee that year?   It passed 60-1, Republicans and Democrats standing together. The year  after that, 56-5. That is what my freshman year looked like: 60-1, 56- 5, Republicans and Democrats standing together on behalf of national  security.   I don't know if you have looked at the vote from the Armed Services  Committee, Madam Speaker. I know you are familiar. It was 33-24,  straight party-line vote, coming out of committee this year.   In the Rules Committee last night up on the third floor, Madam  Speaker, we finished up about midnight. I had the chairman and the  ranking member of the Armed Services Committee there talking about all  the things that they agree on as it comes to national security, yet, to  my friend from Massachusetts' point, the marching orders came down from  somewhere that prevented them from doing what we have always done, and  that is report a bill in a bipartisan fashion.   It has nothing to do with who leads this Congress, Madam Speaker.   About 12 years ago now, when the very first woman to ever hold the  Speaker's chair took over--that would be 2007, Madam Speaker--we didn't  bring the bill to the floor under a rule in a partisan fashion. We  brought the bill to the floor under suspension.                                time  1245    Madam Speaker, that very first bill that was passed in the Pelosi  Speakership passed 369-46 on the floor of the House; 369-46. Most of  the no votes were Democrats voting against the new  [[Page H5317]]  Democratic Speaker of the House and the national security bill; 369-46.   The year after that, the last year of the new Speakership, the year  right before I came, it passed 341-48.   Madam Speaker, I go through these big numbers to make the point that  it didn't have to be this way. We went out of our way, it seems, as an  institution, to divide on national security. I will just give you a few  of those examples.   There are 439 amendments made in order, as my friend from  Massachusetts pointed out, and I think we should celebrate that. But  again, there were 683 amendments offered, so 250 Members were shut out.   Madam Speaker, we had an opportunity, under the new Consensus  Calendar that my friend from Massachusetts referenced, to bring  bipartisan legislation to the floor.   For folks who haven't been following that, the only way to get to the  House floor is to have a committee report your bill. If committees  don't report your bill, you can't get to the House floor unless you end  up on the suspension calendar.   This new majority, this new Democratic majority, changed the rules in  what I think is an amazingly positive and productive way. What they  said is, if you bring together enough Democrats and Republicans to  support your bill, we are going to have to give you a special pathway  to the House floor for those consensus ideas that we want to celebrate  together as an institution.   Madam Speaker, my friend,   Joe Wilson from South Carolina has such a  bill. It is a bill to support the widows and widowers of our fallen  servicemen and women. He has worked this bill with my friend from  Kentucky, Mr. Yarmuth, and this is the very first bill to have  achieved, again, this new level of excellence that the new majority  laid out. If you can bring people together we will give you a special  pathway to the House floor. You get a vote on your bill.   I might point out that my friend from California, Ms. Lofgren, did  this very same thing. She did it on a piece of immigration legislation  that I am a cosponsor of. She put together the requisite number of  Republicans and Democrats, and her bill is coming to the floor, too.   Now, her bill is coming to the floor today on suspension, stand- alone, up-or-down vote to allow Republicans and Democrats to come  together and support that idea.   My friend, Mr. Wilson's bill, without his knowledge, without his  consultation, without his input, has been tucked into this rule, this  partisan rule, this passed-by-party-line-vote rule, to be self-enacted  into the underlying legislation.   I expressed my frustration to the chairman last night; that so often  we fail in ways that meet the very low expectations of our  constituents. This was a wonderful, positive change that Speaker Pelosi  and the new Democratic majority brought to this institution. Madam  Speaker, it is a change that I hope will be a lasting change. It is a  change that I hope will persist no matter who sits in the Speaker's  chair over the next decade upon decade.   But our very first opportunity to use it, we moved it from its  design, which was to be an opportunity to celebrate those things that  bring us together, those hard nuts that we figured out a way to crack  together, and we have turned it into yet another exercise in ``gotcha''  partisan politics.   The men and women who will be served by this legislation deserve  better than that. The men and women who serve in this institution  deserve better than that. And when the new Democratic majority was  sworn in on the first day of this Congress, they promised the American  people better than that.   Madam Speaker, today won't be the last word on this issue; but it is  the first word, and it is an unfortunate one.   I hope that my colleagues will be cognizant of this mistake that they  have made, and I hope that they will correct it before it is too late.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank you for that second admonition. I  did say you wouldn't have to use it again on my side of the aisle. I  can commit to you that you still will not have to issue one on our side  of the aisle.   I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the  ranking member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).    Mr. Speaker, I have become accustomed to your gentle  gavel in the Budget Committee, and I appreciate its gentleness here on  the floor, as well.   I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson),  whose bill you have been so instrumental in, as well.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   You see the challenges that we are confronted with here. My friend  from Massachusetts is telling my friend from South Carolina how my  friend from South Carolina should get his bill to the United States  Senate. There is no one who has worked harder on this issue than Mr.  Wilson has. There is no one whose heart is in this issue more than Mr.  Wilson's is.                                time  1315    I hope you listened carefully to his heartfelt words, because the key  point that he made is that this really wonderful, bipartisan creation  of the new Democratic majority, this Consensus Calendar, if we pass the  rule today will be specifically turned off specifically for Mr.  Wilson's bill.   The new majority can play whatever partisan games they want to, I  wish they wouldn't, but they can, with the underlying bill by stuffing  in self-enacting amendments, by adding amendments after the fact, all  the games that majorities sometimes play, but the new rules that you  voted for, Madam Speaker, that my friend from Massachusetts brags about  on his website, rightfully so, because there were important changes in  those rules, the very first time we have an opportunity to utilize  those rules, Mr. Wilson's bill was ripened for consideration before the  House this week, it is not simply that folks have stolen his language  and tucked it into this partisan underlying piece of legislation, they  have specifically in the rule today prohibited him from availing  himself, and by himself, I mean hundreds of our colleagues and  thousands of widows that they represent, from availing themselves of  the new tool created by the new House majority this year.   I do not value the new majority's use of partisan tools in the NDAA,  but I understand that is the right of a new majority.   My friend from Massachusetts is exactly right. When you lose  elections, losing elections has consequences, but when you pass rules,  passing rules has consequences, too.   I am going to be fascinated by what happens here in about an hour and  a half when the members of the new majority are confronted with an  opportunity to turn off the new bipartisan reforms they just codified  in the House rules 6 months ago.   This should have been a day of celebrating a positive new change from  a new administration, and instead, it is a day of playing politics with  families that have already given much too much to the United States of  America.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, my friend from Massachusetts is right. We have made a  lot of amendments in order in this bill today, but in the absence of an  open rule, we are never able to consider all of the ideas.   One of the ideas we have not had a chance to consider is whether or  not we should be doing business through the Department of Defense with  companies that have a direct or indirect subsidiary company that is  under the control of the Chinese Government or the Communist Party.   The ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Thornberry,  has such an amendment. If we defeat the previous question, Madam  Speaker, I will offer that amendment, which does exactly that. It  prohibits the Department of Defense from contracting with any company  that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of a company in which the  Chinese Government or the Chinese Communist Party has a controlling  interest.    Now, on the list of things I would put on the common bipartisan list  of ideas,  [[Page H5321]]  not doing business with communist China would be one. We have seen that  over and over again. We are in the midst right now of ripping out  security cameras all across this country manufactured by the Chinese as  a result of a prohibition in last year's National Defense Authorization  Act.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be included  immediately prior to the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Speaker, I am holding the Rules of the House here  that say in rule XV, clause 7, paragraph (c), ``After a measure has  maintained at least 290 cosponsors for a cumulative period of 25  legislative days after the presentation of a motion under paragraph  (b)(1), the measure shall be placed on the Consensus Calendar. Such  measure shall remain on the Consensus Calendar until it is'' either  ``considered in the House; or'' . . . ``reported by the committee of  primary jurisdiction.''   Does tucking a measure into the underlying bill, as the self-enacting  amendment does today, satisfy the (c)(1) requirement that it be  considered in the House?    Madam Speaker, the gentleman has only yielded me 30  minutes, but I would be happy to reserve so that the gentleman can  respond.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would say to my friend from  Massachusetts, I don't believe I have any further speakers remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I have enjoyed serving on the gentleman from  Massachusetts' Rules Committee; I confess, not as much as I enjoyed  serving on the gentleman from Texas' Rules Committee, but it is because  when you are on the Rules Committee, there are nine members in the  majority and four members in the minority.   Now, we have talked a lot of math, a lot of votes, a lot of numbers  today, but you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out what  happens when you serve on a committee where there are nine majority  members and four minority members, and the answer is, what happens is  you lose, and you lose a lot.   That is the privilege of being in the majority. When the American  people send a new Speaker and a new majority here, that new majority  gets to craft the process however they want to.   When we crafted the process when I was in the majority, we gave the  minority more amendments than we gave the majority, and we did that  because majorities have powers as committee chairmen. They don't have  to put everything on the amendment calendar. They can tuck it into a  bill.                                time  1330    As the roles have been reversed, again my friend from Massachusetts  is making in order a record number of amendments today. He is making in  order five times more Democratic amendments, folks who already have all  the tools of power, than he is minority Republican amendments.   Again, it is the power of the majority. They get to do that if they  want to do that. Is it fair? Well, we didn't think so. That is why we  did it differently. But if that is what the gentleman wants to do, he  can do it.   But to tuck a bipartisan measure--and I don't mean ``bipartisan''  because one Member signed onto it or two Members signed onto it; I mean  ``bipartisan'' because hundreds of Members signed onto it--into a  measure that intentionally lifts one party up while putting its foot on  the throat of amendments of the other party does not constitute  bipartisanship by any stretch of the imagination.   When my friend from Massachusetts was talking about the rules  package--and he is the author of the rules package. I stipulate, no one  knows more about the rules package than he does.   His heart was in the right place when he added this new Consensus  Calendar. He said this: ``It unrigs the rules so the people's House  actually works for the people again. Americans demanded a new  direction, and this rules package will immediately usher in a new era  for this Congress.''   We are 6 months later, Madam Speaker, and we heard from the author of  the bill that is the subject of contention today. We heard from the  author, the one who has gone out to do all the heavy lifting, do all  the work to build all the bipartisanship--again, not one Member or two  Members, but hundreds of Members. He said he wanted to avail himself of  the Consensus Calendar to get a vote on the floor of the House, an  unbiased, unrigged vote because, as my friend from Massachusetts said,  the new rules package ``unrigs the rules.''   Yet, before we have considered anything else on the Consensus  Calendar this entire year--Mr. Wilson's bill is number one on that  Consensus Calendar--we are confronted with a rule today that turns off  the very provision that my friend from Massachusetts inserted in the  House rules package to unrig the process.   I don't question the motives of any Member of this institution, Madam  Speaker, and partisan motives are fair game around here. We all wish  that they weren't, but occasionally, they are.   When my friend from Massachusetts says that he has done this, this  unprecedented use of the Consensus Calendar and turning it off, he says  he is doing it so that the bill has the best chance of passage in the  Senate and becoming law by being signed on the President's desk. I take  him at his word that he means exactly that.   But I ask you, Madam Speaker, when the author of the bill, the one  who has done all the work, not just for a week, not for a month, but  for years to get this bill to a place where it can be considered by the  Senate, why in the world would we not honor his request, his wish, his  desire? Even if they are going to tuck it into this provision, why not  allow the Consensus Calendar to take its course and get him the vote  that he has worked so hard in a bipartisan way to achieve? If this  isn't about partisan politics, why not give us two bites at making this  the law of the land instead of just one?   If my friend from Massachusetts is right, and when we take a separate  vote on this bill on Friday, it just disappears into the ethos, then no  harm, no foul. But if my friend is wrong and the partisan game that is  being played today exacts a toll--and it is not a toll on us as Members  of Congress, but it is a toll on the widows of the members of our Armed  Forces--then we all know that is a game that has gone too far.   I urge rejection of this rule. Defeat the previous question, allow  our amendment, reject this rule, and allow the bipartisanship that this  new majority offered and then enacted to come to fruition for the very  first time.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5323]]         Madam Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I am  a little confused about what has happened, Madam Speaker. Are we about  to begin a new hour of debate on a new amendment after we just finished  the hour of debate on the underlying rule?    Under the new hour, Madam Speaker?    Well, then I would ask my friend from Massachusetts--I  only had 6 minutes to yield before, and I confess I did not yield any  of them to my friend. The gentleman now has 60 minutes--could I ask for  more than a minute of his time, the customary 30 minutes?    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
