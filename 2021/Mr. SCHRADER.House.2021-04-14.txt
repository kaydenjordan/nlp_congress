 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of S.  415, a bill that has the same policy as my own and Mr. Guthrie's here  in the House, H.R. 1857, the Protecting Access to Safe and Effective  Medicines Act.   This bill is a simple fix, providing clarity around the drug approval  process by increasing the specificity of the language companies may use  when submitting these complex and often lengthy applications. Simply  put, utilizing the term ``active ingredient'' opens the unintended  opportunity for pharmaceutical companies to make minor, relatively  nonpharmacological changes to the same chemical and prevent generic  alternatives from coming to the marketplace. By changing this language,  as this bill does, to ``active moiety,'' we will be able to close  another loophole that can be exploited by companies to inappropriately  obtain exclusivity and hold back competition in the marketplace, the  key mechanism for lowering drug prices.   While this is good policy, it is one small piece of the larger drug- pricing conversation that we need to have. It demonstrates, yet again,  that the policies to lower drug prices are bipartisan and bicameral. In  fact, there are many such policies that did not get done in the last  Congress that offer a starting point for a comprehensive approach  addressing drug pricing, and now is the time to continue this important  work.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the help in  supporting this important bill before us today, and I urge its passage.
