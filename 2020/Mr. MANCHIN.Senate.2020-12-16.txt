 Mr. President, I would like permission to basically be  able to complete my remarks.    Mr. President, I want to start by thanking all of the  Members--and I mean all of the Members--who have worked so diligently  to produce this product.   This is the product we produced with the so-called Gang of 8, but it  turned into a bigger gang than that because more and more people want  to work in a bipartisan way in the Senate. I have said: It is alive and  well; we just have to exercise it more.   We did that. We brought over the bicameral group, the Problem  Solvers, and they were tremendously instrumental in being involved in  this process. I am so pleased to have that bicameral work, bipartisan  work. We need more of it, and we are going to basically demand more of  it. But with this product right now, as the ``four corners'' are  working, this is the template they have used.   Leader Schumer has said that this is what they have used because the  legislative language has already been produced. There might be some  tweaks to it, but there are so many people.   Let me tell you how it started. My dear friend Senator Durbin is  here. After the election, we called each other back and forth, a few of  us, saying: Something has to be done. Nothing is moving. People are  hurting.   We heard that all during the election, and they couldn't figure out  why we hadn't done anything. I had no good explanation because,  basically, the two leaders on both sides of the aisle were locked, and  I said we didn't know how to break it. The only way we could break it  is by doing something showing we could come together.   We did that. We did that in a way that--we had a dinner. Senator Mark  Warner from Virginia said: Let's have a dinner. Senator Lisa Murkowski  said: Come to my house. So we go to  [[Page S7517]]  Lisa Murkowski's house, and there were eight of us. We had four R's and  four D's, and we grew from there. On our side, there was Senator Mark  Warner, Senator Dick Durbin, Senator Jean Shaheen, myself. On the  Republican side, there was Senator Lisa Murkowski, Senator Susan  Collins, Senator Bill Cassidy, and Senator Mitt Romney. From there, it  grew. Then we brought the bipartisan group over--Congressman Josh  Gottheimer and Congressman   Tom Reed and the Problem Solvers--and we  kept growing from there, and we had more Senators coming in. So we got  input from every quadrant we could possibly in order to do what we did,  but it took quite a while.   The biggest hurdle we had was how much we could agree that we need as  an emergency. Democrats were at 1.2, 1.3. The Republicans were at 5 or  6. We couldn't move off of that, and it took us a while to say: Let's  look at emergencies and everything that basically is going to run out  of time in December and be nullified. People are going to lose their  lifelines.   We started putting all those figures together and came up with the  $900 billion figure. That is where 908 came from. I understand they are  still at the 900, which we appreciate very much. I am hopeful that we  can help break that deadlock and be a part of this, but there is so  much more that has to be done, and there is so much more need out there  that will need to be done. We must all come together behind President- Elect Joe Biden to make sure that we do it and look at the need of  America, not the greed of America.   Trust me, if you are sending checks, everyone is in line, but if you  are really getting to the people who are on the frontline, they need  it.   I have people who have said and we have all said: We are not going to  go home. We can't go home until we do something. Guess what. If we  don't do anything, a lot of people won't have a home to go to this  holiday season. They truly won't. They are being evicted. They are  losing their lifeline. They are losing their shelter.   Food assistance--my goodness. Think about all the people in need.  Have you ever seen the lines of people whom you have never seen before,  who have never been to a food give-out or a food bank or a food line?   These are the things that we addressed, and we addressed them in the  most compassionate way. That is our job.   I understand that our four corners are very close to a deal. I think  it will be done. I know it will be done because we have to do it.  Failure is not an option. So we are going to work very hard to continue  to do that.   Let me tell you, we have unemployment assistance for people who lost  their jobs, food assistance, shelter assistance. We have small business  debt relief. We have student loan forbearance. We have so many other  things, and people are depending on us. We include $300 a week. I am  not sure what the final bill will be on the safety net realm there. We  had $13 billion for food assistance. We had SNAP benefits, helping  people who are falling into that chasm of welfare who need help, and  $35 billion for healthcare providers. We had 20 percent set aside for  the rural hospitals and rural clinics. We had $16 billion for testing  and tracing, and I understand they are increasing that, which is  needed; $12 billion for community development financial institutions;  $5 billion for emergency funding for substance abuse prevention and  treatment and mental health services; $82 billion for education,  including $20 billion for basically higher education; $10 billion to  support childcare; $10 billion for broadband, including $3 billion for  education and distance learning; and $45 billion in emergency funding  for transportation. There are so many needs that we have out there.   We have a second bill too. I am understanding that was a little bit  more controversial, but I can tell you one thing: There was no  controversy on the first bill--$748 billion; 100 percent Democrats and  Republicans--all had input to make that happen.   Again, I say the staffs have worked a yeoman's job over day and night  for the last month. They have done a terrific job.   Now for State and local, I really believe personally there is a need  because I have seen the frontline workers and the amount of revenue we  might lose for people not to have those services that are essential.  They are depending on it. We might lose it because the States or the  localities don't have the revenue. So we have to come back and address  that. If we don't do it now, we have to do it as soon as President- Elect Joe Biden takes over, look at it again to try to help those in  need, and we will do that.   So we have come together. We have come together. Also what we are  saying is the money that the Governors and everyone has left over, they  are going to be able to have extensions on how that is used, and we  have some direction.   We want to make sure that the locals have some opportunities too.  Some of the local communities and local municipalities or local  counties did not get the revenue that they should have gotten in the  first tranche of money, so we are hoping that is taken care of also.   So all these protections that we put in there, we are trying to help.  We are trying to get a pathway forward to bring our economy back, to  make sure we are able to. But this is the product that got it all  going, and this is the group of people who made it happen, the  bipartisan group who worked day and night, and I can't thank them more.  I couldn't be more proud to be with a group whom I consider true  Americans who stepped up to the plate and got something done when we  didn't think it could be done.   But, again, I want to thank all of my colleagues, my Republican  colleagues and friends and Democratic colleagues who worked so hard,  and everybody who is going to benefit. I think it can be a merry  Christmas. It can be a much happier Christmas for sure when we all go  home and look at our constituents and say ``We have done everything we  can to get you through the most challenging time,'' which will be the  first quarter of 2021, and this bill is an emergency bill that goes  through April 1.   I would note--oh, we are ready to go.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor an American hero  and one of West Virginia's native sons who was larger than life and an  inspiration for generations of Americans--General Charles Elwood  ``Chuck'' Yeager. Chuck bravely served our Nation as a pilot for more  than 30 years in the U.S. Air Force during World War II and Vietnam.  When he became the first pilot to break the sound barrier he challenged  each of us to test the limits of what is possible. I am grateful to  have known this legendary West Virginian and to call him my dear  friend.   Chuck truly embodied what it means to be from the Mountain State.  Born in 1923 in rural Lincoln County, Chuck grew up the way many of us  do in West Virginia--hunting and fishing and learning early to be  respectful of nature and our fellow man. Like his father, A. Hal  Yeager, who was a gaswell driller, Chuck showed an aptitude for  mechanics, and by the time he was a teenager, he was able to assemble a  car engine on his own. His work ethic and natural talent would serve  him well throughout the rest of his remarkable life.   In 1941, Chuck enlisted in the Army Air Forces right out of high  school and trained as a mechanic before heading to flight school. In  1944, he experienced a harrowing encounter when his plane was shot down  over German-occupied France. He and another American travelled on foot  through mountainous terrain and snow toward neutral Spain. As they  stopped to rest, the Nazis opened fire, wounding the man traveling with  Chuck. Chuck carried him into Spain, where they met British forces.  Despite the treacherous journey he had just endured, to everyone's  astonishment, Chuck was determined to fly again. He climbed his way  through the ranks, pursuing a return to combat duty, which was  eventually granted. For his service, Chuck received the Silver Star,  the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple  Heart, and the Air Medal. He also received the Presidential Medal of  Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian award, from President Ronald  Reagan in 1985. There are so few Veterans left from the World War II  era, and it is our responsibility and our privilege to recognize the  service of these noble heroes.   In 1957, Chuck became an air squadron commander and then commander of  the Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards in 1961. He also  commanded a fighter wing and flew combat missions during the Vietnam  war. He retired as an Air Force brigadier general in 1975, and in an  honorary gesture, he was promoted to the rank of major general in 2005.   We all of course know the story of the day Chuck became the first  pilot to break the sound barrier. On October 14, 1947, Chuck flew an  orange Bell X-1 aircraft at nearly 700 mph and made history. Flying F- 15 planes, he broke the sound barrier again on the 50th and 55th  anniversaries of his pioneering flight, and he was a passenger on an F- 15 plane in another breaking of the sound barrier to commemorate the  65th anniversary.   I knew Chuck very well and he was a dear friend to me and Gayle. As  Governor, I was fortunate to host Chuck at least once a year for the  One Shot Deer Hunt, which gives proceeds to helping the hungry. He told  me so many incredible stories of his service, including all the  intricate details of his legendary flight. I recall him telling me that  the only reason he got to fly the Bell X-1 that day was because the  previous pilot they asked wanted too much money. They offered Chuck an  extra 60 dollars a month, and he jumped at the chance. Not only is the  story true about Chuck pushing through with a broken rib, but he wasn't  even supposed to break the sound barrier that day. He thought if he  didn't go for it that first day, he wouldn't get another chance. Chuck  truly had nerves of steel.   Long after his record-breaking flight, Chuck remained in our hearts  as a symbol of patriotism and bravery. His life is full of tales of his  bravery, his stoicism in the face of danger, and his determination to  perform his duty no matter the cost.   The legacy Chuck leaves is such an important part of our heritage as  West Virginians. Our little State has mined the coal that forged the  steel that built the tanks and ships that keep our country the  strongest in the world. It is an honor to remember Chuck as part of our  military service heritage and our way of life that sinks deep into the  roots of West Virginia's rich culture. I encourage all Americans to  learn what they can about this legendary West Virginian.   Gayle and I are praying for Chuck's wife Victoria, daughters, Susan  and Sharon, son, Don, and all who loved and admired him.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is a great privilege of mine to  rise and honor a pillar of strength in my home State of West Virginia,  Carmine Cann, Sr., as we celebrate his 90th birthday on July 27, 2020.   Carmine has been like family to me for much of my life, and if there  is anything to know about Carmine, it is that family is everything. It  is one of the countless things I have always admired most about him, in  addition to his unwavering devotion to our home State and his  unparalleled knowledge of business and the law. Throughout my own life  and career, I have always kept Carmine in the back of my mind-- remembering to stay strong for my State and my family.   A native of Clarksburg, Carmine practiced law with his father upon  graduating from West Virginia University College of Law. In 1954, their  firm merged with another and became Young, Morgan and Cann, where he  practiced until joining Flaherty's Clarksburg office in 2017.   Carmine served in the West Virginia Legislature for 8 years as a  member of the House of Delegates. Throughout government circles, he was  widely known for his keen political awareness. The Charleston Gazette  dubbed him ``Mighty Mouse'' for his accomplishments in and behind the  scenes. After choosing not to run for reelection, Carmine served the  West Virginia Coal Association and West Virginia Beer Wholesalers  Association as a governmental relations consultant for over 25 years.   Some of his awards and honors include St. Mary's Irish Legend in  2011, Italian American Man of the Year by the West Virginia Italian  Heritage Festival in 2005, and recipient of the Distinguished West  Virginian Award in 1995.   Among his many roles in the community, Carmine is also well known as  a founding member of the Italian Heritage Festival's Board of  Directors. The Italian Heritage Festival is such a special event for me  and for people not only in West Virginia but for people from across the  country. The Italian immigrants who came to this country didn't know  where they were going, couldn't speak the language, and were unfamiliar  with Appalachian culture. All they knew is that they had to work hard  and were determined to provide a good life for their families. That is  what the Festival represents, and those are the ideals that Carmine  upheld. His lovely wife Florence, their 7 children, 25 grandchildren,  24 great-grandchildren, and their entire family, 73 people altogether,  have all been active in this beloved festival. After Florence's  passing, Carmine endowed the Florence Chico Cann Children's Creative  Arts Program as well as the Children's Chorus. Carmine is committed to  the beautiful North Central region of our State, and I know I join  countless West Virginians in thanking him for his service to his  community for so many years.   Carmine will tell you that much of his success is rooted in faith,  and he is forever thankful for the blessings that his Lord and Savior,  Jesus Christ, has provided. He is never one to accept acclaim very  well, instead deferring all praise and thanks to the Almighty. He is a  shining beacon of his faith, family, community, and State.   Carmine's expertise has been sought-after by Senators, Congressmen,  Governors, budding community leaders, and his friends and family. He  has never been one to shy away from a friendly debate with those who  have opposing views. Carmine has the greatest respect for all  opinions--people from all walks of life. He is first and foremost an  outstanding person, a gentleman in the old sense, and a true broker of  compromise in a world so in need of that leadership and trust.   Carmine, despite that we aren't able to have a birthday party in your  honor this year, I know this will still be a memorable occasion for you  to reflect on your many accomplishments and experiences, while you  enjoy the well wishes from your loved ones. You have provided so much  happiness and wisdom to the lives of those around you, myself included.  It is my wish that the memory of this special day remains with you just  as your guidance and influence will remain in all the lives you have  touched. I know that Florence, a true angel, is smiling down on you.  Gayle and I are thinking fondly about you on this special day, and we  sincerely appreciate your many years of loyal friendship.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is an honor to rise today to  recognize the unwavering service of a true West Virginian, CSM Phillip  R. Cantrell, as he retires from Active military service and transitions  to a new chapter of public service. Phillip Cantrell is simply the best  of the best. He is humble, competent, compassionate, and a warrior  scholar. He has served in the toughest of environments, leading  generations of men and women while having an immeasurable and positive  influence on them. I know this because I was fortunate to have Phillip  on my staff for a year as a congressional fellow and am fortunate to  call him my friend.   Command Sergeant Major Cantrell is retiring from his final  assignment, where he served as the senior enlisted leader of the West  Virginia National Guard, a duty that he assumed in 2018 where he  advised the Adjutant General on all matters pertaining to the nearly  6,400 enlisted soldiers and airmen of the West Virginia National Guard.  Before this assignment with the West Virginia National Guard, Phillip  served in the toughest and most elite Active Army units, in combat and  in peace. Phillip is the Soldier's Soldier, having trained a generation  of leaders as a drill sergeant, led infantry units in combat as a first  sergeant and command sergeant major, and paid reverence to our Nation's  veterans as the command sergeant major of the Old Guard.   Growing up in Logan County, Phillip enlisted in the Active Army  Infantry in May of 1988 as soon as he graduated high school. He  attending infantryman training at Fort Benning, GA, and would add many  qualifications along the way, including Master Jumpmaster, Air Assault,  Combat Infantry, and Drill Sergeant Badges. He married his wife Sherry  in June 1989, and they have been together through numerous deployments,  traveling the world together to serve their country and State.   Anyone who has served in the military knows that the noncommissioned  officer is the backbone of the Army. Throughout his career, Phillip has  done the heavy lifting and served at every level of noncommissioned  officer leadership, to include team and squad leaders, platoon  sergeant, first sergeant, operations sergeant major and battalion and  brigade command sergeant major.   Command Sergeant Major Cantrell served in the 82nd Airborne Division  from 1988 to 1996, participating in Operation Just Cause and Operations  Desert Shield/Desert Storm before being reassigned to Fort Leonard Wood  to serve as a drill sergeant. Upon his completion of drill sergeant  duty, he returned to the 82nd Airborne Division and Fort Bragg, where  he was deployed on a peacekeeping mission to Kosovo with the 3/504th  Infantry Regiment.   In 2005, while first sergeant of D Company, 2/505th Infantry  Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division, Command Sergeant Major Cantrell was  deployed in support of Hurricane Katrina relief efforts and  subsequently deployed two companies to Iraq in 2006 in support of  Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was deployed to Iraq in one of the most  dangerous locations during 2006-2007, the time period known as the  surge, when troop deployments were unexpectedly extended from 12 months  to 15 months.  [[Page S7538]]  My State director served on the ground with him in Iraq during this  time and attests to his solid leadership, having seen him operate  during the most challenging, life-and-death conditions. She called him  ``the best in a unit of the bests,'' which is a testament to his  leadership in the most difficult of conditions.   After his combat deployments to Iraq, he was promoted to sergeant  major in 2008 and after completion of the U.S. Army Sergeants Major  Academy was assigned as the 8th Army Operations and Protection Sergeant  Major in Yongsan, Korea.   Command Sergeant Major Cantrell was then competitively selected to  serve as the battalion command sergeant major of 4th Battalion, 3rd  Infantry Regiment at Fort Myer and in 2012 was hand-selected as the  brigade command sergeant major of the 3rd Infantry Regiment, ``The Old  Guard.'' This hallowed unit is America's oldest Active Duty infantry  unit where only the best are selected to serve. The Old Guard is the  official ceremonial unit of the Army, providing a guard at the Tomb of  the Unknown Soldier and performing countless commemorations at  Arlington National Cemetery, amongst other missions. Phillip's service  at The Old Guard is of the highest caliber and reflects great credit  upon his patriotism and abilities.   After serving as the most senior enlisted member of The Old Guard,  Phillip was again competitively selected as an Army congressional  fellow, an honor awarded to very few highly competitive servicemembers.  That is where I really got the chance to know Phillip and see him in  action when he served as a member of my staff for a year.   I have come to know Command Sergeant Major Cantrell well throughout  the years as a valuable part of my team as an Army congressional fellow  and can attest to his strength of character and profound leadership. It  is a privilege to recognize him for his service to our State and  Nation.   Following the year in my office, he was a congressional legislative  liaison in the Army Senate Liaison Division, traveling around the world  with congressional delegations.   Command Sergeant Major Cantrell holds a master's degree in  legislative affairs from George Washington University and a bachelor's  in human resource management from American Military University.   Because of Phillip's career and his unique leadership talents, it is  my greatest honor to recognize his service. When visitors come to West  Virginia, I jump at the chance to tell them we have fought in more  wars, shed more blood, and lost more lives for the cause of freedom  than most any State. We have always done the heavy lifting and never  complained. We have mined the coal and forged the steel that built the  guns, ships, and factories that have protected and continue to protect  our country to this day.   I am so deeply proud of what West Virginians have accomplished and  what they will continue to accomplish to protect the freedoms we hold  dear. Command Sergeant Major Cantrell is a part of this legacy of  excellence and an inspiration to all who will follow in his footsteps.  I want to wish Phillip, his wife Sherry who has been with him every  step of the way, along with his family and many friends, a heartfelt  congratulations and warm wishes for future health and  happiness.                            ____________________     Mr. President I rise today to honor the life of  a proud West Virginian and a devoted husband, father, and grandfather,  my cousin, Mark Allen Gouzd.   Put simply, Mark embodied what it means to be a West Virginian, and  the legacy he has left is such an important part of our heritage. There  is no greater accomplishment than being in a position to give back to  your community, and his work in mine safety and rescue truly benefited  our home State in a profound way that undoubtedly saved countless  lives.   After graduating from Mannington High School and later Fairmont State  College, Mark began his career in land surveying and eventually began  working with Federal Number 2 Mines. As an instructor for the Mine  Rescue Program, Mark diligently prepared miners for the rigors of  working underground. The teams he trained always went on to perform  well in local, State, and even national competitions. For the last few  years, Mark worked as an extension agent for West Virginia University  as the manager of mine rescue and emergency response training at WVU's  Doll's Run facility. He also served as the WVU Collegiate Mine Rescue  Team trainer.   Having experienced a coal mining tragedy within our own family,  Mark's work was especially admirable and came from a place of caring  deeply for the people who keep our lights on, as well as their  families. West Virginia suffered an immeasurable loss when 78 brave  coal miners were killed in the Farmington No. 9 mine disaster 52 years  ago. My dear uncle John Gouzd, one of my neighbors, and several high  school classmates were in the mine that day. For days, we all sat  around the company store waiting for updates about the fate of our  loved ones. I will never forget the look on my mother's face when she  heard the news that her younger brother had died in the explosion. Our  community and the entire State came together to mourn the lives we  lost. For Mark and me, that disaster fueled our passion for promoting  changes that would help keep our miners safe and also ensure their  families were taken care of.   I always consider myself fortunate to have grown up around such  strong, inspiring people. Marion County and our home State as a whole  is just special that way. I always respected and admired Mark for the  strong, passionate leader he was. As a lifelong member of St. Patrick's  Catholic Church in Mannington, Mark served as a lector, Eucharistic  minister, and choir member. The importance of faith and family was at  the forefront of everything he set out to do, and it carried him  through any hardships he faced.   He loved to work with his hands and found solace in gardening and  working on his farm, and I know I join our entire family in remembering  Mark as the hard-working, generous soul he was. His legacy lives on  through our many loving memories of him as well as through the brave  coal miners who learned from his lifesaving training.   What is most important is that he lived a full life, surrounded by  his loved ones. Gayle and I extend our condolences to his beloved wife  of nearly 36 years, Lora; their sons, Zachary and his wife Kelly, and  Jeremy and his wife Allie; and his grandson Oliver; as well as his  parents Joe and Carole; his sisters, Christina and her husband Jack,  and Cynthia and her husband Steve; his brother-in-law Remy Petrucci;  and his mother-in-law and father-in-law, Leonard and Judy Myers; in  addition to his numerous nieces and nephews. Again, we extend our most  sincere condolences from our family to theirs for our shared loss of  this remarkable person. The unwavering love he had for our family,  friends, and our home State will live on forever in the hearts of all  who had the privilege of knowing him.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of one of West Virginia's finest. Patrolwoman Cassie Johnson of  the Charleston Police Department represented the very best of who we  are as a statewide community, and she was taken from us far too soon on  December 3, 2020, at the age of 28. Cassie was the daughter of an  ironworker; she shared her mother's steely resolve and iron  constitution.   Being a police officer in the city she loved and grew up in was a  dream come true for Cassie. She was sworn in by Mayor Amy Goodwin in  January of 2019 and had previously worked as a city humane officer.  Cassie was born and raised in our State's capital. She could have gone  anywhere, and she chose to stay and protect and serve the community  that made her who she was.   She was truly a beautiful person in every way. Growing up, Cassie was  an athlete and particularly loved softball. She would one day find that  the Little League field she played on as a child was on her beat, and  so she watched over it with great care so the current generation of  children could play in safety. One of the first things she did when she  was assigned to the field was to clean up the drug paraphernalia to  make it a safe place for kids. Because  [[Page S7539]]  of her efforts, children and their families have been able to enjoy the  field as a clean, safe, fun place to play.   Cassie was an animal lover and dedicated her life to rescuing pets  who had been cast aside, even taking an animal behavior class in  Tennessee so she could better understand the language of dogs. Cassie's  beloved dog, Emma, was a chocolate lab who passed away just a few  months ago. Cassie grieved deeply for Emma because she had a special  connection with her. Years ago, when Cassie was in high school, Emma  had nine chocolate lab pups--in Cassie's bedroom. Her mom tells the  story of taking the runt of the litter with her to pick Cassie up at  school. When they got home, there were chocolate lab pups everywhere.  That was just one of the many adventures Cassie had with Emma. No  doubt, they are reunited again.   Cassie was a music lover, most likely because her mother sang her to  sleep as a child. She was surrounded by instruments and music  throughout her life. She loved to make the world beautiful, and that is  also why she enjoyed decorating for the holidays. The weekend before  she passed, she decorated her mother's house for Christmas, alongside  her dear sister, Chelsea. One of the last actions she took the day of  her passing was to wipe the snow from those holiday decorations because  she always looked out for her mother any way she could.   Most importantly, Cassie was a genuinely good person and lived her  whole life with West Virginia values. She worked hard and bought her  own home at the age of 25. She was beloved in the community and in her  profession, as evidenced in the tremendous outpouring of grief,  support, and fellowship that followed her tragic passing. Her mother  describes her as respectful and well-mannered throughout her whole  life. Cassie will be deeply missed not only because of who she was but  because we are all so keenly aware of and sorrowful for what might have  been.   No one can ever take away what Cassie represented to the Charleston  community and the entire Mountain State. Every one of our female  leaders in West Virginia is the epitome of strength and advancement in  their fields and serve as inspiring role models for the next  generation, and that is due in great part to the women who broke ground  in generations past. Because of their accomplishments, more young women  like Cassie have, and will, blaze their own trails and continue to make  our State and entire Nation proud. I have such tremendous respect for  our police officers and all of our first responders. Cassie's  compassion, courage, and selflessness will live on through the memories  of those who knew and loved her, as well as through the countless lives  she touched and inspired every day. She leaves us having made a  profound impact in the community she loved as well as in the lives of  those around her.   I had the tremendous and humbling honor of visiting with Cassie's  family at her bedside in her final hours. It is clear to me that Cassie  came from strong roots and that her life was filled with joy and love.  She was a beloved daughter, sister, and a loyal friend, who adored her  three dogs and all animals. True to her character, Cassie was an organ  donor, and her final act of selflessness has given someone else a  chance at life.   The Charleston Police Department has retired Cassie's unit number,  146. I know I join the entire Mountain State in mourning our shared  loss of this bright, generous, vibrant spirit. Gayle and I extend our  deepest condolences to Cassie's mother Sheryl, her sister Chelsea, her  brother Terry, and all her family and friends, her colleagues with the  Charleston Police Department, as well as the city of Charleston, and  will forever keep them in our prayers.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor a proud West  Virginian, noble veteran, a beloved son, brother, uncle, godfather,  great-uncle, and a dear friend to all who had the pleasure of knowing  him. It is a privilege to recognize the life and legacy of a very dear  friend to myself and Gayle, Dr. Richard Howard, for his many years of  dedicated service to the city of Charleston and beyond.   Born and raised in Charleston, WV, Richard attended West Virginia  University, where he achieved many distinctions as a member of the  National Blue Key, Helvetia, Sphinx and president of the freshman class  in 1960. He received early acceptance into the West Virginia University  School of Dentistry, earning his doctor of dental surgery degree in  1967. Put simply, when Richard put his mind to something, there was no  stopping him from doing it at 100 percent.   That mentality worked in his favor as he joined the U.S. Air Force as  a captain, stationed during the Vietnam era at Dover Air Force Base.  Following his honorable discharge, Richard returned to Charleston to  start his long-tenured career in dentistry. After a year as a partner  with a local dental office, Richard set up his own practice as Howard  Family Dentistry, later known as a joint venture with his brother as  Howard and Howard Family Dentistry.   There is a lot to be said of someone who bravely serves our Nation,  then returns home to continue giving back to the community that made  them who they are. When visitors come to West Virginia, I jump at the  chance to tell them we have fought in more wars, shed more blood, and  lost more lives for the cause of freedom than most any State. We have  always done the heavy lifting and never complained. We have mined the  coal and forged the steel that built the guns, ships, and factories  that have protected and continue to protect our country to this day. I  am so deeply proud of what West Virginians have accomplished and what  they will continue to accomplish to protect the freedoms we hold dear.  That is Richard's legacy, and his courage, loyalty, and humility will  never be forgotten.   Richard was deeply involved in the community through the Kanawha  Valley Dental Association, the West Virginia Dental Association, the  American Dental Association, and the Academy of General Dentists, the  International College of Dentists, and was founder and twice-serving  president of the Virginia Street Dental Study Club. He was a member of  the Beni Kedem Shrine, the Legion of Honor, Shrine Jesters, a 32 degree  Mason, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Charleston Symphony, the  Charleston Community Music Association, and the West Virginia  University Woodburn Circle of Honor. Richard was a major supporter of  his church, St. George Orthodox Cathedral, of which he was knight in  the Order of St. Ignatius of Antioch.   Richard had such a zest for life and was a true renaissance man in  every sense of the word. Each challenge he took on, he conquered, and  he did so with unparalleled generosity, humility, and leadership. When  his father passed away, Richard truly stepped up as the family  patriarch. He adored his siblings and his entire family, always willing  to offer advice. He would be honest with you if you were wrong, but his  judgement was always fair. His bright smile and vibrant personality  made any occasion even more special. His accomplishments are endless  and he was an inspiration to all. He is dearly missed.   Put simply, Richard represented the very best of West Virginia, which  is saying quite a lot. In the Mountain State, if you are hungry you  will be fed. If you are lost, someone will not only give you directions  but will offer to drive you to your destination. That is just who we  are, and that is who Richard was. We have lost a shining star in our  home State's capital, but his impact on the lives of his patients and  his passion for this special community will last forever. It was an  honor to have known him and to call him my friend.   What is most important is that Richard lived a full and accomplished  life, surrounded by dear friends and family. It is my hope that his  loved ones are able to find peace, strength, and support in one  another. I extend my condolences to his brother Dr. Edward E. Howard;  sisters Jolene Howard, Janet M. Howard, Margaret Howard Teeter  (Andrew), and Sabrina Howard Stump (James); nephew, Dr. Matthew D.  Stump; and nieces Dr. Jacqueline H. Stump, Elizabeth Stevens Bloch  (Tom), and great nephew Thomas M. Bloch III. Gayle and I, from our  family to yours, extend to you our most sincere condolences for our  shared loss of this wonderful person. The unwavering love  [[Page S7540]]  Richard had for his family, friends, community, our home State, and our  great Nation will live on forever in the hearts of all who knew  him.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is an honor to rise today to  recognize the legacy of MG James A. Hoyer of the West Virginia National  Guard, a man whom I have worked with for decades and a man whom I am  fortunate to call my friend.   General Hoyer assumed the duties as The Adjutant General, West  Virginia Joint Forces Headquarters-West Virginia in 2011, providing  command guidance and vision to the West Virginia Army and Air National  Guard of more than 6,500 Citizen Soldiers and Airmen.   Upon obtaining his undergraduate degree from the University of  Charleston, he was commissioned in 1983 through a joint Reserve Officer  Training Corps program with West Virginia State University. General  Hoyer's military career began in the West Virginia National Guard as a  Cavalry Officer. He attended the Special Forces Officer Qualification  course and spent more than 14 years with the 2nd Battalion, 19th  Special Forces Group. General Hoyer led the development of the West  Virginia National Guard Counterdrug Task Force and the Joint  Interagency Training and Education Center and its Center for National  Response--a national level operational and training capability for  critical infrastructure protection and consequence response. General  Hoyer's most recent assignment was Director, Joint Staff, of the West  Virginia Joint Force Headquarters.   General Hoyer continued his education throughout his career,  including West Virginia Graduate College in 1987, United States Army  War College in 2004, and obtained his Federal/Department of Defense  Identify Management Certificate from the Naval Post Graduate School in  2009.   Among his many awards, decorations and achievements, General Hoyer  has earned the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal (with 1  Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster), Army Commendation Medal (with 1 Bronze Oak  Leaf Cluster), Army Achievement Medal (with 2 Bronze Oak Leaf  Clusters), Army Reserve Component Achievement Medal (with 1 Silver Oak  Leaf Cluster), National Defense Service Medal (with 1 Bronze Service  Star), Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal,  Armed Forces Reserve Medal (with Silver Hourglass and M Device), Army  Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, Army Reserve Component  Overseas Training Ribbon, West Virginia Commendation Medal, West  Virginia Emergency Service Ribbon, West Virginia State Service Ribbon,  West Virginia Service Ribbon, West Virginia Counterdrug Ribbon, West  Virginia Distinguished Unit Award, Special Forces Tab, Master  Parachutist Badge, Air Assault Badge, and the Thailand Parachute Badge.   I have seen firsthand how the Guard protects the citizens of West  Virginia when we are in our most desperate hour of need and how the  Guard protects our country when called upon to serve at the command and  control of the President of the United States. As Governor, my most  honored title was that of Commander-in-Chief of the Guard. I worked  closely with Jim Hoyer and the Guard and did everything I could to  increase capabilities for personnel, equipment, and facilities.   As U.S. Senator, I have the honor of serving on the Senate Armed  Services Committee, as well as the Appropriations Committee, the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, and as ranking member on the Senate Energy  Committee. I continue to work hand-in-hand with Jim Hoyer to promote  good policy for the Guard, the Department of Defense, and all of our  Nation's heroes.   Throughout my time as Governor and as Senator, I have relied on the  National Guard not only to do their mission but to provide solid advice  so that I could form the best policies. I have truly counted on Jim  Hoyer's sound guidance and military expertise every step of the way.  Whether it was forming the Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus, writing  amendments on the Defense bill, preventing war in Syria, providing  death gratuity benefits for families of the fallen during a government  shutdown, or bringing more military assets like the C-130J to West  Virginia, Jim Hoyer has been with me every step of the way.   The West Virginia National Guard fulfills its mission of ``Delivering  Freedom with Courage'' every single day. I am so very proud of the  Guard for serving our State and our Nation so courageously in times of  need, and I am grateful for their unwavering service and selfless  efforts to protect our homeland. This success is due in large part to  the Guard's outstanding leadership, and I am grateful to General Hoyer  for serving as a part of this legacy of excellence.   When visitors come to West Virginia, I jump at the chance to tell  them we have fought in more wars, shed more blood, and lost more lives  for the cause of freedom than most any State. We have always done the  heavy lifting and never complained. We have mined the coal and forged  the steel that built the guns, ships, and factories that have protected  and continue to protect our country to this day. I am so deeply proud  of what West Virginians have accomplished and what they will continue  to accomplish to protect the freedoms we hold dear.   While General Hoyer is retiring and everyone is sure to miss his  strong leadership, his dedication and commitment to excellence will  leave a lasting legacy with the countless lives he has touched. Again,  I congratulate General Hoyer for his remarkable years of service and  his outstanding dedication to protecting our great Nation. I am honored  to wish good health and much happiness to him, his wife Amy, his sons  Jacob and Drew, and his wonderful extended family in the days and years  ahead.                            ____________________
