 Mr. Speaker, ``As a law enforcement officer, my  fundamental duty is to serve mankind; to safeguard lives and property;  to protect the innocent against deception, the weak against oppression  or intimidation, and the peaceful against violence or disorder. . . .''   Mr. Speaker, that is the first paragraph of the Law Enforcement Code  of Ethics that every law enforcement officer across this country swears  to upon their becoming a law enforcement officer and accepting that  badge.   I can tell you, yesterday, during the horrible event that took place,  Officers Bailey and Griner with the Capitol Hill Police performed their  duties above and beyond the expected.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to take this opportunity on behalf of law  enforcement officers across America to thank them for doing their job  with such outstanding bravery and courage.   I also want to let the Scalise family and the Mika family know that  they are in our prayers. We pray for their speedy recovery.   God bless.                            ____________________
