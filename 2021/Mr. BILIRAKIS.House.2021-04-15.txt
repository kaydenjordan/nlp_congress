 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the current  crisis at our southern border.   In March, unlawful border crossings reached their highest level in 15  years. This includes nearly 19,000 unaccompanied minors, which  represents a 99  [[Page H1798]]  percent increase from February and the highest figure ever recorded.   This is a dangerous humanitarian, health, and security crisis that  warrants immediate action.   I am particularly concerned about these children, Mr. Speaker. As the  President of Mexico recently confirmed, this administration's policies  and speeches on this subject have convinced families that they can send  their children to the United States in search of a better life.   Yet, we know that the situation is often dire for these children.  Human traffickers made an estimated $14 million per day along the  border in the month of February alone.   Shortly, I will be joining my colleagues to visit the border and  speak directly to our Border Patrol agents firsthand about their  experiences.   I look forward to sharing that insight with my constituents. However,  we already know that there is unprecedented disorder at the border, and  immediate action is needed. We must secure our border immediately.                            ____________________
