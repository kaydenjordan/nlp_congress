 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   What a profiles in lack of courage this is today exhibited in the  House of Representatives. But it does give us an opportunity, however  limited the time is, to expose a lot of the myths, like this notion  that the other side continues to perpetuate that Social Security and  Medicare are entitlements.   News flash: it is the insurance that the American people have paid  for.   News flash: 10,000 baby boomers a day become eligible for Social  Security.   News flash: the average women in this country, when they retire, get  $14,000 annually from Social Security, and, for more than half of them,  that is all they have to live on.   Yet these bastions of courage on the other side would like to cut  these programs not by coming to the floor of the House of  Representatives and having a vote on it, not by having a discussion in  a committee or even the semblance of a hearing, but somehow, as Mr.  Neal said, with a mask on, decide that they are going to introduce an  amendment where they will never, ever have to vote on what their  constituents actually have to face day in and day out. These are  American citizens who have paid through an insurance program, not an  entitlement. It is called FICA, the Federal Insurance Contributions  Act.    Whose contribution? The American people's contribution.   If you want to vote to take it away, have the courage to bring up a  bill and vote on it.   How about we increase the benefits for the people of this country who  need it?
