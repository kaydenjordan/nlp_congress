 Mr. Speaker, the pandemic is over.   At least that is what we were told by President Biden several months  ago in a September interview. Yet here we are almost 5 months later,  and the White House has failed to roll back the emergency declaration.   In fact, it wasn't until House Republicans scheduled a vote to do  just that, to terminate that declaration, that President Biden  announced that he would actually end it on May 11. What he really did  was announce that he was giving our friends on the other side of the  aisle a little bit of political cover to vote ``no'' on this bill.  Instead, they would rather continue to watch the American economy  suffer for an additional 3 months while we continue this unnecessary  declaration of an emergency.   I am glad President Biden has followed House Republicans' lead on  this, but why wait months?   We can vote to end it right now, today.   We have already let this measure drag on for nearly 3 years,  signifying an egregious abuse of Presidential powers. These emergency  powers have been used to harm our economy and exacerbate our supply  chain problems, and the President is content to allow that to happen  for another 3 months.   Our supply chain doesn't need this to continue anymore. It needs to  end now. It is time for us to stop living in the past. Americans are  ready to move forward. They are tired of hearing mixed messages that  the pandemic is over but still seeing all of the consequences of these  emergency declarations and implementing COVID regulations.    Let's finally deliver on this promise that the end isn't near; it is  right here, right now.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the underlying  resolution.
