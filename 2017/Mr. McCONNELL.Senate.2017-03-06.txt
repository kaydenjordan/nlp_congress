 Mr. President, regulations aren't issued in a vacuum.  They have real economic consequences that can harm the middle class.  They can kill jobs, raise prices, depress wages, and lower  opportunities. Yet the Obama administration went on a regulatory  rampage at a time when we should have been looking to do just the  opposite.   On its way out the door, the previous administration continued to  push through more of these job-killing, partisan regulations against  the advice of Congress, State and local officials, and policy experts.  Fortunately, we now have the opportunity to provide relief from some of  these costly, duplicative rules using the tools provided by the  Congressional Review Act, or CRA.   We only have a short window of opportunity to use these CRA tools,  however, which is why we have been working quickly to provide relief.  The Senate has already advanced several proposals that repeal harmful  regulations. Together with the new administration, we have embarked on  what one national paper most recently called ``the most ambitious  rollback since Reagan.''   Three CRA resolutions have already become law, and we look forward to  passing even more this week. In fact, we will have an opportunity to  send the President another resolution as soon as this evening.   The proposal before us would block another duplicative, unnecessary  eleventh hour regulation that hurts American businesses. This one is  called the ``blacklisting rule.'' Apparently, the last administration  thought it would be a good idea to prevent American businesses from  earning government contracts based on allegations, not facts.  Unsurprisingly, Federal courts have blocked the rule because of its  questionable legality. Now we have the opportunity to provide permanent  relief.   Of course, we all agree that companies should be held accountable and  that workers' rights should be protected. Current law already provides  the tools to do just that. But the blacklisting rule isn't really about  helping employers or workers. It is about empowering the powerful--like  union bosses and entrenched bureaucrats--and it would actually make a  system designed to protect workers even less efficient. More important  for the American people, it would cost taxpayers hundreds of millions,  generate millions of hours of paperwork, and, of course, threaten jobs.  So, of course, it is time to move past this regulation.   I want to thank my colleague Senator Johnson, chairman of the  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, for working with  the House to advance this resolution and protect the American people. I  look forward to its final passage tonight.   After we take that vote, the Senate will continue working to advance  even more regulatory relief measures to help get our country back on  track.  [[Page S1590]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, another important area where Congress  is working to provide relief is ObamaCare.   In election after election, the American people have called for an  end to ObamaCare. In the last election, they made their voices clear  one more time. They elected a President and a Congress dedicated to  bringing relief from this partisan law, and we are determined to do  right by our constituents by doing just that.   Nearly 7 years after being signed into law, I continue to hear from  Kentuckians who aren't sure how they can continue to manage under  ObamaCare's broken promises. Take this Kentuckian from Morehead who  wrote to my office earlier this year:         Prior to Obamacare, I had a manageable monthly healthcare       premium that had enough coverage for myself with a reasonable       deductible. Since Obamacare has been enforced, or should I       say forced upon the American people, my premiums have       increased each year significantly.    Now, under ObamaCare, this Kentuckian says keeping his same coverage  for 2017 means facing a 300-percent increase in his premiums as  compared to the plan he had before the broken law was implemented.  ``The general cost of healthcare has skyrocketed,'' he writes, and as a  result ``small business owners and [the] working middle class are  suffering.''   Unfortunately, his story is like so many others all across the  country. Americans were promised that costs would go down. Americans  were promised that choice would go up. Americans were promised that  they could keep their healthcare plan. None of that was true--not a  single one of those things.   Americans need relief. They deserve a new direction. That is why we  are taking action to repeal and replace ObamaCare with healthcare  solutions that can actually work for the American people.   As our efforts to move beyond ObamaCare continue, Senators came  together last week for another important conversation on the way  forward when it comes to our Nation's healthcare policies. I also had  the opportunity to visit the White House and discuss the ways in which  the administration and Congress can continue working together to bring  relief from ObamaCare.   The House will keep working this week, as well, to move forward with  legislation--under a new President who will actually sign it--that can  finally help us pursue smarter healthcare solutions in place of this  failed partisan experiment. We know the task before us is daunting,  but, of course, it is just as necessary.   So I thank the Speaker for his continued leadership on this issue,  along with each of our colleagues who have been working literally  around the clock on repeal and replace efforts. Let's keep working this  week so that we can bring Americans much needed relief from ObamaCare  as soon as possible.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 44.
