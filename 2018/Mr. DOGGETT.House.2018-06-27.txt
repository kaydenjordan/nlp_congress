 Mr. Speaker, this Congress once provided a check on  excessive executive power. But today, in this House, it is all lapdog  and no watchdog. Even terrified toddlers torn from their mother's  embrace are not beyond the limit of this Congress.   Until very recently, limitation amendments like those I authored to  this bill to protect taxpayers from having funds misused were routinely  approved for debate--no more.                                time  1245    Just as Trump undermines our democracy, so too do these House  Republicans refusing to permit even the pretense of a fair debate on  key national issues.   Having enabled Trump's separation of children from their parents,  often with their silence, Republicans have blocked amendments that I  and 41 of our colleagues sponsored to prevent our military bases from  being converted into internment camps for children and, in some cases,  their families.   Our military bases have an important mission. It is to ensure our  national security, to ensure the utmost readiness for our troops, who  may be called into action in many different parts of the globe at the  same time. It is not their job to take care of 20,000 people, as the  administration has requested, on two Texas military bases. The function  there is a totally different one from that to which we have committed  in this defense bill.   These are real people, real children. They are toddlers who have been  torn from their parents in places like McAllen, which I once  represented; real children who cry themselves to sleep every night,  held without their freedom and without their loved ones, while some of  my former constituents are shopping right down the street.   My constituents at home now in San Antonio, San Marcos, Lockhart, and  Austin care about this. Over 1,000 people have reached out to my  office, their hearts breaking for these children.   Trump is truly testing the waters of dehumanization, seeing how many  people blink an eye when he calls for suspending due process,  guaranteed by our Constitution, for people who don't look like him.   I do believe in a no-tolerance policy. The no-tolerance policy that I  support is no tolerance for bigotry, no tolerance for the demonization  of foreigners which regularly spews forth from this White House, no  tolerance for using cages to hold children as hostages.   No matter how grievous the wrong, how insulting the tweet, my  colleagues sit here, idle and silent, silently blocking debate on  congressional checks on this authoritarian-loving President who seeks  to amass more and more power.   Perhaps what we need in this House is a strong, professional ENT--an  ear, nose and throat physician--because Republicans have lost their  voice when it comes to standing up to Trump on much of anything. You  could say that Trump's got their tongue.   Whatever the reason, they are not there standing up for the children,  won't even permit a debate on the issue of whether our military bases  should be converted to this perverted purpose.   Mr. Speaker, I will never yield to a President who knows no limits,  and we will not yield in raising the issue of these children, their  separation, and the detainment of their families indefinitely. We must  speak out and use every opportunity afforded in this House to defend  their presence and to defend a better policy and the use of our tax  dollars for what they were intended, not to detain, indefinitely, these  babies.
