 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we live in partisan times, but there are  moments when we can break through the typical divisions and work  together on matters of real urgency. The anti-Asian hate crimes  legislation this week is such a matter. It is a very straightforward  and relatively modest bill to address a pressing and important issue in  the country. It would designate a point person at the Justice  Department to identify hate crimes towards Asian Americans related to  COVID-19--telling Federal law enforcement to make these hate crimes a  top priority during the pandemic.   Just as important, it would send a strong message to two groups: to  the Asian-American community that the country is paying attention to  them and to all of America that this kind of bigotry cannot be  tolerated.   I was gratified to hear the Republican leader yesterday say that the  Senate Republican conference wanted to move forward on the bill.   This bill was never intended to be some kind of ``gotcha''  legislation. It is led by Senators Hirono and Duckworth, two  outstanding Asian-American Senators who rightfully want to respond to  the rising tide of anti-Asian violence over the past year. When they  asked me to move the bill quickly, I thought that was exactly the right  thing to do, and here it is on the floor.   The fact that Leader McConnell said yesterday he believes  discrimination against Asian Americans is a real problem and wants to  move forward and be constructive is a very good thing, and I salute him  for it. The entire Senate ought to stand up against the recent surge of  anti-Asian violence. We can take the first step later today by voting  to proceed to the legislation.   As I said yesterday, my intention is to have a bipartisan amendment  process, beginning with the amendment offered by Senators Moran and  Blumenthal--one a Republican and one a Democrat. In consultation with  the Republican leader, we can work out an agreement on other germane,  non-"gotcha'' amendments to the bill if Senators have them. We should  be able and should really try in earnest to reach a final resolution  and pass the bill through the Senate very, very soon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, taking a step back for a moment, this is  how the process should work in a closely divided Senate. If the  Republican minority allows the Senate to move forward with a bill where  we have shared priorities, the Democratic majority will work to set up  a process for the Senate to consider germane amendments from both  sides.   That is the essence of the organizing resolution we all agreed to  earlier this year, and hopefully it is a process we can repeat. In  fact, we will test that proposition on the very next piece of  legislation. If we are able to finish the anti-Asian hate crimes bill  in a timely manner, I will move next to consider a bipartisan water  infrastructure bill.   The bill, the Drinking Water Infrastructure Act, was advanced by the  Environment and Public Works Committee on a unanimous--unanimous--vote.  It will authorize tens of billions of dollars to make sure American  families, especially low-income families, have access to safe and clean  drinking water. I salute Senator Carper, the chair of the committee, as  well as Senator Capito, the ranking Republican on the committee, for  coming together on such an important and necessary bill.   So, in addition to further nominations, it is my intention to move  the bipartisan water infrastructure bill next week.   As the country turns the corner from COVID-19, our focus will soon  shift to  [[Page S1908]]  how we can cement our economic recovery and create the jobs of the  future. President Biden's Build Back Better agenda--a big, bold  investment in infrastructure and jobs--is extremely important to that  effort. It has wide support among Democrats and wide support among the  American people. Many, many Republicans out there in the country  support this bill and this concept. The water infrastructure bill is a  small but important part of that overall effort.   We hope our Republican colleagues join us in advancing these  proposals to repair and reimagine our Nation's infrastructure for a new  century. Just like the anti-Asian hate crimes bill, if Republicans let  us get on the bill, we can work out a process to have bipartisan debate  and amendments, but if the Republican minority prevents the Senate from  even debating some of these commonsense proposals, we will have to try  to move forward without them                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday President Biden announced that  American forces will come home from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021.  It has been 20 years since that fateful day when the Towers fell and  the Pentagon was hit. We in New York live particularly hard with that.  I still think of the people I knew who perished: a guy I played  basketball with in high school; a businessman who helped me on the way  up; a brave firefighter who used to go around the city urging people to  donate blood together. But in that time since then, America's Armed  Forces, thank God, have become extremely successful in deterring and  rooting out terrorist networks around the globe.   President Obama authorized the mission that took out Osama bin Laden,  the architect of the 9/11 attacks. Our intelligence agencies have  assessed that al-Qaida and other terrorist groups do not pose an  immediate threat to strike the United States from Afghanistan because  of the brave work of our Armed Forces and intelligence organizations.  So after sinking two decades of blood and treasure into wars in the  Middle East, it is time to bring our troops home. America does not need  to fight forever wars.   I applaud President Biden's decision. Unlike President Trump,  President Biden and Secretary Austin have developed a careful and  thought-out plan. This isn't President Trump waking up one morning and  announcing a random new policy on Twitter while our generals scramble  to catch up. This will be a careful and thought-out plan with a real  timetable and a firm end date.   Whenever we talk about American troops in the Middle East, one of the  concerns is missions creep and the enormous pressure to kick the can  down the road and delay final decisions. We should and must stick to  the date the President has proposed as the last day our troops will be  there. I have been assured by the White House that the September 11  date will stick and that President Biden will not kick the can down the  road.   I know many Senators have questions, so I am happy to let my  colleagues know that the administration has agreed to brief all  Senators on this important decision. The briefing will take place soon.  It will be in the SCIF, and everyone's questions can be asked and  answered. The President himself will address the Nation later today and  explain the reasons for his decision.   In my view, President Biden's plan to bring American troops home from  Afghanistan is a very wise one.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, we are very pleased that the Senate  just took an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote--92 to 6--to move forward  with legislation to fight the surge of anti-Asian violence across our  country in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Anti-Asian bigotry and violence is a very serious issue that has deep  roots in our country's history. Regrettably, it has grown far worse  over the last year. It is something that affects constituents in all of  our States and has proud Asian-American citizens fearing for their  safety. I have been told stories that make me ache: an older Asian  gentleman afraid to go outside because he would be cursed at, berated,  even spat upon. A young lady told me she would no longer take the  subway to work because the stares at her were so angry and intense that  it was just unnerving. Then it is worse with assaults and violence and  even a death.   We need to do something, and I am so glad that our Republican  colleagues have voted with us to proceed with this legislation. This  was never intended as gotcha legislation. It was always intended as  bipartisan legislation, and for the information of the Senate, we are  making good progress on reaching a bipartisan agreement with sensible,  germane, and constructive amendments coming from Republican  colleagues--the Senator from Kansas, the Senator from Maine--that, I  believe, make the bill even stronger. So we want to continue with this  bipartisan process.   I intend the first amendment to the bill to be an amendment offered  by Senators Moran and Blumenthal. We are working with the Republican  leader to determine if and how many other amendments to the bill there  will be so that we can consider them and vote on final passage without  any gotcha or not germane amendments, but we are moving this bill  forward because it does need to go forward with a sense of urgency.   The legislation will send a loud and clear message that racism and  violence against Asian Americans have no place--no place--in American  society. We should endeavor to finish our work as quickly as possible  and without delay.   I yield the floor.
