 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the National  FFA Organization and celebrate National FFA Week, February 19-26, 2022.  This is a week to applaud the positive impact FFA has made on our  country and acknowledge the accomplishments of its members.   Previously known as the Future Farmers of America, the National FFA  Organization was founded in 1928 by a group of young farmers with  dreams to develop an organization which would address the challenges of  feeding a growing population. These young farmers' leadership,  experience, and passion for the industry became a movement that, for  nearly 100 years, has adapted to represent the entirety of agriculture,  not just farming. The National FFA Organization has been an institution  where students can grow as both agriculturists and leaders. Today,  there are 735,038 FFA members in 8,817 chapters across all 50 States,  Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Washington, DC. In my home  State of Arkansas, FFA has 229 chapters with close to 16,000 members.   FFA is a part of an integrated model that implements classroom  agricultural education and hands-on, experiential learning. I commend  the more than 13,000 agricultural science teachers and FFA advisers who  prepare the next generation of leaders. It is because of them that we  can be confident in the upcoming farmers, ranchers, foresters,  agriculturalists, scientists, educators, and those who seek a career  outside of the agricultural industry.   I have been fortunate to spend some time with these impressive young  people. They hail from different parts of the country and come from  unique backgrounds, but all possess the same passion for agriculture  and service. It is always encouraging hearing FFA members share their  experiences and goals for the future. There is no doubt they are  prepared to make those goals reality.   FFA is about more than preparing students for careers in agriculture.  It teaches leadership skills, instills a sense of service, and places  young Arkansans and young people all over the country on the right path  for success. After leaving their chapters, these young leaders continue  to make a positive difference in the world around them. There are over  8 million FFA alumni. Alumni continue to use the knowledge and skills  acquired while they were members. I know this to be true. Currently, I  have eight FFA alumni on my staff, including some who received the  highest degree achievable in the National FFA Organization and alumni  who served as chapter, State, and national officers.   FFA members inspire those they serve, and I, too, have been impressed  by the members and their accomplishments. I am increasingly optimistic  about the future of agriculture, especially with passionate, dedicated  leaders, like the ones developed by FFA, at the helm. FFA members serve  as a reminder that our future is bright. I am honored to applaud the  great work of FFA at the local, State, and national level as we  celebrate National FFA Week.                            ____________________
