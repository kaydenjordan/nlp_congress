 Mr. Speaker, the Tri-Cities community recently lost a  leader and a friend. I rise today to honor the memory of Bill Berkman,  chairman of the Benton County Republicans. Bill became involved with  the local Republican Party as a precinct committee officer in 2016, and  later that year, as chairman. I got to know him well while encouraging  our fellow community members to get out to vote.   As owner of the MenZone franchises in Kennewick and Pasco, Bill was a  passionate voice for limited government and policies that supported  small business owners. Even with his strong personal beliefs and  conservative principles, though, Bill never let partisanship rise above  integrity. He was adamant that we could and should do more to bring  more respect into our politics.   He will be remembered for his efforts to build bridges, including  with his counterparts in the local Democratic Party.   We will all miss Bill's booming voice, his polite fervent candor, and  his desire for facts, for truth, and for solutions for the Nation.   Rest in peace, Bill.                            ____________________
