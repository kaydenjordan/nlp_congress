 Mr. President, let me first of all begin by thanking  Senator Murray for her leadership in terms of leading us to scrutinize  this nominee, Betsy DeVos. It seems to me the more we dig into this,  the more we look at it, the worse it gets. So I rise in strong  opposition to the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of  Education.   Mrs. DeVos is nominated to lead our Nation's public education system.  Yet she has worked for decades to privatize it and even to create  profitmaking centers. She wants to siphon public funds to private  schools. She has led a multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign to fund  private, religious, and for-profit schools with public education  dollars.   We can all agree that we want our Nation's schools to be the very  best they can be. We want our children to have all the opportunities we  can provide, but that really is the issue. That is why Democrats have  held the floor all night long to do everything in our power to convince  the Senate to reject this nomination.   I believe in the public school system. I want all of our children to  have opportunities. That is the fundamental principle of our American  school system. Everyone should be able to get a great education.   Mrs. DeVos wants to dismantle our public schools. She would drain  resources from the children and teachers who need it the most. I can't  say it strongly enough: A vote for Mrs. DeVos is a vote to destroy our  public school system. My constituents agree. We have received over  63,000 emails and over 2,000 telephone calls in the last month alone  opposing this nomination. These are recordbreaking numbers from my  office for a Cabinet nominee. Many of those calls and letters are from  public school parents and teachers, men and women who are dedicated to  our students and our public education system. They understand that  Betsy DeVos is not qualified to lead our Nation's public education  system.   Betsy DeVos is the first nominee in history for Secretary of  Education with no experience in education or public administration. She  is not a teacher. She is not a school administrator. She didn't attend  public schools. Her children didn't attend public schools. She has  never held a government position, let alone one in education. In fact,  she has open disdain for government.   Mrs. DeVos's complete lack of experience and profound lack of  understanding of education policy were on full display during her  confirmation hearing. Under questioning, it was clear that Mrs. DeVos  was completely uninformed about the ongoing debate in education policy  between proficiency and growth. This issue is critical. It is well  documented that there is a correlation between test scores and  students' socioeconomic status and race. So evaluating schools based on  average test scores tends to penalize schools with large numbers of  low-income and racial minority students. Even if those schools produce  significant student growth on math and reading test scores, proficiency  or growth is one of the most basic education policy questions, and yet  the President's nominee for Secretary of Education doesn't understand  the issue. Maybe this is because she has been single-mindedly focused  on feeding private, for-profit charter schools with public dollars and  the religious and other private schools through vouchers. So her  knowledge about education is limited to her pet issue.    Valerie Siow, who has taught in public schools in New Mexico for 13  years, observed that Mrs. DeVos ``had not bothered to do her homework''  for the hearing. It is clear that Mrs. DeVos does not have the breadth  or depth in education policy or finance to be the Secretary of  Education.   Senator Hassan has a son who has cerebral palsy. She told us a moving  story about the good education he received in the New Hampshire public  schools, despite his disability, because of the Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act, or the IDEA.   Senator Hassan asked if Mrs. DeVos would require schools using  vouchers to comply with that law. Mrs. DeVos initially responded that  she believes the decision should be left to the States. When Mrs. DeVos  was informed that it is Federal law, that it is not up to the States,  she responded that she must have been ``confused.'' Confused? Mrs.  DeVos bragged that she has been an education advocate for 30 years. The  IDEA was passed over 25 years ago, in 1990. Mrs. DeVos was not  ``confused.'' She plainly did not know what the Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act is.   It is very disturbing that she appears not to know how public schools  educate and accommodate kids with special needs. Does she not know what  an individual education plan is? She didn't know, as she said in a  hearing to be Secretary of Education, that the millions of public  school children with disabilities have a Federal right to a free and  appropriate education.   It is just as troublesome that Mrs. DeVos did not know that children  with disabilities can lose their Federal right to an equal education  under State voucher programs--voucher programs she has spent years  advocating for. She did not know that voucher programs can require  students with disabilities to sign away their IDEA rights. Most  troubling of all, she would not commit to making sure voucher programs  comply with the law.   I am also quite concerned that Mrs. DeVos fails to appreciate the  important role that tribal cultures play in educating Native American  children. This Nation has a solemn trust and treaty responsibility to  provide quality education to Native students, both through the public  school system and the Federal Bureau of Indian Education. Her testimony  has proven that she is uneducated about these students as well.   Many States have significant tribal populations. In my home State of  New Mexico it is about 10 percent. As vice chair of the Indian Affairs  Committee, my job is to make sure that any Education Secretary is  committed to respecting tribal sovereignty and self-determination. Mrs.  DeVos has given me no assurance she understands, cares about, or is  prepared to address the needs of Native American students. Nothing in  her hearing or written answers convinced me that she will respect  tribal cultures, tribal sovereignty, or the right to self- determination. In fact, her lobby organization, American Federation for  Children, supports the expansion of vouchers into Indian Country,  diverting money from tribal schools to private schools. I cannot  support taking money away from schools run by tribes and losing self- determination efforts tribes are making.   The National Indian Education Association has said: ``Federal funding  should not be moving over to a private school system . . . move out of  our  [[Page S812]]  tribally-run school system and to a system that does not require  consultation and does not require active engagement of Native  communities.'' I couldn't agree more. She just shows a basic lack of  understanding of tribal sovereignty and self-determination.   Betsy DeVos seems to be driven by her personal religious views. I  respect the strength of her Dutch Calvinist religious beliefs, but  imposing her religious beliefs should have no place in funding public  education, which serves children of all beliefs.   In 2001, she talked about whether Christian schools should continue  relying on contributions instead of vouchers. Mrs. DeVos said:         There are not enough philanthropic dollars in America to       fund what is currently the need in education. . . . Our       desire is to confront the culture in ways that will continue       to advance God's kingdom.    I support her right to devote her philanthropic dollars to her church  and other religious efforts, but I oppose her view of using public  dollars to advance her view of ``God's kingdom'' in public schools.  Separation of church and State is a fundamental principal in our  democracy to protect people and communities from religious coercion by  the government. I am concerned that Mrs. DeVos does not have the  necessary respect for other people's religious beliefs and that her  policies could disregard the importance of tribal perspectives on  education.   We need assurance that every public school student--no matter their  religion, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or identity, ability or  disability--will be respected, protected, and included at the highest  levels in Washington, DC. That is the job of the Secretary of  Education. Mrs. DeVos has not shown over the many decades she has  lobbied on education that she agrees with this basic proposition.   I support making good, quality public school options available. There  are many great public charter and magnet schools around the country. We  have some good ones in New Mexico. But these public schools should meet  the same accountability standards as other public schools--standards  for student achievement, teacher performance, and fiscal  responsibility.   I also support the option of private and religious schools. We have  great private and religious schools in our country. But public dollars  must go to public schools, not private or religious schools, and  certainly not private for-profit schools. The first objective of any  for-profit venture is to make money. That cannot be the first objective  of a school using public funds.   The first and foremost objective of public education funds should be  education for students. When public dollars are used, their use must be  fully accountable and transparent to the public. Betsy DeVos would not  commit that private for-profit charter schools and voucher schools  should have the same accountability standards as public schools. Why  didn't she make this commitment? Likely, because the private charter  schools in Michigan, funded by public dollars--that she has championed  for decades--do not have to meet the same accountability standards as  public schools. This is wrong. These same schools--her work for  decades--have not shown appreciable gains in Michigan over the years.  In fact, Michigan test scores have gone down over time. These schools  have not shown significant improvement over public schools in Michigan.   Finally, I am not convinced that Mrs. DeVos has been transparent in  her responses to the American public. She did not make her disclosures  available to the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee at  the time of her confirmation hearing--this is unprecedented--and the  committee had no opportunity to look into her many, many financial  conflicts.   Since then, she has entered into an agreement with the Office of  Government Ethics. While she will divest from approximately 100  investments that pose a conflict, we do not know if she has divested  from all conflicts. Mrs. DeVos benefits from three trusts. She has not  disclosed the assets in two of those trusts.   The complexity and enormity of Mrs. DeVos's $5 billion holdings is  mind-boggling. We know that from one trust at least 100 conflicts  required divestment. Without transparency in other trusts, the public  does not know if she has any more conflicts.   I also want to raise the issue of Mrs. DeVos's unwillingness to  address her PAC's unpaid $5.3 million fine in the State of Ohio for  violating campaign finance laws.   This situation is troubling on a number of levels. First, Mrs. DeVos  led a multimillion dollar political effort to influence elections  throughout our Nation. Second, while doing so, Mrs. DeVos's political  action committee willfully ignored campaign finance laws and warnings  from State election officials. She racked up an unprecedented $5.3  million fine in Ohio. Then, third, rather than acknowledging that she  broke the law and owning up to her responsibility to pay it, her PAC  simply folded up shop and walked away.   As Secretary of Education, Mrs. DeVos will be responsible for  overseeing college loans for millions of students. Yet she refuses to  acknowledge or pay her own debts. Does she believe the law doesn't  apply to her?   I have written to Mrs. DeVos and the HELP Committee several times  demanding answers about this. Her responses were evasive. She refuses  to pay the fine--hiding behind the corporate veil--while still paying  lawyers to fight it. This is hypocrisy, on top of disregard for the  law.   We have never had a Cabinet nominee, who led a dark money PAC, which  broke the law and flouted the judicial system. This is absolutely,  totally, unprecedented.   For all these reasons, I must vote no on the confirmation of Mrs.  DeVos as Secretary of the Department of Education.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the  confirmation of Senator Jeff Sessions to be the Attorney General.   It is never easy to oppose a President's cabinet nominees, especially  when one is your Senate colleague. I generally think the President  should be able to assemble his team.   But with this President, we are in uncharted territory. President  Trump doesn't want to hire a team that will represent the American  people.   Many of the nominees are billionaires who are out of touch with the  struggles of average Americans, and many of them have shown great  disdain for the very agencies they will lead.   People like Betsy DeVos, who is a billionaire with zero experience in  public schools, has been selected to run the Education Department.   People like Scott Pruitt, who has been nominated to be head of the  Environmental Protection Agency, which he is sued many times.   When the people nominated to the President's cabinet are intent on  dismantling the very agency they are nominated to run, our  Constitutional role of advise and consent takes on new importance.   But the position of Attorney General is unique. The nominee requires  even more scrutiny. The Attorney General is our Nation's chief law  enforcement officer with enormous power to either advance--or roll  back--our constitutional protections.   Perhaps Senator Sessions said it best during the confirmation hearing  for Sally Yates to be Deputy Attorney General.   In that hearing, Senator Sessions said, ``You have to watch out  because people will be asking you to do things you just need to say  `no' about.''   He then asked Ms. Yates, ``Do you think the Attorney General has the  responsibility to say no to the President if he asks for something that  is improper?''   I completely agree with Senator Sessions. The Attorney General has  the responsibility--the duty--to tell the President no when he is  wrong.   And that is why I cannot vote to confirm Senator Sessions. I don't  have the faith that he will tell President Trump no when the situation  requires it.   But I have even less faith that the President will listen. Sally  Yates told him no--she refused to let the Justice Department defend the  President's misguided travel ban. She was fired for doing exactly what  the position of Attorney General requires.   And when Acting AG Yates said his travel ban was wrong, the President  didn't simply relieve her of her position. Instead, he put out a press  release attacking her personally. Sally Yates had served the country  for almost three decades as a career prosecutor and Justice Department  attorney. She deserved the president's respect, regardless whether he  agreed with her.   Time and time again, President Trump has shown that he will not  tolerate dissent. You are either with him or--in his mind--you are  wrong. And you become the enemy. President Trump has put the ``bully''  back into the bully pulpit.   He frequently--and publicly--lashes out against those who express  different views. And more dangerously, he lashes out at the  institutions that are the fabric of our democracy.   This weekend he attacked a Federal judge who ruled against his travel  ban. Rather than respecting the rule of law, and the coequal judicial  branch, he once again took to Twitter personally denigrate the federal  judge who dared rule against his policy--Federal judge who was  appointed by George W. Bush.   President Trump disparages the free press at every opportunity. Any  article or story that is critical of his policies is now dubbed ``fake  news.'' Members of the press are punished for coverage of the  administration that he deems negative. He said he wants to weaken libel  laws so it is easier for him to sue the press.   President Trump will continue his assault on the first amendment,  defining the press that holds him accountable as the enemy, deriding  and belittling those who speak out against him and attacking the free  expression of religion and targeting those who practice Islam.   And when he takes these actions, it is up to the Attorney General to  tell him that he is wrong. It is up to the Attorney General to speak  truth to power, and to be ready to be fired for doing so.   But it is far from clear that Senator Sessions will be that  independent voice within the Department of Justice the American public  needs.   The Washington Post reports--that Senator Sessions not only agreed  with the President's flurry of extreme executive orders, but that he  wanted the president to go further and faster.   In an email to the Post Senior Strategist Stephen Bannon said that  throughout the campaign, Senator Sessions ``has been the fiercest, most  dedicated, and most loyal promoter in Congress of Trump's agenda, and  has played a critical role as the clearinghouse for policy and  philosophy to undergird the implementation of that agenda. What we are  witnessing now is the birth of a new political order. . . .''   Loyalty is a valued characteristic in politics. But the Nation's  chief law enforcement officer must be independent, first and foremost.  He or she must defend the Constitution and all Americans, not be the  President's personal architect of ``a new political order'' that  excludes many people.   Mr. President, for these reasons I must vote no on this nomination.   We have had a very, very long night, and I want to say that I saw my  good friend Senator Casey here. I want to thank all the Senators on the  Democratic side who have spoken up over the course of these 30 hours.  We are trying to address this issue--a very, very important issue--of  whether Senator Jeff Sessions should be Attorney General of the United  States.   In the remarks I am going to give now, I may draw some of them from  the formal remarks I have.   I just want to say that my home State of New Mexico is a majority  minority State. We have--and these are the rough numbers--about 46, 47  percent Hispanic, 10 percent Native American. Those are our large  minority populations. It is a majority minority State.   I can tell you, since this administration has come in, people are  very worried about their voting rights, and they are worried about  their democracy. I have been home in New Mexico and heard the  exchanges. I have read the various emails. People are concerned about  the issue that goes to the heart of this nomination, which is how  Senator Sessions would behave as Attorney General on the issue of  voting rights.   I fully understand the importance of rule XIX and civility. In my  activity here on the Senate floor, I try to be as civil as possible,  but I think there is a bigger issue here. So I fully understand the  importance of rule XIX. God knows we need to maintain civility in this  esteemed body. But when a Member of this body has chosen to be  considered for an office outside this body--and in the case of Senator  Sessions, for an office in a department in which he has previously  served--then his record in that office, better or worse, is critical to  our consideration.   When Mr. Sessions exercised his duties as U.S. attorney in Alabama  under  [[Page S909]]  the supervision of the U.S. Attorney General--the office he now seeks-- his record on voting rights, the backbone of our democracy, was subject  to serious question. In the context of this confirmation, that record  must be included in the context of this confirmation hearing. So here  we are on the floor. We have debated. The record must be included in  the debate on the floor.   As Senator Warren has brought to our attention, it was the judgment  of Coretta Scott King, widow of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther  King, that he used the Office of the U.S. Attorney for Alabama to-- these are Coretta Scott King's words--``chill the free exercise of the  vote by black citizens.'' That was her opinion at the time.   Similarly, in the words of our former colleague Senator Ted Kennedy,  he was ``a disgrace to the Justice Department,'' the Department which  Mr. Sessions will lead if he is confirmed.   I would like to read into the Record today the letter from Mrs. King,  which supports her opinion of Mr. Sessions' lack of commitment to  justice for all and leave this for my colleagues here today to assess  in considering his nomination.   To me, the letter she wrote back on March 19, 1986, goes right to the  heart of what we are debating here on the Senate floor. What we are  debating is our voting rights and whether we will have, for the next 4  years or 8 years, an Attorney General who is going to enforce the laws,  particularly with regard to voting rights.   I first ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           The Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social             Change, Inc.,                                       Altanta, GA, March 19, 1986.      Re Nomination of Jefferson B. Sessions, U.S. Judge, Southern           District of Alabama Hearing, March 13, 1986       Hon. Strom Thurmond,       Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Thurmond: I write to express my sincere       opposition to the confirmation of Jefferson B. Sessions as a       federal district court judge for the Southern District of       Alabama. My professional and personal roots in Alabama are       deep and lasting. Anyone who has used the power of his office       as United States Attorney to intimidate and chill the free       exercise of the ballot by citizens should not be elevated to       our courts. Mr. Sessions has used the awesome powers of his       office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly       black voters. For this reprehensible conduct, he should not       be rewarded with a federal judgeship.        I regret that a long-standing commitment prevents me from       appearing in person to testify against this nominee. However,       I have attached a copy of my statement opposing Mr. Sessions'       confirmation and I request that my statement as well as this       letter be made a part of the hearing record.        I do sincerely urge you to oppose the confirmation of Mr.       Sessions.            Sincerely,                                                Coretta Scott King.     This letter is dated on March 19, 1986. It is a letter  from Coretta Scott King, The Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for  Nonviolent Social Change. This is at the top of the letterhead. She is  writing a letter to Strom Thurmond, and she says:         I write to express my sincere opposition to the       confirmation of Jefferson B. Sessions as a Federal district       court judge for the Southern District of Alabama. My       professional and personal roots in Alabama are deep and       lasting. Anyone who has used the power of his office as       United States Attorney to intimidate and chill the free       exercise of the ballot by citizens should not be elevated to       our courts. Mr. Sessions has used the awesome powers of his       office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly       black voters. For this reprehensible conduct, he should not       be rewarded with a federal judgeship.        I regret that a longstanding commitment prevents me from       appearing in person to testify against this nominee. However,       I have attached a copy of my statement opposing Mr. Sessions'       confirmation, and I request that my statement as well as this       letter be made a part of the hearing record.        I do sincerely urge you to oppose the confirmation of Mr.       Sessions.    There is a carbon copy of this to Senator Joe Biden. This happened in  March of 1986.   Coretta Scott King is speaking out against Jeff Sessions, who was at  the time a U.S. attorney, and he was going to be promoted as a Federal  judge. We all know the history--he was not promoted as a Federal judge.   Here is her statement, which she asked to have read at the Senate  Judiciary Committee on Thursday, March 13, 1986.         Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee:        Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to express my       strong opposition to the nomination of Jefferson Sessions for       a federal district judgeship for the Southern District of       Alabama. My longstanding commitment, which I shared with my       husband, Martin, to protect and enhance the rights of Black       Americans, rights which include equal access to the       democratic process, compels me to testify today.        Civil rights leaders, including my husband and Albert       Turner, have fought long and hard to achieve free and       unfettered access to the ballot box. Mr. Sessions has used       the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of       the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to       serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to       happen. Mr. Sessions' conduct as U.S. Attorney, from his       politically motivated voting fraud prosecutions to his       indifference towards criminal violations of civil rights       laws, indicates that he lacks the temperament, fairness, and       judgment to be a federal judge.        The Voting Rights Act was, and still is, vitally important       to the future of democracy in the United States. I was       privileged to join Martin and many others during the Selma to       Montgomery march for voting rights in 1965. Martin was       particularly impressed by the determination to get the       franchise of blacks in Selma and neighboring Perry County. As       he wrote, ``Certainly no community in the history of the       Negro struggle has responded with the enthusiasm of Selma and       her neighboring town of Marion. Where Birmingham depended       largely upon students and unemployed adults to participate in       nonviolent protest of the denial of the franchise, Selma has       involved fully 10 percent of the Negro population in active       demonstrations, and at least half the Negro population of       Marion was arrested on one day.'' Martin was referring, of       course, to a group that included the defendants recently       prosecuted for assisting elderly and illiterate blacks to       exercise that franchise. In fact, Martin anticipated from the       depth of their commitment 20 years ago, that a united       political organization would remain in Perry County long       after other marchers had left. This organization, the Perry       County Civil League, started by Mr. Turner, Mr. Hogue, and       others, as Martin predicted, continued ``to direct the drive       for votes and other rights.'' In the years since the Voting       Rights Act was passed, Black Americans in Marion, Selma, and       elsewhere have made important strides in their struggle to       participate actively in the electoral process. The number of       Blacks registered to vote in key Southern States has doubled       since 1965. This would not have been possible without the       Voting Rights Act.        However, Blacks still fall far short of having equal       participation in the electoral process. Particularly in the       South, efforts continue to be made to deny Blacks access to       the polls, even where Blacks constitute the majority of the       voters. It has been a long up-hill struggle to keep alive the       vital legislation that protects the most fundamental right to       vote. A person who has exhibited so much hostility--    Here she is talking about Jeff Sessions--       to the enforcement of those laws, and thus, to the exercise       of those rights by Black people, should not be elevated to       the Federal bench.        The irony of Mr. Sessions' nomination is that, if       confirmed, he will be given life tenure for doing with a       federal prosecution what the local sheriffs accomplished 20       years ago with clubs and cattle prods. Twenty years ago, when       we marched from Selma to Montgomery, the fear of voting was       real, as the broken bones and bloody heads in Selma and       Marion bore witness. As my husband wrote at the time, ``it       was not just a sick imagination that conjured up the vision       of a public official, sworn to uphold the law, who forced an       inhuman march upon hundreds of Negro children; who ordered       the Rev. James Bevel to be chained to his sickbed; who       clubbed a Negro woman registrant, and who callously inflicted       repeated brutalities and indignities upon nonviolent Negroes       peacefully petitioning for their constitutional right to       vote.''        Free exercise of voting rights is so fundamental to       American democracy that we cannot tolerate any form of       infringement of those rights. Of all the groups who have been       disenfranchised in our Nation's history, none has struggled       longer or suffered more in the attempt to win the vote than       Black citizens. No group has had access to the ballot box       denied so persistently and intently. Over the past century, a       broad array of schemes have been used in attempts to block       the Black vote. The range of techniques developed with the       purpose of repressing black voting rights run the gamut from       the straightforward application of brutality against black       citizens who tried to vote to such legalized frauds as       ``grandfather clause'' exclusions and rigged literacy tests.        The actions taken by Mr. Sessions in regard to the 1984       voting fraud prosecutions represent just one more technique       used to intimidate Black voters and thus deny them this most       precious franchise. The investigations into the absentee       voting process were conducted only in the Black Belt counties       where blacks had finally achieved political power in the       local government. Whites had  [[Page S910]]       been using the absentee process to their advantage for years       without incident. Then, when Blacks, realizing its strength,       began to use it with success, criminal investigations were       begun.        In these investigations, Mr. Sessions, as U.S. Attorney,       exhibited an eagerness to bring to trial and convict three       leaders of the Perry County Civil League, including Albert       Turner, despite evidence clearly demonstrating their       innocence of any wrongdoing. Furthermore, in initiating the       case, Mr. Sessions ignored allegations of similar behavior by       whites, choosing instead to chill the exercise of the       franchise by blacks by his misguided investigation. In fact,       Mr. Sessions sought to punish older black civil rights       activists, advisors, and colleagues of my husband, who had       been key figures in the civil rights movement in the 1960s.       These were persons who, realizing the potential of the       absentee vote among Blacks, had learned to use the process       within the bounds of legality and had taught others to do the       same. The only sin they committed was being too successful in       gaining votes.        The scope and character of the investigations conducted by       Mr. Sessions also warrant grave concern. Witnesses were       selectively chosen in accordance with the favorability of       their testimony to the government's case. Also, the       prosecution illegally withheld from the defense critical       statements made by witnesses. Witnesses who did testify were       pressured and intimidated into submitting the ``correct''       testimony. Many elderly blacks were visited multiple times by       the FBI who then hauled them over 180 miles by bus to a grand       jury in Mobile when they could more easily have testified at       a grand jury twenty miles away in Selma. These voters, and       others, have announced they are now never going to vote       again.        I urge you to consider carefully Mr. Sessions' conduct in       these matters. Such a review, I believe, raises serious       questions about his commitment to the protection of the       voting rights of all American citizens and consequently his       fair and unbiased judgment regarding this fundamental right.       When the circumstances and facts surrounding the indictments       of Al Turner, his wife, Evelyn, and Spencer Hogue are       analyzed, it becomes clear that the motivation was political,       and the result frightening--the wide-scale chill of the       exercise of the ballot for blacks, who suffered so much to       receive that right in the first place. Therefore, it is my       strongly-held view that the appointment of Jefferson Sessions       to the federal bench would irreparably damage the work of my       husband, Al Turner, and countless others who risked their       lives and freedom over the past twenty years to ensure equal       participation in our democratic system.        The exercise of the franchise is an essential means by       which our citizens ensure that those who are governing will       be responsible. My husband called it the number one civil       right. The denial of access to the ballot box ultimately       results in the denial of other fundamental rights. For, it is       only when the poor and disadvantaged are in power that they       are able to participate actively in the solutions to their       own problems.        We still have a long way to go before we can say that       minorities no longer need to be concerned about       discrimination at the polls. Blacks, Hispanics, Native       Americans and Asian Americans are grossly underrepresented at       every level of government in America. If we are going to make       our timeless dream of justice through democracy a reality, we       must take every possible step to ensure that the spirit and       intent of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fifteenth       Amendment of the Constitution is honored.        The federal courts hold a unique position in our       constitutional system, ensuring that minorities and other       citizens without political power have a forum in which to       vindicate their rights. Because of this unique role, it is       essential that the people selected to be federal judges       respect the basic tenets of our legal system: respect for       individual rights and a commitment to equal justice for all.       The integrity of the Courts, and thus the rights they       protect, can only be maintained if citizens feel competent       that those selected as federal judges will be able to judge       with fairness others holding differing views.        I do not believe Jefferson Sessions possesses the requisite       judgment, competence, and sensitivity to the rights       guaranteed by the federal civil rights laws to qualify for       appointment to the federal district court. Based on his       record, I believe his confirmation would have a devastating       effect on not only the judicial system in Alabama, but also       on the progress we have made everywhere toward fulfilling my       husband's dream that he envisioned over twenty years ago. I       therefore urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to deny his       confirmation.        I thank you for allowing me to share my views.    Now this was a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote--I just finished  reading it--in March 1986. We know the results of that. After the  testimony was taken, Jeff Sessions, because of his record at the time,  was not allowed to become a Federal judge. Today, the issue that we  have before us, the issue we have before us is, is he fit to be our  Attorney General of the United States, based on his overall record, and  this is part of the record.   When the majority leader comes to the floor and strikes the words of  Elizabeth Warren for just reading parts of this letter, he is not  allowing the full record to be before the American people, and he is  not allowing a full debate to occur in this Chamber. That is really  what this is about today. Are we going to, as a Senate, where we have  debate, we have open debate, cut off that debate? Are we able to say  things about one another--and especially in this case. This just isn't  a debate from one Senator to another.   As to Senator Warren, in which it was said she impugned the integrity  of Senator Sessions. Senator Sessions is in a different category here  today. Senator Sessions is seeking the office of U.S. Attorney General.  This is the most important law office in the land--the most important  law enforcement office. This is an office where you can be active and  go out and file civil rights cases, you can protect voting rights, you  can do numerous things. This is an awesome responsibility. So this  should be part of the Record, and I believe it is very important that  we put it in the Record, that we talk about it, and then we look at the  whole picture.   As I said earlier, I rise in opposition to the confirmation of  Senator Sessions. It is not easy to oppose a nominee, especially when  one is your Senate colleague. And I generally think the President  should be able to assemble his team. But with this President we are in  uncharted territory.   President Trump doesn't want to hire a team who will represent the  American people. Many of the nominees are billionaires who are out of  touch with the struggles of average Americans, and many of them have  shown great disdain for the very agencies they will lead. People such  as Betsy DeVos, a billionaire with zero experience in public schools,  selected to run the Education Department. As we all know, yesterday, we  saw what happened; two courageous Republicans--Lisa Murkowski and Susan  Collins--voted against Betsy DeVos. In an unprecedented move, the Vice  President of the United States had to come and sit where the President  of the Senate is and cast the tie-breaking vote in order to get her  through. I think we are going to look back on that as a sad day for  public education because she sure doesn't stand up for public  education.   People such as Scott Pruitt to be head of the Environmental  Protection Agency, which he sued many times.   When the people nominated to the President's Cabinet are intent on  dismantling the very Agency they are nominated to run, our  constitutional role of advise and consent takes on a new importance.   The position of Attorney General is unique. The nominee requires even  more scrutiny. The Attorney General, as our nation's chief law  enforcement officer, has enormous power to either advance or roll back  our constitutional protections, and that power resides in that one  person.   The other important role of the Attorney General is to make sure the  President is obeying the law. In this case, we have a real problem  here. Within the first couple of weeks, the courts are calling the  President in and telling him he is issuing Muslim bans and other orders  and that he is violating the law. So we need an Attorney General who is  going to stand up for what the law is, not be political and not be  ideological.   Perhaps Senator Sessions said it best during the confirmation  hearings for Sally Yates to be Deputy Attorney General. In that  hearing, Senator Sessions said: ``You have to watch out, because people  will be asking you to do things you just need to say `no' about.'' That  is his full quote there.   When he asked Ms. Yates, ``Do you think the Attorney General has the  responsibility to say no to the President if he asks for something that  is improper?'' That is the standard we are looking at--pretty tough  standard--speaking truth to power, the Attorney General to the  President of the United States.    I completely agree with Senator Sessions that the Attorney General  has the responsibility, the duty to tell the President no when he is  wrong. That is why I cannot vote to confirm Senator Sessions. I don't  have the faith that he will tell President Trump no when the situation  requires it, but I have less faith that the President will listen.   Sally Yates told the President no. She refused to let the Justice  Department defend the President's misguided  [[Page S911]]  travel ban. She was fired for doing exactly what the position of  Attorney General requires.   When the Acting AG, Acting AG Yates, said his travel ban was wrong,  the President didn't simply relieve her of her position, instead he put  out a press release attacking her personally. Sally Yates, who served  the government for three decades as a career prosecutor, Justice  Department attorney, deserved the President's respect regardless of  whether he agreed with her or not.   Time and again, President Trump has shown that he will not tolerate  dissent. You are either with him or in his mind you are wrong, and you  become the enemy. President Trump has put the bully back into the bully  pulpit. He frequently and publicly lashes out against those who express  different views, and more dangerously, he lashes out at the  institutions that are the fabric of this democracy. This weekend he  attacked a Federal judge who ruled against his travel ban, rather than  respecting the rule of law and the coequal judicial branch. He once  again took to Twitter to personally denigrate the Federal judge who  dared rule against this policy--a Federal judge who was appointed by  George W. Bush.   President Trump disparages the free press at every opportunity. Any  article or story that is critical of his policies is now dubbed  ``fake'' news. Members of the press are punished for coverage of the  administration that he deems negative. He says he wants to weaken libel  laws so it is easier for him to sue the press.   President Trump will continue his assault on the First Amendment,  defining the press that holds him accountable as the enemy, deriding  and belittling those who speak out against him, attacking the free  expression of religion and those who practice Islam.   When he takes these actions, it is up to the Attorney General of the  United States to tell him he is wrong. That is where that awesome  responsibility resides.   It is up to the Attorney General to speak truth to power and to be  ready to be fired for doing so, but it is far from clear that Senator  Sessions will be that independent voice within the Department of  Justice that the American public needs.   The Washington Post reports that Senator Sessions not only agreed  with the President's flurry of extreme Executive orders but that he  wanted the President to go further and faster.   In an email to the Post, senior strategist Stephen Bannon said that  throughout the campaign, Senator Sessions ``has been the fiercest, most  dedicated, most loyal promoter in Congress of Trump's agenda and has  played a critical role as the clearinghouse for policy and philosophy  to undergird the implementation of that agenda. What we were witnessing  now is the birth of a new political order.''   Stephen Bannon. This is an amazing quote, a contemporary quote from  the President's top strategist. Everybody who is now talking in the  press--and there are a lot of leaks out of this White House--say Steve  Bannon is the puppeteer. He is the one telling Trump what to do. It is  absolutely clear, of all the people in the White House, this is the guy  who has the most clout, and it is a debate for all whether he is the  puppeteer in telling the President what to do.   But listen again to what he said about Senator Sessions, that he  ``has been the fiercest, most dedicated, and most loyal promoter in  Congress of Trump's agenda, and has played a critical role as the  clearinghouse for policy and philosophy to undergird the implementation  of that agenda. What we are witnessing now is the birth of a new  political order.''   I don't know what this new political order is, where you don't  respect the rule of law and don't respect democracy--headed in the  wrong direction, in my opinion.   Loyalty is a valued characteristic in politics, but the Nation's  chief law enforcement officer must be independent, first and foremost.   I hearken back to when Senator Sessions and I were both attorneys  general back many years ago, and I remember assuming that role at the  State level. It is an awesome role because early on in my  administration they brought me cases where Democrats who were in the  State legislature were violating the law, and they said: They are  violating the law. They said they are violating the law. We have to  enforce the law, and I did, and we prosecuted people in my own party.    We had many rulings that came in as Attorney General where people  would say: Interpret this law. And the law could be interpreted in a  political way where you moved it toward your party, or the law could be  interpreted the way it was written, with fairness. It ended up that we  did everything we could to try to be fair to the law and fair as it was  written.   I don't think Senator Sessions is able to do that, not only based on  his history in Alabama as U.S. attorney, but his entire career up to  this date.   We talk about loyalty being a valued characteristic in politics. The  Nation's chief law enforcement officer must be independent, first and  foremost. He or she must defend the Constitution and all Americans, not  be the President's architect of a new political order that excludes  many people.   For these reasons, I must vote no on this nomination.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the Washington Post article I referred to so that people can see that  full article and be able to judge Steve Bannon's quote, who is the  President's top strategist.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, Jan. 30, 2017]  Trump's Hard-Line Actions Have an Intellectual Godfather: Jeff Sessions                    (By Philip Rucker and Robert Costa)         In jagged black strokes, President Trump's signature was       scribbled onto a catalogue of executive orders over the past       10 days that translated the hard-line promises of his       campaign into the policies of his government.        The directives bore Trump's name, but another man's       fingerprints were also on nearly all of them: Jeff Sessions.        The early days of the Trump presidency have rushed a       nationalist agenda long on the fringes of American life into       action--and Sessions, the quiet Alabamian who long cultivated       those ideas as a Senate backbencher, has become a singular       power in this new Washington.        Sessions's ideology is driven by a visceral aversion to       what he calls ``soulless globalism,'' a term used on the       extreme right to convey a perceived threat to the United       States from free trade, international alliances and the       immigration of nonwhites.        And despite many reservations among Republicans about that       worldview, Sessions--whose 1986 nomination for a federal       judgeship was doomed by accusations of racism that he       denied--is finding little resistance in Congress to his       proposed role as Trump's attorney general.        Sessions's nomination is scheduled to be voted on Tuesday       by the Senate Judiciary Committee, but his influence in the       administration stretches far beyond the Justice Department.       From immigration and health care to national security and       trade, Sessions is the intellectual godfather of the       president's policies. His reach extends throughout the White       House, with his aides and allies accelerating the president's       most dramatic moves, including the ban on refugees and       citizens from seven mostly Muslim nations that has triggered       fear around the globe.        The author of many of Trump's executive orders is senior       policy adviser Stephen Miller, a Sessions confidant who was       mentored by him and who spent the weekend overseeing the       government's implementation of the refugee ban. The tactician       turning Trump's agenda into law is deputy chief of staff Rick       Dearborn, Sessions's longtime chief of staff in the Senate.       The mastermind behind Trump's incendiary brand of populism is       chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who, as chairman of the       Breitbart website, promoted Sessions for years.        Then there is Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and       senior adviser, who considers Sessions a savant and forged a       bond with the senator while orchestrating Trump's trip last       summer to Mexico City and during the darkest days of the       campaign.        In an email in response to a request from The Washington       Post, Bannon described Sessions as ``the clearinghouse for       policy and philosophy'' in Trump's administration, saying he       and the senator are at the center of Trump's ``pro-America       movement'' and the global nationalist phenomenon.        ``In America and Europe, working people are reasserting       their right to control their own destinies,'' Bannon wrote.       ``Jeff Sessions has been at the forefront of this movement       for years, developing populist nation-state policies that are       supported by the vast and overwhelming majority of Americans,       but are poorly understood by cosmopolitan elites in the media       that live in a handful of our larger cities.''        He continued: ``Throughout the campaign, Sessions has been       the fiercest, most dedicated, and most loyal promoter in       Congress of Trump's agenda, and has played a critical role as       the clearinghouse for policy and philosophy to undergird the       implementation of  [[Page S912]]       that agenda. What we are witnessing now is the birth of a new       political order, and the more frantic a handful of media       elites become, the more powerful that new political order       becomes itself.''        Trump, who is never shy about showering praise on his       loyalists, speaks of Sessions with reverence. At a luncheon       the day before his inauguration, Trump singled out someone in       the audience: ``the legendary Jeff Sessions.''        Trump said in an email to The Post that Sessions is ``a       truly fine person.''        ``Jeff was one of my earliest supporters and the fact that       he is so highly respected by everyone in both Washington,       D.C., and around the country was a tremendous asset to me       throughout the campaign,'' Trump wrote.        Sessions helped devise the president's first-week strategy,       in which Trump signed a blizzard of executive orders that       begin to fulfill his signature campaign promises--although       Sessions had advocated going even faster.        The senator lobbied for a ``shock-and-awe'' period of       executive action that would rattle Congress, impress Trump's       base and catch his critics unaware, according to two       officials involved in the transition planning. Trump opted       for a slightly slower pace, these officials said, because he       wanted to maximize news coverage by spreading out his       directives over several weeks.        Trump makes his own decisions, but Sessions was one of the       rare lawmakers who shared his impulses.        ``Sessions brings heft to the president's gut instincts,''       said Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser. He compared       Sessions to John Mitchell, who was attorney general under       Richard M. Nixon but served a more intimate role as a       counselor to the president on just about everything. ``Nixon       is not a guy given to taking advice, but Mitchell was       probably Nixon's closest adviser,'' Stone said.        There are limits to Sessions's influence, however. He has       not persuaded Trump--so far, at least--to eliminate the       Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, under which       children brought to the United States illegally are allowed       to stay in the country.        Sessions has also been leading the internal push for Trump       to nominate William H. Pryor Jr., his deputy when Sessions       was Alabama's attorney general and now a federal appeals       court judge, for the Supreme Court. While Pryor is on Trump's       list of three finalists, it is unclear whether he will get       the nod.        In his senior staff meetings, Trump talks about Sessions as       someone who ``gets things done,'' calmly and without fanfare,       said Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor.        ``He does it in a very courtly, deliberative manner,'' she       said. ``There's never a cloud of dust or dramatic flourish.''        Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House and informal       Trump adviser, said, ``Sessions is the person who is       comfortable being an outsider to the establishment but able       to explain the establishment to Trump. There is this New       York-Los Angeles bias that if you sound like Alabama, you       can't be all that bright, but that's totally wrong, and Trump       recognized how genuinely smart Sessions is.''        Sessions was especially instrumental in the early days of       the transition, which was taken over by Dearborn after a       purge of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's associates.       Sessions became a daily presence at Trump Tower in New York,       mapping out the policy agenda and making personnel decisions.        Once former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was out of       consideration for secretary of state, Trump considered       nominating Sessions because he was so trusted by the inner       circle, including Kushner, although Sessions's preference was       to be attorney general, according to people familiar with the       talks.        Since his nomination, Sessions has been careful to not be       formally involved even as his ideas animate the White House.       In a statement Sunday, he denied that he has had       ``communications'' with his former advisers or reviewed the       executive orders.        Sessions has installed close allies throughout the       administration. He persuaded Cliff Sims, a friend and       adviser, to sell his Alabama media outlet and take a job       directing message strategy at the White House. Sessions also       influenced the selection of Peter Navarro, an economist and       friend with whom he co-authored an op-ed last fall warning       against the ``rabbit hole of globalism,'' as director of the       National Trade Council.        Sessions's connections extend into the White House media       briefing room, where press secretary Sean Spicer took the       first question at his Jan. 24 briefing from a journalist at       LifeZette, a conservative website run by Laura Ingraham, a       Trump supporter and populist in the Sessions mold. The       website's senior editor is Garrett Murch, a former       communications adviser to Sessions.        Another link: Julia Hahn, a Breitbart writer who favorably       chronicled Sessions's immigration crusades over the past two       years, was hired by Bannon to be one of his White House       aides.        More mainstream Republicans have been alarmed by Sessions's       ascent. John Weaver, a veteran GOP strategist who was a       consultant on Sessions's first Senate campaign and is now a       Trump critic, said Sessions is at the pinnacle of power       because he shares Trump's ``1940s view of fortress America.''        ``That's something you would find in an Allen Drury       novel,'' Weaver said. ``Unfortunately, there are real       consequences to this, which are draconian views on       immigration and a view of America that is insular and not an       active member of the global community.''        Inside the White House and within Sessions's alumni       network, people have taken to calling the senator ``Joseph,''       referring to the Old Testament patriarch who was shunned by       his family and sold into slavery as a boy, only to rise       through unusual circumstances to become right hand to the       pharaoh and oversee the lands of Egypt.        In a 20-year Senate career, Sessions has been isolated in       his own party, a dynamic crystallized a decade ago when he       split with President George W. Bush and the business       community over comprehensive immigration changes.        In lonely and somewhat conspiratorial speeches on the       Senate floor, Sessions would chastise the ``masters of the       universe.'' He hung on his office wall a picture of He-Man       from the popular 1980s comic book series.        As he weighed a presidential run, Trump liked what he saw       in Sessions, who was tight with the constituencies Trump was       eager to rouse on the right. So he cultivated a relationship,       giving Sessions $2,000 for his 2014 reelection even though       the senator had no Democratic opponent.        ``Sessions was always somebody that we had targeted,'' said       Sam Nunberg, Trump's political adviser at the time.        In May 2015, Nunberg said, he reached out to Miller, then       an adviser to Sessions, to arrange a phone call between Trump       and the senator. The two hit it off, with Trump telling       Nunberg, ``That guy is tough.''        The next month, Trump declared his candidacy. In August of       that year, Sessions joined Trump at a mega-rally in the       senator's home town of Mobile and donned a ``Make America       Great Again'' cap. By January 2016, Miller had formally       joined the campaign and was traveling daily with the       candidate, writing speeches and crafting policies.        ``Senator Sessions laid a bit of groundwork . . . on       matters like trade and illegal immigration,'' Conway said.       ``It was candidate Trump then who was able to elevate those       twin pillars in a way that cast it through the lens of what's       good for the American worker.''        As Trump kept rising, so did Sessions.        ``It's like being a guerrilla in the hinterlands preparing       for the next hopeless assault on the government,'' said Mark       Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration       Studies, a conservative research institute. ``Then you get a       message that the capital has fallen.''     Thank you.   With that, I will yield the floor momentarily, and I may be back in a  minute or two.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as I reflect on the nomination of Jeff  Sessions to be Attorney General, one of the things that hits me is,  when we look at the broad scope of how America has been moving forward  in the last 100 years, the three big movements that have changed  America have been the civil rights movement; the women's rights  movement--women's suffrage, women's rights, women wanting freedom over  their choices on reproductive rights; and then conservation and  environmental rights, which have kind of changed everything since Teddy  Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt and my father and Uncle Mo Udall, who  served in the Congress.   I grew up believing civil rights was something that was moving us  forward, was inclusive, and was something where we really cared about  every person.   The job of the United States Senator is to represent your State. My  State of New Mexico is majority-minority, very diverse, and I am very  proud to speak out for the people of New Mexico and their civil rights.  I have told many of them back home the story I learned through my  father and through his public service, when he was a college student at  the University of Arizona.   Both he and my Uncle Morris Udall were at the University of Arizona  in the lunchroom. Way back in the 1940s, the lunchroom was segregated  so the Black students had to eat outside under the trees. They couldn't  eat inside. My father and Mo had a friend, a young man by the name of  Morgan Maxwell. Morgan still is a good friend of the family, and I am  good friends with his son who lives in New Mexico.   Morgan was sitting out under the tree, and Mo and my father went over  and said: We want you to have lunch with us. They took him through the  line at the University of Arizona. The  [[Page S913]]  people serving looked at him like they were a little shocked and  surprised. They said: He is our friend. He is going to have lunch with  us. They served him, and they sat down at the lunch table in the  lunchroom. It ended up that they had a good lunch that day.   But that push to bring Morgan Maxwell, a Black student, into a  segregated lunchroom ended up with the president of the university  facing a decision: Was he going to discipline the Udall brothers or was  he going to change the rule and integrate the lunchroom? Thank God, he  integrated the lunchroom, and the University of Arizona, at that time,  moved forward with integration.   I had always heard that story, and it resonated with me a lot. Then,  later, as I was growing up here in Washington when my father was  Secretary of the Interior, there was a great commotion around the fact  that the Washington Redskins was the last team in the NFL to integrate  their team. Here, we are talking in the 1960s. The owner of the  Washington Redskins was named George Preston Marshall. Everyone knew he  was a bigot and racist. He said: This is never going to happen. We are  not going to integrate the Redskins. So there was a big movement in  Washington to get my father to do something about it.   He took this in a serious way and passed it on to the Solicitor. The  Solicitor came back and said: Stewart, actually, you can do something  about it. The stadium resides on Park Service property and you are the  landlord. Tell him next year when he gets his lease, if his team isn't  integrated, you can terminate the lease, or he can integrate. George  Preston Marshall raised hell and went to Jack Kent and Bobby Kennedy at  Justice and did everything they could to push it aside. The Kennedys  backed my dad.    I know my colleague Senator Hirono is here.   The short story is that the Washington Redskins got Bobby Mitchell  and had the first winning season the next year in a long, long time.   Those civil rights are things you grow up with. They are things you  want to move forward with. That is why I rise today to say I am deeply  disturbed about what Coretta Scott King said about Jeff Sessions in  1986 when he was going to be promoted. As U.S. attorney, he chilled the  free exercise of vote by Black citizens. That is how he carried out his  responsibilities.   I think if you look at the whole history here, he is not fit to be  Attorney General, and that is why I am going to vote no, and I urge  everybody to vote no.   I see my great colleague from Hawaii, Senator Hirono, here. She may  want to speak. Others may come in.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
