 Madam President, today I am reintroducing legislation  that would help bolster the Nation's background check system for  firearms.   Under current law, incomplete background checks must be removed from  the FBl's systems if they remain unresolved beyond the 88-day mark. As  a result, countless firearms have been sold without completed  background checks. This poses a grave danger because it allows  individuals who we know are dangerous to purchase firearms.   In recent years, gun sales across America have dramatically  increased. In 2022, about 17.4 million guns were sold in the United  States. Unfortunately, this surge in purchases has overwhelmed our  already-strained background check system.   While the vast majority of background checks are promptly completed  within 3 days, the sheer volume of checks means that some checks will  necessarily be delayed--and sometimes significantly delayed.   According to data compiled by NBC News, between January 2020 and  November 2021, the FBI was unable to resolve 734,604 background checks  within the current 88-day window. As a result of these delays, the FBI  was required to wipe the incomplete checks from their systems. Since  these background checks were never completed, it is impossible to know  how many of these firearms were transferred to purchasers who were  prohibited by law from owning a gun.   Congress must act to protect public safety by ensuring that all  background checks are completed.   This bill would do exactly that. It would grant the FBI the authority  to retain gun purchase records until a background check is fully  completed. Put simply, this bill will let the FBI do its job.   I thank Senators Blumenthal, Booker, Menendez, Murphy, Padilla, and  Whitehouse for their support, and I urge the rest of my colleagues to  support the bill as well.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Rounds):   S. 2384. A bill to provide lawful permanent resident status for  certain advanced STEM degree holders, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.
