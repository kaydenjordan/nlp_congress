 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the en bloc package,  and I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry for their  support of two amendments that I have offered, particularly my  amendment clarifying the statutory rights of servicemembers and their  families under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.   For too long, forced arbitration clauses buried deep within the fine  print of everyday contracts have eroded workplace discrimination  protections for servicemembers and blocked them from having their day  in court to hold corporations accountable. Under these agreements, a  servicemember can be called up for Active Duty, express to his or her  employer a desire to return to his job following deployment, and then  be fired on his last day at work before he deploys. This actually  happened.   The servicemember would then learn that he or she has waived the  right to due process because of the contract he or she signed, removing  the procedures and safeguards afforded to individuals in our justice  system. These forced arbitration clauses allow corporations to choose  their arbiter and their venue and to deny servicemembers the right to  press their claims for unjust termination.   This bipartisan amendment would end this shameful practice by  clarifying that arbitration clauses are only enforceable if agreed to  by the servicemember or their family after a dispute arises, thereby  protecting their rights under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.   I thank my colleagues, Congressman Guy Reschenthaler and Veterans  Affairs' Committee Chairman Mark Takano, for their strong, bipartisan  support for this amendment to protect our men and women in uniform. I  thank the chairman and the ranking member for their support of this  amendment.
