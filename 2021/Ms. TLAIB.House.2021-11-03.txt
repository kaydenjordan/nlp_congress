 Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Carr Center  in Detroit, Michigan, as they celebrate 30 years of preserving,  presenting, promoting, and developing African and African-American  cultural arts traditions in southeastern Michigan.   Founded in 1991 as the Arts League of Michigan, the Carr Center has  worked to fulfill its mission of bringing artistic excellence by  offering a wide array of programming.   Building upon its initial creative placemaking, the Carr Center has  become a destination and hub for the performing arts in the city of  Detroit.   The Carr Center has implemented three pillars of programming: Carr  Center Presents, Carr Center Contemporary focus on performing and  visual arts, while the Carr Center Arts Academy offers in-school and  intensive summer arts education opportunities.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join me in recognizing  the Carr Center's many contributions to southeastern Michigan over the  past three decades as we wish them well in the years to come. They are  a true gem of Michigan's 13th District.                            ____________________
