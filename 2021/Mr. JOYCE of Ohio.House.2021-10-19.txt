 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill,  the Drug-Free Communities Pandemic Relief Act.   The unfortunate reality is that while the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged  our Nation last year, so did the opioid crisis.   More than 93,000 overdose deaths were reported in 2020.   Meanwhile, enough fentanyl has been seized at our southern border  this year to kill the entire U.S. population seven times over.   And just the other week, the DEA warned that counterfeit pills laced  with this deadly synthetic opioid are spreading across all 50 States.   These statistics are harrowing, and the stories of loss they cause  are heartbreaking. All of us have loved ones, friends, or neighbors in  our communities that have been impacted.   As a former Geauga County prosecutor, I saw firsthand how addiction  has devastated communities in northeast Ohio and know how important it  is to support local efforts that reduce and prevent youth drug use.   That is why I introduced the Drug-Free Communities Pandemic Relief  Act with my friend and colleague on the other side of the aisle,  Congressman Kilmer.   Recognizing that local problems need local solutions, the Drug-Free  Communities Program provides funding to local coalitions that engage  multiple sectors of their communities in order to reduce and prevent  substance abuse disorder among younger Americans.   No other drug prevention program has consistently achieved the same  reduction in youth drug use than the Drug-Free Communities Program has.   However, hundreds of coalitions have been unable to meet the  program's local matching requirements due to financial difficulties  caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.   My bipartisan legislation will address that challenge and ensure  these coalitions have the resources and flexibility they need during  these difficult times to combat the crisis of addiction gripping our  country.   With more Americans dying from drug overdoses than ever before, it is  critical that we do everything we can to support and empower those  working on the front lines in our communities to reduce and prevent  addiction among our children.   I strongly urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill today.                                time  1630
