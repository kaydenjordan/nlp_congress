 Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly 5 months since President  Biden nominated Julie Su to be Secretary of Labor. That nomination  remains stalled. The Senate has declined to confirm her. She now faces  bipartisan opposition, yet the President has not withdrawn her  nomination.   Worse yet, Su is continuing to serve as Secretary of Labor in an  acting capacity, despite the Senate declining to put her in that  position. It appears that this is now the plan, to simply cancel the  vote and carry on as if she had been confirmed.   Su's leading supporter in the Senate, Bernie Sanders, said as much.  He said: I hope she has the votes to become the Secretary. If not, of  course, she should stay where she is. She is doing a great job, Sanders  continued. Why would you not?   Well, why would you not? One simple reason is the Constitution. This  is blatantly an end run around the Constitution's advice and consent  requirement of Article II, section 2, clause 2.   As further evidence of the Biden administration's plan to simply keep  Su on indefinitely, with or without a vote, after months of Department  of Labor rulemaking being put on pause to spare Su negative press  during the confirmation process, the wheels are now back in motion. The  administration seems to be acknowledging that Su does not have the  votes for confirmation but, again, plans to keep her at the helm of the  Labor Department anyway.   Now, this administration has a disturbing pattern of seeking to do by  undemocratic means that which it cannot do by democratic means.   For example, on the topic of student loan forgiveness, President  Biden had said: I don't think I have the authority to do that, and then  he went ahead and did it anyway by executive order.   On the issue of independent contracting, Congress has declined to  adopt the destructive ABC test via the PRO Act, so the Labor Department  is seeking to enact a functionally equivalent legal standard by  rulemaking. This is the most brazen example yet. Having made the worst  possible pick for Secretary of Labor, which the United States Senate is  rightly rejecting, the President is trying to install his nominee as  the permanent Secretary anyway.   Now, the student loan executive order, of course, was just struck  down by the Supreme Court, but what the administration is attempting  here is much more potentially disruptive. What is at issue is not just  one policy, rather, it is every action the Department of Labor takes  under Acting Secretary Su that will be put under a legal cloud.   Now, Su's allies have tried to make a legal argument relating to the  interplay of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of the statute that  created the position of Deputy Secretary of Labor. This argument is  without merit. There is no statutory authority to have an Acting  Secretary who has been nominated for permanent Secretary continue  serving indefinitely, with or without confirmation; nor could there be  because any such statute would violate the Constitution.   Education and the Workforce Chairwoman Virginia Foxx and I have sent  a letter to Gene Dodaro, U.S. Comptroller General at the U.S.  Government Accountability Office, requesting an opinion on the legality  of keeping Su as the head of Labor indefinitely.   None of this should be necessary. The White House and Julie Su have  had every opportunity to persuade the Senate. They have had a nightly  war room and daily arm twisting for months. It is well past time to  withdraw the nomination and for the President to nominate a Secretary  of Labor who will be on the side of American workers.                             The Fentanyl Crisis     Mr. Speaker, last month, the district attorney of Placer  County in my district secured the first-ever murder conviction in  California for dealing fentanyl. This is a very important moment in the  battle against the fentanyl epidemic that is taking such a tragic toll  on every community across the country.   As The New York Times reported: The novel prosecution in Placer,  northeast of Sacramento, is being closely watched in law enforcement  and legislative circles in California, which lost about 6,000 people to  fentanyl and other opioids in 2021, the last year for which complete  data is available. Prosecutors have been looking for ways to hold  people distributing the drug accountable for the staggering death toll.  [[Page H3631]]    Now, I would like to share the details about this case and the  successful legal strategy of the district attorney, but first a word  about the scale of the fentanyl crisis in the United States.   Fentanyl has become the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18  to 45, surpassing car accidents, surpassing suicides, surpassing  everything. It is now the leading cause of death for young people in  our country. It is affecting every community, including my own.   It has been reported that 73,102 Americans died from fentanyl in the  past year. That amounts to 200 deaths every day, one every 7 minutes.  The reason is largely because of the lethality of fentanyl, which is  unlike any other drug; 100 times more potent than morphine. Two  milligrams, or the amount that fits on the end of a pencil, is a deadly  dose.                                time  1930    Fentanyl is being added to street pills. Mr. Speaker, 98 percent of  the pills sold on the street are fakes, and 60 percent have the  potential to be lethal.   Many victims are teenagers, people with no prior drug use who perhaps  were stressed out from isolation during the COVID shutdowns. They  purchase what turns out to be fake pills, such as Xanax, over social  media or the internet. Dealers often deliver these pills straight to  the victims' homes.   A huge part of this problem is to prevent fentanyl from coming into  the United States. The southern border is by far the primary source. In  fact, in 2022 alone, the DEA seized 379 million lethal doses of  fentanyl. Securing the border would diminish the availability and  ability to traffic into the United States, and it would save many  lives. That is the most important part of this equation.   There are other ways that we can tackle the problem, and that is  where Placer County is leading the way. Like other communities across  the country, our county experienced an astronomical 450 percent  increase in fentanyl deaths from 2019 to 2021. Almost half of those  were among residents 25 years of age or younger.   The case that was recently prosecuted involved the tragic death of a  15-year-old Roseville girl who passed away on June 21, 2022. The dealer  was a Placer County area drug dealer named Nathaniel, who was involved  in selling fentanyl to minors. He possessed and transported fentanyl in  the form of M30 Percocet pills. The fentanyl was pressed into the pill.   One of his customers was a 15-year-old girl who overdosed on one of  those pills and, as a result, passed away in June. Nathaniel witnessed  this OD, and after his customer died, he continued to sell pills from  the same batch to other individuals. This is why he was charged with  murder. It is the first murder charge and conviction of a fentanyl  dealer in California.   Specifically, he was charged by Placer County District Attorney  Morgan Gire and convicted of second-degree murder in Placer County  Superior Court.   In order to establish his case, District Attorney Gire had to prove  the following elements: first, that Nathaniel did in fact deal the  deadly fentanyl pills to his victim; second, that the defendant knew  that the pills he provided to his victim contained fentanyl; and,  third, that he knew how deadly the fentanyl he provided was.   In other words, he had to know his actions could lead to the death of  the customer and then choose to deal anyway. That is the basic  predicate of the murder charges and conviction.   Other factors in play in this case involved callousness. District  Attorney Gire indicated that he would only pursue murder charges if a  degree of callousness is present, if a dealer continues to deal after  he or she knows someone died of the pills and is pursuing profit. Gire  said charges would be less likely in cases where addicts were simply  sharing pills with one another.   A second additional factor in play here was deception, where the  dealer deceptively markets fentanyl as something else. Gire said that  that changes the legal landscape.   In an era of skyrocketing and tragic fentanyl deaths and the  increasing prevalence of it in our communities, a multipronged approach  of education, accountability, and stopping the supply is needed. The  prevailing prosecutorial approach and many of the criminal laws on the  books in California are failing to achieve an adequate level of this  occurrence.   The strategy that is being pursued in Placer County is that by  raising the cost of dealing fentanyl for dealers--we are talking about  a 15-years-to-life sentence here for second-degree murder--we can keep  these predators away from our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I want to add a quote from District Attorney Gire, which  I think is a very important one. ``I have heard the criticism that this  is a retread of the war on drugs,'' he said. ``It isn't. Fentanyl is  something different.'' That is an argument that we really need to  understand.   Whatever arguments we might make in terms of prosecution strategies,  when it comes to other forms of drug use, there is simply no comparison  to the damage that this drug is doing across our country. We must take  action in every way possible.   This murder conviction, the first of its kind in Placer County, sends  a loud and clear message to those who would victimize young people and  Americans with this lethal substance. It says: Stay out of our  community.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage prosecutors across California and across the  country to look at the model District Attorney Gire has provided in  California because it will save lives.                            Pay Raise for Military     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the 5.2  percent pay raise for our servicemen and women provided for in the  National Defense Authorization Act, or the NDAA.   Americans have been left struggling under the weight of runaway  inflation and an ever-increasing cost of living--perhaps none more so  than those in uniform.   Skyrocketing inflation has contributed to pay for servicemembers  falling behind that of their civilian counterparts in terms of  purchasing power. The much-needed pay increase that we are providing  with this legislation is the largest in 22 years, and it will ensure  that compensation for military service is at least commensurate with  the rise in civilian wages.   In concrete terms, this means more income to cover housing, food,  providing for a family, and other basic necessities that those in  uniform serving our country shouldn't have to lose sleep over.   In addition to this across-the-board pay increase, the NDAA contains  numerous provisions designed to make life more affordable for junior  enlistees. Pay for our military's most junior enlistees, E-1s, is  currently a paltry $22,000 a year. The NDAA increases that base pay  rate to $31,000 a year so that the starting wage for junior enlistees  isn't lower than that of a fast-food cashier in California.    The calculation of basic allowance for housing is also improved to  provide a more accurate and higher level of aid for housing, and the  basic needs allowance, which enables low-income servicemembers to  support a family, is expanded, as well.   Finally, the Secretary of Defense is authorized to provide monthly  bonuses to junior enlisted members to mitigate the impacts of  inflation.   Mr. Speaker, we owe members of our military a debt that can never be  repaid for their service and sacrifice to our country. Americans  undoubtedly have an obligation to provide a level of compensation that  matches at least that of their civilian counterparts and enables  servicemembers to meet basic housing costs and provide for their  families.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation fulfills that basic foundational  commitment, and I am proud to support the pay increase for our  military.                       Vaccine Discharge Reinstatements     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of offering  reinstatement to the over 8,000 servicemembers who were discharged from  the military for merely declining to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. As we  speak, our Nation's military is in the midst of a severe recruitment  shortage.   The Army fell short of its recruitment goal by 15,000 recruits last  year. This year, it is on track to fall short by 20,000. The Air Force,  Navy, and Marine Corps are facing similar challenges.   The consequences of failing to recruit enough volunteers are severe-- reduced combat readiness and a reduced ability to keep us safe. This is  all the more notable given that our military, of  [[Page H3632]]  course, is all volunteer. We rely on citizens willingly stepping up and  joining to serve our country.   These severe shortages have been exacerbated by our Secretary of  Defense taking the same approach to COVID as, unfortunately, many  civilian leaders did, an approach characterized by heavyhanded  overreactions and a complete disregard for scientific evidence and  informed policymaking.   Members of our Armed Forces, young, physically fit men and women, are  the least at-risk population for COVID. Moreover, over 95 percent of  the military has already been vaccinated against COVID before the  discharges occurred.   Like students, small business owners, and many other groups of  individuals, servicemembers were harmed and had their lives upended by  wholly unnecessary actions pursued by politicians and political leaders  who simply were not looking at data and evidence, and had no regard for  personal freedoms.   The National Defense Authorization Act offers a corrective course to  these mistakes. The act provides a pathway to reinstatement for any  servicemember discharged for declining a COVID vaccine and requires the  Secretary of Defense to fully inform discharged individuals of the  steps they can take.   Further, it assures that veterans, for the time spent discharged,  will be classified as a ``career intermission'' to prevent any negative  impact on future promotions. It will also prohibit the Department of  Defense from forcing cadets discharged from military service academies  to repay tuition.   While the damage done by the original discharge decisions can never  be undone, I am very proud to support legislation that at least allows  Congress to do everything in its power to mitigate the harm that was  done.                     Providing Transparent Accountability     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Providing  Accountability Through Transparency Act.   What this measure does is very simple. It requires that Federal  agencies, when issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, simply include  a link to a plain language summary of the proposal in 100 words or  less.   This is a basic, commonsense measure to make our government more  accessible to Americans. I think right now that is something that is  very important. After we went through a few years where many people  felt like their ability to participate in government was foreclosed  altogether, and where we have had a trend that has been decades in the  making where more and more power is consolidated in Washington, D.C.,  and in Federal bureaucracies, ordinary citizens have less and less of  an opportunity to participate. When there is some opportunity, such as  a notice of public rulemaking up for public comment, oftentimes they  are confronted by a blizzard of legalese that makes it very difficult  to make heads or tails of what is going on.   What this measure does is it says, in 100 words or less, let's put it  right there in plain English so everyone is on the same page, so we as  a country can have a debate about whether this is good or bad policy.   It is a simple step, a modest step, but it is a step in the right  direction.   Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I am proud to support this measure.                   Commemorating Israel's 75th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of Israel's 75th  year as a nation.   For these last 75 years, Israel has stood as a sanctuary for the  Jewish people; as a beacon of freedom, democracy, and human rights in  the region; and as a steadfast ally to our Nation.   The United States has been among Israel's closest allies from its  very inception. In fact, President Harry Truman officially recognized  Israel merely 11 minutes after its formation. Since that moment, the  bond between our two nations--one based upon shared values, common  interests, and a united vision for the future--has only grown stronger.   Our Nation's welcoming of Israeli President Isaac Herzog to speak  before a joint session of Congress this Wednesday is just the latest  reflection of this special relationship. I look forward to continuing  to advance this partnership in every way I can in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I will take a moment to remark upon the unique place  Israel holds not only in the heart of its citizens but in people across  the globe.   In 2018, I had the chance to visit, as part of a bipartisan  delegation, and spend a week meeting with leaders from business,  academia, government, the media, the IDF, and other facets of Israeli  society. We also visited the West Bank, a kibbutz outside of Gaza, the  Holocaust memorial, a hospital caring for the wounded from Syria, the  Lebanon border, and much more.   Mr. Speaker, I came away with a sense of deep admiration for the  tremendous dynamism and diversity of Israeli society, for the way such  a deep connection to history coexists with a drive toward innovation  and modernization, for the spirit of self-reliance and national  service, and for the deeply felt sense of Israeli identity and pride in  the nation's achievements.                                time  1945    The United States and the global community is enriched by the  presence of Israel on the world stage. As a Member of Congress, I take  great pride in supporting Israel, and wherever possible, advocating for  Israel in the global arena. Today, I am honored to recognize and  commemorate that fact by celebrating Israel's 75th anniversary as a  nation.                    Recognizing Rocklin Donuts & Cinnamon     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate an exceptional  small business in my district, Rocklin Donuts & Cinnamon, for their  recent recognition on Yelp as the top doughnut shop in the Nation.   Let me say that again: the top doughnut shop in the Nation.   This distinguished, family-owned establishment is operated by Ky and  Anna Pho, a couple whose story embodies the American Dream. Over 40  years ago, Ky and Anna emigrated from Cambodia to the United States of  America. After overcoming the many obstacles they faced in immigrating  to a new country, they committed themselves to this enterprise and are  now recipients of a well-deserved reward for their diligent efforts.   Their commitment to their business and strong work ethic is truly  inspiring. They rise every morning between 2 and 3 a.m. to prepare  fresh doughnuts for the many patrons who frequent their shop. They  serve a wide array of delicious treats, ranging from an assortment of  doughnuts to breakfast croissants, and, of course, the traditional  cinnamon roll.   It was not long ago when they opened their doors, just in May of  2022, and they quickly rose to high regard in our communities, earning  a five-star Yelp rating and national attention in this short period of  time.   I have gone by there a few times recently, and I will tell you, Mr.  Speaker, the line is out the door.   Therefore, on behalf of California's Third Congressional District and  the United States House of Representatives, I am pleased to recognize  Rocklin Donuts & Cinnamon for this outstanding achievement.                     Recognizing the Downieville Classic     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the silver  anniversary of the Downieville Classic, a world-renowned annual bike  race staged in Downieville, California. Before becoming a cherished  destination for mountain bikers, this historic gold rush town in the  Sierra Nevada was known mainly for its past notoriety of vigilante  justice, claim jumping, and boom and bust fortunes.   Downieville's famous--or inglorious--days, such as they were, were in  the past until a pioneer of backcountry mountain biking named Greg  Williams realized that the true treasure of the Sierra Nevada was not  the gold in the rivers but in the recreational challenges of the  mountains themselves. Greg's vision was to combine world-class ultra  biking with spectacular mountain landscapes to revitalize the economy  of his hometown.   Letting the mountains dictate the course, Greg and his team designed  the premier classic point-to-point route as a 26.5-mile black diamond  lung-busting endurance run from Sierra City to Downieville.   Riders climb to the 7,469-foot crest of the Sierra Nevada, then  plunge 5,700 vertical feet along a route of flowing turns, rolling  jumps, boulder staircases, and river crossings. This ordeal on wheels  tests both the sturdiness of riders and their bikes.   Recognizing the challenge of the race and beauty of the course,  Outside magazine named the Downieville Classic  [[Page H3633]]  one of the 10 best bike races in North America.   The combination of sustainable recreation, job creation, and world- famous athletic events has made Downieville a model for the economic  recovery of struggling mountain communities throughout the Lost Sierra.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States House of Representatives,  I am honored to commemorate the 25-year anniversary of the Downieville  Classic in recognition of the profound impact the race has had on  Sierra County and the broader region.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
