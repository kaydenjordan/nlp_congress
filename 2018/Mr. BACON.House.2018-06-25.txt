 Mr. Speaker, I am a cosponsor on this bill, and I urge  support for the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, H.R. 299.   Our sailors, when they were off the coast of Vietnam, thought that  they were safe from Agent Orange, but that water was sucked into the  ships. It was used for shower water, used to wash their clothes, and  our sailors were impacted by it. Now we know that not only them, but  their children and grandchildren have also been impacted at times. So  it is far time that we passed this bill and provide protections to our  veterans who are now suffering the consequences of Agent Orange.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the leadership of Chairman Roe and Mr. Valadao  for what they are doing here. This is the right thing to do.   I have talked to so many sailors who have been impacted by this, and  I know they will be relieved to have this bill passed. I thank them  both, and I thank the minority side as well.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5733) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide for  the responsibility of the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center to maintain capabilities to identify threats to  industrial control systems, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5733         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Industrial Control       Systems Capabilities Enhancement Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. CAPABILITIES OF NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY AND                     COMMUNICATIONS INTEGRATION CENTER TO IDENTIFY                     THREATS TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS.         (a) In General.--Section 227 of the Homeland Security Act       of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 148) is amended--        (1) in subsection (e)(1)--        (A) in subparagraph (G), by striking ``and'' after the       semicolon;        (B) in subparagraph (H), by inserting ``and'' after the       semicolon; and        (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(I) activities of the Center address the security of both       information technology and operational technology, including       industrial control systems;'';  [[Page H5631]]         (2) by redesignating subsections (f) through (m) as       subsections (g) through (n), respectively; and        (3) by inserting after subsection (d) the following new       subsection:        ``(f) Industrial Control Systems.--The Center shall       maintain capabilities to identify and address threats and       vulnerabilities to products and technologies intended for use       in the automated control of critical infrastructure       processes. In carrying out this subsection, the Center       shall--        ``(1) lead, in coordination with relevant sector specific       agencies, Federal Government efforts to identify and mitigate       cybersecurity threats to industrial control systems,       including supervisory control and data acquisition systems;        ``(2) maintain cross-sector incident response capabilities       to respond to industrial control system cybersecurity       incidents;        ``(3) provide cybersecurity technical assistance to       industry end-users, product manufacturers, and other       industrial control system stakeholders to identify and       mitigate vulnerabilities;        ``(4) collect, coordinate, and provide vulnerability       information to the industrial control systems community by,       as appropriate, working closely with security researchers,       industry end-users, product manufacturers, and other       industrial control systems stakeholders; and        ``(5) conduct such other efforts and assistance as the       Secretary determines appropriate.''.        (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of the enactment of this Act, and every 6 months       thereafter during the subsequent four-year period, the       National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center       shall provide to the Committee on Homeland Security of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a briefing on       the industrial control systems capabilities of the Center       under subsection (f) of section 227 of the Homeland Security       Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 148), as added by subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5733, the DHS Industrial  Control Systems Capabilities Enhancement Act of 2018.   Industrial control systems are the critical interface between digital  controls and a physical process. These systems are ubiquitous in our  modern society and are utilized in all 16 sectors of our Nation's  critical infrastructure.   Whether they are used in managing the operations of electric power  generators, water treatment facilities, medical devices, manufacturing  facilities, or transportation networks, disruptions or damage to these  systems have the potential to cause catastrophic and cascading  consequences to our Nation's national security, our economic security,  and our public health and safety.   The Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity and  Communications Integration Center, or NCCIC, has a key role in  addressing the security of both information technology and operational  technology, including the industrial control systems.   DHS, through the NCCIC, currently provides operators of industrial  control systems across critical infrastructure sectors with support.  They do this with malware and vulnerability analysis, incident  response, and briefings on emerging threats and vulnerabilities.   H.R. 5733 codifies DHS' current role and directs them to maintain  existing capabilities to identify and address threats and  vulnerabilities to products and technologies intended for use in  automated control of critical infrastructure processes. This  legislation also supports DHS' function to secure ICS technologies by  allowing NCCIC to provide cybersecurity technical assistance to ICS end  users, product manufacturers, and other stakeholders to mitigate and  identify vulnerabilities.   DHS operates a central hub for ICS information exchange, technical  expertise, operational partnerships, and ICS-focused cybersecurity  capabilities. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5733 to  codify the work that DHS performs in mitigating industrial control  system vulnerabilities, while ensuring that private industry has a  permanent place for assistance to address cybersecurity risks.   I want to thank Chairman McCaul and Chairman Ratcliffe for their  support of this legislation, as well as Congressman Langevin for his  amendment in committee. This is a bipartisan effort.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to say it has been a pleasure  working with Mr. Langevin not only on the Homeland Security Committee,  but also on the Armed Services Committee. We have partnered on quite a  few things, and it is wonderful to make a difference with him.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, first, I again want to thank my colleague from Rhode  Island for his partnership on this, and his comments were absolutely  right. The Russians and the Chinese are both working to be able to  attack our energy grid, among other parts of our infrastructure, and we  need to be prepared. And it doesn't start on day one of a war. It  starts now, when we have the time to prepare.   The next December 7 will not be like Pearl Harbor with aircraft and  torpedoes and bombs coming to attack our Pacific Fleet. It is going to  be preceded by a cyber attack that is going to try to shut down our  energy grid and other parts of our infrastructure, and the time to  prepare is now. This bill starts that process, or continues that  process, so that we are prepared.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
