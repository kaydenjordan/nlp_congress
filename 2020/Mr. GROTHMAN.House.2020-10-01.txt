 Mr. Speaker, normally, or frequently, people use this  microphone to give negative news, and I would like to lead off with  three little positive stories that I don't think have been in the news  enough, and then we will talk about a story--I don't know if it is true  or not--but we are going to ask for a committee hearing.   First of all, I was at a committee about 10 days ago in which we had  a hearing on Afghanistan. So many of us back home have heard stories,  attended funerals of people, people frequently in the National Guard,  who have died fighting in Afghanistan.   We have now gone 7 months without any combat deaths in Afghanistan. I  don't think that story has been told enough. I am kind of really  surprised it hasn't been told a lot during this campaign season, but it  hasn't.   So let's celebrate the fact that we have gone 7 months, hard to  believe, without a combat casualty in Afghanistan.   Now, the second piece of good news. I was talking to the head of the  border patrol, and it was not long ago, about 15, 16 months ago, when  90,000 people a month were apprehended at the southern border and  allowed in the United States, frequently given a hearing, an asylum  hearing. But they were allowed in the United States, frequently lost  track of, and people who we weren't appropriately vetting becoming a  permanent part of our American fabric.                                time  0945    In the last month, in part due to three different things--a  negotiation that President Trump had with Mexico, where when we  apprehend people, we send them back to Mexico, pending the asylum  hearing; secondly, negotiations with Central America, where people  walking through Central America headed to the United States are kept in  Central America; and third, a directive that if people try to come into  this country because of fears of COVID-19, they are also immediately  turned around and led back--we now have gone from about 90,000 people  to under 2,000, as a matter of fact, he told me under 1,000 people a  month being let in this country who are apprehended or talked to by the  Border Patrol.   There are still people who sneak across the border who are not  apprehended by the Border Patrol. But among these people who they  touch, we have gone from 90,000 to under 1,000. That is good news, and  I am surprised how many people, even on the floor of this institution,  do not know what an improvement we have had at the border.   The third piece of good news I am going to give a tip of the hat to,  when I drove in 2 weeks ago, I took an Uber from the airport. I talked  to the Uber driver, who not only was driving for Uber, but he also had  a job, I believe he told me, with CVS, and he was living the American  Dream.   When I asked him what was great about America, he said anybody can  make it in America, the land of opportunity.   Here you have an Afghan Uber driver. He wasn't of European heritage.  I don't believe he was Christian. I don't believe in the family growing  up he could speak English. But despite all these disadvantages, he is  living the American Dream--and it wasn't rocket science--driving an  Uber, working at CVS.   I hope we remember him as other Congressmen, for whatever political  reason, want to tear down America and say you can't make it in America.  I will tell you, if that Afghan Uber driver can make it in America and  live the American Dream, anybody can live the American Dream.   But now I would like to ask for a hearing because I had some,  perhaps, bad news back home. I talked to a woman who had two children.  One is $30,000 in debt, one is $40,000 in debt, from taking out student  loans. She told me that she felt that if she and her husband weren't  married, there would have been government programs, and her children  wouldn't be so in debt.   She has raised good kids. Those kids are going to pay off their  loans, even if they were discriminated against because their parents  were married, or not.   But it occurred to me, at a time when so much of the rhetoric in this  institution is about discrimination, we ought to have a hearing on the  Education and Labor Committee: Is it really true that we have  government programs out here penalizing people for getting married?   I would ask, again, that my wonderful chairman of the Education and  Labor Committee have a hearing on this topic. We can find out whether  it is the official policy of the United States, when determining  government grants helping people go through school, that we  discriminate against children of married couples. And they have to  delay having children, delay buying a house, as they have to pay off  their student loans.   So I would like to have a hearing. I hope what my constituent told me  is not true, that it is the official policy of the United States  Government to discriminate against people who decide to get married.  But I am afraid it might be, and that is why I would like to have a  hearing.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of provisions in this bill  that are offensive. My colleague, Congressman Rice, just pointed out  the tax cut aimed primarily at the very wealthy. But I am going to  focus on the $1,200.   In my prior life, I used to be an estate planning attorney, and I  would write out wills. People would come in to see me, and one of their  goals was to leave a shot in the arm, leave something for the next  generation, save up some money and give them part of a house, part of a  bank account.   In this bill, the $1,200 to everybody in the country, including  people who do not need any extra assistance because of this, is a  little bit offensive.   I don't know who put together this bill, but kind of unlike the  Greatest Generation that always wanted to leave a little more assets to  their children and grandchildren, this bill lets everybody spend $1,200  so they can leave increased debt to their children and grandchildren. I  think that is a little bit embarrassing.   The second thing that I would point out is that the $1,200 goes not  just to American citizens but to illegal immigrants, and this is part  of a scary trend around here. Whether you are talking about free  medical care for illegal immigrants, welfare for illegal immigrants,  or, now, $1,200 checks to illegal immigrants, it is just sending us  down the wrong way and pretending we don't even have a country here at  all.   Not to mention, at least, when I went to my local Walmart, he said  the last time you sent out these checks, there were huge amounts of  increase in spending in the electronics department. So we are going to  send the next generation further into debt so this generation can buy  more, or at least part of this generation can buy more, electronic junk  from China at Walmart.   I just can't imagine what went on in the room when they put together  this deal, but I am voting ``no'' tomorrow or later tonight.
