 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 1677, Financial  Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2017.   I commend Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Chairman  Tom Marino and Ranking Member David Cicilline, as well as Judiciary  Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, for their leadership on this bill.   I support this legislation for several reasons. To begin with, H.R.  1667 addresses a real need recognized by regulatory agencies,  bankruptcy experts, and the private sector that the bankruptcy law must  be amended so that it can expeditiously restore trust in the financial  marketplace as soon as possible after the collapse of a systemically  significant financial institution.   This need is perhaps best illustrated by the collapse and subsequent  bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008. As a result of that firm's  failure and the rampant uncertainty it generated, a worldwide freeze on  the availability of credit quickly developed. This, in turn, triggered  a near collapse of our Nation's economy and clearly revealed that  current bankruptcy law is ill-equipped to deal with complex financial  institutions in acute economic distress.   H.R. 1667 would establish a specialized form of bankruptcy relief  specifically designed to facilitate the expeditious resolution of a  large, systemically significant financial institution, such as Lehman  Brothers, while minimizing its impact on the financial marketplace.    Under the bill, the debtor's operating subsidiaries would continue to  function outside of bankruptcy, while the debtor's principal assets,  such as its secured property, financial contracts, and the stock of its  subsidiaries, would be transferred to a temporary ``bridge company.''   The bridge company, under the guidance of a trustee, would then  liquidate these assets to pay the claims of the debtor's creditors. The  bill would also temporarily prevent parties from exercising their  rights in certain qualified financial contracts.   Each critical step of this process would be done under the  supervision of a bankruptcy judge and subject to appeal.   Another reason I support this bill is that it appropriately  recognizes the important role the Dodd-Frank Act has in the regulation  of large financial institutions. Without doubt, the Great Recession was  a direct result of the regulatory environment at the time. Fortunately,  the Dodd-Frank Act has done much toward reinvigorating a regulatory  system that makes the financial marketplace more accountable and more  resilient.   In particular, title II of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a mandatory  resolution process to wind down large financial institutions, which is  a critical enforcement tool for bank regulators to ensure compliance  with the act's heightened regulatory requirement.   H.R. 1667 is an excellent complement to the Dodd-Frank Act's  resolution process and will help facilitate the rapid administration of  a debtor's assets in an orderly fashion that maximizes value and  minimizes disruption to the financial marketplace.   Accordingly, I support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I am pleased to note that H.R. 1667 is the product, indeed, of a very  collaborative, inclusive, and deliberative process, which should be the  norm, not the exception, when it comes to drafting legislation. It  reflects thoughtful suggestions offered by Federal regulators and the  Federal judiciary as well as leading bankruptcy practitioners and  academics.   I support H.R. 1667, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our Nation's  dedicated diplomats, the hardworking men and women at the State  Department and USAID who are heroically serving our country here and  around the world.   In his very first budget, President Trump has proposed draconian cuts  to these agencies. These reductions threaten not only our leadership in  the world, but they put our Nation's people and interests at  unnecessary risk.   Our global leadership depends on balanced investment in three areas:  defense, diplomacy, and development. Undermining any one of these  pillars weakens all of them.   The State Department and USAID's effectiveness and success is not a  function of equipment or technology. Rather, it is the experience,  capabilities, and strategic deployment of our people.   In a world where our challenges are, every day, more numerous and  more complex, we are constantly sending our diplomats to places further  afield. They are deserving of our full support and our utmost respect  for their bravery, dedication, and service in defense of the United  States and our values.   I call on my colleagues to join me in protecting our strategically  important investments in diplomats, diplomacy, and development, as well  as defense.                            ____________________
