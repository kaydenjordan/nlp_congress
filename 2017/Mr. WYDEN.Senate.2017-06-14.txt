 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have some remarks to make with respect to  healthcare that I will offer in a moment.   First, I want to address the events of this morning. The shooting  that took place in Alexandria today was a horrendous, despicable act of  violence. The victims--including Congressman Scalise, two Capitol  police officers, and two others--are still undergoing treatment. There  is much that is still not known about what happened.   There are a few things that are known. First, it is thanks to the  extraordinary heroics of the Capitol Police and first responders on the  scene that this shooting did not become a massacre. Each and every one  of us who comes to work in these buildings every day is profoundly  grateful for our Capitol Police, our first responders, and the  incredible service and protection they provide.   Second, I think all of us know that this violence has visited too  many of our communities. It has cost and ruined too many lives.   Finally, we know that the game our colleagues were practicing for--a  charity game between rival parties that is held to benefit  disadvantaged kids--is going to go on as planned. The game is  [[Page S3477]]  a show of friendship. It is a show of bipartisanship. It is an  indication that, as there are strong differences of opinion on the  policies that we debate on the floor of the Senate, we still come  together at urgent times like this. The game, which shows our  commitment to friendship and bipartisanship, has never been needed more  than it will be tomorrow.   Our thoughts are now with those who are injured. It seems that  everyone you run into at the Capitol has said they are praying and they  are rooting for a full and speedy recovery. It is one of those moments  when people understand that there is legislation here--their bills,  their amendments. Sometimes there is a lot of process--an amendment to  the amendment to the amendment, as my wife calls it. Then there are  other times like this morning, which are life and death.   As we reflect on those who did so much to keep it from being even  worse--a massacre--we have our prayers for those who are injured. Once  again, it puts into perspective what is so very important.                            Healthcare Legislation    Mr. President, to the topic at hand, there have, obviously, been  dramatic headlines in the news pertaining to ties of the President with  Russia. I want to be sure that what is happening here in the Senate  with respect to healthcare doesn't get drowned out.   The fact is that here in the Senate, behind closed doors, 13  Senators--all from the same party, all of them men--are updating the  Republican healthcare plan. The House passed its TrumpCare bill by the  slimmest of margins just a few weeks ago.   The public has seen it, and, based on everything I can tell, it has  gone over about as well as a prolonged root canal surgery. I have heard  about every imaginable concern about that House bill from Oregonians. I  have had 46 townhall meetings thus far this year, including 4 over this  past weekend.   When the bill came to the Senate, my colleagues on the other side got  out in the press, tamped down expectations, and claimed that everything  would be starting over. They are starting from scratch. Now the public  knows, because it is what Members of the majority party have said, that  the Senate version isn't going to be all that different from what  barely made it from the House this spring.   When the bill is finalized, we know it is going to be rushed to the  floor, and it will not be long before debate is cut off and final votes  are cast. It is a plan that relies on speed, forcing a devastating blow  to American healthcare through the Senate before our citizens can  actually catch on to what is happening.   This political process on this bill makes what the House has been up  to look positively transparent. The basic framework of the Republican  healthcare plan isn't going to change. Millions and millions of  Americans will lose their health coverage. It is not my view. It is the  view of the independent Congressional Budget Office. Costs are going to  go up, especially for those who are elderly and sicker, and those who  are the fortunate few are going to get an enormous tax break.   The basic framework isn't changing, and what that means is that the  social safety net--led by Medicaid, which is a lifeline for kids and  seniors and the disabled--is going to be under attack. The public  health system in America has stood on two twin pillars since 1965.  Those pillars are Medicare and Medicaid. The Republican majority has a  plan to knock one of them out beginning this year.   Today, Medicaid comes with a guarantee that if you are sick, if you  are injured or if you spend every day walking an economic tightrope,  you are going to be able to get care when you need it. You will not be  denied benefits. But TrumpCare ends that guarantee.   The plan Republicans have on offer would dismantle Medicaid as it is  known today, putting hard dollar limits on the program. That puts caps  on care. That is what it means--that there will be caps on care. It is  a scheme that puts Medicaid in a vise, squeezing its funding year after  year fix. The plan makes budget targets a bigger priority than real- world healthcare needs for some of the most vulnerable people in our  country.   Seventy-four million Americans have health coverage through Medicaid.  That includes 37 million children. It provides comprehensive care to  millions of pregnant women. It is a leader in the fight against the  opioid epidemic, and there is treatment for those who are dealing with  mental health and substance abuse disorders.   Medicaid is a lifeline when it comes to helping kids and adults with  disabilities. Then there is the nursing home benefit, something I know  from my years as codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers. This is a  benefit that is a bedrock protection, built into Medicaid to help pick  up the tab for two out of three nursing home beds in America. If you  roll that benefit back, I don't see how seniors across this country are  going to avoid living in squalor. Maybe their kids can take them in,  but the kids of the parents I am talking about have told me they are  working on an economic tightrope, trying to balance food against the  fuel cost, the fuel cost against the rent cost.    So my guess is, if you squeeze the Medicaid Program tighter and  tighter and States are forced to cut benefits and access to care, as  will be inevitable under TrumpCare, I just don't see where you can  ensure that seniors in nursing homes are going to be protected.   My own view--and this goes back to the days when I worked with  seniors--the challenges with older people have evolved over the years.  Back then, you had Part A. That was hospitals. Part B was doctors. That  is not Medicare any more. Today, more than 90 percent of the spending  deals with chronic illness--cancer, diabetes, heart disease, strokes.  It is a very different program, but we are still going to need nursing  home care for so many of our older people who have done everything  right in life. They are our mothers, our fathers, our grandparents, our  friends. They fought our wars. They started families. They built  careers. They raised kids. They scrimped. They saved. They never went  on that special vacation. They never bought the boat they would have  loved to have, and they did it because they always wanted to pay for  essentials and see if maybe they could set aside what they could for  schooling for their kids and retirement for themselves.   But, as I have said, what I have seen over the years since those Gray  Panther days is that growing old in America just keeps getting more  expensive for so many older people. The bills don't stop coming when  you retire. And most older people still live on a limited, fixed  income. I saw that with my full-time work at the legal aid office for  older people and the Gray Panthers, and I saw those seniors having to  stretch every last penny, and even then, it was a struggle to cover the  basics. So what happens--and I am afraid we are going to see a lot more  of it--is seniors eventually spend down their savings. When they face  challenges, they spend down their funds.   Today, when it comes time to pay for long-term care like nursing  homes and home-based care, Medicaid steps up. It is the backstop, a  guaranteed backstop to protect our senior citizens. I don't want to  undersell how much that means to people in my State and across the  land. Medicaid is the barrier that keeps millions of seniors from  falling into isolation and utter destitution.   There was a time in our country when seniors were cast aside. They  were sent to poor farms, what were called almshouses. The wealthiest  Nation on Earth said goodbye to those poor farms with the creation of  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Under the Republican  healthcare plan, unfortunately, Medicaid would be slashed so deeply,  States are going to be forced into cutting benefits. Seniors could be  nickel-and-dimed for basic everyday services. Nursing homes could be  shuttered. Home-based care that allows seniors to live independently  could be no more. I think you are going to have lots of seniors living  in squalor, and some could be out on the street.   So in my view, the people of our country are owed answers to key  questions about this Republican plan.   First, how are families supposed to support their loved ones if they  lose the guarantee of Medicaid?   One year in a nursing home costs more than $90,000 on average. That  is two or three times the cost of a year of college tuition. Are  families going to be forced into choosing between educating their kids  and supporting their  [[Page S3478]]  elderly parents? Is it going to be a fact of life for working Americans  that they have to cram two or three or four generations of one family  into the same house simply because they can't afford nursing home care?   Second, what is the backup plan for vulnerable, isolated seniors,  particularly those who live in rural areas?   I recently held a series of eight healthcare roundtables in rural  communities across Oregon just over the last few days, in Pendleton and  Condon. The message I heard from healthcare providers again this past  weekend throughout rural Oregon was that TrumpCare cuts could hit  seniors in rural America especially hard.   Seniors in rural communities have higher rates of chronic illness,  like heart disease and diabetes. The healthcare they need requires more  attention and more services. They count on getting top-notch care in  nursing homes and from home-based providers. Losing these benefits  could mean being alone in a home that is unsafe, cut off from the care  and the connections they need.   Colleagues, in the last few weeks of this debate, I heard Members  flatly deny that gutting Medicaid by more than $800 billion will mean  anybody loses access to healthcare services. That is just untrue.  Anybody who says that they can slash our healthcare programs by close  to $1 trillion without having a negative impact on access to healthcare  services is just plain wrong.   Furthermore, I think it is time to recognize what the end goal of  this debate appears to be. My Republican colleagues haven't put forward  a proposal to protect seniors who can't get the Medicaid nursing home  care they need or kids with disabilities who lose the services they  depend on. What Republicans have on offer is not a plan that swaps one  vision of healthcare for another.   These massive cuts to Medicaid and other health programs are going to  pay for equally massive tax breaks for the fortunate few. Members of  this body are going to have to decide whether it is worth gutting  Medicaid and endangering essential care, like nursing home care and  important home-based services, to pay for these big tax breaks for the  fortunate. In my view, it should be an easy choice.   My colleagues on the other side ought to drop this partisan  approach--what is called reconciliation--that it seems the Senate is  headed toward. At a minimum, the majority party ought to bring this  process out from behind closed doors and give it a little bit of  sunlight. There ought to be hearings convened in the Finance Committee  and the other committees of jurisdiction, as there were again and again  in 2008 and 2009.   When you are talking about one-sixth of the American economy and what  is the premier issue and always will be, which is people and their  loved ones having their health, I don't see how you make an argument  for not having a debate out in the open. There has to be a public  debate. The legislation ought to be written in the light of day, and  then our people ought to have ample time to review it before it goes up  for a single vote, either in committee or here on the floor.   I am going to close with something that I think about especially  today--the big challenges of our time. You have to deal with them in a  bipartisan fashion in order to, one, get them right, and two, make them  sustainable. The Presiding Officer of the Senate knows this. He and I  spent many months working on key economic issues and recently put  together a bipartisan bill on infrastructure. Healthcare is  particularly important because when you are talking about providing  care for over 300 million Americans, you have to really think through  what the consequences are. Often, when you take a step over here, it  ripples over there. That is why it seems to me that it is so important  that the Republican majority set aside this partisan ``our way or the  highway'' approach and get back to working together to find common  ground.   I had a piece of legislation when we were debating healthcare in 2008  and 2009--eight Democratic Senators and eight Republican Senators. That  was the first time in the history of this body that we had that. There  are Republicans and Democrats who continue to serve in this body who  are cosponsors of that legislation. It is called the Healthy Americans  Act.   We got some of what we thought was important into the Affordable Care  Act--in particular, a provision that I think the American people really  want to think about in the days ahead, and that is, in our bill with  the 16 Senators, we had airtight, loophole-free protection for those  with preexisting conditions. There wasn't any way to hit them with  extra costs or discriminate against them because they had a preexisting  condition. We said that we wouldn't stand for that because if you allow  discrimination against those with preexisting conditions, you take  America back to the days when healthcare was for the healthy and  wealthy. If you are healthy, you don't have a preexisting condition,  and if you are wealthy, you can pay for care. We can't go back there.  But the House bill basically allows States to get waivers so they can  start unraveling that and punch big holes into that guarantee of  airtight protection for those with preexisting conditions.   If the majority will set aside this partisan-only, ``we are doing it  our way'' kind of approach, what you heard from colleagues on my side  is that there is very significant interest in working together to deal  with the key challenges. One of them, obviously, is more competition in  the insurance markets, particularly as it relates to individual  insurance. You do that, and you will take the insurers off this roller  coaster so they have some certainty and predictability. You can  stabilize the private insurance market.   We ought to work together on bringing down prescription drug prices.  Our people tell us every time we are home that these prescription drug  price increases are hitting them like a wrecking ball. I have  introduced approaches that I think can get bipartisan support, and  there are others who have as well. But that is how to do it right. That  is how you find common ground: You take time to take each other's good  ideas.    Bipartisanship isn't about taking each other's lousy ideas.  Bipartisanship is about taking each other's good ideas, and there are  good ideas on both sides of the aisle to stabilize the private  insurance market, to hold down prescription drug prices. But this idea  of reconciliation, where we are all just going to do it our way--that  is the Republican approach, the partisan approach, and featured in that  approach are devastating cuts to Medicaid. That is a nonstarter.   So I come to the floor this afternoon, particularly given years of  interest in trying to find bipartisan common ground on healthcare, to  urge my colleagues to abandon this approach that is being pursued  behind closed doors, that nobody knows anything about, and that really  seems unprecedented in terms of dealing with one-sixth of the economy.  I urge my colleagues to abandon the partisan approach of reconciliation  and work with colleagues on this side on a bipartisan basis.   I will close simply by way of saying that I wanted to come to the  floor today, and I will try to be back tomorrow to outline other  challenges ahead in healthcare. I urge the American people across this  country, in every corner of our Nation, to make their voices heard.   I yield the floor.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
