 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Anthony  Cazillo, III, who passed away last month at the young age of 26 years  old.   Anthony made an exceptional impact in his short life in the lives  that he touched and in the community that he lived. He served as a  township supervisor in Pequea Township, Lancaster County, and he was  running for reelection this year.   To serve in elected office at such a young age speaks to the life of  service that Anthony lived and the passion that he had for improving  his community. One of Anthony's goals as a supervisor was to ``make  Pequea Township boring again.'' This is just one example of his wit,  his sense of humor, and I believe indicative of the servant's spirit  that he carried as a local elected official.   Anthony was a graduate of Millersville University and the Penn Manor  School District. He is survived by his wife, Katelyn; his parents; and  his sisters.   My condolences and prayers of comfort are with the Cazillo family,  his friends, and all those who grieve for Anthony.   I was really thankful to have gotten to know him in recent years. We  certainly wished that Anthony could have been with all of us longer,  but we do give thanks for the time spent with him.                           Utz's 100th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an iconic business  and household brand name from Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional  District.   Utz Brands of Hanover--the ``Snack Food Capital of the World''--is  celebrating its 100th year in business and now has the fifth generation  of family members as part of the company.   Founded as Hanover Home Brand Potato Chips by Bill and Salie Utz in  1921 with just $300, the company used hand-operated equipment to  produce up to 50 pounds of potato chips per hour from their home.   Quickly outgrowing the volume they were able to produce from their  home, the company changed its name to Utz Potato Chip Company and  purchased land to build their first factory on Carlisle Street in  Hanover in 1947.   Fifty pounds of potato chips per hour in 1921 has grown to 5.5  million pounds of snacks produced each week. Utz Brand operates 15  factories in the United States, generating over $1 billion in sales  annually. The company's headquarters and six manufacturing facilities,  as well as 1,800 employees who staff those facilities, call  Pennsylvania's 11th District home.   Utz is certainly one of the key families and companies that have  earned Hanover the moniker of the ``Snack Food Capital of the World.''  They have made an extraordinary impact on the community that I  represent through their business and charitable efforts.   I want to congratulate them on this remarkable milestone of 100 years  in business and wish them continued success in the next century as  well.                          Eighteen Days for H.R. 18     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of life and our  Nation's unborn children.   For over 40 years, the Hyde amendment has kept taxpayer money from  funding abortions, and it is estimated to have saved at least 2.4  million lives.   Polling consistently shows that a majority of Americans oppose being  forced to pay for abortions with their tax money. This is something  that we all should be able to agree on. However, House Democrats  recently passed a spending bill for the Department of Health and Human  Services that, for the first time since 1976, does not include the Hyde  amendment.    H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, would make the  prohibition against Federal funding for abortions permanent and  government-wide.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18.   Life is a precious gift, and we must do all that we can to ensure  that we defend the unborn who have no voice to speak for themselves.
