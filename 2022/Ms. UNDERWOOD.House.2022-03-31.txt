 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the end of Women's  History Month and highlight the contributions of women in my community:   From education leaders like Joliet-native, Margaret Haley, a teacher  who led the Chicago's Teachers Federation to become the largest women's  union in the country by 1900; and   Katharine Lucinda Sharp of Elgin, a founder of the Illinois Library  Association who ran the Midwest's first library school;   To entertainers like Plainfield-native, Melissa McCarthy, whose  comedy has graced our screens for two decades; and   Businesswomen, like Mary Foot Seymour of Aurora, who founded the  Business Women's Journal, a publishing company led entirely by women.   These are just a few of the amazing women who have made a mark on my  Northern Illinois community and our country, and I am proud to honor  them.                            ____________________
