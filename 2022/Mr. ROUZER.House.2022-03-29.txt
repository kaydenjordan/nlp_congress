 Mr. Speaker, it is so fitting that today we are passing  the Coast Guard reauthorization bill, a very good bipartisan piece of  legislation, naming it in honor of our dear friend and colleague, Don  Young of Alaska, who did so much during his time here for the Coast  Guard.   A fixture in the House for 49 years, Don Young took care of the needs  of Alaskans like no other could. So it was a natural fit for him to  serve as chairman of both the Natural Resources Committee and the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee during his time here. His  accomplishments for Alaska and throughout the course of his life are  well known and numerous.   He was certainly a throw-back to the old days on Capitol Hill. He  fought hard for his constituents, for Alaska, for America. He had the  force of a lion, but great compassion. And, boy did he know how to live  life to the fullest. He was the perfect public servant for he had two  attributes one must have to survive and serve the public well: A tough  hide but a tender heart. That is the gentleman from Alaska that I got  to know. That is the man who, with his dear wife, Anne, by his side,  told me at my birthday party last month that he wanted to get the show  on the road, go up to the stage and sing happy birthday. I simply said,  ``Yes, sir,'' and what a memorable night he made it.                                time  1545    Sometimes words cannot properly describe a man, for the emotions that  stir the heart are so powerful, words cannot possibly reflect them.  That is how it feels for me, anyway.   But let it be said many times over: Don Young was a force, a legend  in his own time. And America is better and greater because of him.   Let's pass this Coast Guard reauthorization bill in honor of our  great friend, Don Young.
