 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for the  time.   Mr. Speaker, I think today we are at a really important moment in our  history. Obviously, we are all frustrated, myself included as an  appropriator. We have gone through this process. There was an effort to  bring bills up sooner. We all would have liked those to have come up  sooner, but playing games and dragging this out, and watching Members  drag the process out even further than it needs to be, is not helpful.   Ultimately, we need to get this passed. We need to get this over to  the Senate as quickly as possible because the American people want us  to get this done.   There are a lot of efforts that need to move forward. We obviously  need to continue the process of appropriating, and I think we have a  commitment now from leadership to keep us here over the next 2 weeks,  which I think is the right thing to do, so that we can finish the  appropriations bills.   We have done quite a bit, obviously. Moving the four bills off the  House floor is a huge step for us. We have two more to move out of  committee, and I think we will be moving that soon enough.   The reality is, we need to finish our work, and these 45 days will  give us the ability to do that. It makes a difference for the American  people and makes a difference for us here in Congress, and sadly, it is  something we need to do.   Ultimately, we have to vote here in a few minutes, and I ask that all  of my colleagues support the CR and get us through those 45 days so we  can finish our work.
