 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Prison to  Proprietorship for Formerly Incarcerated Act, legislation I was proud  to author with Representative Jeffries. I really appreciate his kind  words.   Some individuals who have paid their debt to society deserve a second  chance at success. This includes giving folks reentering the workforce  a shot at entrepreneurship and small business ownership. Included in  this legislation are counseling and training services for incarcerated  individuals who want to start their own small businesses.   I am a firm believer in giving folks an opportunity to succeed, and  this bill makes sure those who are joining society have the skills and  knowledge to do so.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members who feel the same to support  this important piece of legislation. I thank Representative Jeffries  for his efforts on this bill, as well as Ranking Member Chabot and  Chairwoman Velazquez. I hope I said her name correctly. I have been  working on it. I thank them all for their leadership on the Small  Business Committee in helping this bill come to the floor.   Madam Speaker, on a personal note, I always appreciate Chairwoman  Velazquez reaching across the aisle to me and for her friendship from  day one. I appreciate Ranking Member Chabot's mentorship and for always  having time for a wet-behind-the-ears freshman.
