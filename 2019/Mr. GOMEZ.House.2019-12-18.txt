 Mr. Speaker, we are here at this moment in our Nation's  history because the President abused the power of his office, bribed a  foreign government to intrude into our democracy, and engaged in an  unprecedented campaign of obstruction of Congress to cover it up.   Our credibility in the global community has been compromised. Our  character and motivations are questioned.   We know where the President's true loyalties lie: not with our  constituents, not with our allies, but with our adversaries and  himself.   Abraham Lincoln once said: ``Nearly all men can stand adversity, but  if you want to test a man's character, give him power.''   Donald Trump has failed this test, and now our test is whether we  will be  [[Page H12174]]  a check on that power. Therefore, we must hold anyone to account,  regardless of party or politics, who sets fire to the very institutions  that define our Nation and our values. With this in mind, I will vote  ``yes'' to impeach Donald J. Trump.
