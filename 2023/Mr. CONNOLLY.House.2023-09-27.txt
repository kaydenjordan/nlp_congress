 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment regarding  the Department of Defense workforce, which is particularly important as  we face a shutdown.   However, first, I need to address two of the biggest workforce  challenges facing the military, both wholly manufactured by my friends  on the other side of the aisle.   First and foremost, to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle,  do not shut down the Federal Government. Step up to the plate and  govern on a bipartisan basis. I know it is hard, but the country needs  you to set aside impeachment inquiries, ideological crusades, and  infighting to do your job.   Second, Senator Tommy Tuberville's holds on more than 300 military  promotions are a direct threat to our national security and undermine  the leadership of our military.   For the first time in the history of the Department of Defense, three  of the five military services were operating without Senate-confirmed  leaders. General and flag officers are being required to perform double  duty in acting roles. Military families are having their lives put on  hold.   How are we going to retain talented officers if their careers face a  graveyard in the U.S. Senate, buried under the desk of one Senator who  cannot name the three branches of government?   Senator Tuberville's holds, which would require more than 700 hours  of floor time in the Senate to overcome individually, are an outrageous  assault on our Nation's military at the altar of a far-right culture  war.                                time  1130    I call on my colleagues to join me in condemning this reckless  behavior. But I digress.   My amendment would prevent Congressional Republicans from further  compounding their attacks on the Department's workforce. The amendment  would prevent any cuts to the Department of Defense civilian workforce  that undermine our military and national security.   Please follow along closely.   Defense appropriations bills routinely include language that says:  None of the funds appropriated by this act may be used to reduce the  civilian workforce programmed full-time equivalent levels absent the  appropriate analysis of the impacts of those reductions.   This language has received broad bipartisan support. It was included  in the 2023 omnibus. It is in the current FY24 Department of Defense  Appropriations bill in the Senate, and it was adopted as part of other  past fiscal year Department of Defense appropriations bills in this  body and in the other.   This language is derived from section 129(a) of Title 10, General  Policy For Total Force Management, which states, ``The Secretary may  not reduce the civilian workforce programmed full-time equivalent  levels unless the Secretary conducts an appropriate analysis of the  impacts of such reductions on workload, military force structure,  lethality, readiness, operational effectiveness, stress on the military  force, and fully burdened costs.''   My amendment would restore that important language and legacy by  prohibiting dangerous civilian workforce cuts that do not prioritize  those enumerated priorities. It is helpful to understand the broader  context to appreciate why this is essential.   The underlying bill cuts the civilian workforce by $1.1 billion. The  Committee Report for the bill refers vaguely to robotic process  automation and artificial intelligence as ways to reduce the civilian  workforce. That is a low bar for due diligence.   Forgive me, but I prefer the previous standard Congress reiterated  and endorsed, which was to remind the Department that any such  reduction in the civilian workforce must first prioritize the  lethality, readiness, and operational effectiveness of the military.   My amendment would restore that consideration and that language.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from the American  Federation of Government Employees in support of my amendment.            American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                                 Washington, DC, September 21, 2023.        Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the American       Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (AFGE), which       represents over 750,000 federal and District of Columbia       employees, including 250,000 Defense Department civilian       employees, I write to provide AFGE's views on several       amendments that were made in order by the House Rules       Committee with respect to H.R. 4365, the Department of       Defense Appropriations Act, 2024, that the House is expected       to consider today.        Specifically, AFGE strongly urges you to oppose amendment       168 that will be offered by  [[Page H4606]]       Rep. Hageman (R-AZ), amendment 167 that will be offered by       Rep. Greene (R-GA), amendments 155 and 156 that will be       offered by Rep. Boebert (R-CO), amendment 161: that will be       offered by Rep. Fallon (R-TX), amendment 178 that will be       offered by Rep. Roy (R-TX), amendment 172 that will be       offered by Rep. Norman (R-SC), and amendments 176 and 184       that will be offered by Rep. Rosendale (R-MT) during floor       consideration of H.R. 4365, the Department of Defense       Appropriations Act, 2024.        Hageman amendment 168 would arbitrarily and without       justification prohibit regular telework and remote work for       Defense Department civilian employees and contractors.       Longstanding policy has, with considerable success, directed       DoD agency managers and personnel to collaboratively develop       and implement telework policies that address the specific       needs of agencies and further their missions. Importantly,       the workplace flexibility that telework enables has improved       DoD's capacity to maintain continuous operations in the event       of a natural or national security crisis. It has also helped       DoD agencies recruit and retain talent, be more productive,       and reduce traffic congestion and emissions. Not       insignificantly, remote work and telework are particularly       important for military spouses who are frequently deployed to       remote places with few job opportunities but can otherwise       contribute to the federal civilian workforce.        Greene amendment 167, Boebert amendments 155 and 156,       Fallon amendment 161, and Roy amendment 178 would invoke the       so-called Holman Rule to either reduce to $1.00 the annual       salaries of various DoD officials. These cynical amendments,       if enacted, would do great damage to the Department's ability       to maintain readiness and recruit and retain personnel who       reflect the diversity of America.        Rosendale amendments 176 and 184 would strip the Defense       Department of its authority to set policy as it pertains to       the prevention of COVID-19. These amendments are singularly       irresponsible and reckless. Enactment would risk the health       of tens of thousands of DoD military personnel and civilian       employees in the event of a future COVID-19 outbreak--all to       make a cynical political point. Senior Defense Department       officers and medical personnel are in a much better position       than Congress to determine appropriate measures to protect       the health of military personnel and civilian employees.        Norman amendment 172 would, if enacted, reverse important       strides the Defense Department--one of the least diverse       agencies in the federal government--has made in recent years       to recruit and retain the best and the brightest personnel       from all corners of America.        AFGE recommends that you support amendment 159 that will be       offered by Rep. Connolly (D-VA). This amendment would restore       important language included in previous Defense       Appropriations Acts prohibiting the Defense Department from       reducing its civilian workforce absent the appropriate       analysis of the effects of these reductions on workload,       military force structure, lethality, readiness, operational       effectiveness, stress on the military force, and fully       burdened costs. By omitting the provision that Rep.       Connolly's amendment proposes to restore, H.R. 4365, if       enacted, could lead to reckless cuts in the civilian       workforce that the armed services depend on to protect and       defend our nation.        Please vote against these amendments should recorded votes       be requested. For questions or more information please       contact Julie Tippens or Keith Abouchar.            Sincerely,                                                  Julie N. Tippens,                                  Director, Legislative Department.     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  distinguished gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
