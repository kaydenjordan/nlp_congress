 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of a resolution  promoting COVID-19 vaccine equity among communities of color.   Communities of color continue to be disproportionately impacted by  the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, highlighting longstanding health, social,  and economic inequities.   The resolution calls for the prioritization of areas with a high  Social Vulnerability Index, SVI, for COVID-19 vaccination efforts and  working with trusted community partners to implement culturally and  linguistically appropriate strategies, among other efforts.   The resolution is going to be introduced during this month of April,  during the National Minority Health Month to promote the health and  well-being of racial and ethnic minority communities and to underscore  the need for these communities to get vaccinated.   Vaccinate, vacunen. It is very important that they get vaccinated, es  muy importante que se vacunen.   Madam Speaker, vaccinate yourself. It is very important.   I am so proud to support this resolution.                            ____________________
