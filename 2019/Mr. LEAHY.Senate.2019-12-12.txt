 Mr. President, I recently had the pleasure of meeting with  my friend, former Vermont State Representative Kiah Morris, who among  many distinctions was only the second African-American woman ever  elected to the Vermont Legislature. Kiah's talents are far-reaching.  She has also been an actress of stage, film, and television, spoken  word performance, as a singer, dancer, and arts manager. Whether as a  legislator or on a theater stage, Kiah's work has focused on  amplification of the voices of oppressed people, on human rights, and  on social justice.   It was in keeping that Kiah recently traveled to El Salvador and  Honduras under the auspices of Oxfam America to meet with families  struggling with the violence, poverty, lack of opportunity, injustice,  and hopelessness that is causing thousands of destitute, frightened  people to abandon their homes to seek refuge elsewhere. In those  countries, Kiah saw where people had been gunned down, victims of gangs  or corrupt police. She listened to the stories of threats and  extortion, of kidnappings and deadly attacks, of fear and desperation.  Inspired by the people she met and outraged by the brutality they  described, she wrote a poem.   I ask unanimous consent that Kiah's poem, which captures the essence  of what the debate here over Central American refugees should be about,  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         I Saw the Places They Died                           (By Kiah Morris 2019)       I saw the places they died      I saw the places they died      I saw the blood on the wall as if it were fresh  [[Page S7024]]       I saw the bullet holes pierce their flesh      I saw the places where they died and their spirits left their             bodies onto a heavenly place      Far from a war-torn country of our design which orchestrated             their demise      On the darkened brick walls splashed with stucco      Metal bars on windows each home a fortress from the violence             that hovers in wait across the thresholds      Street vendors who compete for our Starbucks money to feed             their souls and nourish their dreams      I saw the places they died in the tears behind the eyes of a             priest who saw too much Mental memorials to the             expressions of horror and sadness on the face of a             mother who died trying to save their daughter's life             captured in the space between his eyes and the weight             of their loss      Their state-sanctioned murders designed to leave no witnesses             behind      Ordered bullets to fillet her face to ensure no viewer could             recognize their own mother's eyes in her frozen gaze      I saw the places where they died, where the children were not             spared      No life too precious to halt corruption and gang warfare      Daily genocides where there are no sacred spaces or             sanctuaries in which to hide      I saw the places that they died in the cobblestone streets      Where people are pawns in a corruptors endgame      The depth of the violence bears no shame      I saw the places where they died when I heard the women speak             of the terror that they face every day,      Every week      The normalcy of rape, the dignity decimated, the beatings             meant to break and the constant earthquakes that shake             the fragile state      I saw the places they died in the hopeful smiles of the proud             feminists who carry the burdens of their sisters as a             shield      To protect the dignity of their humanity which too often is             forced to yield      I saw the places they died, float off into still air      Laden with promises unfulfilled and hidden ambitions laid             bare      I craft petals with poem to form a bouquet dropped off in a             history of genocide      With the hope the path these roses display will propagate a             garden in honor of the many places they died.                            ____________________
