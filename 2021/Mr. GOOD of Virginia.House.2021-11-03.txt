 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3992, the more  appropriately named profiting off of older job applicants act.   This, like so many other Democrat proposals, is a trial lawyer payout  disguised as a win for older workers. Democrats are addicted to  inventing problems that fit their slanted narrative of American life.  To liberal Democrats, older workers are vulnerable employees who can't  cut it in the modern economy, and that could not be further from the  truth. In fact, employment for workers ages 65 and older tripled from  1988 to 2018, the last 30 years, while employment for younger workers  only grew by a third.   During that same time, the number of workers aged 75 and older nearly  quadrupled. Despite what Democrats may have you believe, there are  several existing laws already protecting Americans of all ages against  discrimination in the workplace.   One of those legal protections which today's bill would amend is the  Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967, or the ADEA. It  prohibits employment discrimination based on age for job applicants and  employees at least 40 years old and up, as it should. Discrimination is  wrong. It is immoral, and it must be vigilantly addressed.   But this bill radically expands the definition of discrimination  against  [[Page H6159]]  older job applicants by authorizing claims against a disparate impact  theory; again, what happens, not what is intended by the employers.  This needlessly interferes with employers' routine recruitment and  hiring practices.   The ADEA already prohibits discrimination against job applicants, but  the ADEA does not authorize disparate impact claims by job applicants.   Congress has long recognized that addressing different forms of  discrimination require different laws. For example, Congress did not  include age in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but passed a separate and  distinct law in 1967 prohibiting age discrimination; once again, the  ADEA.   Yet, H.R. 3992, this bill, abandons congressional precedence and  imprudently allows disparate impact claims by job applicants under the  ADEA. The most destructive impact of this bill would be the assault on  existing programs that employers are using all across the country which  creates job opportunities for workers, students, and prospective  employees.                                time  1645    Under this bill, routine recruiting efforts at high schools, Job  Corps centers, and colleges, including job fairs, would be legally  suspect because these students are typically younger, on average.   In addition, simply posting a job opening on a job search website  could land an employer in a world of trouble because users of those  websites tend to be younger.   Apprenticeship and internship programs would also be threatened  because the participants tend to be younger, and employers tend to hire  full-time employees from these programs.   These examples are not mere speculation. The AARP, one of the  Democrats' favorite big donors, has already backed class action  litigation challenging college recruitment as violating the ADEA.   If this bill is enacted into law, a tsunami of lawsuits attacking  these valuable and effective programs would follow, putting millions of  job opportunities in jeopardy and forcing employers into court to  defend them. But that is what our friends across the aisle seem to  want.   Endangering hiring practices, when there are over 10 million unfilled  jobs, flies in the face of common sense and good governance. Surely, my  Democrat colleagues know better.   They should also be aware of their own hypocrisy, as I can assure you  that every Member of Congress has recruited from colleges,  universities, or on job search sites to fill staff and intern  positions, the vast majority of which have been hires of younger age.   By failing to hold even a single hearing on this bill and refusing to  adopt any commonsense Republican amendments, Democrats exposed their  true intentions, to rush through yet another piece of misguided  legislation to appease the left.   Additionally, Democrats refused to allow floor debate on commonsense  amendments offered by Republicans to protect job opportunities for  workers and determine whether the bill is even necessary.   For example, Representative Miller-Meeks submitted an amendment to  make sure the bill does not prohibit an employer from recruiting or  interviewing students attending high schools, Job Corps centers,  colleges, or universities.   Representative Allen submitted an amendment to ensure the bill does  not prohibit employers from operating apprenticeship or internship  programs, and Representative Letlow submitted an amendment to protect  employers' ability to post job openings on job search websites.   If this were truly about crafting high-quality legislation that  protects older job applicants, then this bill's sponsors should have  been clamoring for a thorough and bipartisan analysis of this bill.   This legislation was first introduced in June of this year and  considered by the committee only a month later. Now, we are here  debating it on the floor without any meaningful review.   Because H.R. 3992 was rushed through the legislative process, we  cannot even begin to understand its sweeping and unintended  consequences. But what we do know about this bill should concern every  Member of this body.   The profiting off older job applicants act will jeopardize job  opportunities for millions of Americans, both young and old, and will  make the Democrats' trial lawyer friends yet richer, once again.   Congress and the Supreme Court have long recognized that different  forms of discrimination require different legal solutions. This bill  abandons that precedent and will not only set off a slew of legal  challenges, but it will also hamstring our job creators attempting to  rebuild during a once-in-a-century pandemic and inflation crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this misguided  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have been a recruiter for a for-profit corporation. I  did that for 15 years where I had the responsibility of recruiting on  college campuses and hiring and making those decisions for a company  for which I was depended on to find the absolute best workers, and that  was not during a time when we had 10 million open jobs in the country  and companies so desperate to find quality workers and fill those  positions. I did this for a company that was vulnerable to the very  consequences that we want to bring in greater capacity here today on  this House floor.   Once again, we have got House Democrats trying to solve a nonexistent  crisis instead of the many that they have created; massive spending,  rising crime, gas prices going through the roof, increased inflation  for groceries and other things, surging illegals across the border,  firing cops and nurses and first responders because they don't get a  vaccine that we are forcing upon them.   Instead of dealing with those, this majority is here focused instead  on yet another manufactured problem with yet another leftist solution  that has the added benefit from their perspective of paying off their  trial lawyer donors.   They miss the point about disparate impact. As an example, a job  recruiter goes to a college campus, spends several days recruiting,  happens to only have typical younger, college-age workers apply, hires  some of those workers, and now their trial lawyer friends would sue  them because they didn't hire any older workers when no older workers  applied because they used a typical standard practice for hiring entry- level workers. That is a real example.   They don't understand the difference between impact and treatment. We  already have laws prohibiting the practice of disparate treatment on  age discrimination basis.   This misnamed piece of legislation does nothing to truly protect  older job applicants. Again, older job applicants are already protected  by the law, and age discrimination is already illegal. Democrats just  want to raise the stakes for their lawyer friends, making it easier to  sue and the penalties more severe perhaps so that they can then donate  more to Democrat campaigns.   Democrats don't want to acknowledge that sound economic policy, if  they could recognize it, is what is good for older Americans; low  taxes, less regulation. That benefits older American job applicants  just like everybody else, not more regulation, penalization of  employees, and unnecessary victimization.   It has already been said, according to the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, these are the facts. Don't let the facts get involved with  bad legislation. I know, don't interfere. But the facts show, and I  would like my colleagues across the aisle to explain the problem with  the facts, that the number of workers age 75 and older in the workforce  has quadrupled in the last 30 years, rising from 461,000 in 1988 to 1.8  million in 2018.   But, again, this legislation is about trial lawyers, not older  Americans, and this bill would serve as yet another burden on small  business owners.   In the age of online job postings and digital recruiting, this  legislation would make employers vulnerable for any form of recruiting  that brings in younger applicants. Online job boards, social media,  even the simple act of posting a position online could be challenged  under this bill simply because younger applicants tend to apply through  those processes and search for jobs through those mechanisms.   The unintended--or, I suspect, the truly intended--consequence of  this bill would be countless class action lawsuits against employers  who are already struggling under Democrat efforts to cripple our  economy.   Democrats have spent 2 years closing businesses with lockdowns,  firing employees with their vaccine mandates, and paying more people to  stay home. Here's another way: Let them benefit from a trial lawyer who  sues on their behalf under this bill. Heck, even Members of this very  body are staying home rather than attending committee hearings or  voting in this Chamber. And now that America is trying to reopen in  spite of them, Democrats want to have their trial lawyer friends sue  more business employers and job creators.   What we do on this floor has consequences that reach into every  corner of this great Nation; a sad and dangerous reality under this  majority this year. But Democrats are relentless in their determination  to pass legislation with a compassionate title--it sounds good--for a  manufactured crisis and a policy that hurts small businesses and kills  jobs. It is what they do.   As I said before, the Democrat majority has unveiled contempt for  employers, businesses, and job creators, and they continue to  perpetuate this ``us against them'' mind set between employees and  employers or employers and job applicants. They truly believe that  employers are hostile to and exploitive of their employees, and they  need more regulation, again, when we have 10 million job openings and  employers desperate to fill those positions so they can stay open.   The socialist America that the left clearly wants is not the America  that our constituents and millions of Americans know and love; as the  results in Virginia and New Jersey clearly showed last night,  bipartisan results, because there are not that many Republicans in  Virginia or New Jersey to deliver those results.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time to close.   Discrimination is wrong, and it has been illegal in the United States  for decades, as it should be.   Older workers are faring well in the workforce without the help from  us in Congress, and they don't need a trial lawyer payoff--disguised as  a win for older workers--that will threaten routine hiring practices,  limit job opportunities, and create a tsunami of parasitic litigation.   We should ensure that our legislation does not have unintended  consequences that are negative and harmful, but H.R. 3992 fails  miserably in this regard when it comes to protecting older workers and  ensuring job opportunities for current and future workers.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3992, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, unfortunately this amendment is a  day late and a dollar short. It requires the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission to study the extent of discrimination against  job applicants based on age and make recommendations of best practices  to prevent discrimination. This study could possibly yield useful  information, but it is information we should have obtained before we  vote on H.R. 3992.   Further, the amendment tacitly acknowledges that we need more  information before we vote on this bill. This is classic ready, fire,  aim.   The Committee on Education and Labor rushed to mark up H.R. 3992 only  a month after it was introduced without holding a single hearing on the  bill, a measure which is sorely lacking the examination that it  deserves.   However, the information we do have more than suggests that this bill  is unnecessary. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act already  prohibits discrimination against job applicants because of age.  Moreover, older workers have done well in the job market in recent  decades. Again, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for  workers age 65 and older, employment tripled from 1988 to 2018, while  employment among younger workers only grew by about a third.   This amendment, which requires a study after the underlying bill has  already been signed into law, does nothing to address the problems in  the bill.   H.R. 3992 will threaten routine recruitment and hiring practices,  such as participating in college job fairs and posting to online job  boards, at a time when nearly 8 million Americans are unemployed and  employers are struggling to find workers to fill the more than 10  million available jobs.   I oppose this amendment, which is a day late and a dollar short, and  I strongly oppose the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Madam Speaker, last night was a great night for  America. As Virginians across the Commonwealth, in bipartisan fashion,  Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, rejected the radical, woke,  socialist education policies of this Biden administration and this  complicit Democrat majority in this Congress.   Most of our schools will be better off being governed by the first  seven ticked-off parents in line at the next school board meeting than  the woke leftist, progressive, liberal members of the typical American  school board.   The Federal Government should not be involved in education. There is  no constitutional basis for the Federal Government to be involved in  education to begin with. I love our friend,   Thomas Massie, our  colleague from Kentucky's bill that says--of which I am a cosponsor-- the Department of Education shall cease to exist on December 31 of  2022. How much better our schools, our children, our parents, and  families would be if that were the case.   We are seeing the silver lining from the past 2 years with the China  virus as the exposure has been there. What is being taught in the  schools? The strong disinfectant of sunlight, letting parents see what  their children are being taught as they supervise them learning from  home.   And, thankfully, thousands and thousands of parents showing up at  school board meetings to make their voices heard because they don't  want critical race theory and its ideology taught in our schools. It is  amazing how the Democrat majority and their allies, their friends in  the media say: That doesn't exist.   It may be true that there isn't a class taught in a typical American  high school that is called critical race theory, taught an hour a day  every day for 5 days a week. Of course, that is not true. That is not  typical. However, all throughout our country, critical race ideology,  this theory that tries to define who we are as Americans: it tries to  define Americans based on race; it tries to explain why we became a  Nation; it tries to explain why the American Revolution was fought; it  tries to identify who are victims and who are oppressors.   That ideology is absolutely included in training for teachers all  across this country. In fact, in just the last 2 weeks we have learned  that in two of Virginia's largest blue counties, Fairfax County and  Loudoun County, teachers are being trained with critical race ideology  to have that permeate all of their teaching through all of their  classes. It is the lens through which they are taught to present the  material to their students.   In Fairfax County, as a matter of fact, it was shown with a recent  article by the Washington Times, spent $5.5 million dollars in the past  year purchasing CRT-related curriculum and materials for their school  system. $2.5 million of which was for--guess whose son in-law's  company--the attorney general, Merrick Garland.   So you have parents rising up saying this is not what we want taught  in our schools. Not to mention, these radical transgender policies that  infringe upon the rights of the 99.9 percent of students who just want  to use the bathroom of their choice with people of their own biological  gender.   In Loudoun County, a county that has become notorious around the  country because of this, we have a county where they have a male  student who goes into the women's restroom and commits sexual assault.  It was not exposed as it should have been and dealt with as it should  have been. He transferred to another school where another assault takes  place.   After that occurs, the parent of the first student victim shows up at  a school board meeting, understandably upset, surprisingly restrained  from how upset a parent must be. What did we do? We arrest the parent  at the school board meeting.    After both of those assaults took place, that very school board  passes their official transgender policy allowing male students who  want to identify as female students to access those restrooms.   In addition, throughout the country, we are making children, who now  we want to vaccinate, they are almost no risk from the China virus, but  we are making these children wear masks all day long despite there  being almost no evidence that it makes any measurable difference for  anyone to wear a mask. To do that to children all day long in a school  is nothing short of child abuse.   For this and many other reasons, Virginians across the Commonwealth  rose up and said no to that and elected a Governor, a Lieutenant  Governor, an attorney general, and a new Virginia House of Delegates  that will say no to the radical views of the majority Democrat Party  today in Virginia, that is aligned with the radical views on education  and otherwise, here in this Chamber and in this town and in this  administration.   When I ran for office 2 years ago, I identified immigration, our  fiscal situation and our spending, and education as the three most  critical issues, the greatest threats to the future of our country. Our  children are our most precious resource and they are truly our future.  Our children's education is the one thing where those who hold all the  levers of power here in Washington and--at least until January--in my  home State of Virginia, they tell us: You must pay for it with  compulsory taxes, but you have no say in that product that you are  purchasing. In fact, the losing--thank God--the losing gubernatorial  candidate in Virginia  [[Page H6169]]  who was resoundingly rejected, who tried to nationalize the election by  bringing in all the heavy-hitters, the former President, the current  President, the current Vice President, the losing candidate said:  Parents, you got no say. It is none of your business. Give us your  money. We will teach your kids. We will decide what they learn. We will  decide the policies. If you show up to the school board systems, what  we will do is identify you as a domestic terrorist and we will sic the  FBI and the attorney general on you. Americans and Virginians said no.  They also said no in New Jersey. And they are going to say no  throughout this country next year.
