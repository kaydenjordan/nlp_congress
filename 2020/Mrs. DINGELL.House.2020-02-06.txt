 Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for all the hard work  he has been doing.   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 826 and in opposition to the  Trump administration's recent proposed cuts to Medicaid.   Medicaid provides important lifesaving care for our Nation's  children, seniors, and disabled, including in my home State of  Michigan. That is why political leaders, under the leadership of  Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, worked across the aisle to expand  Medicaid in Michigan in 2014.   This expansion, Healthy Michigan, currently covers over 650,000  Michiganders, providing them access to both quality and affordable  healthcare and protection from crippling medical bills.   It has also supported rural hospitals both in Michigan and across the  country. Without Healthy Michigan, hospitals across the State that  serve some of our most vulnerable residents would face closures and  terrible increased financial pressures.   Finally, Medicaid is the single largest payor of long-term care in  this country and allows our seniors the opportunity to live with  dignity as they age.   The Trump administration's recent actions puts this all at risk. Both  the 2017 healthcare proposal and the CMS proposal would block grant  Medicaid, drastically cutting the resources it provides for lifesaving  medical care.   We know what this means: increased healthcare costs for my  constituents and a loss of coverage for seniors, the disabled, and our  children, who are the overwhelming majority of Medicaid recipients.   This resolution sends a strong message: We will make good on our  commitment to provide quality and affordable healthcare to every  American, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
