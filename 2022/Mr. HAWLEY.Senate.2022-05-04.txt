 Madam President.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, I find  myself here on the floor again as my friend the Senator from Virginia,  whose sincerity and urgency on this issue I don't doubt for a second,  tries to move a whole slate of nominees to which multiple Republican  Senators have objections. And let me give you a sense of why.   One of the nominees that my friend is attempting to move here, let's  be clear, to do this without a vote--we could be voting on these  nominees. The majority leader could schedule votes on them any time,  but he hasn't done that. He hasn't done it in some of the cases for  months.   This is an act--this is a request to suspend the regular order of the  Senate and to confirm these nominees without a vote. Well, I, for one,  am not going to consent to confirming without a vote people like Ravi  Chaudhary. He is being nominated for Assistant Secretary of the Air  Force.   Mr. Chaudhary, who appeared before the Armed Services Committee, on  which I sit, as does my friend from Virginia--Mr. Chaudhary has  proposed using AI technology--artificial intelligence--to track members  of the military, identify them as extremists, and then have them  expelled.   He said:         The key to disrupting them--    Meaning ``extremists,'' his word, people whose views he doesn't agree  with.         The key to disrupting them is uncovering and understanding       their initial behaviors, elements that are contained in their       electronic footprints.    What Mr. Chaudhary has proposed to do is to use surveillance on  members of the U.S. military to determine whether they might, in the  future, commit acts that he might disapprove of and then to take action  against these members of the military.   In 2015, he wrote this: that the military exhibits a ``culture of  xenophobic cronyism.'' And he went on to say that there was a  ``xenophobic command climate'' in the U.S. military today.   I said to Mr. Chaudhary, at the time when we had our hearing, that I  cannot  [[Page S2311]]  believe that he would propose to use surveillance on members of the  U.S. military to track their speech, to track their activity online, to  track their movements online, all in an effort to decide if they might,  in the future, commit acts that he disagrees with.   I submit to you, Madam President, not only is that wrong; it is  blatantly unconstitutional--blatantly unconstitutional--and it is  frightening. What is further frightening is that he would be nominated  for a leadership position in the Department of Defense.   I call on the President of the United States to withdraw this  nomination today, just as he should withdraw his unconstitutional  disinformation board that he is attempting to force on the American  people as we speak. This is the most radically anti-free-speech  administration in American history. Their actions are an affront to the  basic constitutional values of this Nation, including and especially  the First Amendment.   I am appalled--appalled--at what this administration is doing-- censoring American citizens, surveilling them--and now advocating it in  the U.S. military, to the men and women who put their lives on the  line?   So, no, I will not consent to have this individual, who never should  have been nominated for this position, fast-tracked to be confirmed  without a vote, without a single, solitary vote on the floor of the  U.S. Senate.    I think you have the floor, Senator; so, yes, I think----    Can I respond to that?    On all eight of them, Senator?    To have a vote on the floor?    I would be happy to take a vote on the floor on all eight  nominations.    Is this a recorded vote on the floor, Senator?    Senator, you want to vote on all eight at one time; you  don't want to vote on each one?    What I propose to do here is--there are multiple Senators  on this side of the aisle besides myself who have objections to  different multiple of these. What I propose to do is object to this  now, but I think we can work something out on this going forward.   So I think--do I have the floor now?    OK. So I object.    Mr. President, had there been a recorded vote, I would  have voted no on the Motion to Instruct Conferees from Mr. Menendez  that moves that the managers on the part of the Senate at the  conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the Senate  amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be instructed to insist upon the  provisions contained in section 73003 of the Senate amendment (relating  to establishment of an Inspector General of the Office of the United  States Trade Representative).                            ____________________
