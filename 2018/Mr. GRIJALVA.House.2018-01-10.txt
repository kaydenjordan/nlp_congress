 Mr. Speaker, given that each day that Congress delays  action on the Dream Act, 122 people lose their DACA protected status-- since September 5, when Trump eliminated DACA, close to 16,000 young  people have lost their protected status and face daily risk of  deportation; given the fact that we have pleaded with Republican  leadership on the urgency of finding a permanent legislative solution  that will protect DREAMers; given the fact that the contradictions and  confusion in the negotiations going on to craft a legislative fix  continue to abound; and given the fact that this House has the  opportunity to vote on a clean Dream Act, we must act now on a  permanent solution that will protect DREAMers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to adjourn  offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).

Personal Explanation     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today, we are debating a bill package that follows a very familiar  playbook for House Republican leadership.   This bill package is just the latest attempt by my Republican  colleagues to push a highly partisan agenda by combining that divisive  proposal with noncontroversial items.   Today's bill includes two bills that passed Senate and House Natural  Resources Committee by unanimous consent.   One of these bills would make a technical correction to a previously  passed Tribal water settlement, and the other would clarify that two  pueblos in New Mexico should receive equal treatment when leasing their  lands.   Unfortunately, instead of quickly passing these bills and suspensions  and sending them to the President to be signed into law, House  Republican leadership has decided to take those two bills hostage and  combine them with a highly divisive bill that is likely not going  anywhere--H.R. 986, section 3 of this legislation--which I do not  support.   This political stunt seems doomed to fail. The only thing it will  accomplish is wasting everyone's time.   Meanwhile, a list of bills that are critical to Tribes across the  country sit in the Natural Resources Committee and are just ignored by  the majority.   For example, we could be moving legislation that would protect and  preserve Native American cultural artifacts, or legislation that would  address issues at Indian Health Service, or legislation to codify  meaningful and robust Tribal consultation process; or we could be here  today passing the bipartisan bill known as the ``clean'' Carcieri fix.   These bills deserve attention. They are promoted by not only Indian  Country, but many, many Members in a bipartisan fashion in this House.   I hope we can move past these petty political games soon, which  people are, rightfully, sick of having to see.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to change course  and stop blocking consensus bills from moving through this body by  conjoining them with divisive, contentious proposals.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Dakota (Mrs. Noem).
