 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to implore my colleagues to act  with haste on the critical energy crisis that is currently dragging  down the productivity of our economy and bleeding our workers bone dry.   My constituents are already weighed down by the heavy burden of taxes  and regulations and cannot afford to pay the rising energy prices that  currently hinder their ability to invest and rebuild in our local  economy in the wake of a global pandemic and the suffocating lockdowns  that have absolutely ravaged our communities.   They can no longer afford the inefficient and opaque decisionmaking  on our energy policy and strategic reserves by bureaucrats who don't  know what it means to be unable to fill up their gas tanks, balance a  monthly food budget, or sacrificing the miles they drive in search of  baby formula for their children.   On behalf of the constituents of New York's Third Congressional  District, I urge my colleagues to join me to aggressively demand  commonsense energy policies, to encourage due diligence and  transparency from the decisionmakers, and to shore up our strategic  reserves for the sake of our precious national security.                            ____________________
