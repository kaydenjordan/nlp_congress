 Madam Speaker, on February 27, 1933, the Reichstag,  Germany's capitol building, was set on fire. Who was responsible  remains in dispute even today.   But what is undisputed is that the Nazis, barely holding on to power  in a coalition government, used the attack to besmirch their political  opponents, consolidate their grip on the government, arrest hundreds of  political opponents, and, ultimately, rescind the due process rights  and fundamental freedoms of the German people. It remains a cautionary  tale, for obvious reasons.   The January 6 riot at the Capitol has become the centerpiece of the  Democrats' agenda. No other issue facing our country, not the worst  inflation in 40 years, not the highest gasoline prices in history, not  the fastest increase in homicides ever recorded, not the historically  unprecedented illegal mass migration across our southern border, none  of these crises has commanded prime-time congressional hearings from  the Democrats.   What happened here on January 6 was an affront to our Constitution  and a national disgrace. Those who entered the Capitol with the intent  to disrupt the counting of electoral votes deserved to be denounced by  their fellow citizens and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.   More importantly, questions involving the authority of Congress to  refuse to count electoral votes, or why adequate security was not  present to protect the Capitol, or whether there were conspiracies to  break into the Capitol are all important to resolve to ensure that this  never happens again.   What is unfolding, instead, is a sick mockery of the principles of  fairness and due process that this House is founded upon. It promises  to discredit those proceedings and to dishonor its participants.   Congress has a time-honored process to get at the truth. It  guarantees the right of both sides to appoint their representatives,  who then question and debate the facts, offer conflicting evidence, and  hold an issue to every light.   For the first time in the history of this institution, the Speaker  arrogated to herself not only the selection of the majority members but  the minority members as well, thus assuring only one side, her side,  could be heard.   Without having both sides represented, it becomes impossible to test  the accuracy of facts, the truth of the narratives, and the soundness  of opinions. It robs the process of the credibility that is a necessary  prerequisite to legitimacy.   Instead of the sober inquiry that should have been undertaken a year  and a half ago, we have a Soviet-style show trial, all carefully  choreographed by an ABC television producer.   To add hypocrisy to outrage, some of the Speaker's representatives  played a crucial role in developing and fanning the Russia collusion  hoax that groundlessly challenged the legitimacy of the Trump election  and Presidency. Some were themselves involved in challenging electoral  votes counted after the 2016 election. Some were apologists for the  violent riots that consumed this country in 2020. Some have been eerily  silent as Supreme Court Justices have been intimidated in their own  homes.   Now, the FBI thoroughly examined the riot last year. They found no  evidence that President Trump conspired with protesters to enter the  Capitol, nor have the Democrats offered any now. They instead repackage  and rehash the snap impeachment trial in which the President was  acquitted by the Senate.   Indeed, this committee knows but has deceptively suppressed the  stunning fact that 4 days before the riot, President Trump offered the  use of National Guard troops to keep the peace. The Democrat leadership  turned it down.   Do they really expect us to believe that the same guy who  meticulously planned the riot also authorized the National Guard to  prevent the riot? This is insane.   Insurrection? The constitutional process immediately resumed once  these yahoos were kicked out of this building. Do the Democrats  actually expect us to believe that some lunatic wearing buffalo horns  was moments away from seizing control of our government?   The narrative cannot survive in open debate, and the Democrats know  it. That is why they are not permitting one.   Our institutions are strong because they are backed by the common  sense of the American people. Our traditions of due process and  fairness are too deeply ingrained in the American character to succumb  to this madness.   After Americans have reported their verdict in the upcoming election,  perhaps we can forge a bipartisan consensus on the measures necessary  to assure that the excesses of both January 6 and the January 6th  Committee never threaten us again.                            ____________________
