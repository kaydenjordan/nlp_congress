 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 2020 has been a difficult year for so many.  We have lost far too many mothers and fathers, sons and daughters,  sisters and brothers, neighbors and friends.   My own heart and the hearts of many in Delaware grew heavier this  week as we said goodbye in Delaware to a whole series of friends, folks  who had long been champions of our community, folks who were exactly  the sort of people who helped build and sustain community.   I am grateful for the privilege of the floor to speak for a few  minutes about the legacy of these lions of Delaware, these folks who  were giants of service and who gave their hearts to us.   On Monday, we said goodbye to Elaine and Wayne Manlove, who were  loved by so many, and I rise first to pay tribute to them--some of the  most special people I have ever known.   They were killed in a tragic accident literally the day before last  Tuesday's election. On that day, we lost two of Delaware's greatest  diamonds, Mary ``Elaine'' Manlove and Lambert ``Wayne'' Manlove from  Hockessin and Ocean View. It was always striking they went not by their  first names but by their middle names. They were known as Elaine and  Wayne Manlove. These are proud patriots, people dedicated to our State  and community who spent decades giving to others.   Elaine I knew best in her role as State elections commissioner and as  someone who fought hard here for funding for election security and  election systems. The very last time I saw her, she was proudly showing  off the brandnew statewide election system in Delaware. She didn't,  tragically, get to see the fruits of her labor--the deployment of these  new, state-of-the-art digital voting machines. Her many professional  achievements in that role: increasing our voter rolls, modernizing  machines, bringing elections to the classrooms, carrying off just this  last Tuesday a near flawless statewide election. While impressive, it  was just a very small part of who Elaine was.   Deeply proud of her Irish heritage, known for her kindness and her  generosity, her Irish Catholic faith that she and Wayne shared was a  foundation for them and for their family and their lives.   St. Patrick's Day in Wilmington was often the highlight. Elaine was  one of the folks who helped organize the annual St. Patrick's Day mass  and breakfast--a breakfast that raised money for the St. Patrick Center  that serves some of the neediest and most marginalized in Wilmington  but a breakfast that was a celebration of the intersection of faith,  politics, service, hope, and community.   My own wife Annie worked with Elaine for years in New Castle County  government long before her time as the State elections commissioner,  and they remained close for years afterward. Annie knew her as the best  mom and grandmother and friend to so many people.   Margaret Aitkin, one of Elaine's closest friends, who also served  with her and my wife in county government, said:         Elaine never sought the spotlight, and she never tried to       be the center of attention--she was like a warm fire that you       just gravitated towards. She wasn't the life of the party;       she was the reason for the party.    Elaine had a special and giving spirit that had a lasting and  transformative  [[Page S6638]]  difference on thousands of Delawareans, from Kirkwood Soccer, to the  county, to her work for elections, to her deep commitment to her faith,  her family, and her community.   Wayne, her husband of 51 years, was a union electrician, a proud  member of IBEW Local 313 for 53 years. Wayne loved hosting neighborhood  dinners, annual crab feasts, watching his beloved Eagles with family  and friends, and confounding his son because he could never get his  players straight. He loved sharing the Eagles with all three of his  sons.   For Wayne and Elaine, their sons, Matthew, Joe, and Michael, were the  beginning, middle, and end. The Sun rose and set on their boys. They  took huge delight in sharing stories about them with everyone who would  sit still and listen. They did everything it took to put them through  college and through parochial education. They sacrificed hugely for  their children, and it made a lasting difference in their lives.   Once Elaine and Wayne were your friends, they were always your  friends. They brought together people from grade school, high school,  from work, and from all different walks of life. They were strongly  rooted in and connected to St. Elizabeth's parish, where Elaine was  baptized, where they were married, and where they just last year  renewed their vows for their 50th wedding anniversary. On Monday,  hundreds of us gathered to wish them farewell.   So my condolences, my deep and heartfelt condolences go out to  Matthew and Meghan, to Joe, to Michael and Mary, to Elaine's brother  Grant and wife Ruth, and their four grandchildren who gave them such  joy: Catherine, Elizabeth, Margaret, and Finn.   I am turning now to consider another Delawarean and friend, someone I  knew for decades who exemplified character, bravery, and  integrity. Mike Rush--Edward Michael Rush, Jr., who passed away late  last month in Bear, was someone who always rose to the tasks and  challenges at hand--a Marine Corps veteran, a small business owner, a  firefighter, a member of the American Legion, a stalwart of his parish,  and a great friend.    He was a proud graduate of Salesianum High School and Goldey-Beacom  College and a proprietor and leader of a family-owned business, Rush  Uniform. He started working there in 1963, and he helped build and lead  his family-owned business for decades.   I first really got to know Mike through the Better Business Bureau,  where he and his family sponsored an award for ethical behavior by a  family-owned business. He sponsored the Edward M. Rush, Sr. Memorial  Award.   Mike was also someone whose whole heart was in the fire service. The  volunteer fire service in Delaware is one of the backbones of  communities up and down our State, and he was a life member of two  volunteer fire companies. He was 50 years with Wilmington Manor, 33  years with Christiana, president of the New Castle County Volunteer  Fire Chiefs Association, president of the Delaware Valley Fire Chief's  Association, and then, ultimately, while I was county executive,  president of the Delaware State Fire Chiefs Association.   Mike was also someone who did the hard work of being a fire school  instructor for our State for 30 years. Mike did so much for so many  others through his parish, through his fire company, through his  training service, and through his service to our Nation in the  military. He has earned accolades for his decades of bravery and his  commitment to our community.   But more than anything, because I was not able to make it to his  service, I wanted to share my condolences and the gratitude of our  State and Nation for Mike's wife of 45 years, Winnie; his sisters  Barbara and Catherine; his children Megan and Barbara; and his beloved  grandson Seamus.   Let me now turn to another anchor of another community in our State  and offer greetings and condolences to the family and the beloved of  Pastor Lottie Lee-Davis. She was an ordained minister from the east  side of Wilmington and a hallmark of resiliency and faith. She was a  preacher's daughter, a voice for the voiceless, and a beacon of hope  for many.   A friend, Alethea Smith-Tucker, told our Delaware News Journal that  it was unending how many people Pastor Davis had touched and encouraged  without judgment and without regard. She was the devoted pastor at Be  Ready Jesus is Coming Church. She answered the call to serve beyond the  confines of the pulpit. She provided housing for single mothers and  their children. She led efforts to renovate parks for the community,  and she recently garnered funding to build a mixed-use property just a  block from her church to provide housing for those in need.   Sadly, that which she launched, she will not get to see come to  fruition in this life, but I am confident that Pastor Davis will  continue to inspire and engage and move the community of Wilmington,  the congregation she helped lead, and the families who will benefit for  years to come from her vision and her leadership of this project she  just launched. Her legacy will continue to live through her work.   I wanted to give my condolences to her husband Flalandas; to her  daughter Amira; and to members of the congregation, family, and  friends.   Last, but certainly not least, this past week we lost someone beloved  to me and to so many in the Hockessin community, Gloria Ignudo Corrozi.  Gloria was a mainstay of one of the landmark couples of our State for  decades.   Gloria spent 30 years working at DuPont, and like so many of her  generation who had a successful career at DuPont, she also was engaged  in lots and lots of other community activities, engagements, and  services. She spent a lot of her life also helping the Delaware Chapter  of the American Diabetes Association. She served as cochair and raised  tens of thousands of dollars year after year after year for this  important cause.   But, frankly, her great joy was her family. Her beloved husband of 55  years, Philip Corrozi, was someone who was an incredible mentor and  friend to me at work, at home, and in public service. Phil was an  elected Republican, chairman of the Budget Committee, leader in our  State general assembly, and someone who, with Gloria's tireless  affection and support, crafted lasting solutions for our State.   Gloria was a blessing to an incredible network of friends and family,  nieces and nephews, all of whom knew her as Aunt Gloria. I had the  opportunity to get to know her best in the decade I spent working with  Phil at a global manufacturing firm in Delaware. But Phil Corrozi,  frankly, was someone who, when he gave his heart to a cause, Gloria was  right alongside him and often pushing him. For a woman who never had  children of her own, Gloria had so many people who knew her and thought  of her as a second mother.   My heart goes out to Gloria's family and friends who, today, gathered  at St. Anthony of Padua Church in Wilmington to say their final  goodbyes to this gracious, kind, funny, giving, loving, powerful woman,  whose witness was an important influence on my life, as well as so many  others.   These are just some of the individuals our community has lost this  year. Delaware is a State of neighbors, and we all feel these losses  profoundly.   There was a strong, common thread amongst those I have just honored  and those who have been a gift to our State. I want to return to a  powerful message that Joe, Wayne and Elaine Manlove's son, gave in a  eulogy just Monday at St. Elizabeth Church. It was funny; it was  memorable; it was wide-ranging; it was personal; and it was touching.  But at the conclusion, Joe said this. While today is sad and painful  and so unexpected for all of us, I want to leave you with this thought:  When you leave here today thinking of my parents and feeling the void  in your life, do the following--join a civic committee, help organize  your kids' Little League, volunteer for something you care about, help  a neighbor with a home project, and when some email comes out saying  ``We need people to help,'' respond that you are in. Do all of it  without a thought of compensation. Do it because it is the right thing  to do. Do it because you want to improve the world around you. Do it  because there is nothing more powerful than the heart of a volunteer.   That was them, Wayne and Elaine, but that was also Mike and Lottie  and Gloria and so many other friends and neighbors who helped weave  together  [[Page S6639]]  across different backgrounds, different political parties, and  different places of origin and different communities--they weaved  together a State of neighbors and left a lasting legacy. That legacy is  that we love one another as we have been called to do. May we continue  to be grateful for their legacies of service and live lives that would  make them and their families proud.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
