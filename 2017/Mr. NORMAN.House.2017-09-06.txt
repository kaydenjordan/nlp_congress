 Mr. Chairman, thank you for your work on this bill which  provides funding to critical programs within a difficult but fiscally  responsible allocation. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify on the  Record a question I have on funding for the National Emergency Grant  program.   The National Emergency Grant program provides critical job training  and reemployment funding for workers who have lost their jobs as a  result of plant closures or mass layoffs.   Does this bill fully fund the National Emergency Grant program?    I thank the chairman for his response and commitment to  the National Emergency Grant program. I have seen firsthand the  importance of this program in my district, including the recent layoffs  at the VC Summer power plant and throughout the country.  [[Page H6847]]                                     time  1815    Getting people who are laid off from their jobs back to work as  quickly as possible is critically important for affected communities  and for the economy. I fully support this program and this bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
