 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Alex Medina, a man who  demonstrates the spirit of giving that is a model for all of us.   Alex is a bone marrow donor, and thanks to his generosity, he was  able to provide Egerton Burroughs, a man whom he had never met, with a  second chance at life.   Mr. Speaker, donations like Alex's, whether they be bone marrow,  blood, or other precious resources, help save the lives of countless  Americans every day.   Mr. Medina and Mr. Burroughs were brought together by a wonderful  program, Be The Match, which matches viable bone marrow donors to  patients across the country.   We are blessed in North Carolina that both Duke University Hospital  and Wake Forest Baptist play pivotal roles in bone marrow and stem cell  transplants. Dedicated professionals there and at other institutions  perform lifesaving work.   Mr. Speaker, across North Carolina and our entire Nation, the  kindness and generosity of donors like Alex Medina should not only be  celebrated but also encouraged.   We can all play a positive role in the lives of others, and donating  blood and other critical resources is one way of doing so. The simple  actions we take can go on to make a profound impact upon people we know  as well as those we do not know.   Proverbs 11:25 reads: ``A generous person will prosper; whoever  refreshes others will be refreshed.''   Let us never forget how we can serve as forces for good and give to  others the gifts that God has bestowed upon us.                           Recognizing Bill Fisher     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Bill Fisher, a familiar  voice to many within the High Country in North Carolina's Fifth  District and someone I consider to be a dear friend.   After nearly 50 years of being on the radio and keeping the High  Country informed on all the news of the day, Bill, or Fish, as many of  his friends and colleagues refer to him, will be hanging up his headset  one final time and retiring.   For years, I have been fortunate to join Bill on the radio to talk  about issues ranging from the local to the national levels.   Mr. Speaker, one of the most important duties that we have as  Americans is to be an informed citizen, and I cannot overstate how much  Bill embodies that role. No matter the topic or issue of the day, Bill  always takes the time to inform people of the developments that matter  most. He knows how to read the pulse of the community he proudly  serves.    As Bill enters this new and exciting chapter of his life alongside  his wonderful wife, Sheryl, family members, friends, and loved ones, I  hope he knows that he has left an indelible mark upon his community  that will be felt for many years to come.   Those who tune in to Bill's show on the commute to work, the grocery  store, and everywhere in between are grateful for his work. In my eyes  and in the eyes of many, Bill is the best that western North Carolina  has to offer. May God continue to bless Bill and his family in his  well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise today to support the House Republican package to  alleviate rising healthcare costs for small businesses. I am proud that  the Committee on Education and the Workforce has taken a leading role  in this effort.   Healthcare cost is the number one issue facing small businesses  today. In fact, according to the NFIB, it has been their top issue for  over 30 straight years. Through the dot-com bubble, the Great  Recession, the COVID-19 pandemic, and record inflation, small  businesses have consistently identified healthcare costs as their  greatest concern.   House Republicans recognize that these small businesses are the  engines of the American economy, and this package is the first step  toward much-needed relief.   I will take a moment to discuss the two pieces of this package from  the jurisdiction of the Education and the Workforce Committee. First,  this package incorporates Representative Good's Self-Insurance  Protection Act. We passed the Self-Insurance Protection Act through  committee because small businesses are being squeezed. There is no  other way to put it.   On the one hand, premiums are skyrocketing, and it is costing small  businesses a fortune to cover their employees. Single-coverage premiums  cost about $8,000 per year now, and they are drastically outpacing  inflation. The bottom-up inflationary pressures have inevitably forced  small businesses out of the insurance marketplace, and more and more  are deciding to self-insure. Experts predicted this when the ACA  passed, and it has held true.   On the other hand, the government is coming from the top down and  telling small businesses they cannot access stop-loss insurance. Stop- loss insurance is a financial tool that self-insured businesses  typically buy to protect themselves from catastrophic costs, but the  government overreaches, overregulates, and denies many small businesses  this critical tool.   For example, in New York, insurers are expressly prohibited from  selling stop-loss insurance to employers with fewer than 100 employees.  The New York State Association of Health Underwriters wrote regarding  the law: ``Some groups have already lost their employer-provided health  coverage altogether and have had to go into the New York health  insurance marketplace exchange to obtain coverage, only to find that  their new coverage has higher copays, larger deductibles, greater total  out-of-pocket annual limits, narrower in-plan healthcare provider  networks, and fewer out-of-network medical specialists.''   Like in a pincer maneuver, the government is coming from both sides  and trapping small businesses in the middle with no options.   The Self-Insurance Protection Act is the solution. It provides a  lifeline to small businesses and hardworking Americans who are being  squeezed by the soaring cost of traditional health insurance. It would  stop Federal and State overregulation of stop-loss insurance, allowing  self-insured small businesses a way out of the government's two-sided  trap.   Next, this package also incorporates Representative Walberg's  Association Health Plans Act, which is perhaps the single best cost- saving tool at our disposal. The Association Health Plans Act would  offer immediate relief for everyday workers, taxpayers, and job  creators. I know this because it has been tested.    In 2019, before the courts stopped President Trump's association  health plan, AHP rule, America got a chance to see and feel the impact  of deregulation. AHPs produced savings of up to 29 percent on average.  At the upper limit, groups saved 50 percent with their newly formed  AHPs.   AHPs achieve these savings by allowing small businesses to band  together to increase their bargaining power when purchasing health  insurance. Currently, many regulations restrict small businesses and  individuals from doing so.   Enabling small economic actors to pool resources is critical to their  competitiveness in the market. In healthcare, big companies enjoy large  economies of scale, and only more so with each passing year.   Countless studies and evidence point toward this worrisome trend of  market consolidation. Three pharmacy benefit managers own 80 percent of  the market. Physician practices and hospitals are merging at a rapid  pace. Thankfully, hospital mergers have slowed during and after the  pandemic, but it is not enough. This bill helps mom-and-pop shops and  self-employed workers fight back.   I should also clarify that this bill does not turn healthcare into  the Wild West, like some Members claim. Important regulatory guidelines  exist to make sure enrollees would not be defrauded under AHPs.   For example, every AHP must have a board consisting of at least 75  percent employer membership. This ensures that AHPs are maintained in  good faith.   They are also required to abide by existing consumer protections,  such as prohibitions against discriminating  [[Page H3027]]  based on an individual's health status and prohibitions against using  preexisting conditions to deny coverage, increase premiums, or impose  waiting periods.   The benefits of the Association Health Plans Act can be summed up in  the words of Trump's DOL: ``AHPs are about more choice, more access,  and more coverage.'' I agree.   Let's help small businesses get the relief they need and working  Americans the coverage they deserve.   Madam Chair, I urge passage of this healthcare package, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, our colleagues are opposed to freedom in  choosing healthcare. They want everyone in government-controlled  healthcare and are quite willing to mislead the American people on what  these bills do.   Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Walberg), a member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good), who introduced this resolution, and is chair of  the Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen), a member of the Committee on Education and the  Workforce.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, my colleagues have explained that many things that our  colleagues across the aisle have said about these bills are not  accurate.   I am not going to say it again, but I think it is important that we  say that these bills are going to do good things for the American  people. It is going to provide choice and it is going to provide lower  costs.   I am certain of two things: one, healthcare costs present a  significant burden on small businesses; and, two, inaction is not going  to cut it.   This comprehensive small business healthcare package is a proven  first step on free market principles and reducing government  interference. By empowering small businesses with choice in  competition, we can lower healthcare costs and increase access to high- quality care.   I hope the other side of the aisle gives this legislation the serious  consideration it deserves. I often hear complaints that Republicans  don't have a plan to fix healthcare costs. Here it is.   Let's reduce healthcare costs together and pass this package.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I am pleased my Democratic colleagues are finally  expressing some concern for rising healthcare costs, particularly the  burden those costs can impose on our Nation's seniors.   I remind my Democrat colleagues that Medicare is expected to become  insolvent in 8 years. Increasing access to AHPs may be a lifesaving  option for these seniors if Congress does not address Medicare's  insolvency issues.   Unfortunately, for seniors, premiums of older Americans have risen  drastically thanks to ObamaCare. In fact, health plans in New York just  requested rate bumps of up to 40 percent.   The percentage of healthcare costs paid by a health insurance plan is  known as the actuarial value, AV. On average, the AV of an individual  employer-sponsored plan is 83 percent. When compared to the 70 percent  AV of a silver plan and even the 80 percent AV of a gold plan on the  Affordable Care Act exchanges, employer-sponsored plans provide  affordable and more comprehensive coverage than ACA plans.   Employer-sponsored plans also have lower average deductibles: $1,763  for an individual employer-sponsored insurance plan compared with  $5,155 for an individual ACA exchange silver plan.   I will repeat that: $1,763 on an employer-sponsored plan, for an  individual employer-sponsored insurance plan, compared with $5,155 for  an individual ACA exchange silver plan.   Individual employer-sponsored plans have lower average out-of-pocket  costs than ACA exchange plans.   Madam Chair, $4,355 is the average maximum for an individual- sponsored insurance plan compared with an average maximum of $8,519 for  an individual marketplace silver/ACA plan.   Clearly, our government-run and government-subsidized healthcare  programs are facing incredible fiscal challenges. I urge my colleagues  to be more concerned with the older adults enrolled in those programs  than those enrolled in large group employer plans.   This amendment is an insincere attempt to delay implementation of  commonsense policy that will increase health coverage options for all  Americans. Instead, AHPs and the coverage options provided under this  bill give older Americans more affordable coverage options.   Madam Chair, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no''  on the amendment and ``yes'' on the underlying bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.     Madam Chair, I believe I have the right to close, so I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, again, our colleagues continue to try to  mislead the American people about what this bill does. These plans  cannot cherry-pick, cannot exclude, and must cover preexisting  conditions.   The opposition to this bill from our colleagues across the aisle,  unfortunately, is to freedom of choice. The title of this bill is the  CHOICE Arrangement Act, freedom of choice, which would allow people to  stay out of the non-affordable care act, known as ObamaCare, but still  have affordable health insurance.   This bill is about choice, freedom, and good healthcare coverage, and  we should approve the bill without this amendment.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate Mr. Molinaro's amendment. I  support it, and I appreciate his working to make a good bill better.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Self) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Wagner, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3799) to  amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for health  reimbursement arrangements integrated with individual health insurance  coverage, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the  ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the veto message of H.J. Res. 45.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of overriding President  Biden's veto of H.J. Res. 45, a Congressional Review Act resolution  nullifying the Biden administration's attempt to circumvent the will of  the Congress and the role of the Congress of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, President Biden's radical plan to cancel up to $20,000  in student debt via executive fiat is utter hogwash. The American  people are not fooled by the deceptive, doctored-up talking points on  student loans that the left has attempted to force-feed them over the  past 2 years.   Appealing words like ``forgiveness'' have been cast around  innumerable times as if to imply that a massive student loan bailout is  the equivalent of a sweepstakes giveaway.   Here is a reality check for our colleagues across the aisle: There is  no such thing as forgiveness.   This entire scheme is nothing more than a transfer of wealth from  those who willingly took on debt to those who did not or had the grit  to pay off their loans.   Two-thirds of this debt transfer plan would go to the top half of  earners. It takes from those in the lower half of earners and gives to  the upper half. It redistributes wealth, but from the bottom of our  socioeconomic ladder to the top. The 87 percent of Americans who owe no  Federal student debt are paying for the 13 percent who do.   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle also claim that this  transfer of wealth is about fairness. No, it is about sticking  hardworking taxpayers with the tab and those who owe it walking away  from it scot-free.   Mr. Speaker, if this is not the textbook definition of limousine  liberalism, I don't know what it is.   What is more, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal  Budget, inflation could rise by as much as 27 basis points if mass  student debt cancellation is implemented. That means we could see an  additional two rate hikes by the Federal Reserve because of this  inflationary policy alone.   To halt the biggest transfer of wealth from blue-collar workers to  white-collar professionals in our Nation's history and to prevent any  further extension of the student loan repayment pause, the House and  Senate both passed H.J. Res. 45.   Following the President's predictable veto, this resolution comes  before the House again. We must continue to take a stand and defend the  interests of hardworking citizens. As the institution that holds the  power of the purse, it is our responsibility to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cut through the political noise  that the left continues to gin up about so-called student loan  forgiveness and vote in favor of overriding the President's veto on  H.J. Res. 45.   Fiscal responsibility must be given the due deference it deserves.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My colleagues have said that this is overdrawn in terms of the way  the CRA was written, the Congressional Review Act was written, and that  it does too much. It gets into too many other things other than simply  turning back the President's proposal. It deals with the debt and  repayment of debt and those kinds of things.   However, this CRA does not in any way tie the hands of Congress. It  is up to us to pass the laws.   What it does do is stop unelected bureaucrats from writing laws in  the form of rules to implement laws passed by Congress.   We didn't authorize the Department to do many of the things that it  is doing. Congress did not do that, but it is doing many things.   The CRA will stop the President's actions and some of these other  things that are happening. We have the authority to write legislation,  to do whatever we want to. If we want to write legislation to take care  of debt and to take care of interest rates, we can do that.   Forgive me, Mr. Speaker, for not crying crocodile tears along with my  colleagues on the accessibility to college in this country. College in  this country is accessible to anyone who has the capable skills to  attend, or taxpayers covering the costs of college for many who can pay  for themselves and many who simply take advantage of generous taxpayers  by skipping out on their loans.   That is not what the help from taxpayers is supposed to do. It is  supposed to help people gain a college education and go out there and  be productive citizens, not renege on paying back their loans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration is destroying the Federal  student aid system that has balanced providing millions of students  access to opportunities for post-secondary education while respecting  the interest of taxpayers who fund these opportunities.   Democrats know their radical free college agenda won't make it  through Congress, so instead they are forcing it down Americans'  throats by executive fiat through the student loan program. Obfuscation  about the details has allowed the department to tout alleged benefits  without facing any scrutiny over the implications of these radical  changes; however, the facts, which this administration has tried to  push under the rug, prove its agenda is nothing more than an attempt to  skirt the law and enact policies that would never pass Congress.   These actions will leave colleges free to continue increasing costs  that greatly impact all American taxpayers. These policies deny any  accountability to borrowers and evade any responsibility to help those  students turn their degrees into a job.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the override of the President's  veto, and I yield back the balance of my time.
