 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8,  the Bipartisan Background Checks Act.   Mr. Speaker, I grew up on a farm. I was taught at an early age how to  handle a .22 and shotgun. We used them for hunting, to put food on the  table.   But this bill is just simply a background check for every gun sale or  transfer, with commonsense exceptions. As the previous speaker noted,  this has nothing to do with keeping someone who legally obtained a gun  from getting one.   When my niece got her first buck over the holidays at the family  farm, my brother-in-law gave her his favorite shotgun as a present.  They were all so excited. That would be exempted from any paperwork,  and that just makes sense.   My amendment also makes sense. It simply codifies the practice of  ensuring that the background check forms and notifications used to  purchase or transfer a firearm remain available in Spanish, as well as  in English.   Our country is blessed with a diverse population. Language diversity  is part of that diversity that we should celebrate.
