 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense  amendment with the intent of accurately and transparently determining  the prevailing wage for Department of Defense contracts. My amendment  would require the calculation of wages for contractors and all defense  projects to be based on actual statistics calculated by the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, or BLS, as opposed to the current process which  determines these rates based on fundamentally flawed surveys within the  Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor, or the DOL.   This amendment is needed. A 2008 Department of Labor Inspector  General report found that ``one or more errors existed in 100 percent  of the wage reports.'' The Congressional Budget Office estimates that  upwards of $13 billion could be wasted over 10 years if Davis-Bacon is  left unreformed. As stewards of the public treasury, we have an  obligation to spend taxpayer money wisely. This amendment addresses  that very need.   Additionally, this amendment doesn't remove funds from the Defense  budget. The money this amendment saves--potentially in the billions of  dollars--will be kept within the Department of Defense budget to be  used for other important defense priorities. In a fiscal environment  where every dollar counts, this amendment presents a welcome  opportunity to make our defense dollars go further.   This amendment isn't an attempt to repeal Davis-Bacon. It is about  competition, equality, accuracy, and transparency for everyone. It  simply asks that wage determinations for Department of Defense  contracts be made with statistically sampled information from the  Bureau of Labor Statistics so that we are able to spend Federal dollars  in a more efficient manner and support more jobs. The BLS has proven  time and time again that they are the only agency capable of accurately  determining these wages.   A fair wage for a fair job is fair to the American taxpayer. Again, I  thank the chairman and ranking member for their continued work on the  committee.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not anti-Davis-Bacon. Let  me give you some fun facts. In some cities, the Wage and Hour  Division's calculated wages are 75 percent higher than the actual  prevailing wage. In other areas throughout the country, they are below  minimum wage and only 33 percent of the actual prevailing wage. What is  fair is fair.   When you start looking at the figures that are used for calculation,  they haven't been updated in many cases since 1970. Give me a break.  This isn't about Davis-Bacon, this is about crony capitalism. This is  about a vestige of the Jim Crow era.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Chair, may I ask how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, this is not anti-Davis-Bacon. We  want to make it an issue like that, but the statistics speak for  themselves.   The Federal Government is willing to pay the wages for our  hardworking contractors on what they deserve, but as stewards of the  taxpayer dollar, we must insist that these wages are accurate, fair,  and transparent.   The inspector general has stated there are fundamental problems with  the current methodology. We owe it to the American taxpayer and the  contractors themselves to make sure funds are based upon accuracy and  wages are being paid fairly.   The opposition claims to be fighting in favor of Davis-Bacon, but if  they really cared about its longevity and effectiveness, they would  support this amendment and improve and strengthen it.   The opposition also believes this amendment is an attack on the  American worker. Tell that to my contractors who have been put out of  business with the military in south Arizona. Please tell them that when  they couldn't calculate the Davis-Bacon application and were put out of  business by the Department of Labor.   That couldn't be further from the truth. This provides certainty and  clarity to the wages of hardworking tradesmen and women across the  country who perform services for the government.   We as a body should be for fiscal responsibility and for proper  worker compensation. This amendment is an opportunity to act exactly on  this. I urge my colleagues to support this good-governance and  commonsense approach.   I ask my colleagues: Do you support transparency and accuracy?  Support my amendment.   Do you support the responsible use of taxpayer dollars? Support my  amendment.   Do you support workers and fair compensation? Then support my  amendment.   Do you support a fair wage for the hardworking contractors of the  DOD? Support my amendment.   Anything stays safe in the military budget. This is military- specific.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the chair and the ranking member for their  help, and I urge everybody to vote ``yes'' for this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.
