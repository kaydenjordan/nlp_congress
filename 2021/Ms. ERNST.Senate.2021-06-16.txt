 Madam President, in each new Congress, the bill number S.  1 is a sign of the majority's priority legislation. It says a lot about  the new Democrat majority that the bill they chose to design as S. 1  prioritizes themselves.   This bill creates a Federal campaign fund to finance the expenses of  candidates for Congress. Instead of addressing the important issues  that are on the minds of my fellow Iowans--like the rising cost of  gasoline, bread, milk, and all sorts of household goods--this bill  literally takes money out of the paychecks of working Americans and  puts it into the campaign coffers of Washington politicians.   Rather than helping to get Americans back to work, the Democrats' top  priority, again, is S. 1. Their top priority is to create a Federal  jobs program for political consultants and pollsters, taxpayer- subsidized robocalls interrupting your family dinner, junk mail  cluttering your mailbox, and attack ads blaring--yes--on your TV. And,  folks, you cannot--cannot--unsubscribe, either, because there is no  opting out.   Think about the politician you dislike the most. Now imagine your tax  dollars funding their ads and fliers and campaign parties and rallies.  That is what this bill does.   That is right. The bill subsidizes politicians' campaigns--your tax  dollars helping to elect politicians who oppose your values.   This idea is so unpopular that a New York poll found that the  majority leader's own constituents oppose public funding of campaigns  by a 3-to-1 margin.   While the Democrats call the bill the For the People Act, a more apt  title would be ``Fund the Politicians Act.'' It is about Washington  politicians--the same ones who just brought back earmarks to pay for  their pet pork projects with your tax dollars, prioritizing themselves.   The bill not only subsidizes the campaigns of politicians, it  nationalizes elections. Washington would tell the rest of the country  how you can select your representatives. It does so by creating a  Federal workaround of State voter ID laws by effectively eliminating  the enforcement of State ID requirements at the polls.  [[Page S4572]]    Think about what you are required to show an ID to do: drive a car,  board a plane, buy a beer--and the list goes on. But Democrats think it  is best if we don't require an ID to vote.   The majority of Americans disagree with Washington Democrats, and 77  percent of voters support voter ID. A little known fact is that this  includes support by 63 percent of Democrats and a vast majority of  Black and Hispanic voters.   It is all part of the Democrats' larger scheme and total power grab  to tilt our political system in their favor. First, eliminate the  filibuster. Then, rig elections by eliminating election integrity laws  like voter ID verification. Then, add new States, like the District of  Columbia and Puerto Rico, that will elect Democrat Senators. And don't  forget the plan to pack the Court.   There are just 50 Democratic Senators, but 60 votes are required to  end debate on legislation in the Senate. Therefore, the Democrats must  eliminate the filibuster in order to pass S. 1, their priority  legislation. That is right--changing the rules in order to  fundamentally change our country.   And I would remind folks that my friends across the aisle are seeking  to abolish the very same tool--the filibuster--that they used 327 times  last year alone when they were in the minority. If they chose to change  the rules, they would destroy this Chamber's long, proud history as  being the world's greatest deliberative body.   The Senate's current assistant majority leader made it clear--very  clear--in 2018, in no uncertain terms, that ending the filibuster would  be the end of the Senate as it was originally devised and created going  back to the Founding fathers   Because the takeover of elections is just as radical and largely  unconstitutional, the Democrats' Court-packing scheme is another key  component of enshrining S. 1.   Folks, we can all see this for what it is--a transparent play for  permanent political power. This is not about democracy. It is about  changing the rules and tipping the scales to favor Washington  Democrats.   As a former local elections commissioner, I believe elections are  always best kept at the State and local level, and I will continue to  push back on my colleagues' attempts to federalize our elections  system.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I thank Senator Scott, and I appreciate  the time to speak today on this topic. Certainly, I am rising to also  support the Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act.   The United States should no longer provide any recognition or  resources to Hamas, a terrorist organization supplied by Iran disguised  as a Palestinian political party. Hamas is a longstanding terrorist  organization whose attacks and efforts against peace threaten the lives  of civilians and innocents.    Using the population of Gaza as a human shield, Hamas fired more than  1,500 rockets into Israeli civilian areas in an unprovoked attack last  month. The attack was not the action of a responsible political party  but the violent outburst of an Iranian proxy bent on the destruction of  Israel and peace.   Hamas's roots and rationale have very little to do with a broader  struggle for freedom of worship or narrow land use disagreements. It is  far simpler than that. Iran supplies rockets, and Hamas launches  rockets on innocent Israelis because they share a common goal:  eradication of the Jewish people in Israel. It is that simple.   Hamas couldn't be more clear in their goals. Their charter states:         There is no solution for the Palestinian question except       through Jihad. There is no way out except by concentrating       all powers and energies to face this Nazi, vicious Tatar       invasion.    No mention of peace or advancement for people--Israel's defensive  actions against a terror group that compares their people to Nazis and  is dedicated to their destruction are to be expected. Self-defense and  protection of citizens is a core responsibility of every country. Hamas  attacked innocent civilians, fully expecting them to be attacked in  return. Their plan was to purposely create civilian casualties.   We must be unequivocal in support for our ally. The President and  Secretary of State must remain strong in American support to Israel and  not lose sight of the true threat Hamas's backer, Iran, poses to  Israel.   The administration must abandon its attempts to return to the deeply  flawed nuclear agreement with Iran. Their attempt to return to the  failed nuclear deal only emboldens Iran's nuclear ambitions.   Iran provides Hamas and other genocidal terrorist organizations with  rocket systems, rocket parts, assembly training, and cash support every  year. And Iran's goal mirrors that of Hamas: to wipe Israel off the  map, bottom line.   Just as no country--Israel or otherwise--would tolerate such  terrorism and aggression against its citizens, no true ally would turn  their backs on a friend in their moment of need. They certainly would  not continue funding the organization responsible for the attack. So  now, more than ever, the United States must stand with its ally,  condemn the attacks against Israel by Hamas, and affirm our commitment  to support Israel's peace and security.   The Stop American Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act ensures no funding  will be authorized to the territory of Gaza, the site of Hamas's  headquarters, until the President certifies to Congress that these  funds can be spent without benefiting terrorist organizations.   The United States must be clear in our unwavering commitment to our  ally and ensure no American taxpayer dollar goes to Hamas ever again.   I would like to thank my friend and colleague from the great State of  Florida for moving on this piece of legislation I am proud to support.   Again, thank you for your leadership on this.   I yield the floor back to the Senator from Florida.
