 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I am honored to be here today to introduce  my amendment to the Climate Action Now Act, which highlights the  critical role of technology in the fight against climate change. The  United States must continue to invest in research and development of  clean energy technology in order to meet our nationally determined  contributions under the Paris climate accord.   We need American leadership in the fight against climate change. The  U.S. has always led in the field of research and innovation. Our  laboratories and research universities are among the best in the world,  and their ability to  [[Page H3396]]  innovate to combat the world's challenges are without parallel.   Climate change is an urgent challenge we must address, and America's  scientists and technologists have always risen to this challenge. Yet,  instead of fighting climate change, this administration proposed  slashing the budget for climate research and renewable energy programs.   Let's take a look at the President's proposed 2020 budget for the  Department of Energy. President Trump would slash the Office of Energy  Efficiency and Renewable Energy by more than 85 percent. This is the  home at the Department of Energy for supporting every kind of renewable  technology that we have developed and implemented.   President Trump proposed completely zeroing out the ARPA-E budget.  ARPA-E was created to incentivize researchers to develop promising  research into game-changing technologies that can meet our future  research needs. Since 2009, 136 of these projects have attracted  billions in private follow-on funding, creating private-public  partnerships and American jobs.                                time  1830    President Trump has even proposed cutting State Energy Programs,  which help States implement energy efficiency in schools and government  buildings, saving taxpayers money.   That is why I believe that it is so important that we now recognize  and support the critical role that United States leadership in research  and development can and must play in the fight against climate change.   These programs help our country develop new and improved  technologies, foster entrepreneurship, urge small business growth, and  create clean energy jobs.   In my home, California's 45th Congressional District, there are 5,239  renewable energy jobs and 14,140 energy efficiency jobs. That is a  total of 21,622 clean jobs. Those programs filter down to our  laboratories, our universities, and our entrepreneurs leading American  innovation.   I am proud to say that some of the great research and development  happening to combat climate change is happening in California's 45th  District at the University of California, Irvine.   UC Irvine is a leader in clean technology innovation and research,  helping bring our country closer to meeting the goals of the Paris  climate accord.   UC Irvine is home to the Advanced Power and Energy Program and the  National Fuel Cell Research Center, which focuses on developing new  fuel cell technology.   UC Irvine engineers created the first power-to-gas hydrogen pipeline  injection project in the country. This pipeline takes surplus energy  from the school's solar panels, converts water to hydrogen and blends  it with gas, which can be stored for later use. This allows us to use  clean electricity that would otherwise go to waste, helping reduce  pollutants in our air.   Now is the time to harvest the innovative technologies we have while  investing in improving clean technologies for tomorrow. I am proud to  champion and advance research and innovation.   We need to act now and keep the commitments we made to our  coastlines, our community, our country, and the world when we signed  the Paris climate accord.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this weekend, college students around the  [[Page H3398]]  country will cross the graduation stage, accept their diplomas, and get  ready to begin their careers. It will be a weekend of well-deserved  celebration. Their hard work and years of study have paid off. Yet, for  too many of these students, they will soon face the reality of paying  the high price of their diplomas.   Too many of these students will soon come face-to-face with a  mountain of debt that will take them years, often decades to pay.  Today, nearly 43 million Americans, that is one in six adults, have  Federal student loan debt. The Federal student loan portfolio has risen  to over $1.4 trillion.   Tomorrow's graduates will face an average of $30,000 in debt, a  crippling amount for any young person to shoulder before they have even  entered the workforce. That amount of debt increases every single year.  How can we expect young people in this country to choose the course of  their careers, to contribute to their communities, and to plan and  start their families while simultaneously allowing lenders to saddle  them with loan burdens on decades-long repayment timelines?   Among borrowers of all ages with outstanding student loan debt, the  median self-reported amount owed among those with less than a  bachelor's degree was $10,000. Bachelor's degree holders owe a median  of $25,000, and those with a postgraduate degree owe a median of  $45,000.   I have heard stories from students at colleges and universities  throughout California's 45th Congressional District.   Merhpad and her family immigrated to the United States in 2014. After  they settled in Orange County, earning a college degree became her  primary goal. But without Federal financial aid programs, such as the  Pell grant, she would not have been able to afford and pursue an  education. Her commitment and dedication to her education inspired her  parents to also attend Irvine Valley College to pursue degrees.    She uses her financial aid to afford transportation, food,  healthcare, and school supplies. Because she lives with her parents,  she doesn't need to spend financial aid on housing. But other students  aren't so lucky.   Community colleges typically don't offer housing for their students,  and with an average rent of $1,000 to $2,000 in Orange County, it is  almost impossible to afford to live near our colleges' campuses.   Jose, a student at Saddleback College in Orange County is studying  psychology and playing football. He is the eighth of 11 kids. He  received a scholarship to cover his tuition and meals, but it isn't  enough to help him afford housing. Jose was homeless for two semesters,  sleeping in his car and at his football teammates' houses. Despite  these challenges, Jose has a 3.8 GPA and he hopes to graduate from  Saddleback to go on to pursue a degree in clinical psychology.   He explained, ``I move forward towards graduation, believing that if  I can overcome the adversities I have faced in my life, anyone can.''   His persistence and dedication are inspiring. But no student should  ever have to choose between getting an education and being homeless.  Unfortunately, these stories are all too common. Too many students are  struggling just to keep a roof over their heads.   Recently, I met with students from the University of California  Irvine to discuss the challenges they are facing. One of those students  was Stephanie, a first-generation student studying public health.   She completed the full college application process on her own,  including applying for financial aid. She received both a Pell grant  and a Cal grant, but she still has to work three part-time jobs  throughout the year to afford housing and food.   She spends more than 12 hours most days in class and at her part-time  jobs, fighting to ensure that she doesn't have to take on student  loans, so she can go on to pursue a masters in global public health.  Stephanie is not the only one facing challenges affording living  expenses while in college.   Another one of those students was Deshay, a junior at UC Irvine who  will soon become the first person in his family to graduate from  college. Deshay left home at 17, so when he applied for financial aid a  year later, he did so on his own, declaring himself as an independent.   His expected family contribution was zero. While he got the funding  necessary to attend UC Irvine, the aid didn't cover all of his living  needs, including groceries. Deshay had a goal when he started college.  He wanted to graduate loan free. He didn't want to take out loans to  pay for his living expenses and so he took on two part-time jobs. But  the reality of the cost of living in Orange County soon set in.   After nearly 2 months of eating only one meal a day, Deshay was left  with few choices. When he finishes college next year, he will graduate  with nearly $30,000 of debt.   Still, he is excited to graduate and to start giving back to our  community. He plans to move home to Sacramento and he hopes to open a  youth center modeled after Boys & Girls Clubs across the country. But  Deshay is worried that he may not be able to successfully apply for the  loan that he will need to start his business, in large part because of  the student loan debt he carries.   College students who have fought to pursue an education, who work  tirelessly toward their dreams, are being forced to put these dreams on  hold. Why? Because the education necessary to achieve their dreams has  left them buried in debt.   This Congress, as we work on the reauthorization of key legislation  for students across this country, we need to ensure that students  graduating this weekend and in coming weeks don't have to choose  between a job serving their communities or financial security or choose  between putting food on the table and attending classes.   That is why I will be introducing the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau Student Loan Integrity and Transparency Act, along with Senators  Warren, Brown, and Udall. The bill does just what it says. It mandates  that the Department of Education and student loan servicers share  information and cooperate with the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau's student loan education ombudsman. That ombudsman is the number  one Federal official tasked with advocating for our students who are  struggling to repay loans.   It also requires the ombudsman's office be fully staffed at all times  so the office can conduct the level of oversight necessary to protect  student borrowers.   This is just the first step of many needed to improve student loan  oversight and improve college affordability. I look forward to  opportunities to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  ensure that our students have the opportunity to access an affordable  college education.
