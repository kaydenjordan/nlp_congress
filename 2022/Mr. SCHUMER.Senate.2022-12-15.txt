 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning, the Biden administration  announced they are taking action to counter the Chinese Communist  Party's threat to our national security. Just a few moments ago, the  Department of Commerce said they would formally add Wuhan-based YMTC  and 35 other Chinese companies to the so-called Entity List, blocking  them from purchasing critical technology from American businesses.   I am glad this decision has finally arrived because I have long  sounded the alarm on the economic and national security threats posed  by YMTC and other CCP-backed technology companies, like CXMT and SMIC.  YMTC poses an immediate threat to our national security so the Biden  administration needed to act swiftly to prevent YMTC from gaining even  an inch of military or economic advantage. I am glad that they are  heeding our calls as well as calls from other Members on both sides of  the aisle.   Of course, YMTC is a well-known chip supplier for Huawei, one of the  biggest companies that pose a risk to U.S. security interests. Any  supplier of Huawei is no friend of the United States because the risks  are too great and the entanglements of these companies with CCP and  Chinese military are too treacherous. This is a necessary and prudent  step by the administration.   The administration's announcement also comes on the heels of my  amendment with Senator Cornyn to the National Defense Act that would  remove YMTC as well as SMIC and CXMT from our Federal supply chains  entirely. It is a one-two punch: The administration blacklists these  companies from doing business, and here in Congress we will shut them  out even further from U.S. supply chains. Of course, this is about more  than just a single group of businesses stretching their tentacles into  our country. It is about holding firm against a CCP that has become  more emboldened and oppressive over the recent years.   The 21st century will be largely shaped by our two giant economies.  For decades, the Chinese Communist Party has cheated their way to the  top by piggybacking off American technologies and American IP, with  huge implications for our security and for our edge in AI, cyber  security, telecom, and other major technologies. Whoever masters the  technologies of tomorrow will be able to reshape the world in their  image this century. And if the CCP gets there first, it will spell dark  times for democracy, for freedom, and for American prosperity and  American jobs.   Today's decision by the administration will provide one more firewall  we  [[Page S7208]]  all need to keep the CCP's authoritarian designs in check. I applaud  the administration for taking this important step.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the message to accompany H.R. 1437.    Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  to the Senate amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion  to concur.

I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to concur with  an amendment.    I have an amendment at the desk to amendment No. 6534,  which is at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that further reading be  dispensed with.    Mr. President, I move to refer the House message to the  Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report back forthwith  with an amendment No. 6536.    I ask unanimous consent that further reading be waived.    I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion.    I have an amendment to the instructions, which is at the  desk.

Con. Res. 121, which is at the desk; that  the concurrent resolution be considered and agreed to, all without  further intervening action or debate.    I yield the floor.

Res. 121, the Senate resume consideration of the  message with respect to H.R. 1437; that it be in order to make motions  to concur with the following amendments: Scott of Florida amendment No.  6540; Lee amendment No. 6541, as modified with the changes at the desk;  that there be 2 minutes for debate between each vote, equally divided  between the two leaders or their designees, and the Senate vote in  relation to the Scott and Lee motions; that if neither of the motions  to concur with amendment are agreed to, the Schumer motion to refer and  motion to concur with amendment be withdrawn and the Senate immediately  vote on the motion to concur; that the Scott motion and motion to  concur votes be subject to a 60-affirmative vote threshold for  adoption; finally, that if the motion to concur is agreed to, the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 123,  which is at the desk; that the concurrent resolution be considered and  agreed to, all without further intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, two quick points. First, I know that our  great Senator from Rhode Island who handled this bill so well will  speak, but I do want to wish my congratulations to Senator Inhofe, who  has been in this body for such a long time and led the Armed Services  Committee in both the majority and minority with such fervor and  concern for our soldiers and troops. So thank you.    OK. Now, in an effort to move along this evening, I  would ask Members to please remain on or near the floor during votes  tonight.   I ask unanimous consent that the remaining votes this evening be 10- minute votes.    Mr. President, we haven't had a single government  shutdown during the entire 117th Congress, and thanks to this weeklong  extension today, we are not starting now.   Today's 1-week continuing resolution will keep the government open  long enough to give our appropriators a chance to finish their work on  a yearlong funding package.   This is about taking a very simple, exceedingly responsible step to  ensure we finish the year without hiccups and without minimal drama. A  1-week CR will give us more time so we can keep working.   I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their  great cooperation.   Next week, hopefully, we will finish the job, passing a package that  will keep the government fully funded into next fall. Nobody is going  to get everything they want, but the final product will include wins  everyone can get behind, including passing the Electoral Count Act,  emergency aid for Ukraine, and funding for our kids, our veterans, our  small businesses, and our military families.   No drama, no gridlock, no government shutdown this week, it is a win  for the American people. I thank my colleagues for their work.   I ask for the yeas and nays.                           Vote on Motion to Concur
