 Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Inhofe, as  chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and  the cochairs of the Senate Army Caucus, it is our honor to pay tribute  to a great leader and exceptional advocate for the U.S. Army, LTG Guy  C. Swan III, U.S. Army, Retired, as he retires from his current  position as vice president of the Association of the United States  Army, AUSA. For the past 10 years, Lieutenant General Swan led  education and professional development for AUSA. Lieutenant General  Swan exemplifies a lifetime of commitment and service to the Nation and  to others.   A 1976 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point,  Lieutenant General Swan was commissioned as a second lieutenant to be  an armor officer. Throughout his distinguished career, he was  frequently recognized for his exemplary leadership skills, holding  command assignments at every level and in many theaters. His career  culminated as the commanding general, U.S. Army North/Fifth Army. Along  the way, he served in critical staff assignments such as chief of staff  and director of operations in Multi-National Forces-Iraq and in high  visibility roles including commanding general, Military District of  Washington. Placing mission and Nation first, he excelled in every  endeavor.   Between assignments leading soldiers, Lieutenant General Swan  demonstrated his longstanding commitment to continuous learning. He  earned master's degrees in military art and science from the U.S.  Army's School of Advanced Military Studies and in national security  studies from Georgetown University. Seamlessly stitching his knowledge  gained in academia with his military experience, Lieutenant General  Swan made considerable contributions as a thought leader in national  security throughout his career. He served as a national security fellow  at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and  as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Aspen Institute  Homeland Security Group, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency-- FEMA--National Advisory Council.   Following his retirement in December of 2011 from the U.S. Army,  Lieutenant General Swan continued to serve in support of soldiers,  their families, Army civilians, and veterans as vice president for  education at AUSA. Through his committed leadership, vision, and always  positive outlook, Lieutenant General Swan responded to ever-changing  interests and needs of the Army by expanding and improving AUSA's  support for professional development and education. His work also  heightened public interest in the appropriate role of the Army in  defense of our Nation. His priority programs to achieve these goals  included creating AUSA's world-class ``ARMY'' magazine, building a  family readiness program that reaches out to Army families worldwide,  refocusing AUSA-sponsored writing contests to build critical thinking  and research skills in the Army, expanding the AUSA book program to  include discussions with authors having expert knowledge on the Army  and the Nation's security challenges, and establishing an AUSA  fellowship program to provide professional development opportunities  for mid-level Army officers. In developing and supporting these diverse  efforts, he ensured AUSA made the Army, across all of its components, a  more professional and capable organization.   He also continued to give back to his alma mater, West Point, serving  as a Presidentially appointed member of its Board of Visitors. In this  capacity, he contributed to the development of the next generation of  academy graduates entrusted with the privilege of leading American  soldiers.   Lieutenant General Swan has served the Nation he loves with great  distinction and has been an exemplary leader for the servicemembers,  families, and civilians of the Armed Forces. His steady leadership,  positive outlook, and professionalism have been a sustaining source of  strength for those he has led, coached, mentored, and taught through  four decades of service.   On behalf of the Senate and the United States of America, we thank  Lieutenant General Swan, his wife Melanie, and their entire family for  their commitment, sacrifice, and contributions to our Nation. We join  our colleagues in wishing him a long and joyful retirement. Well done.  [[Page S2812]]                                ____________________
