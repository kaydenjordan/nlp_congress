 Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to praise the  progress the Senate and the House has made toward passing tax reform  for the American people.   Our tax plan would roughly double the standard deduction, a deduction  that 71 percent of Missourians use. When our tax bill passes, the  simple truth is that it will allow Missouri families and families  everywhere to take home more of their paychecks.   Our tax plan will also be more fair, eliminating special interest  loopholes and making it easier for average Americans to file taxes.  Currently, our country spends a total of $378 billion per year filing  tax returns. Our tax plan will change all that.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the  final version of this bill so we can give Americans a great present by  Christmas and watch our economy thrive.  [[Page H9673]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 38, the  Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act.   This bill, which reaffirms the Second Amendment rights of all law- abiding citizens to keep and bear arms in every State, includes a  provision I introduced earlier this year as the Police Officers  Protecting Children Act.   My provision would help protect our children from school shootings  and empower local law enforcement to respond rapidly in the case of an  emergency. As many of you who represent rural areas know, in these  sparsely populated regions, our local law enforcement is stretched  thin.   My bill would amend the Gun-Free School Zones Act to allow school  boards to permit off-duty and retired police officers to carry their  firearms on school campuses so they can respond quickly in the event of  a crisis. The legislation would expand the reach of local police  officers, decrease emergency response time, and put more choice back in  the hands of our local school districts. It is a win-win-win.   As we have learned over and over, localities are much better equipped  to know what works for their district rather than the Federal  Government. In fact, the idea of my bill came from a constituent who is  a retired police officer and served his community for 30 years. This  gentleman came to me because he wasn't allowed to use his weapon to  protect his grandchildren at school even though he had decades of  experience and continued to pass an annual recertification test.   Additionally, the sheriff of Laclede County in my district said: Not  allowing current law enforcement officers, or qualified retired law  enforcement officers, to carry weapons at schools simply puts  children's lives at risk.   I agree.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Judiciary Committee for including my  legislation in this important bill, and I urge my colleagues to support  the rule and the underlying bill.
