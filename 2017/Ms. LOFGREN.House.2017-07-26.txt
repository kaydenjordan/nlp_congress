 Mr. Speaker, a lot of Members don't know what a previous  question motion is, and that is not really a surprise, because it is  usually used to set up some issues, and it is a party-line vote. This  is different.   This is different because this would allow amendments to be offered  to these appropriations bills. Now, the amendment process in  appropriations is one of the few times that Members of Congress have an  opportunity to offer an amendment. And it is not just Democrats. It is  Republicans, too.   I recall very well--I am a member, I am a co-chair of the Fourth  Amendment Caucus. It is Congressman Ted Poe and myself. And what  members of the Fourth Amendment Caucus did was we put together an  amendment that actually reformed section 702 of the PATRIOT Act. What  it said was you can't query the database accumulated under section 702  without a warrant. It is pretty obvious the Fourth Amendment protects  Americans. That passed by a huge bipartisan vote twice. We don't get to  offer that amendment this time because it is not an open rule.   So I am just asking that we treat this previous question vote as very  different than the usual garden variety previous question vote, because  this is different. This isn't about idealogy. This isn't about 30- second adds and all that nonsense that we both do. No. This is about  having the opportunity--Republicans and Democrats, Members of  Congress--to offer an amendment in important areas, especially the  Fourth Amendment.   So please vote ``yes'' on the previous question this time, and let's  have open rules. Let's have democracy in America.
