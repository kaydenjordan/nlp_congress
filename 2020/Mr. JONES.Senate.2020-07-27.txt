 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, today marks the third day after a pretty  emotional weekend for the folks of Alabama, for the folks of America.   Earlier this afternoon, we had a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda to  pay our respects to the late John Robert Lewis, a true American hero.   A native of Alabama, John grew up in the cotton fields of Pike  County, AL, in Troy, to become one of the most influential Members of  Congress and, perhaps, one of the most influential Americans this  country has ever seen.   He was a remarkable human being whose life and work are examples to  us all. It is now up to us to carry on, to make ``good trouble,'' to  fulfill the dream, the promise of a more equal and just nation.   As a son of Troy, AL, John Lewis loved our country with all his  heart, and he set out to make it a stronger, more democratic, more  equal, more just nation for every person.   To persevere toward that end in the face of the hate and violence he  so often faced is a testament to the strength of both the character and  the heart of John Lewis.   John was a dear friend to my wife Louise and me, and we are both  profoundly grateful to have had him in our lives.   John's long life represented an unbroken thread from a very painful  past to a more hopeful future. He gave us all reason to hope. More  importantly, he gave us the courage to pursue the bright future we all  want for ourselves and for our children and for our grandchildren.   You know, it struck me earlier today, as we had one of the most  emotional things that I have been a part of with John in the Capitol  Rotunda: I was in Selma, AL, on Saturday evening--my last trip with  John; I have had many--at Brown AME Chapel, historic Brown Chapel, for  a service. Martin Luther King III was there. Congresswoman Terri  Sewell, a daughter of Selma, was there. So many of the foot soldiers  who marched with John were there. I was struck by his passion, by his  courage, and I thought to myself: What can I say that has not already  been said about John Lewis? The words just escaped me.   The following day, we were in Montgomery. John took one last journey  across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL. This time, on the other  side of that bridge, he was met again by State troopers from the State  of Alabama, but instead of tear gas and billy clubs, he was met with  salutes as people lined the streets, shouting: We have got this John.  We will carry on.   Then he went to Montgomery along the same path that they marched in  1965 to make sure that Americans could vote, and vote easily, without  paying a poll tax, without having to count jelly beans or guess at the  number of jelly beans in a jar or take another kind of test.   John marched, and he walked all the way from Selma to Montgomery. In  Montgomery yesterday afternoon, his body was placed in the capital of  the State of Alabama, Montgomery, which was the birthplace of the  Confederacy, the capital of the Confederacy. He had to ride past all of  those monuments that are along the way--and the names.   But on that sunny afternoon, John Lewis was brought into the Capitol  Rotunda for the State of Alabama--the first African American to lie in  state in the State of Alabama at the capitol.   Ironically, the last person to lie in state at the Alabama capitol  was George Wallace. What an interesting bookend for John's life--that  unbroken thread--from a Governor who declared ``segregation now,  segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever,'' who instilled  lawlessness, all the way to John Lewis, who instilled hope and love.   John Lewis was 25 years old when he led a peaceful march across the  Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL. It was in 1965. As he got to the  other side and was met by Alabama State troopers, he had his skull  fractured. He was called lawless. They all were. That day is now  forever known as Bloody Sunday.    You know, change doesn't wait for us to become settled and  comfortable, and even if we are both of those things, it just doesn't  allow us to look the other way when justice is on the line. If there is  one lesson from John Lewis's exemplary life--one from so many--that we  should heed today, it is that we should look to the youngest Americans  to make good on America's promise and show the rest of us how to fight  to eradicate injustice.   When George Floyd took his last breath, it was young men and women-- White, Black, and Brown--who rose up and said enough is enough, just  like 1965, following the death of Jimmie Lee Jackson, when John Lewis  and others rose up and said enough is enough; just as John did as a 21- year-old Freedom Rider, risking his life, traveling by bus throughout  the South. The ride or march--that journey for freedom--never ended for  him, and it can't end for any of us until we make it right.   Although John truly believed that the moral arc of the universe bends  toward justice, he knew that it does not bend on its own. John  certainly did his part to bend that moral arc, but as significant as  his individual efforts were, it was his enlistment of others to join  him that is going to leave his lasting legacy.   We are all here today in some measure, in some way, because we joined  his fight for justice. No matter what side of the political aisle you  are on, no matter where you come from, no matter what your background,  we are all here today, in part, because of John Lewis, to join a fight  for justice. We join because it is the right thing to do, but also  because John showed us the way. He showed us the way by his courage, by  his determination, and, more importantly, by his love.   John Lewis lived to see the generation that I believe will lead this  Nation to our ideals and to fulfill a promise to all. Like him, this  younger generation is protesting peacefully, nonviolently. They love  this Nation. They love this Nation as much as John, and they want this  Nation to fulfill its obligation of equality and justice.   Some have painted them as lawless thugs. They would be wrong. They,  too, like John, are patriots who want America to move forward to a  nation of equals--that long dream of a nation of equals--and move  forward together as a nation, together as one.   In Alabama we saw firsthand the divisions that John sought to heal  and the violence that rose up in opposition to his peaceful efforts to  make right so many wrongs. He loved this country so, so much. May his  love and his moral  [[Page S4501]]  courage ripple from this place in Washington, DC, the floor of the  Senate, the floor of the House of Representatives, from Selma and  Birmingham and Montgomery, Portland and Seattle, Minneapolis,  Washington--everywhere. Let the love and moral courage rip through the  hearts of young Americans--White, Black, and Brown--to reach beyond the  current chaos and division, just as John did, and lead us to come  together as a community to end injustice and inequality.   It is the young among us in Alabama and across this Nation who can  heal what we have failed to heal in our lifetimes, no matter how hard  John Lewis tried.   I truly believe that with the events of the last few weeks, as John  saw the thousands of new recruits for his quest to bend the moral arc  of the universe toward justice, he confidently looked around and said:  All is well. It is time for the torch to be passed. It is time for me  to go.   But it is not just the young in this country. As Members of Congress,  we also have an obligation to act, to bend that moral arc toward  justice, just as John did his entire life.   As we begin to grapple with a world without him, we must face the  challenges of the moment with the same grit and perseverance he  embodied. We are charged--we in this body are charged with continuing  the fight for justice and equality that in his life's work meant so  much.   John was called ``the conscience of Congress.'' May the conscience of  all in Congress--all of us, each of us, the Senate, the House--be  awakened by his passing to finish John's efforts to restore integrity  to the Voting Rights Act.   Later, after the reception today, the memorial service, the House of  Representatives voted unanimously, by unanimous consent, to change the  name of H.R. 4 to the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020.   We can talk about naming roads, and we can talk about renaming  bridges, but if there is one thing that John Lewis would ask us to do,  it is to pass the Voting Rights Act of 2020; restore the Voting Rights  Act to where it is supposed to have been. It is a good bill that passed  the House of Representatives, but it has languished over here in the  bowels of an office somewhere. As we approach the election in 2020, we  need to send that message that every vote in this country can count.  Every person who is eligible should be able to vote and not only cast  the ballot but cast it with ease, cast it at a time when it is  convenient with them, cast it by mail in the privacy of their home if  possible, but cast a ballot to raise the level of participation. That  is what John Lewis stood for. That is what John Lewis meant. That is  what we need to do for John Lewis.    In the program here, I was so pleased that this program reprinted a  painting of John Lewis that is housed in the Birmingham Civil Rights  Institute. Below it is a quote from John: ``When you see something that  is not right, not fair, not just, you have to [stand up], speak up.''  Speak out and find a way to ``get in good trouble, necessary trouble.''   I have to tell you, folks--I have been here for 2\1/2\ years now, and  there are just not enough people who will stand up and speak out when  they see things that they know are unfair and unjust. It is our job,  our duty. We owe it not just to our constituents but to the people of  America to stand up, to speak out, and to get in the way, to make good  trouble.   It is time that we do that with regard to the Voting Rights Act. It  is time that we do that with regard to the police reforms and law  enforcement reforms that are out there as well that we know need to  exist. So let's do it, folks. Let's remember John for who he was and  know more because he was that kind of icon. He was that American hero  who will last--his legacy will last for generations.   Let's remember the charge that John gave us in the final passage of  his autobiography, where he quoted the old African proverb ``When you  pray, move your feet.''   John gave us the charge:         As a nation, if we care for the Beloved Community, we must       move our feet, our hands, our resources to build and not tear       down, to reconcile and not to divide, to love and not to       hate, to heal and not to kill. In the final analysis, we are       one people, one family, one house--the American house, the       American family.    We must carry John with us every step of the way every day and finish  his life's work--patriots for equality and an America that lives a  reality closer to its ideals.   Rest in peace, our old friend John Robert Lewis. We have many bridges  to cross, but we got this.   I yield the floor.
