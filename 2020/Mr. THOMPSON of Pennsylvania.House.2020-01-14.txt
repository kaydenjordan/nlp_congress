 Mr. Speaker, recently, I had the  pleasure of kicking off the new year by attending the 104th  Pennsylvania Farm Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the largest indoor  agriculture exposition in the world.   The Pennsylvania Farm Show dates back to 1917, when the first event  showcased 44 commercial exhibitors featuring the latest in farm  machinery and 440 competitive exhibitors. Since then, the Pennsylvania  Farm Show has become the largest indoor agriculture exhibition in the  would.   Dr. Milton Eisenhower, Penn State University president at the time  and brother of President Dwight Eisenhower, dubbed the Pennsylvania  Farm Show ``always the greatest show on Earth'' during his 1955 visit.   Thanks to the sustained dedication by Pennsylvania farmers and farm  families, tens of thousands of volunteers, and generations of  agribusiness owners, the Pennsylvania Farm Show continues to be the  greatest show on Earth. Today, the Pennsylvania Farm Show has grown to  approximately 6,000 animals, 12,000 exhibits, and 600,000 visitors  throughout the week.   Each year, I host a congressional listening session at the farm show  to hear directly from farmers, industry experts, and the agriculture  advocates about their priorities as well as their concerns.   I want to say thank you to Representatives John Joyce, Fred Keller,  and Dan Meuser, as well as Senator Bob Casey and Pennsylvania  Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding, for joining me for the 2020  congressional listening session at the farm show.   Even after more than a decade of serving on the House Agriculture  Committee, there is no experience that replaces the value of meeting  with our farmers, ranchers, and producers face-to-face.   With the right policies and good investments, rural America can be  just as strong as the hardworking men and women who call it home. A  robust rural America is not possible without a strong rural economy,  and thanks to the passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade  agreement and a soon-to-be-signed agreement with China, new market  opportunities for agricultural exports are on the horizon. New markets  are the key to economic growth and stability for our farm families.   Stability also means having reliable safety net programs in place  when times are particularly tough and when the weather is threatening  our ability to feed ourselves. Over the years, technology has advanced  and the economy has diversified, and keeping up with the demands of a  new era is necessary to compete in the modern marketplace.   With connectivity, broadband, and, specifically, 5G, rural businesses  will be better equipped to compete. Connectivity also expands  opportunities for the next generation in rural America, helping signal  to younger people that rural America is a great place to call home, to  start a business, and to raise a family.   After spending several days at the Pennsylvania Farm Show, I am  increasingly confident that the future of rural America is bright.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 5583, the Help Grandfamilies Prevent Child Abuse Act. I am proud  to cosponsor this legislation with my colleague, Congresswoman Mary Gay  Scanlon of Pennsylvania's Fifth District.   All children deserve a loving and safe home. Sadly, due to the  Nation's growing opioid crisis, more and more children are being left  without structure, without safety, and, in some cases, without parents.  As a result, grandparents have become the primary caregivers for many  children.  [[Page H216]]    The Help Grandfamilies Prevent Child Abuse Act will provide resources  to assist grandparents in raising their grandchildren and, most  importantly, help prevent these children from entering the foster care  system.   This bill ensures grandfamilies and kinship caregivers are eligible  for services under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, or  CAPTA. It also provides support to meet the needs of children who have  experienced trauma; for example, those exposed to substance misuse.  Lastly, the bill calls for training and resources to assist caregivers  in navigating the complicated childcare system.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5583 is a good bill. It is a bipartisan bill, and I  urge my colleagues to support it.                            ____________________
