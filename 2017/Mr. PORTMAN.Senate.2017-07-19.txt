 Mr. President, today I wish to remember Maynard  F. Hagemeyer, a WWII veteran and Ohio business and civic leader. Mr.  Hagemeyer passed away on July 16, at the age of 98, at his home on  Wilmington Road in Clarksville; he died in the same room he was born in  on November 22, 1918.   Maynard Hagemeyer attended Spring Hill elementary school in a one- room schoolhouse and graduated from Massie Township High School in  Harveysburg, OH in 1936. He attended the University of Cincinnati,  studying business administration. He loved horses and, in his youth,  showed Percheron and Belgian horses throughout the U.S., and in 1940,  he traveled through the Panama Canal, transporting draft horses to  Chile.   Drafted into the U.S. Army in 1941, Maynard served almost 5 years  during WWII, half in deployment overseas. He attained the rank of  captain and commanded a company in the 23rd replacement battalion in  North Africa, serving under General George Patton. He also served under  General Mark Clark in Italy.   Maynard took over the family farm in 1948 and operated various  business ventures over the years. These included an excavation  business, a feed mill, an anhydrous ammonia and fertilizer business, an  egg business, and a Standardbred racing and breeding business he  started in 1957 that still continues today.   Active in the community, Maynard was a member of the Clarksville  Masonic Lodge since 1940, the Scottish Rite and Shrine since 1946, and  he joined the Eastern Star in 1947 and served as ``Worthy Patron'' in  1952 and in 1962.   Maynard was on the Warren County Fair Board for 42 years and the  Warren County Veterans Commission for 20 years. He also served as a  director of the Ohio Harness Horsemen's Association and was the first  president of the Harness Horse Youth Foundation.   He stepped into public service after the death of his father in 1948,  completing the balance of his father's term as Warren County  commissioner. He was also a member of the Warren County School Board  for 10 years and served as a Washington township trustee for 32 years.   Maynard has been recognized many times over the years, including the  Pacer Grass Roots award in 1989, named a ``Kentucky Colonel'' at the  age of 91, Masonic Lodge 75-year award in 2016, and the Harveysburg  alumni 80-year award in 2016.   Maynard and his beloved wife, Stella, were married for 71 years and  had 4 children, 8 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.   I would like to honor Maynard Hagemeyer for his contributions to his  community, his country, and his family.                            ____________________
