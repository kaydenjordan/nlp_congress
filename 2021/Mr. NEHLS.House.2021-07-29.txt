 Madam Speaker, crime is up across the country.   Cities that defunded their police are now facing the consequences.  Police chiefs have gone on national TV to literally beg for more  support and assistance. What started as a far-left political slogan  ended up impacting real-world policy in numerous Democrat-run cities.   Now, crime is surging across America. Just the other day, there was a  brazen shootout a mile away from the White House.   The facts and the numbers do not lie. This is President Biden's crime  crisis.   Rather than face the radical elements of their own party, the  Democrats are deflecting responsibility.   Defunding the police means less law enforcement officers on the  streets, less crimes getting solved, and less criminals getting  arrested. The only people who benefit from defunded police are the  criminals themselves.   We are a nation of laws and law and order. We owe it to the American  people to do what we can to keep them safe, even if the Biden  administration won't.                            ____________________
