 Mr. Speaker, many times, people ask me: Just what is it  about regulations that kills jobs? That is what we are involved in this  week is undoing some of those regulations. I will be introducing one  today to unwind a regulation that the BLM recently put into place.   What happened is, over a year ago, for the first time in 40 years, we  allowed Americans to export oil. We are diminishing the trade  deficits--that is, we are making our economy stronger--by shipping to  South American countries and to countries all over the world. It is  good for American jobs. Then the BLM comes in and puts in its onshore  oil and gas order No. 3 rule, which will make it more difficult for us  to produce oil off of public lands. It simply shouldn't be there.   We are introducing legislation today that will reject that as a  bureaucratic entanglement of job creation in the country. That is as  simple as we could be. We look forward to the support of the Members of  the House.                            ____________________
