 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Collins), the ranking member, for yielding.   Madam Speaker, this bill we are debating today is fatally flawed.  Republicans are for a compassionate solution to help DACA recipients,  but that solution must be paired with commonsense border security,  interior enforcement, and changes in policy to stem the tide of illegal  border crossings, human smuggling, and frivolous claims of asylum.  Tragically, this bill does nothing to address the crisis at our  southern border.                                time  1530    Ninety-nine days ago, Chief of the Border Patrol Carla Provost  testified before the Judiciary Committee that ``a humanitarian and  immigration crisis'' was occurring at the border. By any measure, Chief  Provost is correct.   Border Patrol stats show that total apprehensions in the first 7  months of the current fiscal year have already exceeded the total  apprehensions from last fiscal year.   What does this bill do to address that reality and stem the tide of  illegal border crossings? Nothing.   This year, the Border Patrol has also seen a 266 percent increase in  apprehensions of aliens wanted by law enforcement.   What does this bill do to address that? Nothing. In fact, this bill  contains weak screening requirements that will almost certainly put  criminals on a path to citizenship. Republicans tried to fix this at  committee, but our efforts were rejected by the majority.   The Border Patrol also reports a sharp increase in the apprehension  of gang members.   What does this bill to address that? Nothing. The bill contains no  additional enforcement resources, not even to apprehend and remove  known gang members. This bill will certainly give green cards to gang  members.   Republicans tried to fix this in committee. Democrats rejected the  amendment, impugning the integrity of police departments across America  in the process by suggesting that America's cops indiscriminately add  people to gang databases.   Chief Provost also noted in her February testimony that the nature of  illegal border crossings has changed significantly. A decade ago, the  Border Patrol used to apprehend, primarily, single adult males. Today,  there is an unprecedented influx in family units and unaccompanied  minors.   Over the past 5 years, family unit apprehensions are up 621 percent.  Unaccompanied minor apprehensions are up 105 percent. The Border Patrol  has evidence showing that transnational criminal organizations are  exploiting the law to traffic children, using a child repeatedly to aid  in the smuggling of adults into the U.S.   Why is there a crisis involving family units and children? What  changed? The law.   In 2008, a Democratic Congress enacted the Unaccompanied Alien Child  Protection Act, a law that offers perverse incentives, leading to the  very problems we see today. In 2008, there were 8,041 unaccompanied  minors apprehended at the border; last year, 50,036 apprehensions.   While the nature of the immigrants detained has changed, Congress has  not kept pace with these changes. The Border Patrol is now in need of  diapers, formula, meals, and medical care appropriate for children.  Madam Speaker, you would think that Democrats could at least include  more resources to care for young children at the border, but you would  be wrong. This bill doesn't do that either.   Homeland Security is also hampered by a 2014 court order limiting how  long Immigration and Customs Enforcement can detain not only  unaccompanied minors, but also children traveling with parents and, in  some cases, child traffickers. This means entire family units and  criminals are released into the U.S. after 20 days of detention.   DHS desperately needs Congress to address this critical issue. Does  this bill fix this issue? No, it does not.   We also know that there is abuse of our generous asylum laws. Aliens  encountered at the border are being coached to claim fear, guaranteeing  they will be released into the U.S.   Does this bill do anything to reduce frivolous asylum claims? No.   Does it require asylum seekers to apply at a legal port of entry? No.   Does it hold people accountable for filing or assisting in filing  fraudulent claims? No.   Does it impose any kind of asylum quota? No. This bill fails to  advance even basic asylum fixes.   Make no mistake about it, Madam Speaker: The policies passed by this  House, even if they never become law, will send a message.   If the House passes this bill, Democrats will be sending a clear  message to DACA recipients, those young adults brought here by their  parents illegally, that Democrats are willing to hold these young  adults hostage in the push for open borders.   If the House passes this bill, we will incentivize illegal  immigration, just as Congress did in 2008, and we will certainly get  more of it. That is exactly what this bill will do.   This is not compassionate. It is reckless. It is misguided.
