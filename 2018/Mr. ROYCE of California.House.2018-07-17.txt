 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4819) to promote inclusive economic growth through  conservation and biodiversity programs that facilitate transboundary  cooperation, improve natural resource management, and build local  capacity to protect and preserve threatened wildlife species in the  greater Okavango River Basin of southern Africa, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4819         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Defending Economic       Livelihoods and Threatened Animals Act'' or the ``DELTA       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The greater Okavango River Basin, which ranges from the       highland plateau of Angola to northeastern Namibia and       northern Botswana, and also provides critical natural       resources that sustain wildlife in Zambia and Zimbabwe, is       the largest freshwater watershed in southern Africa.        (2) The greater Okavango River Basin is the main source of       water and livelihoods for over 1,000,000 people, and the       effective management and protection of this critical       watershed will help advance important conservation and       economic growth objectives for Angola, Botswana, Namibia,       local communities, and the broader region.        (3) The greater Okavango River Basin is home to the largest       remaining elephant population in the world, as well as other       threatened wildlife species.        (4) Poaching and trafficking of threatened wildlife species       in the greater Okavango River Basin has increased in recent       years, and has the potential to undermine regional stability       by disrupting local governance and management of resources,       and supplanting key economic opportunities for community       members.        (5) Governments in the region have taken important steps to       coordinate through existing conservation frameworks to combat       trafficking, ensure responsible resource management, support       local livelihoods, and protect threatened wildlife species.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that it is in the interest of       the United States to engage, as  [[Page H6313]]       appropriate, with the Governments of Angola, Botswana,       Namibia, and neighboring countries, and in partnership with       donors, regional organizations, nongovernmental       organizations, local communities, and the private sector, to       advance conservation efforts and promote economic growth and       stability in the greater Okavango River Basin and neighboring       watersheds and conservation areas.       SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to promote inclusive       economic growth through conservation and biodiversity       programs that facilitate transboundary cooperation, improve       water and natural resource management, and build local       capacity to protect and preserve threatened wildlife species       in the greater Okavango River Basin and neighboring       watersheds and conservation areas.       SEC. 5. STRATEGY.         (a) In General.--The Secretary and the Administrator, in       coordination with the heads of other relevant Federal       agencies, shall seek, as appropriate, to work with the       Governments of Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and neighboring       countries, and in partnership with donors, regional       organizations, nongovernmental organizations, local       communities, and the private sector, to develop a strategy       to--        (1) create and advance a cooperative framework to promote       responsible natural resource, water, and wildlife management       practices in the greater Okavango River Basin;        (2) protect traditional migration routes of elephants and       other threatened wildlife species;        (3) combat wildlife poaching and trafficking;        (4) address human health and development needs of local       communities; and        (5) catalyze economic growth in such countries and across       the broader region.        (b) Elements.--The strategy established pursuant to       subsection (a) shall--        (1) promote cooperative and responsible water, natural       resource, and wildlife management policies and practices       within and among the countries of Angola, Botswana, and       Namibia, with a particular focus on the greater Okavango       River Basin and the critical headwaters located in Angola;        (2) protect and restore wildlife habitats and traditional       migratory patterns of elephants and other threatened species;        (3) combat wildlife poaching and trafficking in Angola,       Botswana, Namibia, and those areas of Zambia and Zimbabwe       that border Angola, Botswana, or Namibia, including within       regional and national parks and reserves, by building the       capacity of the governments of such countries, local law       enforcement, community leaders, and park rangers to detect,       disrupt, and prosecute poachers and traffickers;        (4) promote conservation as a foundation for inclusive       economic growth and development within a comprehensive       assistance strategy that places Angola, Botswana, and Namibia       on a trajectory toward graduation from the need for United       States foreign assistance;        (5) identify opportunities and mechanisms to leverage       regional organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and       public-private partnerships to contribute to support the       implementation of the strategy;        (6) establish monitoring and evaluation mechanisms,       including measurable goals, objectives, and benchmarks of       success, that are included in grants, contracts, and       cooperative agreements to ensure the effective use of United       States foreign assistance; and        (7) coordinate with and build the capacity of regional       conservation frameworks in order to advance regional       conservation objectives.       SEC. 6. UNITED STATES SUPPORT.         (a) In General.--The Secretary and the Administrator, in       coordination with the heads of other relevant Federal       agencies, are authorized to prioritize and advance ongoing       efforts to--        (1) promote inclusive economic growth and development       through responsible water and natural resource management and       wildlife protection activities in the greater Okavango River       Basin;        (2) provide technical assistance to governments and local       communities in Angola, Botswana, and Namibia to create a       policy-enabling environment for such responsible water and       natural resource management and wildlife protection       activities; and        (3) build the capacity of local law enforcement, park       rangers, and community leaders to combat wildlife poaching       and trafficking.        (b) Coordination and Integration With Regional Conservation       Frameworks.--The Secretary and the Administrator, in       coordination with the heads of other relevant Federal       agencies, shall coordinate assistance provided by Department       of State, the United States Agency for International       Development, and such other relevant Federal agencies with       existing regional conservation frameworks in order to ensure       regional integration of conservation, wildlife trafficking,       and water management initiatives, to prevent duplication of       efforts, and to advance regional conservation objectives.        (c) Coordination With Private Sector.--The Secretary and       the Administrator, in coordination with the heads of other       relevant Federal agencies, are authorized to work with the       private sector and nongovernmental organizations to leverage       public and private capital to promote responsible resource       management, combat wildlife poaching and trafficking, and       support inclusive economic growth and local livelihoods in       the greater Okavango River Basin.        (d) Monitoring and Evaluation.--The Secretary and the       Administrator shall establish monitoring and evaluation       mechanisms, to include measurable goals, objectives, and       benchmarks, to ensure the effective use of United States       foreign assistance to achieve the objectives of this section.       SEC. 7. REPORT.         (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary and the       Administrator, in coordination with the heads of other       relevant Federal agencies, shall submit to the appropriate       congressional committees a report on the implementation of       this Act.        (b) Matters To Be Included.--The report required under       subsection (a) shall include a description of the strategy       required by section 5, including--        (1) the monitoring and evaluation plans and indicators used       to measure performance under the strategy;        (2) any legislative impediments to meeting the objectives       of such strategy;        (3) the extent to which Angola, Botswana, and Namibia have       demonstrated a commitment and willingness to cooperate to       advance efforts described in section 5(b);        (4) progress made to date in meeting the objectives of such       strategy;        (5) efforts to coordinate, deconflict, and streamline       conservation programs in order to maximize resource       effectiveness;        (6) the extent to which Angola, Botswana, and Namibia and       other government in the region are investing resources to       advance conservation initiatives; and        (7) the extent to which other funding sources, including       through private sector investment and other investment by       Angola, Botswana, and Namibia, have been identified to       advance conservation initiatives.       SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the       Administrator of the United States Agency for International       Development.        (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (A) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and        (B) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate.        (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of State.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Okavango Delta supports the economic livelihood of a  million people in that region. It is in a desert, but the Okavango  River flows into that desert and makes a home to the largest remaining  population of elephants in the world.   This ecosystem spans three countries. It starts in the highlands of  Angola, and it flows through Namibia and Botswana. Like other regions  across Africa, there is a challenge here in the poaching and  trafficking of threatened species in the delta. That poaching of  elephant, black rhino, and hippo is increasing.   I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of poachers and  organized criminal networks across the continent. Wildlife trafficking  and profits from poaching provide a key funding source for  international criminal networks and for terrorists.   These deadly groups undermine regional stability. They spread  violence. They disrupt local governance. They have a devastating impact  on the economic opportunities for members of the community.   This legislation provided by our good friend here, Mr. Fortenberry,  H.R. 4819, is the Defending Economic Livelihoods and Threatened Animals  Act of 2018. This DELTA Act is an opportunity to be proactive and  protect this part of the world before it is too late. It strengthens  coordination among the Governments of the United States and Angola,  Botswana, and Namibia to address these poaching threats and to support  local communities in this greater Okavango River Basin.  [[Page H6314]]    A few months ago, I led a bipartisan delegation to the region, and I  saw the critical need for these countries to work together to preserve  and protect this magnificent landscape. I had not been in Angola since  the beginning of that war, and to go back to see Angola today and have  an opportunity to meet with the chairman of the committee responsible  for conservation there--she is, in fact, herself a park ranger--and to  see how Angola has emerged from years of civil war and unrest and is  now looking to the international community for partnership and for  support is heartening.   With Angola's immense natural resources, we are already seeing,  unfortunately, foreign governments--for example, Beijing--pushing  unwise development that threatens to siphon off this critical water  source. Obviously, to siphon off this water source, it would devastate  the river basin. This is why we must act now to protect the animals and  communities that call the region home.   Animals and poachers, of course, know no boundaries. The water  doesn't know any boundaries. In order for conservation efforts to be  successful, we must take a transboundary approach.   I was proud to be the author of the Congo Basin Forest Partnership  Act some years ago. I think it was in 2004 that it was passed. We saw  how increased coordination across national borders can be successful in  protecting critical landscapes and combating poaching threats.   This DELTA Act looks to build on these proven successes, which have  set up national parks now in seven landscapes across Africa. This  legislation strengthens the coordination among the Governments, as I  said, of the United States, Angola, Botswana, and Namibia. It does that  by leveraging partnerships with the private sector, with nongovernment  organizations, and with regional bodies. It prioritizes wildlife  trafficking and anti-poaching programs in this greater Okavango River  Basin. And it promotes responsible economic growth for local  communities through responsible natural resource management.   Again, I thank the bill's author, Representative Fortenberry, and our  fellow co-chairs of the House International Conservation Caucus,  Representatives McCollum and Cuellar, for their leadership and  steadfast efforts to keep conservation and anti-poaching efforts alive  here in Congress and to help us drive these efforts.   I want to thank Ranking Member Engel and, of course, from New York,  Joe Crowley, for their work on this legislation. It is deeply  appreciated, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), a member of the Committee on  Appropriations and the author of this landmark legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the greater Okavango River Basin is home to the largest  remaining elephant population on this planet, but like other regions  across Africa, we know that poaching and trafficking of threatened  species is increasing. We know that greater transboundary cooperation  is essential to protect the basin in order to combat poaching threats  and, obviously, to encourage the responsible management of water  resources.   The U.S. currently supports programs in Africa to combat poaching  threats and promote economic growth, but greater coordination and  diplomatic engagement with these governments, these governments working  together to streamline these programs and galvanize support from  partner countries also in the region, is essential.   We do this not only to protect these threatened species, but also  because it is in our national security interest to do so. I urge all of  my colleagues to support this important measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3030) to help prevent acts of genocide and other  atrocity crimes, which threaten national and international security, by  enhancing United States Government capacities to prevent, mitigate, and  respond to such crises, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3030         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Elie Wiesel Genocide and       Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that the United States affirms       the critical importance of strengthening the United States       Government's efforts at atrocity prevention and response       through interagency coordination such as the Atrocities       Prevention Board (referred to in this section as the       ``Board'') or successor entity. In carrying out the work of       the Board or successor entity, appropriate officials of the       United States Government should--        (1) meet regularly to monitor developments throughout the       world that heighten the risk of atrocities;        (2) identify any gaps in United States foreign policy       concerning regions or particular countries related to       atrocity prevention and response;        (3) facilitate the development and implementation of       policies to enhance the capacity of the United States to       prevent and respond to atrocities worldwide;        (4) provide the President with recommendations to improve       policies, programs, resources, and tools related to atrocity       prevention and response;        (5) conduct outreach, including consultations, not less       frequently than biannually, with representatives of       nongovernmental organizations and civil society dedicated to       atrocity prevention and response;        (6) operate with regular consultation and participation of       designated interagency representatives of relevant Federal       agencies, executive departments, or offices; and        (7) ensure funds are made available for the policies,       programs, resources, and tools related to atrocity prevention       and response, including through mechanisms such as the       Complex Crises Fund or other related accounts.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It shall be the policy of the United States to--        (1) regard the prevention of genocide and other atrocities       as in its national security interests;        (2) mitigate threats to United States security by       addressing the root causes of insecurity and violent conflict       to prevent--        (A) the mass slaughter of civilians;        (B) conditions that prompt internal displacement and the       flow of refugees across borders; and        (C) other violence that wreaks havoc on regional stability       and livelihoods;        (3) enhance the capacity of the United States to identify,       prevent, address, and respond to the drivers of atrocities       and violent conflict as part of the United States'       humanitarian, development, and strategic interests; and        (4) pursue a Government-wide strategy to prevent and       respond to the risk of genocide and other atrocities by--        (A) strengthening the diplomatic, risk analysis and       monitoring, strategic planning, early warning, and response       capacities of the Government;        (B) improving the use of foreign assistance to respond       early, effectively, and urgently in order to address the root       causes and drivers of violence, and systemic patterns of       human rights abuses and atrocities;        (C) strengthening diplomatic response and the use of       foreign assistance to support transitional justice measures,       including criminal accountability, for past atrocities;        (D) supporting and strengthening local civil society,       including human rights defenders and others working to help       prevent and respond to atrocities, and protecting their       ability to receive support from and partner with civil       society at large;        (E) promoting financial transparency and enhancing anti-      corruption initiatives as part of addressing a root cause of       insecurity; and        (F) employing a variety of unilateral, bilateral, and       multilateral means to prevent and respond to conflicts and       atrocities by--  [[Page H6316]]         (i) placing a high priority on timely, preventive       diplomatic efforts; and        (ii) exercising a leadership role in promoting       international efforts to end crises peacefully.       SEC. 4. TRAINING OF FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERS IN CONFLICT AND                     ATROCITIES PREVENTION.         Section 708 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C.       4028) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(1)--        (A) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (B) in subparagraph (C), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(D) instruction on recognizing patterns of escalation and       early warning signs of potential atrocities or violence,       including gender-based violence, and methods of conflict       assessment, peacebuilding, mediation for prevention, early       action and response, and transitional justice measures to       address atrocities.''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(d) Definition.--In this section, the term       `peacebuilding' means nonviolent activities designed to       prevent conflict through--        ``(1) addressing root causes of violence;        ``(2) promoting sustainable peace;        ``(3) delegitimizing violence as a dispute resolution       strategy;        ``(4) building capacity within society to peacefully manage       disputes, including the capacity of governments to address       citizen grievances; and        ``(5) reducing vulnerability to triggers that may spark       violence.''.       SEC. 5. REPORTS.         Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act and annually thereafter for the following six years,       the President shall transmit to the Committee on Foreign       Affairs and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of       the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign       Relations and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the       Senate a report, with a classified annex if necessary, that       includes--        (1) a review, in consultation with appropriate interagency       representatives, consisting of a detailed description of--        (A) current efforts based on United States and locally       identified indicators, including capacities and constraints       for Government-wide detection, early warning and response,       information-sharing, contingency planning, and coordination       of efforts to prevent and respond to situations of genocide       and atrocities and other mass violence, such as gender-based       violence and violence against religious minorities;        (B) recommendations to further strengthen United States       capabilities described in subparagraph (A);        (C) funding expended by relevant Federal departments and       agencies on atrocities prevention activities, including       transitional justice measures and the legal, procedural, and       resource constraints faced by the Department of State and the       United States Agency for International Development throughout       respective budgeting, strategic planning, and management       cycles to support conflict and atrocities prevention       activities in countries identified to be at risk of       atrocities;        (D) current annual Government global assessments of sources       of instability, conflict, and atrocities, the outcomes and       findings of such assessments, and, where relevant, a review       of activities, and the efficacy of such activities, that the       Atrocities Prevention Board or successor entity undertook to       respond to sources of instability, conflict, and atrocities;        (E) consideration of analysis, reporting, and policy       recommendations to prevent and respond to atrocities produced       by civil society, academic, and other nongovernmental       organizations and institutions;        (F) countries and regions at risk of atrocities, including       a description of most likely pathways to violence, specific       risk factors, potential groups of perpetrators, and at-risk       target groups; and        (G) instruction on recognizing patterns of escalation and       early warning signs of potential atrocities and methods of       conflict assessment, peace-building, mediation for       prevention, early action and response, and transitional       justice measures to address atrocities in the Federal       training programs for Foreign Service officers;        (2) recommendations to ensure shared responsibility by--        (A) enhancing multilateral mechanisms for preventing       atrocities, including strengthening the role of international       organizations and international financial institutions in       conflict prevention, mitigation, and response; and        (B) strengthening regional organizations;        (3) implementation status of the recommendations contained       in such review; and        (4) identification of the Federal departments and agencies       and civil society, academic, and nongovernmental       organizations and institutions consulted for preparation of       such report.       SEC. 6. DEFINITION.         In this Act, the term ``genocide'' means an offense under       subsection (a) of section 1091 of title 18, United States       Code, or any substantially similar conduct.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it was over 60 years ago that free people around the  world pledged to never again stand by in silence as oppressed people  are annihilated in a genocide. Unfortunately, since then, we have  witnessed mass atrocities and genocide in places such as Bosnia, the  Rwandan genocide, Cambodia, Burma, and in the ISIS strongholds in Syria  and in Iraq.   The United States has often been a leader in responding to these and  other humanitarian crises--not soon enough, in many cases. However,  there is more, obviously, that can be done, and U.S. efforts have been  largely reactive and disjointed, with little transparency or oversight.   This bill is the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act.  It would correct these deficiencies. This act would require an annual  report of administration actions to prevent and respond to potential  genocides and mass atrocities, and it would mandate the identification  of countries that are at risk of such crimes against humanity.   This act also requires that all Foreign Service officers, who often  are at the forefront of U.S. efforts to address atrocities ever since  our Ambassador in Armenia was the first to sound the alarm on the  Armenian genocide, be trained to deal with early warning signs,  conflict assessment, mediation, and other responses.   All of this will better enable our government to develop a  coordinated response as a crisis is developing and, ultimately, to save  lives.   With its name, this bill honors the legacy of Holocaust survivor and  Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel, and it furthers our commitment to his call,  for it was his call for ``never again''--never again by strengthening  the U.S. Government's coordination on efforts to prevent, mitigate, and  respond to genocide and other mass atrocities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                                     July 17, 2018.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On June 22, 2018, H.R. 3030, the Elie       Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018 was       referred to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence       (the Committee).        In order to expedite the House's consideration of the       measure, the Committee will forgo consideration of the       measure. This courtesy is conditioned on our mutual       understanding and agreement that it will in no way diminish       or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee with respect to       any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matter       contained in the legislation or any similar measure, nor will       this waiver inhibit the Committee's ability to address issues       of concern going forward.

Sincerely,                                                       Devin Nunes,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, July 16, 2018.      Hon. Devin Nunes,      Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Foreign Affairs on H.R. 3030, the Elie Wiesel       Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018, and for       agreeing to be discharged from further consideration of that       bill.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your Committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to  [[Page H6317]]       seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 3030 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work with your Committee as       this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), who is the author of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), chair of the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Ann  Wagner, for her leadership on this important bill. I also thank the  ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Engel, for his  support, along with Mr. Sherman, on this bill.   Passage of this legislation sends a strong message of the continuing  U.S. commitment to respond to genocide and to respond to mass  atrocities as they emerge, with effective and coordinated programs that  will best protect the most vulnerable. The U.S. must be a world leader  in efforts to prevent genocide and crimes against humanity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4989) to require the Department of State to  establish a policy regarding the use of location-tracking consumer  devices by employees at diplomatic and consular facilities, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4989         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Diplomats from       Surveillance Through Consumer Devices Act''.       SEC. 2. SECURE UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR                     FACILITIES AGAINST CYBERSURVEILLANCE.         (a) Policy on Location-Tracking Consumer Devices.--Not       later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this       Act, the Secretary of State shall establish a policy on the       use of location-tracking consumer devices, including GPS-      enabled devices, at United States diplomatic and consular       facilities by United States Government employees,       contractors, locally employed staff and members of other       agencies deployed to or stationed at such facilities.        (b) Security Briefing.--Existing and new employees at       United States diplomatic and consular facilities, including       contractors, locally employed staff, and members of other       agencies deployed to or stationed at such facilities, shall,       as a part of the security briefings provided to such       employees, be informed of the policy described in subsection       (a) and given instructions on the use of location-tracking       consumer devices both on and off the premises of such       facilities.        (c) Coordination.--The Secretary of State may coordinate       with the heads of any other agencies whose employees are       deployed to or stationed at United States diplomatic and       consular facilities in the formulation of the policy       described in subsection (a) and the dissemination of such       policy pursuant to subsection (b).        (d) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the formulation       of the policy described in subsection (a), the Secretary of       State shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign       Relations of the Senate a report on the details of such       policy.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   First, I thank Mr. Castro and Mr. McCaul, the co-authors of this  legislation. I know Mr. McCaul knows some of the dangers that our  diplomats face overseas. In his past service to the United States, he  has been in parts of this dangerous world, and this is what our  diplomats face. As they work to prevent armed conflict, there are armed  combatants on the other side of those issues. As they try to combat  terrorism, as they are working out there to empower women or to open  new markets for U.S. exports, they are in tough environments. In turn,  it is our job to ensure that our diplomats have the information and  resources they need to stay safe while they serve our country overseas.                                time  1700    Now more than ever, everyday devices such as smartphones include  location tracking capabilities. While these are enormously useful  tools, they also, obviously, present security concerns as users'  locations can then be tracked by others, by hostiles.   For the thousands of State Department employees who work overseas,  this is a real concern. It is a real security risk.   While the State Department has longstanding and thorough policies on  the use of these devices while in embassies and in consulates, the  Department has no such policy to guide personnel outside Department  grounds. And that is where we send them, outside the Department  grounds.   So the bill before us today addresses this security gap. It mandates  that the State Department develop a comprehensive, modernized policy on  devices that contain tracking capability. It also requires that all  current and future diplomatic staff be briefed on the new policy and  current best practices for using devices that are enabled with local  tracking features. The objective is to build in a culture of safety and  self-awareness.   Technology is advancing every day, and we must not allow our agencies  to expose personnel to new risks.   I urge my colleagues to support this act, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), chairman of the Committee on  Homeland Security, a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee,  and the coauthor of this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Our diplomats serve in some of the most dangerous parts of the world.  They advance U.S. interests overseas, and while they serve our Nation  overseas, it is our job here to ensure that they have the information  and resources that they need to stay safe. So I urge my colleagues to  vote in favor of this timely bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5105) to establish the United States International  Development Finance Corporation, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5105         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is the BUILD Act. Across the globe, lack of access  to capital is constraining economic growth, especially in the world's  least developed countries.   According to the International Finance Corporation, micro, small, and  medium-sized enterprises have an unmet financing need of more than $5  trillion every year in emerging markets, depriving them of the capital  that they need to grow. Foreign investment is critical to empowering  entrepreneurs, critical to creating jobs and to reducing poverty.   Our country has an undeniable interest in supporting the development  of vibrant and stable economies around the world. Healthy private  sectors promote good governance and support thriving civil societies.  It helps reduce civil strife. The resulting stability is good for our  national security and also benefits U.S. exports and jobs.   Increasingly, other countries are working to advance their economic  and political interests by shaping overseas markets. China's One Belt,  One Road initiative is estimated at $1 trillion. This dwarfs the size  of the Marshall Plan that rebuilt war-torn Europe in the 1940s and  1950s.   Across Africa, Asia, and beyond, Beijing is making massive  investments in new construction and infrastructure projects, from the  headquarters of the African Union to a port in Djibouti, where both the  U.S. and China now have military bases. Beijing now owns 80 percent of  this strategically located African nation's foreign debt.   As the president and CEO of OPIC, the Overseas Private Investment  Corporation, testified to the Foreign Affairs Committee, his words: ``A  condition of many of these loans is that Chinese firms, and labor, get  the business. . . . This state-directed approach is not consistent with  our values, which incorporate the high standards of international  financial institutions related to governance, transparency, debt  sustainability, environmental, and social safeguards.''   Chinese development practices have often left countries worse off-- and I have seen this with my own eyes--putting some countries into debt  distress. Last December, Sri Lanka gave control of the strategic Sri  Lankan port to Beijing for 99 years after it could not repay the  Chinese-backed loans to fund it. That granted Beijing a foothold in the  Indian Ocean and its critical shipping lanes.   And due to Beijing's ``no strings attached'' financing, some of  Africa's most brutal regimes have been thrown an economic lifeline that  undermines democratic governance. Unlike the United States, Beijing  does not have an anti-corruption standard. It is willing to fund just  about any government, from Venezuela to Sudan.   The U.S. cannot and should not match China's investments dollar-for- dollar, but we can and should do more to support international economic  development with partners who have embraced the private sector-driven  development model.   However, America's development finance tool kit, which is spread  across multiple agencies, is limited, it is duplicative, it is  uncoordinated. So the BUILD Act will address these shortcomings. It  will modernize America's antiquated development finance capabilities to  address the challenges of this century. Specifically, it will merge  OPIC and USAID's development credit authority into a standalone U.S.  international development finance corporation with new authorities.                                time  1715    Among these new authorities will be the ability to cofinance projects  with our allies like the U.K.   What this is going to do, just on the U.S. side, is this is going to  double their book of business.   Through the provision of loans and guarantees and limited equity  investments and feasibility studies, political risk insurance, and  other investments of support, the new Development Finance Corporation  will mobilize private capital to provide countries a competitive  alternative to the state-directed approach of Beijing and Moscow.   I am pleased that this bill doesn't just merge existing functions  together but also includes critical reforms to protect taxpayers, to  improve government efficiency, and to make America's development  finance toolkit very effective. Notably, it adopts many of the same  principles as the Millennium Challenge Corporation, including the  constraints analysis, which directs investment to where it will have  the most impact.   This bill will create a dedicated inspector general of the new  corporation. It will require that the corporation prioritize support in  the poorest countries and those making continual progress towards  economic policies that support free enterprise, and it will create  lasting institutional linkages between the Development Finance  Corporation and other development agencies.   This bill has got strong support from the White House, which made it  a priority in its National Security Strategy and 2019 budget.   In short, the BUILD Act represents a major opportunity for this  Congress and the executive branch to transform and modernize our  Nation's tools to support global development and increase opportunities  for American entrepreneurs in these emerging markets.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                     Washington, DC, July 16, 2018.      Hon. Ed Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I write concerning H.R. 5105, the       Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act       of2018.

Further, I appreciate your agreement to       incorporate changes suggested by the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure into the bill prior to       floor consideration.

Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to forgo a sequential       referral request on H.R. 5105, the Better Utilization of       Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act of 2018, so       that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.       Edits requested by your committee have been incorporated in       the bill text scheduled for consideration by the House.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 5105 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho). He is the chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, and he is the author of  this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4989.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask for an ``aye'' vote on  the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5480) to improve programs and activities relating  to women's entrepreneurship and economic empowerment that are carried  out by the United States Agency for International Development, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5480         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Women's Entrepreneurship and       Economic Empowerment Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Because women make up the majority of the world's poor       and gender inequalities prevail in incomes, wages, access to       finance, ownership of assets, and control over the allocation       of resources, women's entrepreneurship and economic       empowerment is important to achieve inclusive economic growth       at all levels of society. Research shows that when women       exert greater influence over household finances, economic       outcomes for families improve, and childhood survival rates,       food security, and educational attainment increase. Women       also tend to place a greater emphasis on household savings       which improves families' financial resiliency.        (2) A 2016 report by the McKinsey Global Institute       estimated that achieving global gender parity in economic       activity could add as much as $28 trillion to annual global       gross domestic product (GDP) by 2025.        (3) Lack of access to financial services that address       gender-specific constraints impedes women's economic       inclusion. More than one billion women around the world are       currently left out of the formal financial system, which in       turn causes many women to rely on informal means of saving       and borrowing that are riskier and less reliable. Among other       consequences, this hampers the success of women       entrepreneurs, including those seeking to run or grow small       and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The International       Finance Corporation has estimated that 70 percent of women-      owned SMEs in the formal sector are unserved or underserved       in terms of access to credit, amounting to a $285 billion       credit gap.        (4) Women's economic empowerment is inextricably linked to       a myriad of other women's human rights that are essential to       their ability to thrive as economic actors across the       lifecycle. This includes, but is not limited to, living lives       free of violence and exploitation, achieving the highest       possible standard of health and well-being, enjoying full       legal and human rights such as access to registration,       identification, and citizenship documents, benefitting from       formal and informal education, and equal protection of and       access to land and property rights, access to fundamental       labor rights, policies to address disproportionate care       burdens, and business and management skills and leadership       opportunities.        (5) Discriminatory legal and regulatory systems and banking       practices are hurdles to women's access to capital and       assets, including land, machinery, production facilities,       technology, and human resources. Often, these barriers are       connected to a woman's marital status, which can determine       whether she is able to inherit land or own property in her       name. These constraints contribute to women frequently       running smaller businesses, with fewer employees and lower       asset values.        (6) Savings groups primarily comprised of women are       recognized as a vital entry point, especially for poor and       very poor women, to formal financial services and there is a       high demand for such groups to protect and grow their savings       with formal financial institutions. Evidence shows that, once       linked to a bank, the average savings per member increases       between 40 to 100 percent and the average profit per member       doubles. Key to these outcomes is investing in financial       literacy, business leadership training, and mentorship.        (7) United States support for microenterprise and       microfinance development programs, which seek to reduce       poverty in low-income countries by giving small loans to       small-scale entrepreneurs without collateral, have been a       useful mechanism to help families weather economic shocks,       but many microcredit borrowers largely remain in poverty. The       vast majority of microcredit borrowers are women who would       like to move up the economic ladder but are held back by       binding constraints that create a ``missing middle''-large       numbers of microenterprises, a handful of large firms or       conglomerates, and very few SMEs in between, which are       critical to driving economic growth in developing countries.        (8) According to the World Bank, SMEs create 4 out of 5 new       positions in emerging markets but about half of formal SMEs       don't have access to formal credit. The financing gap is even       larger when micro and informal enterprises are taken into       account. Overall, approximately 70 percent of all micro,       small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in emerging       markets lack access to credit.       SEC. 3.

(b) Matters to Be Included.--The report required under       subsection (a) shall include an assessment of the following:        (1) What is known about the impact of such development       assistance on the economies of developing countries.        (2) The extent to which such development assistance is       targeting women and the very poor, including what is known       about how such development assistance benefits women.        (3) The extent to which the United States Agency for       International Development has developed a methodology used to       ensure compliance with the targeted assistance requirement in       section 252(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as       amended by section 4 of this Act, and the quality of such       methodology.        (4) The monitoring system required in section 253(b) of the       Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended by section 4 of       this Act, including the quality of such monitoring system.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material in the record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am the author of this measure. It is the Women's  Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, and I want to thank  those members on the staff that worked on this measure: Amy Porter,  Joan Condon, Jessica Kelch, and Emily Cottle, and I thank them because  around the globe, women make up the majority of the world's poor. This  is due, in part, to gender constraints that in some places deny women  access to basic financial services, like savings accounts.   Today, more than 1 billion women remain left outside of the formal  financial system, and women-owned, small-and medium-sized enterprises  face a $300 billion credit gap. A 2014 analysis found that closing the  gender gap and access to credit for small- and medium-sized women-owned  businesses would increase per capita GDP by 12 percent in developing  countries. That is because when women exercise greater influence over  finances, literally, everyone benefits.   Childhood survival rates, food security, children's education,  economic opportunity for families, all of that increases. Investment in  women yields results for entire communities. Indeed, countries with  high female labor force participation rates are more resilient to  economic shocks and suffer fewer slowdowns in economic growth.   A 2016 report estimated that achieving global gender parity in  economic activity by 2025 would add as much as $28 trillion to annual  GDP, an amount equal to the combined economies of the United States and  China.   Confronting the barriers that keep women from being able to fully  participate in their local markets is key to generating sustainable,  economic growth. And this means not only expanding women's access to  the financial system, but also, as cell phones become more and more  available, expanding their access to new financial technology like  mobile money.   The Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act addresses  barriers to women's economic inclusion in developing countries by  requiring that all USAID strategies and projects and activities be  shaped by a gender analysis and by expanding the agency's  microenterprise assistance authorities to support small-and medium- sized women-owned businesses. This is critical as small- and medium- sized enterprises create four out of five new jobs in developing  economies.   So the bill is the result of the committee's extended focus on  empowering women and girls through U.S. foreign policy, which has been  the subject of five full committee hearings and other subcommittee  hearings in recent Congresses. Our women's empowerment initiative has  produced significant legislation including: the Girls Count Act of  2015, the Protecting Girls' Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings  Act, and the Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017, among others.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that we should invest our limited foreign  assistance dollars wisely, and I have seen the good things that happen  when we focus on empowering women. That is what this bill does, and I  ask for my colleagues' support in helping to make it happen.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time  to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), chairwoman emeritus  on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and I ask unanimous consent that  she may control that time.
