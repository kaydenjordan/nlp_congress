 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address a serious issue  that affects millions of people around the world, to include many  Americans: slavery and human trafficking. Despite major progress, many  countries still struggle to define and understand human traffic  operations and how to combat it.   Most of us assume that human trafficking transports people only  internationally. In reality, the 2019 Trafficking in Persons Report  showed that a majority of human trafficking survivors were identified  in their countries of citizenship. While women and children may account  for the majority of people trafficked, adolescent boys and men also  have been victims of this modern-day slavery.   Everyone is vulnerable to human trafficking, women, children, foster  youth, Native Americans, immigrant children, those with disabilities,  and the LGBTQ community. That is why the public must be educated on  human trafficking and reject the misconception that it can't or won't  happen to them or someone they know.   While there is not an exact statistic on how many people are  trafficked in the United States, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  assessed as many as 24.9 million people--adults and children--are  trapped in this human form of modern slavery around the world,  including our own country.   We may also assume trafficking occurs only in major cities like New  York or Las Vegas, but it also happens in suburbs, rural areas, and on  Tribal or farmland. In Nebraska, 900 individuals are being sold online  for sex each month, and 75 percent of them are from just Omaha.   I am grateful for the steps Nebraska has taken to combat trafficking  and protect survivors, but legislation can do only so much.  Organizations such as the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland  Security, and the Department of State have worked hard to fight this  global issue and have been trained to locate and deter human  trafficking.   I thank the Nebraska State Patrol, the sheriff departments, and local  law enforcement for their diligent work in capturing traffickers and  rescuing survivors. I thank the many nonprofit volunteer organizations  that are dedicated to making a difference in combating this crime.   In honor of the National Slavery and Human Trafficking Month this  past January, we must commit to work together to address this heinous  crime and ensure that all are safe from exploitation.                Bringing Awareness to Importance of Mentoring     Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Mentoring  Month from this past January. As a member of the Youth Mentoring  Caucus, I rise to bring awareness to the importance of supporting  strategies and policies that enhance mentoring programs and increase  the procurement of quality volunteer mentors.   Research has shown that mentoring relationships have positive effects  on people's lives in so many ways. Mentoring reassures our youth that  they are not alone in dealing with everyday challenges; creates  opportunity for personal growth and development; and provides youth,  especially those in foster care, with vital relationships, networks,  and counseling services needed to navigate life and successfully  transition into adulthood.   I know the power of mentorship firsthand. I joined the Air Force in  1985 after a faith-based mentor saw where my talents leaned, and I  would never have been a five-time commander nor a general officer  without thoughtful mentors.   In my district, MENTOR Nebraska has partnered with 26 Omaha public  schools to implement a mentoring program called Success Mentors, which  serves over 600 youth. Within the last 2 years, the percentage of  mentored youth in North Omaha increased by 150 percent. In the last 5  years, the percentage of mentored juvenile justice youth increased by  250 percent. In addition to a number of positive benefits associated  with increased mentorship, this program has shown an improvement in  school attendance--by over 50 percent in one school alone.   Congress must partner and support State and local governments and  nonprofits so they can continue to prioritize new ways and approaches  for serving at-risk or disadvantaged youth and connect them with caring  adults who will help them navigate life and be their support system.   That is why I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 3061, the Foster Youth  Mentoring Act of 2019, which addresses the need for greater support of  mentoring programs that serve youth in foster care by developing best  practices and quality mentoring standards when searching for and hiring  mentors.   I thank our Nation's mentors, who are actively strengthening our  communities and making a difference in the educational, personal, and  professional lives of today's youth. Additionally, I urge my colleagues  from both sides of the aisle to commit to improving our youth's  outcomes and futures by supporting legislation like H.R. 3061.                            ____________________
