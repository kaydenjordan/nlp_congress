 Mr. Speaker, I was hoping we would be able to get more  accomplished this week that would help the American workers. It is  amazing a party that calls itself the friend of the working class in  America has spent much of the last 10, 12 years doing everything they  can to encourage people to come into the United States illegally so  that they can take the jobs from those hardworking Americans and those  who wanted to work. It has clearly driven down wages for many years  now.   I think that had a lot to do with President Trump's getting a higher  percentage of African Americans and Hispanics than was ever predicted  or that other Republicans have done. I have African American friends in  different places who say that it is pretty clear the party that counts  on getting 90 percent of our vote or so, most places, they haven't done  us any good.   Under 8 years of the Obama administration, especially after the early  part of the administration when the Democrats had the House, the  Senate, and the White House, they got anything they wanted done.   Did they want to fix immigration or the border? No. It was not a  priority at all.   They are more interested in driving us into socialized medicine,  which has made record profits for the big pharmaceuticals, made record  profits for the big insurance companies, and driven the little guys out  of the market.   So we also know, and we have seen in this last election, the part  that the multimillionaires, the megamillionaires, and the billionaires  have played as they poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the  election to try to drive into office people who call themselves  Socialists, Communists, and progressives.   It doesn't take a lot of research to figure out why they would do  that. We saw the policies of the Obama administration and the  Democratic Party have a profound effect on the economy. President Obama  himself--you can find it on video--he finally had to admit that, for  the first time in American history--it was on his watch; it was under  his policies--95 percent of all the income made in America went to the  top 1 percent.   So we can talk about the party that cares deeply about the working  class, but let's look at whom they pandered to in order to get hundreds  of millions of dollars to help in races where we had Republican Members  of Congress who were outspent 10-to-1, 20-to-1, and 30-to-1. It was  dramatic.   Talking to Ted Cruz, he said that they had 18 full-time employees,  which is understandable you would have a lot, because it is the big  State of Texas. You need more than two or three. He had 18 full-time  employees at the time of the election. He said that then he learned  that his opponent, Robert Francis O'Rourke, had over 800 full-time  employees.   What you normally use full-time employees in your campaign for, you  don't have them necessarily go out and do the door knocking and do the  calls, but usually it is your full-time employees who contact others  and solicit volunteers who then go do the block walking, the phone  calls, and all that kind of thing.  [[Page H9754]]    So to have outraised and outspent Ted Cruz so dramatically that you  can have not just 18 employees but really a whole army--platoons and  platoons, 20 platoons or so of full-time employees--it tells you that  that money was not coming from the country's poor in order to drive up  the contributions.   One of the things that I feel really needs to be done--and I haven't  heard anybody mention it in the Democratic Party, and there is probably  a good reason--but one of the things we saw in 2008 when President  Obama, then-candidate Senator Obama ran--we saw little glimpses of it  in the Clinton election years, but we saw it with Robert Francis  O'Rourke--that is contributions that came in under the amount that  required the filing of the name and information about the contributor.   So it is a loophole. Obviously, if you have a loophole, somebody is  going to come along and take advantage. But when you have millions and  millions of dollars contributed in $40, $50 amounts so that you just  list the amount, you don't have to list who the credit card holder was,  so we don't know if there was one credit card that paid for millions of  dollars of $50 contributions. We don't know where that money came from.  We don't even know if it came from the United States or Iran.   When you have that kind of a loophole, heck, you could even have--and  I am just saying it is possible. When you don't have to report where  the money came from, you can say, hypothetically, that we will send  $150 billion to you and your country if you will be sure and send me  millions back for the campaigns I want to help.                                time  1130    I am not saying that happened. I am just saying that is the kind of  thing that is possible, and that loophole needs to be closed. It is  inconvenient to have to report every contributor, but because it is a  loophole that can allow violations of the law without allowing a proper  audit and determination whether the law was violated, that loophole  needs to be closed.   We need to stick in a provision before we leave the majority that  requires the contributor of every dollar to be listed meeting the  Federal requirements: who they are, where they are, and that  information. It needs to be filed.   For heaven's sake, if somebody is doing it with a credit card, it  isn't hard to do that filing. You can get a program that will just do  it on automatic pilot for you.   But in the same way, we know that the Democratic Party has battled  tooth and nail. We have courts, I would say all over the country, but  they are very careful where they file so they can have the most liberal  judges, even though this is an area of complete ignorance of Chief  Justice Roberts, who said there is no such thing as an Obama judge, a  Bush judge. Well, he is right about that.   Really, to say somebody is a Bush judge, that is really not to define  who they are. We have seen appointments under H.W. Bush. I understand  President George H.W. Bush has acknowledged nominating David Souter for  the Supreme Court. I understood that it had come down to Edith Jones,  who is a wonderful, America-loving, brilliant jurist, former chief  judge of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, but it came  down to Edith Jones and David Souter.   I was told by one of Edith's close friends that she was asked to fly  to Washington and actually was at the White House with David Souter  while President George H.W. Bush was trying to make up his mind. Edith  and Souter were both waiting to find out who was going to be tapped to  go out into the Rose Garden, wherever they did it, to make the  announcement of who was going to be the nominee.   Supposedly--I was told, but haven't confirmed--it apparently was John  Sununu who said: I am sure Judge Jones is a great jurist, would be a  great jurist. I don't really know her. But I know David Souter would be  a terrific Supreme Court Justice.   So they said: Go get Souter. And he comes out.   To say that Souter was a Bush appointment doesn't define who he is.  It doesn't tell you anything about who he is.   On the other hand, we have Justice Roberts. And it is nothing against  him from an intentional point. It is simply that he is totally  ignorant, apparently, of the fact that, when someone says this judge or  justice was an Obama justice or judge, then it does define who they  are. They are rock-ribbed liberal. They don't care what the  Constitution says. They fit in nicely at the Ninth Circuit, where one  justice said something years back about: Well, we don't care what the  Constitution says. We figure if we come out with enough opinions, the  Supreme Court can't reverse them all.   To me, it is a bit treasonous. It is unconstitutional. It should be a  basis for impeaching any such judge. But we haven't done that. I was  hoping that our Judiciary Committee would begin to bring in justices  who had shown contempt for the Constitution in violation of their oath.  But because of what I believe was the lack of keeping our promises, we  didn't get enough people out in the last election, and we lost the  majority in the House.   I know we had House Republican leaders whose mantra was, ``When there  is no drama, we win,'' but it seemed very clear. The Senate won. They  picked up a couple of seats because they fought and there was drama,  and they stood up against the outrageous attacks on an honorable man  named Kavanaugh, kind of like Judge Bork. There probably was nobody  more qualified like Judge Bork when he was nominated, but he was a bit  arrogant, so they got the folks to bring him down.   You had Senator Ted Kennedy, who did an amazing job of character  assassination. He was effective in the lies he made up about Bork, and  that kept him from being confirmed. Of course, there was a big  celebration not for the truth, but for the fact that, regardless of the  truth, they were able to block Judge Bork.   The term ``Obama judge'' or ``Obama justice'' is quite definitive. He  was very careful not to appoint anyone who believed in following the  strict language of the Constitution. These are people who had no  problem in doing what I left the bench to do, and that is to legislate.  They have no problem with taking over legislative duties.   Now we have seen we have Obama judges who have no problem taking over  the executive function. Can any judge say that a President cannot put  restrictions and even prevent a reporter from coming and asking  questions when they violate what has been instructed and when the  person in charge, the President, says, ``I have answered your  questions,'' and he doesn't allow a filibuster and the reporter still  will not be obedient? The President needs to be able to say: ``You are  not going to come back and ask any more questions. That is the way it  is.''   It seems to me to be perfectly equivalent, if the President were to  issue an order saying that no Federal judge could go back--or could  limit oral argument, that it is a violation of an attorney's freedom of  speech, but to put a time limit on oral argument.   In the early days of this country, there were no time limits on  arguments before the Supreme Court. I understand Daniel Webster argued  one case for about 3 days. In the Amistad case, John Quincy Adams, one  of my heroes, even though he was a very ineffective President--some say  the best educated, perhaps the most intelligent--but he was determined  to bring an end to slavery.   He was talked into handling the oral argument in the Amistad case  before the Supreme Court when they were meeting downstairs. His  argument spilled into a third day. Since it was multiple days, one of  the nine Justices even died during that time.   That kind of crimps your argument a little bit if you lose a Justice.   They didn't have time limits. You could argue the case as long as you  wanted. In fact, if you go down to the Old Supreme Court Chamber  downstairs, they have two red couches. They are called fainting couches  because lawyers could argue a case as long as they felt like they  should, and sometimes they might grow faint. They had a place to land  if they argued too long and became faint.   If the courts are going to say the President cannot have any  restrictions and put any restrictions on reporters who want to  filibuster a press conference and they can't limit their questions as  long as the reporter wants to talk, then maybe the President should  issue an executive order that no Federal judge can limit the time of  oral argument of any lawyer before the court.  [[Page H9755]]    Now, if that had been the law, that I could not limit oral argument  in a case either during my time as a trial judge, my time as a court of  appeals chief justice, I could not have survived on the bench. You have  got to be able to put a limit on how long argument is going to go on.   But if the courts are going to say the President can't limit a  reporter, it violates his freedom of speech, it sure seems like it is a  violation of a lawyer's freedom of speech for a justice to say: I am  putting a limit of 10 minutes, an hour, 40 minutes, whatever they do.  It seems like that would be a violation as well.   It is just really outrageous, and you would expect either an Obama or  Clinton judge to be the one who would issue such a ridiculous ruling.  Certainly, reporters have freedom of speech, but they do not have a  right to be anywhere they want to be to utilize that speech.   The President can restrict all kinds of areas. As we know, President  Obama did. He shut down tours of the White House for a prolonged period  of time. We had a harder time allowing constituents--I am talking about  Democratic constituents, because we don't care what party anybody is  affiliated with. No party, some party, if they want our help to get a  ticket to tour the White House, we help them. We don't ask them what  party they are a part of.   Apparently, party meant a great deal during the Obama years, and they  had no problems with doing things like violating the law that says you  can't spend more to shut down a Federal site during a government  shutdown than it takes to leave it open.   They spent a lot of money shutting down facilities that didn't  require any money to keep them open. They wanted to make the veterans  suffer and keep them out of their memorials. For some of them, it was  their only chance to see the memorials in their whole life.   The Obama administration didn't care. They shut them down and then  said it is all the Republicans' fault. Even though we passed four  bills, doing everything we could to prevent a government shutdown, the  Senate was hell-bent on having a shutdown, and with the help of John  Boehner saying Republicans did it, it was ridiculous. Maybe he had had  too much to drink that night. I don't know.   We passed four bills in those preceding days, even up until 1 a.m.  The last one was appointing conferees. They didn't include me. They  were people who were ready to get an agreement struck within the hour,  and the Senate would not appoint conferees because they wanted a  shutdown.   I was just heartbroken. I was the one who cut the tape. I hollered at  Steve Palazzo from Mississippi. He had three busloads of veterans out  there. The majority, I think, were in wheelchairs. They couldn't get  in. I came with scissors, cut the tape. I called Steve over. There were  two big barricades. I said: Steve, when I cut the tape, don't hesitate.  You open the left side, I will open the right side, and we will get  this open for our veterans.   I had asked Steve King before we did that to go over and tell the  Park Police closest to us which ones were Members of Congress so they  didn't arrest us and then later say: Oh, we didn't know they were  Members of Congress. We had a right to be there, and we had a right to  inspect the facilities. So, Steve took care of that detail for us.   Once he had done that, then I cut the ribbon. And he opened the left  one; I opened the right one. I didn't even notice there was a bagpipe  player who had worked his way up right behind me and Steve. So when we  opened those barricades, the first guy through behind us was the  bagpipe player. It was awesome to see all those veterans rolling in in  wheelchairs right behind the bagpipe player. It was a beautiful sight.  But it was tragic to see the way the Obama administration wanted to  punish our veterans.   After I left there to go try to help open the Iwo Jima Monument  access, I came by and could see the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. I  couldn't believe they had barricaded that. It is a walk-through  memorial.                                time  1145    Yes, they wanted to blame Republicans, but they spent a lot of money  to blockade a facility that you walk through. It is a moving memorial  to most of us, but they blocked people out of that.   So when you couple that kind of callousness toward the middle-class  patriots of this country who risked life and limb--some of them lost  limbs--and you want to punish them to make a political point, it was  outrageous.   Then, when you see that the economic policies of an administration,  the Obama administration, which claimed to be looking out for the  little guy, where basically they kept holding out--luring people into  the United States illegally by their failure and refusal to protect our  borders.   It is clear they drove down wages. People had not had a wage  increase, when adjusted for inflation, for a very long time.   When anybody really studies socialism--and I am not talking about the  games that are played in so many universities now about this glorious  thing called socialism, progressivism, communism.   When you really look historically at what that means, in socialism  there is no middle class. You have the ruling class, and you have the  ruled class. Now, someday in heaven, then everybody will share and  share alike and do so joyfully. But in this world, where no human being  is perfect, there is always going to be jealousy.   You are always going to have circumstances like I found as an  exchange student in the Soviet Union when I asked a bunch of farmers  sitting in the shade in the middle of the morning: When do you work out  in the fields?   They looked terrible. You couldn't even tell what they had cultivated  and what they hadn't. And they laughed, and I thought I had said  something wrong in Russian.   One of them responded: I make the same number of rubles if I am out  there in the sun as I do here in the shade, so I am here in the shade.   That explains why socialism, communism, it never, ever works in this  world. It never, ever will. You are left with a ruling class that gets  all kinds of privilege--that doesn't have to worry about money, they  get everything they want--and then the ruled class.   And their healthcare stinks. Being over in the Soviet Union for that  summer and being exposed to their socialized medicine, I literally  thanked God that I was American and never had to worry about socialized  medicine. It just seemed like they were 20, 30 years behind where we  were. And I lived in the small town of Mount Pleasant. We had a lot  better healthcare than they had over there at some of the larger  cities. It was amazing.   But, if you are going to use socialism and you are going to pay a  physician the same amount of money whether they see 5 people or 100  people, then the physicians have no incentive to take care of as many  people as they physically can. They have an incentive to see as few as  they can. And, in a socialized medicine situation, the physicians don't  get paid all that much.   Now, the big pharmaceuticals, Big Pharma, the big insurance  companies--not the little ones, the big ones--and pharmaceuticals that  signed on to support ObamaCare, they could tell, and I could tell from  reading the bill, that they were going to make billions and billions  more than they have ever made in their history.   As I told some of their lobbyists, you guys signed your own death  warrant. Yeah, you are going to make billions and billions more, maybe  15 years; but then, eventually, you are going to be capped. And you are  not going to be able to collect for research and development. You are  going to be unable to keep creating lifesaving, life-enhancing  medications, and you are going to be like a Third World pharmaceutical.   They didn't care, because these guys had golden parachutes. They knew  they would make billions more because of what Obama did for them. And  they did, and they have, and they still are.   Yes, we have lost a lot of insurance companies, but the big  companies, they are doing great. They are doing real well. In fact, I  was shocked; I missed it when I read the bill, but these biggest  insurance companies could even get bailouts in years they made record  profits.   We were able to stop some of that while we had the majority, but I  guess  [[Page H9756]]  those kind of things won't be stopped next year. The Democrats that  passed ObamaCare are probably not going to be restricting the big money  coming to the big insurance companies because I am sure a lot of that  will come back in the way of political contributions.   So, there is a lot that needs to be done. We have not been faithful,  as a party, to keep our promises. The number one issue, I think, that  got President Trump elected was that he was going to secure the border:  We are going to get a wall built where we need it.   And I really do believe what he said, that if he had the cooperation  of Congress, he was going to be able to make Mexico pay for it. And I  felt like he eventually would.   But if there is no wall built--not in all places do we need it. We  don't need 2,000 miles of it, but there are some places where we  definitely need it. But these invasions--whether you want to call them  caravans, they are really invasions. Even though the alt-left media  like CNN and MSNBC were saying it is all big lies about these caravans,  there are no invasions, there are no caravans, it is all a political  hoax--well, it was not a political hoax. They were either intentionally  lying, or they were just ignorant. Either way, they were wrong.   Then we see yesterday information about at least a third of those who  are wanting to crash into our country, invade our country, have serious  healthcare issues. And they are going to make a lot of Americans sick  if they come in.   Now, there is no country in the history of the world that has been  more generous, more philanthropic, has done more good for other  countries, other peoples all over the world. But, in order to maintain  that, you have to have a vibrant economy. And, actually, to do that, to  care for the environment, you have got to have a vibrant economy.   So we should be doing reconciliation, get the money for the  President's wall, and do it now before we turn over the majority.  Anything else is a betrayal of our promises.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 11 o'clock and 53 minutes  a.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Tuesday,  December 4, 2018, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
