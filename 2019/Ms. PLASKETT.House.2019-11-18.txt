 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, tonight we will address mental health  within the Black community, the lack of access to treatment, and the  stigma of mental health within our community.   The stigma of mental health and lack of access to treatment within  the Black community frequently leads to Black people ignoring or  dismissing those signs of illness.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) to  give remarks on this and other matters of health in our community as  well as in America.                                time  2030     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so much for her  admonishment to us to continue working, to continue doing what is  necessary for those of us who live in the Black community, for those  who are affected by what is a lack of treatment in the Black community,  particularly in the area of mental health.   This may explain why Black adults are 20 percent more likely to be  reported having serious psychological distress than White adults. They  are also more likely to have feelings of sadness, helplessness, and  worthlessness compared to their White counterparts. And while less  likely than their White counterparts to die from suicide, Black  teenagers are more likely to attempt suicide than our White teenagers.   Socioeconomic determinants have been found to have significant  effects on mental health. In the Black community, class and poverty are  two powerful, impactful factors.   Black adults living in poverty are two to three times more likely to  report serious psychological distress than those living above the  poverty line.   Black people of all ages are more likely to be victims of serious  violent crime than non-Hispanic Whites, making them more likely to meet  the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder.   Mental health conditions do not discriminate based on race, color,  gender, or identity. Anyone can experience the challenges of mental  illness, regardless of their background. However, cultural differences,  life experiences, socioeconomic conditions, and how well-informed one  is can affect how an individual copes with these conditions.   In the Virgin Islands, after the devastating storms of 2017, studies  organized by the Community Foundation of  [[Page H8950]]  the Virgin Islands found that the trauma and lack of community caused a  significant percentage of the population, both children and adults  alike, to develop various mental health problems.   Younger children are reverting to behaviors they had once advanced  beyond, and older children are displaying cognitive impairment and  aggressive tendencies.   Also, about 60 percent of adults in the Virgin Islands are exhibiting  symptoms of depression; the same percentage showed signs of PTSD.   More than a year after the storms, 40 percent of surveyed students  had symptoms of PTSD, with some admitting to having suicidal thoughts.   Although anyone can develop a mental health problem, African  Americans sometimes experience more severe forms of mental health  conditions due to unmet needs and other barriers.   According to the Health and Human Services Offices of Minority  Health, African Americans are 20 percent more likely to experience  serious psychological distress. Black Americans are also more likely to  experience socioeconomic disparities, such as exclusion from health,  educational, social, and economic resources, and are often not believed  by medical professionals when reporting symptoms--often not believed.  These disparities contribute to unfavorable mental health outcomes.   Historical adversity, including slavery, sharecropping, segregation,  along with other means of race-based exclusions from health,  educational, and socioeconomic resources, have led us to the  disparities experienced by Black Americans today. Despite progressive  gains and reform in our society, racism lingers and continues to impact  the Black community, including the state of mental health.   One of the individuals who is fighting this--not just mental health,  but all health issues, and particularly among African Americans, the  Black community--is my colleague from Chicago, Congresswoman Robin  Kelly. She leads the Congressional Black Caucus in health areas by  leading our Braintrust on Health and has spent a significant amount of  time in her district and throughout this country highlighting the  issues that affect African Americans, disparities in health issues, as  well as mental health.    I ask her to speak to you, Mr. Speaker, about those issues that  affect Black Americans, about those issues that impact our community  and, therefore, impacts America, that does not let us be our best.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for  what she has said, and, Mr. Speaker, I would engage the Congresswoman,  through the Chair, in a discussion. I know that she has been going  around the country to so many districts and talked with so many people  about healthcare, about the disparities of health.   Is there a connection between the lack of access to physical  healthcare and how it affects communities in terms of mental care as  well?   I yield to the gentlewoman.    I think so much about when the gentlewoman said people  talk about post-traumatic stress disorder, and there are so many people  in our country who are having present-day traumatic stress disorder.   In the Black community, there is this stigma to just live through it,  not discuss it, and begin normalizing the kind of life that we lead,  the kind of fear that many people in Black communities have, whether it  is fear of being shot or fear of the police.   Mr. Speaker, I think, as a Black mother having four sons, I begin to  think that it is normal to be concerned for my sons out at night. That  is not normal, and that is going to affect your mental state after a  while.   So I think of all these people and the things that they are going  through.                                time  2045    Right. It should not be normal. We are, unfortunately, normalizing  some things. But no, that should not be normal.   Every mother worries about their child, but it shouldn't be, ``If my  child is not home by a certain time, I am so worried,'' and all of  these things that are going through your mind. That should not be  normal for us.   The other thing is, when you are stressing out about certain things,  that not only affects your mental health, but it affects your physical  health also. It affects your body head to toe, which is not good  either. Then it gets into the high blood pressure that we face and  heart disease and those kinds of things.   It really does have a huge effect all over, not just on one thing or  the other.    I think about how, if a family has individuals with  diabetes, hypertension, the other issues, and they are taking money and  time to deal with that--if, in fact, they are--they are not considering  going to counseling or going to some other things about depression or  other things that they may be feeling and things that may be happening  within their home.   It is a matter of taking care of what is the immediacy.   Still, the stigma is there that your mental health is not as  important as your physical health.   I yield to the gentlewoman.    Then there is the issue of having culturally sensitive  doctors as well.    Because so many individuals in the African American  community, if they are going to speak with a psychiatrist, a mental  health professional, if that individual does not--never mind that they  don't look like them, but if they are not culturally sensitive to the  issues, they may not come back the second time. They may not even make  the appointment if they realize that this person is not going to be  able to understand the life that they lead here as a Black person in  America.   I yield to the gentlewoman.    I was looking at a statistic here that, according to  the Health Resources and Services Administration, 89.3 million  Americans live in federally designated mental health professional  shortage areas, in contrast to only 55.3 million Americans living in  similarly designated primary care shortage areas and 44.6 million  living in dental health shortage areas.   There is, within the greater American society, a shortage of those  professionals in the mental health area. For African Americans, that  number is exacerbated with African Americans that look like themselves.   We are just thinking about the Speaker earlier today issuing a  statement saying that the Senate is considering cutting all funding-- not supporting funding for HBCUs, historically Black colleges and  universities, where we know that a preponderance of the African  Americans in the mental health area have been going to school.   I yield to the gentlewoman.    You have rural in your area as well.    The other area is that those even who receive  treatment, one of the things that we have noted is that African  Americans are negatively affected by prejudice and discrimination when  they are in the healthcare system.   Missed diagnoses, inadequate treatment, improper bedside manner, and  [[Page H8952]]  lack of cultural competence all lead to an exacerbation of health  issues that cause distrust and prevent many African Americans from  seeking help in the healthcare area.   I yield to the gentlewoman.    I know that there have been studies, which you were  just discussing, where Black women are historically mistreated by  doctors because they do not believe African American women when they  say that they are not feeling well or when they are complaining about  an ache or a pain, that a diagnosis on a larger scale is not done on  them once they say that.    This cuts across all economics of African Americans.  This is not just about poor Black women.    This happens at the highest economic levels of Black  women dying in great numbers after giving birth to children.    I thank Ms. Kelly for her leadership and continued  support on this subject.   For those who need a voice here in Washington, I know she is at the  forefront, not just on mental health issues but all health issues,  including the fact that she has considered gun violence a health issue.  She is fighting for additional funding at NIH in this area.   The totality of the health of the American people, I think, is so  important, and I am grateful for Ms. Kelly's leadership in that and her  continuing to bring up these topics.    One of the things, Mr. Speaker, that we wanted to talk  about was Blacks being overrepresented in prison: 1 million of the  total 2.3 million people incarcerated in the United States. One million  of those 2.3 million are, in fact, African American. That is another  area for mental health that Black Americans face.   A current major national concern: People of color account for 60  percent of the prison population. While only 14 percent of Black people  are drug users, we account for 37 percent of drug arrests.   This incarceration could contribute to mental health issues of Black  people and raises questions surrounding the delivery of mental health  services in prison.   The reverse is also true. The lack of access to mental health testing  and treatment may, in fact, lead to incarceration. This reality leads  to real issues in healthcare regarding access, mental health, and  quality care treatment.   Treatment issues that must be addressed include the fact that the  Black community is overrepresented in inpatient treatment and  underrepresented in outpatient treatment, highlighting the need for  more early education and intervention.   Regarding misdiagnosis and access to care, access is a central point  of contention when thinking about the care of Black psychiatric  patients. Often, communities such as my district are not equipped with  adequate facilities and services. In the Virgin Islands, there is not  just a lack of inpatient care for mental health but outpatient as well.   At this point, we have almost no separate mental health facility.  Either individuals have to be sent off-island or, unfortunately, many  people are sent to correctional facilities for nonviolent crimes who  are experiencing, in fact, a mental health issue.   Unfortunately, over a year ago, we lost a young man who obviously had  very severe mental health issues that his family had been treating him  for. He had been sent to prison because we don't have that mental  health facility. He, in fact, lost his life in the correctional  facility, knowing that this poor young man had mental health services  that he needed and that our island does not have the resources, the  funding, to be able to provide.   Research has shown that a lack of cultural competency in mental  healthcare, as I discussed earlier and as you heard from Congresswoman  Kelly, results in misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment.   While Black patients may prefer Black physicians, only about 2 to 4  percent of mental health providers identify as Black--2 to 4 percent-- in this country, meaning that Black patients are likely to be seen by a  provider from a different cultural and ethnic background than their  own.   Similarly, in research, there is a paucity of Black researchers and  Black patients participating in research, which is problematic as  research is the basis for evidence-based clinical care.   These are all issues that are affecting the Black community.   Some may think that we also have the stigma of what do we as African  Americans think. African Americans are reluctant to discuss mental  health issues and seek treatment because of the shame and the stigma  associated with such conditions.   Many African Americans also have trouble recognizing the signs and  symptoms of mental health conditions, leading to underestimating the  effects and the impacts of mental health conditions. That affects all  of us, at all levels.   I know, as a parent, as an African American parent, I have been one  individual who has done this also, not recognizing when a son is  feeling depressed and just thinking that he needs to suck it up and go  on with his work and do what he needs to do and thinking that, ``You  already know that you are a Black man in America. You don't have time  to feel sorry for yourself. You have to push through,'' and realizing  that that son was really depressed and needed to get some mental health  treatment.   These are things that are affecting our community, and we need to be  upfront about what we are facing. Some may think of depression as the  blues or something that needs to be snapped out of.   ADHD in a child is often regarded as a child being bad. Too often,  young Black men are put in suspension or, even at the age of  kindergarten, separated from school, taken out of the classroom because  of bad behavior that a teacher recognized. That same behavior in a  White student is not seen that way.                                time  2100    Those signs, that lack of sensitivity begins at the youngest age in  Black America, and those are the things that we must be careful about.   Oftentimes, people assume that their emotional mental state is  normal, not realizing that they are suffering from disordered thinking  or a clinical symptom.   Approximately 30 percent of African American adults with mental  illness receive treatment each year, compared  [[Page H8953]]  to the U.S. average of 43 percent. Here are some the reasons why.   Socioeconomic factors play a part, too, and can make treatment  options less available. In 2017, 11 percent of African Americans had no  form of health insurance.   For the Virgin Islands, we have this issue as well. We have only one  full-time and one part-time psychiatrist for our islands. Today, the  traumas of the storms that rocked the territory have become apparent,  and, as a result, mental health is being talked about more frequently.   I am grateful that our Governor, Governor Bryan, is declaring a  mental health state of emergency for our islands, being clear-eyed and  noticing that this is such an issue that we must face.   However, access to mental health treatment is still in dire need of  improvement. For many years, the lack of a facility and mental health  providers have led to the Virgin Islands' government spending millions  of dollars to send mental health patients off-island due to an  inability to treat them within the territory. The cost of sending  children off-island for mental health treatment totals $13 million a  year, a significant amount for a jurisdiction with a small annual  budget.   The territory currently has no inpatient facilities. Outpatient  facilities are unsuited to meet the needs of the Virgin Islands.   A 2019 study conducted by the Caribbean Exploratory Research Center  found that 6 out of 10 Virgin Islanders showed depressive symptoms. The  same study revealed the symptoms of PTSD in 57 percent of adults. These  extraordinary numbers display a mental health crisis within the Virgin  Islands that does not have the fiscal, occupational, or infrastructural  capacity to handle.   The lack of mental health professionals and mental health education  and awareness creates a barrier for many obtaining care. But I know  that the Virgin Islands is not the only place that faces this. Places  like inner cities within the United States, Detroit and elsewhere, also  experience these mental health issues.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge my colleague, one of my  close friends here, a classmate of mine coming into Congress in the  same class, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, who has made extraordinary  strides in supporting not just the people of her district, but also  being one of the co-chairs of the Women's Caucus here in Washington,  continually bringing to light the issues that face women.   Just earlier this evening, she had a dinner, women who had been  incarcerated and the mental stress that they were dealing with being  incarcerated. One woman, I know, Congresswoman, she discussed having  her sentence with a 6-month old child that she had to stop  breastfeeding because she had to go to prison, a woman, 2 weeks after  giving birth, having been sent to prison for being a girlfriend of a  drug dealer. These are the kinds of things that women in America have  been dealing with.   Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful to Congresswoman Lawrence for taking  the lead on supporting women in this country, for talking about  inequities and always dealing with issues that affect those Americans  who cannot speak here in these Halls.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence)  to discuss these issues with us.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to also acknowledge the work  that another Member of Congress, Max Rose, does in mental health  related to veterans. We know so many of those veterans are, in fact,  African American, coming back home after having served this country,  facing already racial disparities, facing issues of race in America, as  well as the trauma of what they have been through in serving us.   We are grateful for that support to those veterans so that they can  sustain themselves, get back to being productive in this country. I  want to thank the gentleman for that work that he has done.   But I just want to close with letting people know about some  statistics and then giving them a charge.   According to the American Psychiatric Association, African Americans  are less likely to receive guideline-consistent care, less frequently  included in research, and more likely to use emergency rooms or primary  care rather than mental health specialists. Only one in three African  Americans who need mental healthcare receive it.   Plaguing issues of poverty, mass incarceration, and financial  hardship have increased mental illness and suicide in the African  American community.   I just want to give people a charge: Start the conversation about  mental  [[Page H8954]]  health with your peers. Show compassion. Do not be judgmental. Your  language matters.   Advocate, if not for yourself, for your family, for your community.  Write down all the things that make you upset, for example, media,  police brutality, poor perception/narrative of African Americans. Write  it down and embrace your voice.   In the Black community, more people promoting solidarity are talking  about their struggles publicly, but we need more people to share their  experiences. We are at our best when human connection and connectivity  happen. Share your story.   I thank the men and women who, across the Nation, are fighting to end  the stigma, do the research, and make mental health treatment more  accessible in the Black community, including our own, in the Virgin  Islands, Dr. Janis Valmond, deputy commissioner for health promotion  and disease prevention, who has provided a lot of the information I had  tonight.   The Congressional Black Caucus uses this Special Order hour to let  America know what is happening in our community.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 11 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, November 19, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
