 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a great public servant from  my district, Denise Wilkerson.   Ms. Wilkerson is the council president for the city of Roselle, New  Jersey, but her dedication to her community extends far beyond her city  council work. She also is the president of the Union County National  Organization for Women. She served as second vice president of the  National Council of Negro Women in Roselle, as well.   She is actively involved in her local NAACP chapter, and, in  addition, she is the executive director of Abounding Women Community  Outreach. This nonprofit is dedicated to empowering women through their  community events and professional skills training.   She is a vibrant part of my community, and I am glad to commend her  from the floor of the United States House of Representatives on this  day. She deserves all the accolades we can give her and much more.                            ____________________
