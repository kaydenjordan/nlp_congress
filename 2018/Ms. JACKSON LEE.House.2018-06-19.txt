 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3192,  the ``CHIP Mental Health Parity Act.''   H.R. 3192 would ensure access to mental health and substance use  disorder prevention and treatment services for children under the  Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).   Beginning in infancy and continuing through adolescence, children  need access to mental health screening and assessment and a complete  array of evidence-based therapeutic services.   Around 1 in 5 children in the U.S. suffers from a diagnosable mental  disorder, but only 20 to 25 percent of affected children will receive  treatment.   Untreated mental health and substance use disorders are associated  with family dysfunction, school expulsion, poor school performance,  juvenile incarceration, unemployment, and suicide.   CHIP has been an essential source of children's health coverage,  ensuring that families have access to high quality, affordable,  pediatric health care for children in working families whose parents  earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to purchase  private health insurance on their own.   Given the prevalence of mental health and substance use disorders in  children and the nationwide opioid epidemic, it is essential now more  than ever that all children and adolescents enrolled in CHIP have  access to mental health and substance use disorder screening and  treatment.   There are currently over 400,000 CHIP recipients in Texas.   This figure is significantly less than in 2014, when nearly half of  all children in Texas were enrolled in CHIP or Medicaid.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 3192 and the estimated 8.9  million children across the United States who rely on CHIP for their  necessary health services.    Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 5605, the ``Advancing  High Quality Treatment for Opioid Use Disorders in Medicare Act.''   This important bill provides applicable beneficiaries increased  access to opioid use disorder treatment services and will improve  physical and mental health outcomes for such beneficiaries.   In 2016, approximately one-third of Medicare beneficiaries received  an opioid prescription, 500,000 of which received high doses of opioids  yet many lack access to quality treatment for substance abuse.   This legislation would create an Alternative Payment Model (APM)  demonstration program to incentivize the delivery of high quality,  evidence-based substance use disorder treatment services.   The voluntary program would enroll eligible beneficiaries who agree  to receive Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment services through  providers and institutions participating in the Program.   To support those who are suffering from opioid use disorders, we must  employ a multi-faceted approach that actually achieves results.   The purpose of the Advancing High Quality Treatment for Opioid Use  Disorders in Medicare Act is to assist states in the implementation of  a variety of strategies, including:   Reducing hospitalizations and emergency department visits;   Increasing the use of medication-assisted treatment for opioid use  disorders;   Improving health outcomes of individuals with opioid use disorders,  including by reducing the incidence of infectious diseases (such as  hepatitis C and HIV);   Reducing deaths from opioid overdose; and   Reducing the utilization of inpatient residential treatment.   Under the Program, the Secretary of the Health and Human Services  shall make payments to participants for:   Furnishing opioid use disorder treatment services delivered through  opioid use disorder care teams; or   Arranging for such service to be furnished, to applicable  beneficiaries participating in the Program.   The current surge of opioid usage requires a strong, national  response, and with passage of the Advancing High Quality Treatment for  Opioid Use Disorders in Medicare Act, we are addressing this issue.   Opioid use disorder leads to physical and functional changes to parts  of the brain affecting impulse, reward, and motivation.   In recent years, it is estimated that 2.1 million individuals in the  United States have an opioid use disorder.   This legislation would require APM demonstration program participants  to provide both medication as well as psychosocial supports, such as  care management, psychotherapy, treatment planning and appropriate  social services to treat substance use disorder, which is considered  the gold standard of care.   Voluntary APM demonstration program participation would be  prioritized in regions with high prevalence of opioid use disorders.   Care teams would require inclusion of health care providers who are  licensed to dispense opioid medications for the purpose of  detoxification or maintenance treatment for opioid use disorder, as  well as appropriate providers of psychosocial treatment.  [[Page H5243]]    In addition, in conjunction with stakeholders, the Health and Human  Services Secretary would develop quality and outcome measures to assess  the care beneficiaries receive through the Program.   Participating providers or institutes will receive a monthly case  management fee for all beneficiaries receiving opioid treatment  services.   Program participants will receive a higher case management fee if  their care team includes an addiction specialist, and for the  initiation of treatment period, which is treatment and resource  intensive.   Participants would be eligible to receive an additional incentive  payment for providing quality substance use disorder treatment care.   The demonstration program is authorized for four years and capped at  20,000 participants.   I am confident that the comprehensive approach we are taking to  address those suffering from Opioid Use Disorder will help address the  nation's growing epidemic.   For these reasons, I support the Advancing High Quality Treatment for  Opioid Use Disorders in Medicare Act and the goal of ensuring the best  possible response to treat opioid use disorder in America.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5811,  which amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to  post approval study requirements for certain controlled substances.   H.R. 5811 allows the FDA to require that pharmaceutical manufacturers  study certain drugs after they are approved to assess any potential  reduction in those drugs' effectiveness for the conditions of use  prescribed, recommended, or suggested in labeling.   In recent years, many communities have been devastated by the number  of overdoses that have been related to the escalating opioid epidemic.   According to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, illegal  substances, deadly synthetics such as fentanyl, and legally available  pain relievers accounted for more than 42,000 deaths across the country  in 2016.   Further, in the city of Houston, there were 364 drug-related overdose  deaths alone that happened in 2016 according to the Treatment Center, a  highly respected drug and alcohol addiction treatment service center.   This is a national emergency that deserves immediate action.   H.R. 5811 would expand an existing mandate that requires drug  developers to conduct post-approval studies or clinical trials for  certain drugs.   FDA will provide doctors and patients the information they need to  use medicines wisely.   This will ensure that drugs, both brand-name and generic, work  correctly and that their health benefits outweigh their known risks.   Under current law, in certain instances, the FDA can require studies  or clinical trials after a drug has been approved.   H.R. 5811 would permit the FDA to use that authority if the reduction  in a drug's effectiveness meant that its benefits no longer outweighed  its costs.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass H.R. 5811.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise to commemorate Juneteenth,  as a Texan and one who acknowledges that it was my State, 153 years  ago, June 19, 1865, where General Gordon Granger rode into Galveston,  Texas, and announced the freedom of the last American slaves, belatedly  freeing 250,000 slaves in Texas nearly 2\1/2\ years after Abraham  Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.   Having spent 2 days at the border, I know that there are 2,000  children who have been separated from their families who are seeking  freedom. I rise today in honor of Juneteenth because it was and is a  living symbol of freedom for people who did not have it.   Today, I introduced H. Res. 948, the annual congressional resolution  commemorating Juneteenth Independence Day, which is cosponsored by more  than 50 of my colleagues. Juneteenth remains the oldest known  celebration of slavery's demise.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that we need to be able to honor the issue  of freedom, so I conclude by saying that the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr., once said, ``Freedom is never free,'' and African American  labor leader A. Phillip Randolph often said, ``Freedom is never given;  it is won.''   We must win the freedom for these children, 2,000, who have been  separated from their families.   Mr. Speaker, 153 years ago, on June 19, 1865, General Gordon Granger  rode into Galveston, Texas and announced the freedom of the last  American slaves; belatedly freeing 250,000 slaves in Texas nearly two  and a half years after Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation  Proclamation.   Juneteenth was first celebrated in the Texas state capital in 1867  under the direction of the Freedmen's Bureau.   Juneteenth was and is a living symbol of freedom for people who did  not have it.   Today, I introduced H. Res. 948, the annual congressional resolution  commemorating Juneteenth Independence Day, which is co-sponsored by  more than 50 of my colleagues.   Juneteenth remains the oldest known celebration of slavery's demise.   It commemorates freedom while acknowledging the sacrifices and  contributions made by courageous African Americans towards making our  great nation the more conscious and accepting country that it has  become.   It was only after that day in 1865 when General Granger rode into  Galveston, Texas, on the heels of the most devastating conflict in our  country's history, in the aftermath of a civil war that pitted brother  against brother, neighbor against neighbor and threatened to tear the  fabric of our union apart forever that America truly became the land of  the free and the home of the brave.   The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ``Freedom is never  free,'' and African American labor leader A. Phillip Randolph often  said ``Freedom is never given. It is won.''   Truer words were never spoken.   We should all recognize the power and the ironic truth of those  statements and we should pause to remember the enormous price paid by  all Americans in our country's quest to realize its promise.  [[Page H5275]]    Juneteenth honors the end of the 400 years of suffering African  Americans endured under slavery and celebrates the legacy of  perseverance that has become the hallmark of the African American  experience in the struggle for equality.   In recent years, a number of National Juneteenth Organizations have  arisen to take their place alongside older organizations--all with the  mission to promote and cultivate knowledge and appreciation of African  American history and culture.   Juneteenth celebrates African American freedom while encouraging  self-development and respect for all cultures.   But it must always remain a reminder to us all that liberty and  freedom are precious birthrights of all Americans which must be  jealously guarded and preserved for future generations.   As it takes on a more national and even global perspective, the  events of 1865 in Texas are not forgotten, for all of the roots tie  back to this fertile soil from which a national day of pride is  growing.                            ____________________
