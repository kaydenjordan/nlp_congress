 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Senior Master  Sergeant Jess Roper, who has served as my Department of Defense fellow  this past year.   Jess has served in the Air Force for 18 years, primarily as a Korean  linguist, and has been stationed across the country and around the  world, from California to South Korea, from Hawaii to Iraq.   Jess' contributions to my office are countless. She staffed me  through my work on the House Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence, she has overseen the introduction of legislation on  cybersecurity and mental health, and she has delivered on priorities  for the Servicewomen and Women Veterans Caucus, as well.   Jess' dedication to public service is something we should all aspire  to, but she is also so much more than that.   To date, she has completed 72 marathons, including one in Antarctica.  She holds two master's degrees and is also recently a first-time  homeowner. She is an amazing woman.   While my team and I are very sad to see her go, we are so thrilled  that she was assigned to us, and she will always be ours.   I wish her nothing but the absolute best as she moves forward in her  career.   Jess, aim high, and God speed.                            ____________________
