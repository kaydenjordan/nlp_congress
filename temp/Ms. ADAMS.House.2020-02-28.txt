 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2339, the  Protecting American Lungs and Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act.   In 1999, I was tapped to serve as one of the founding members of the  American Legacy Foundation whose mission was to create a world where  young people reject tobacco, and anyone can quit. For 7 years I served  as vice chair of Legacy as we fought to help create a tobacco-free  generation. That organization is known today as the Truth Initiative.   We helped air the first advertisements that curtailed teen cigarette  use and started us toward the end of an epidemic, but our work is not  yet done. We have a new epidemic on our hands, one we cannot ignore.   In 2019, over 5 million middle and high school students used e- cigarettes. That is up almost two million students from 2018. H.R. 2339  tackles this problem. By prohibiting the sale of all flavored tobacco  products, we protect our children from the scourge of nicotine  addiction.   To be blunt, this legislation puts health before profit, and that is  the truth.                            ____________________
