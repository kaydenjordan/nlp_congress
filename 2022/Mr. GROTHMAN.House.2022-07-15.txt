 Madam Speaker, I would like to address the current  situation in Ukraine.   Obviously, everyday people in Ukraine and Russia are dying, and I am  concerned that the current administration has no particular plan, or at  least we are not told of any plan or goal, as to where we want to wind  up.   Ukraine has the second lowest birthrate of any country in a country  of that size in the world. It is lower than all but South Korea. Russia  also has a very low birthrate. Even before the war, a lot of Russians  were leaving Russia, at least subjectively from what I have seen when I  toured the southern border of the United States.   The combination of immigration and low birthrate means that the  primary goal of the leaders of both these countries should be to make  sure we get the number of Russians and Ukrainians up, not going the  opposite direction.   In any event, I do not know. We have not met collectively since March  to have a briefing for all the legislators as to what the opinions of  the Biden administration are. So I am going to ask the press maybe to  ask a few questions to find out whether they are working with anybody  to try to reach some sort of end to this war or if they don't care if  it goes on for another 6 months.                            ____________________
