 Mr. Speaker, my understanding is the longest recorded  vote in the House in the past has been 2 hours and 50 minutes. This  motion has been open a similar amount of time.   May I ask how long you intend to keep the House suspended with this  vote?    Mr. Speaker, I have a further parliamentary inquiry.    With one vacancy in the House of Representatives, 217  votes represents a clear majority on your side. The clear majority  means that the vote will not change regardless of who else shows up. It  is time to close this vote.    Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, is it possible to defeat this motion  currently with 217 votes up on the board?    And with the full number of the House being 434, this is  a majority vote. It is anatomically impossible to defeat this with more  than 217 votes. They don't exist.    Mr. Speaker, I would just submit, anyone who is up  watching C-SPAN at this hour wonders what in the heck the House is  doing right now. All the problems we have to solve, and this is the  best we can muster.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the chairman of  the House Committee on Rules for yielding me the customary 30 minutes,  and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, you have to ask, What in the world have people been  thinking today?   Congress--which doesn't enjoy a high approval rating in general--the  Democratic leadership and Speaker have shown such disrespect and  disdain for every Member on both sides of the aisle that it will be  very, very difficult to repair that damage.   Now, exactly 12 hours late, we are considering a rule that provides  for the consideration of a so-called Build Back Better Act. The final  text of the bill, of course, does not have an opinion from the  Congressional Budget Office, and the final text of the bill has been  difficult to obtain, but now, there for all to see but none to read, it  certainly does not provide for the American people.   So let's just briefly recap the series of events: in an emergency  August session, the House deemed passed on a procedural vote the budget  resolution--not a real vote, a procedural vote--setting the top line  reconciliation levels. In September, the 13 committees of jurisdiction  did markup their portions. The Budget Committee held a markup on a  Saturday night on a zoom call without a score from the Congressional  Budget Office.                                time  2030    Speaker Pelosi, Democratic Senators, and the White House then engaged  in a new round of negotiations, guaranteeing that after over a month of  work--very partisan work--this bill would become wholly new legislation  before heading to the House floor.   With only a few hours' notice, the Rules Committee met last week on  rushed reconciliation text that did not include language for every  title. In the middle of this hearing, Speaker Pelosi decided to  abruptly end testimony as her hastily crafted agreement completely  collapsed.   We were then called back on Wednesday of this week to restart  consideration on even newer text with very little time to review. I  wish I could tell you everything that is in this bill, but we really  haven't had the time. I guess we will have to follow the lead of  Speaker Pelosi at another time when she said we will have to pass the  bill to find out what is in it.   This is the most expensive piece of legislation in the history of the  United States House of Representatives. The spending in this bill is  five times America's annual defense budget, seven times the cost of the  interstate highway system, five times annual Medicare spending, and  more than the gross domestic products of Canada and Mexico combined. If  enacted, new spending will be more than the total combined annual wages  of the American people. Think about that for a minute. If you tax the  American people every single dollar they earn, you still would not be  paying for this bill, but Democrats seem unconcerned with this  discrepancy.   This bill includes a Methane Emissions Reduction Program. Methane is  a pollutant if released into the atmosphere, but it is also a valuable  commodity in the form of natural gas; it heats homes, it runs our  plants that generate electricity. Domestic energy protection has  skyrocketed over the past few decades, and yet at the same time methane  emissions in the United  [[Page H6218]]  States of America have fallen 15 percent over that timeframe.   Instead of building on this progress and welcoming the innovation,  this provision would provide millions of taxpayer dollars to create a  new natural gas tax, increasing the cost of residential natural gas by  up to 34 percent.   During the Rules Committee meeting, I submitted an amendment that  would strike this methane language and instead provide incentives to  build the infrastructure necessary to get this valuable product to  consumers.   Stranded gas in the Permian basin could be shipped to major  population centers in the eastern part of the the country, or shipped  overseas, but we couldn't find the necessary money to do that in a $5  trillion bill.   This package also provided billions of dollars to roll out electric  vehicles and electric vehicle infrastructure--basically toys for rich  people. There are also subsidies for electric vehicles manufactured  using union labor. Ironically, these pro-labor provisions could put  thousands of nonunion auto workers out of a job. The subsidies would  also breach international trade agreements. I submitted an amendment to  remove this language, but it too was not considered.   This bill contemplates an expansive drug pricing provision. This  proposal claims to protect research and development, yet the Secretary  still has the ability to set the price of any new drug at any level the  Secretary wishes, even zero. There is no judicial review of arbitrary  decisions.   Additionally, disagreeing with the prices set by the Secretary will  result in a 95 percent excise tax. Under this bill, the government will  be the deciding factor determining which drugs and which cures can come  to market and be available to the American people.   I am specifically concerned about funding for some of the  disproportionate share hospitals being cut from 100 percent of what is  expected to be provided to 87 percent; and it will prohibit  nonexpansion States from implementing uncompensated care pools, who  provide healthcare to the uninsured and underinsured.   When the American Rescue Plan was signed into law, it included a vast  expansion of the Affordable Care Act premium subsidies. While these  subsidies were intended to be temporary, this bill will provide a cliff  that people will fall off in 2025, and premiums having risen during  that time, people will be left in the lurch. It is bad that this has  very shortsighted, very punitive policy on some of the poorest people  in the country, and it hurts the very people we should be trying to  help.   Additionally, the American Rescue Plan eliminated the eligible income  cap for the Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, permitting those  with very high incomes to qualify. Experts estimate this will cost $34  billion over the next 2 years and incentivize businesses to stop  offering group health insurance. So 190 million Americans could be in  jeopardy of losing their healthcare coverage. Remember that one, If you  like your insurance, you can keep it?   I am also concerned that during last night's Rules Committee meeting  not one chairman or ranking member could tell me when I asked, All of  these new gifts that are being given by this bill, in addition to the  ACA credit, the paid time off, do any of these new benefits require  American citizenship? Absolute silence from every chairman and ranking  member because the answer is no. These benefits will be available to  people who cannot provide proof or show that they are citizens of this  country.   The magnitude of the changes contemplated in this reconciliation  package require the full input of Congress, not just a few privileged  in a secret room somewhere; like we have seen all afternoon.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the ranking member of the House Committee on  Rules.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Oklahoma.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach), who is a valuable member of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy), the designated conscience of the Conference.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), a valuable member of  the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger), one of the newest members of  the Texas delegation from out in west Texas, the Permian Basin.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to immediately consider the Illegal Immigrant Payoff Prohibition  Act, introduced by Mr. McClintock. This bill will prevent the Attorney  General from making settlement payments to individuals and families who  have entered the country illegally for claims arising out of the  illegal entry.   Madam Speaker, we have a crisis along our southern border, and this  will only incentivize further unauthorized immigration, overwhelm our  border officials, and expose additional immigrants to danger.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, to explain the amendment, I now yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock), my good  friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), a member of the Republican leadership and a  valuable member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains  on our side?    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, a couple of things come to mind. We are told that, by  2050, the United States will no longer have carbon emissions and that,  over that same 30 years, energy requirements in this country, energy  consumption, are going to increase 50 to 60 percent. Those two facts do  not match up.   It is strange that in this massive bill we have in front of us--$4  trillion, $5 trillion, $6 trillion, who knows--there is not one word  and not $1 for nuclear energy, for advanced nuclear energy, for new  nuclear technologies and reprocessing of spent fuel. You cannot produce  50 to 60 percent more energy with windmills and solar panels. China  can't produce enough solar panels for you to keep up with that kind of  energy demand in a zero-carbon future.   We have heard a lot this evening. In fact, the previous speaker  recalled President Kennedy. His was the first inaugural I remember,  back in elementary school, and he exhorted us, he exhorted the people  of our generation: Ask not what your country can do for you.    Yet, we find ourselves here tonight with this behemoth of a bill that  is going to spend our children's and children's children's inheritance  as far as the eye can see.   This bill was finalized by just a couple of you in some secret room  someplace in this Capitol behind closed doors with no input from  Members, Members who represent literally one-half of the country. No  one seemed to pay attention to when the voters spoke earlier this week  and said: We don't want Big Government, and we don't want this creeping  socialism that we are seeing.   Yet, the response of this House was to double down on that and jam  through this massive bill.   This bill, we are told, is a messaging bill for House Democrats. I  will say the Senate is going to rewrite it. I submit you will not like  what the Senate rewrites and sends back to you. But I will tell you  this: You will not have the opportunity to change anything. Once it  comes back from the Senate, it will be a straight up-or-down vote. You  will not be able to change one syllable of your bill, and it will  become law with whatever the Senate puts in it.   There is nothing here but a partisan social spending scam that is  meant to bolster Democrat prospects. Unfortunately, your prospects  really took a hit last Tuesday night.   This bill will fundamentally change life in America for every  citizen, and not in a good way. The magnitude of the changes  contemplated in this massive reconciliation bill should require the  full input of Congress.   This should call on us and our various generations to be  transformational. Instead, we have watched all afternoon while we are  mired in the transactional. You can't be transformational if you are  mired in the transactional.   Madam Speaker, vote against this rule, vote against this bill, and  vote against the infrastructure bill. Let's do the right thing for the  people.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
