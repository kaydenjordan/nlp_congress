 Mr. President, today I recognize Judge Guido  Calabresi, a dedicated public servant and professor who is celebrating  70 years as a naturalized citizen of the United States on September 16.   His life and career constitute a legacy of commitment and passion for  initiating positive change. A deeply insightful and tirelessly driven  person, he is recognized as a pioneer in the academic world who has  spent six decades educating and serving others.   In 1939, Judge Calabresi moved with his family to New York and then  New Haven, CT, from Milan, Italy, where his parents were notable  antifascist figures. Forbidden from bringing money with them to  America, his family had to start again from scratch upon their arrival.  Judge Calabresi and his older brother, Paul, worked to learn English  and assimilate into their new home. Their father had a fellowship at  Yale, which at the time had no Italian or Jewish faculty members,  forcing the family to forge a unique identity at the institution.   Young Guido devoted himself unstintingly to his studies. Once  naturalized as a citizen, along with his parents and brother in 1948,  he graduated summa cum laude from Yale in 1953 with a bachelor of  science in economics, earned a bachelor of arts with first class honors  from Oxford in 1955 as a Rhodes Scholar, and then a bachelor of laws  magna cum laude from Yale Law School 5 years later and a master of arts  the next year in 1959 from the University of Oxford in politics,  philosophy, and economics.   Judge Calabresi focused on legal scholarship starting in the late  1950s, when he served as a law review member and note editor for the  Yale Law Journal and graduated first in his class from the law school.  After graduation, he clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice  Hugo Black and went on to become the youngest full professor ever at  Yale Law School.   His impressive career led him to become dean of the Yale Law School  for 9 years, ending in 1994. One of Judge Calabresi's most notable  accomplishments in the academic world is his role as a founder of the  subfield of law and  [[Page S6137]]  economics along with Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase. His public  service included impressive charitable and local government activities,  including as a town selectman in Woodbridge for 4 years, beginning in  1971.   In 1994, recognizing his extraordinary accomplishments as a teacher  and scholar, President Bill Clinton nominated him to serve as a U.S.  circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second  Circuit. Confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Judge Calabresi joined the court  in September 1994, 55 years after fleeing to America to escape Italian  racial laws.   Judge Calabresi was shaped throughout his education, as a lawyer, and  as a judge by his experiences as a refugee who courageously forged his  own path as a U.S. citizen. Now a senior judge for the Second Circuit  and sterling professor emeritus of law and professional lecturer at  Yale, he has written seven books and more than 100 articles on law and  other related subjects. He has also been awarded 50 honorary degrees  from universities across the globe.   With his remarkable record of public and academic service, Judge  Calabresi is a credit to the State of Connecticut and to our country.  His unfailing readiness to embrace new challenges and benefit his  communities sets an inspiring model for all of us.   I applaud his many accomplishments and hope my colleagues will join  me in congratulating Judge Guido Calabresi on this landmark of  attaining 70 years as a naturalized American citizen.                            ____________________
