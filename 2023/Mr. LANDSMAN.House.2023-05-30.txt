 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 382,  condemning the rise of antisemitism and calling on elected officials to  identify and educate others on the contributions of the Jewish American  community. I also thank my colleague, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, for her  leadership on this and many other issues.   As a member of the Jewish community, this is deeply personal for me  and my family. Like all parents, I want my children to be safe no  matter where they go. I also want them and their culture, their  Jewishness, to be understood and appreciated by others.   Unfortunately, we are not there yet. Last year, an individual in our  community, who went by the name ``Paleface'' online, was arrested just  moments after he announced that he would soon drive with his many  assault weapons to local synagogues to kill as many Jews as he could.  He was, fortunately, stopped.   I am also the Representative of the First Congressional District in  Ohio, which is home to the city of Cincinnati and the Nancy and David  Wolf Holocaust and Humanity Center, which is dedicated to the work of  this resolution: providing learning experiences that touch hearts and  change minds. It was founded by local Holocaust survivors, and it is  committed to education that inspires action, not only in Cincinnati,  but around the entire Nation.   I want to lift up the Holocaust and Humanity Center and Cincinnati  and encourage my colleagues to seek them out to identify and educate  others on the contributions of the Jewish-American community and to end  anti-Semitism now and forever.
