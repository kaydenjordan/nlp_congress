 Mr. President, over the next days and weeks and months,  we are going to hear a lot about our dear friend Dianne Feinstein, and  I am so glad that some of her friends from California and the Speaker-- former Speaker--Nancy Pelosi and her family are here to just be with us  in these first moments of our learning of her passing.   And we all have stories to tell about Dianne, but when I joined, for  example, the Intel Committee, and she was chairing it, she said: Mazie,  this is not a committee that you can just parachute in and not spend  the time really learning about our intelligence community and all  that--and I really took that to heart. I spent many, many hours on that  committee, even though we could never talk about it. And then at one of  the earlier hearings of the Judiciary Committee--and I really marveled  at this. It was a hearing that had to do with guns, and I always  associate, of course, Dianne with her courageous fight to ban assault  weapons. And one of the newer members of the Judiciary Committee, as I  was, chose that hearing to lecture Dianne Feinstein about her efficacy  on guns, and I thought this was so untoward against someone who had  spent so much of her time fighting for gun safety. But she just said: I  have not spent all these years on this committee to be lectured by you,  which I thought was really quite tactful.   But later she said to me--she took me aside, and she said: Do you  think I was too mean? Do you think I should apologize? And all I could  think of was, Are you kidding? That was Dianne Feinstein. She was old  school. She was very kind. And I am wearing a scarf that she gave to  me. And you have heard some of my other colleagues talk about, if we  admired something of hers, she would give it to us. Well, this scarf  she was wearing at that moment, and I said: Oh, that is such a lovely  scarf, and she just took it off and gave it to me.   I wear this scarf often. In fact, we had to be careful about admiring  anything Dianne had because she would likely take it off and give it to  us. But this is one of the things that I will always remember about  Dianne Feinstein, her courage, her integrity, her commitment to public  service, literally, until the very, very end.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, thank you for your patience.   I want to begin today by reiterating my sadness about the passing of  our friend Senator Dianne Feinstein.   Senator Feinstein's death strikes at the heart of so many of us  committed to public service, as she was. A courageous trailblazer, she  stood up to powerful interest groups on behalf of her constituents and  the rest of us. She was a fierce legislator, fighting to ban assault  weapons, defend survivors of domestic violence, protect our Nation, and  much more. But she was also a thoughtful friend.   Just last week, she wrote me a letter expressing her happiness that  the banyan tree in Lahaina, badly burned by the wildfires, is starting  to show signs of renewed life. She wrote:         I hope that the beloved tree continues to recover and serve       as a source of hope and a symbol of resilience for the entire       community.    I, too, share her hope.                                Maui Wildfires    Mr. President, it has now been 6 weeks since the fires tore through  the town of Lahaina on Maui as well as several upcountry Maui  communities. As the whole world has seen now, those fires were  devastating, claiming nearly 100 lives and destroying close to 3,000  structures, most of them residences. Our hearts break for all those  impacted by this tragedy.   Within hours of those fires, though, the Federal Government was on  the ground, providing assistance and relief. In the weeks since, well  over 1,000 Federal personnel have traveled to Maui to aid in the  recovery efforts, and more than $125 million in individual relief has  been distributed. Additionally, President Biden requested $4 billion in  disaster relief funding following the fires on top of the $12 billion  he had previously requested.   As I said at the time, disaster relief has always had broad  bipartisan support, and there is no reason the Maui disaster should be  treated any differently.   In fact, Speaker McCarthy agreed. When he visited Lahaina less than 4  weeks ago, he said:         We want to get the resources to individuals that could       rebuild their life. We've got to focus on the children for       the schools, get them back into the education so they don't       miss out.    I couldn't agree more.   This funding is essential to our ongoing recovery efforts, but now  Speaker McCarthy, in refusing to stand up to the most radical faction  in his caucus--I call them the chaos caucus--is endangering these  resources for Maui and other communities impacted by disasters across  the country. We just heard from our majority leader what is happening  in New York City even as we speak.   So, again, as we speak, the Senate is working to advance a bipartisan  continuing resolution to keep government open, which includes $6  billion in disaster relief. While clearly not everything we need, it is  a critical downpayment that will allow the Federal Government to  continue its important work on Maui and in other communities impacted  by disasters across the country. It will allow FEMA, the SBA, and the  other critical Federal Agencies to continue their disaster relief work  as we work to pass a longer term funding agreement. But if radical  House Republicans shut down the government, that funding will be held  up indefinitely.   My colleague, Representative Jill Tokuda of Hawaii, summed it up well  just yesterday in her testimony before the House Energy and Commerce  Committee. She said that the people of Maui ``have gone through enough,  the wheels of government must keep turning to provide support and  resources, so they focus on recovery and rebuilding.''   By forcing a government shutdown, Speaker McCarthy will be abandoning  the people of Maui--the very same people he vowed to help just weeks  ago when he visited Maui.   We are less than 48 hours from Republicans shutting down our  government, and they have yet to even put forward a funding bill that  they can pass. It is unconscionable.   While these remarks are focused on the impact of a shutdown on  disaster aid, make no mistake--a Republican government shutdown will  have negative consequences for millions of Americans not just in  disaster relief but on every aspect of their lives all across our  country. This is not a game. We all want to know what it is going to  take for House Republicans to grow up and realize that the chaos they  are sowing is going to have real impacts on real people's lives all  across the country.   Meanwhile, the Hawaii delegation, as well as the bipartisan Senate,  will continue doing everything we can to keep government open by  passing the continuing resolution that we have on deck in the Senate  and secure the funding for our communities--funding that is so urgently  needed.   I yield the floor.
