 Mr. President, I would like to honor the life and  legacy of Colombian-American journalist and broadcaster, Eucario  Bermudez. Bermudez, a beloved south Florida radio legend amongst the  Hispanic community, died earlier this month after years of service to  the Hispanic community in the State of Florida. Today I pay tribute to  Eucario's life, with immense gratitude for his work and  dedication.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I would like to highlight the  hard work and unique entrepreneurial spirit that can be found across my  home State of Florida. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small  Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small business  that exemplifies hard work and dedication toward the local  [[Page S272]]  community. Today, it is my distinct privilege to honor Indian Pass Raw  Bar from Port St. Joe in Gulf County, FL, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   Indian Pass Raw Bar has deep historical ties to the Florida Panhandle  along the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico, tracing its roots to a  commissary store founded in 1903, for workers in the then-booming  turpentine industry. It is located in the same building as the original  Indian Pass Trading Post that opened in 1929, where Mrs. Gypsy McNeil  established her talent with her delicious seafood gumbo.   In 1986, Hurricane Kate struck the Florida Panhandle and destroyed  the Indian Pass Trading Post. The McNeil family showed resilience after  the storm and recovered by converting the general store into an oyster  bar, setting the stage for business to skyrocket.   Twenty-three miles from Apalachicola, FL, Indian Pass Raw Bar serves  the panhandle's world-famous oysters and iconic seafood dishes, such as  steamed shrimp and crab legs. Drinks are served on an honor system  where customers keep their tabs to turn in at checkout, treating  customers like trusted friends. It has become a renowned location for  Floridians and tourists alike to enjoy time with family. Southern  Living magazine once described Indian Pass Raw Bar as ``quite possibly  the best seafood shack in existence.'' It has also received praise from  the Garden & Gun magazine as one of Florida's ``Hidden Hotspots.''  Indian Pass Raw Bar's success continued with the opening of a second  location in June 2017, in downtown Port St. Joe, FL.   In October 2018, category 5 Hurricane Michael devastated the Florida  Panhandle, including Gulf County. The storm severely damaged Indian  Pass Raw Bar, as high winds blew off the front door, forcefully removed  the air-conditioning system, and threw its iconic street sign hundreds  of yards away. However, just as they did after the 1986 storm, the  McNeil family is rebuilding and looks forward to continuing to serve  their world-famous oysters again this spring. Upon reopening, they will  welcome visitors to the gulf coast of Florida for their 90th year in  business.   The Indian Pass Raw Bar became what it is today partly because of  Hurricane Kate in 1986. The McNeil family understands how devastating  these storms truly are and the impact they can have on small business  and working families. To help their community, the McNeil family  enthusiastically opened their facilities as emergency supply  distribution centers to their neighbors in need, despite having their  own difficulties. Meredith McNeil said in October 2018: ``This whole  area, the whole Gulf, we've done this before. We're all resilient.''   This is the kind of commitment to community that is unique to  American small business. During a catastrophe, the Indian Pass Raw Bar  helped bring their fellow citizens together by offering emergency  supplies in order to help their customers and to give back to the  community that has supported their business. Indian Pass Raw Bar is an  example of Florida's exceptional entrepreneurship, continuing a 90-year  history, being resilient and innovative in its approach to challenges,  and giving back to the community during a time of need. I would like to  congratulate the McNeil family and all the employees at Indian Pass Raw  Bar for being named the Senate Small Business of the Week for the week  of January 14 to 18, 2019. I wish them continued success in their  future endeavors.                            ____________________
