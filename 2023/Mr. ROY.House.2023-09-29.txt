 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, strongly in  support of this legislation.   This is legislation that will make sure our troops are paid. It will  make sure that our military can continue to do its job. It will make  sure that our border is secured, and it will simply return funding of  the Federal bureaucracy to pre-COVID levels. That is what we are  talking about here. That is what my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle are so up in arms about, that we must have a bureaucracy, bloated  with massive expenditures in a post-COVID universe, or your life, as  you know it, is going to end.   When the Declaration of Independence was written, when our  unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were  drafted, those rights did not emanate from this floor.   That pursuit of happiness did not come from this floor or anywhere in  this building because this building didn't exist. It didn't come from  Congress because Congress didn't exist.   The fact is that no matter what happens heading into this weekend,  whatever the result, there are 50 State governments that are continuing  to operate. There are 3,000 counties, county governments operating.  There are 20,000 city and municipalities with governments operating;  12,000 independent school districts, because we have a Federal system  of government and we are supposed to take care of ourselves and our  families and our communities. We are not supposed to bankrupt our  country and devalue the dollar and drive up inflation such that the  American people can no longer afford to live.   That is what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are doing  with blank checks, with more borrowing, more taxing, more spending,  destroying the future of this country. That stops now. We stand up on  this side of the aisle for sanity and a secure border.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation.
