 Madam President, on Roy Blunt, I first met him when he  was a whip in the House. We had some kind of conference going, and I  thought: My gosh, he can count votes. He is the whip. He can count  votes in the conference, too, and so forth.   And then, when he came and started running for the Senate, I was one  of many over here who wanted to help him get here. And when he came in,  as has been said here, he went right into the leadership because he is  a leader.   Roy, you have got it in you. You are a natural. It is in your bones,  so to speak. And you have brought a lot to this Senate.   I have worked with you on just about everything, but especially on  the Appropriations Committee, and you have been stellar. You have a  great family. You have a great wife. You have a son who is the former  Governor of the State of Missouri. We would miss you,  [[Page S6984]]  but I won't be one of the ``we's.'' I will be gone too. But at the same  time, they will miss you here. But they will miss you reaching out to  the other side to make things happen. Reaching out to show that America  is first; the country is first--and reaching out just over the aisle  and to others with natural friendship, which means a lot up here and  something we need to do more of.   But we wish you well. You will do well in your next life, whatever  that is, and maybe we will see you again after January sometime.   I would like to start by thanking my good friend from Missouri,  Senator Roy Blunt, for his decades of dedicated service.   We have served together in the Senate for 12 years, and together in  Congress for 26 years.   I remember when Senator Blunt was first elected to the House of  Representatives in 1996 and later to the Senate in 2010.   Roy is a fifth generation Missourian who grew up on a dairy farm.   Before coming to Washington, he was a high school history teacher and  later a county official for 12 years.   In 1984, Roy was elected to be the first Republican secretary of  state in more than 50 years in the State of Missouri.   He then served as the president of his alma mater, Southwest Baptist  University, which undoubtedly prepared him for his many years of  prioritizing education funding as the lead Republican Senator on the  Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee.   Senator Blunt has been a force in the Senate, sitting on the  Appropriations Committee; the Commerce, Science and Transportation  Committee; the Select Committee on Intelligence; and chairing the  important Rules Committee.   Notably, Senator Blunt was elected to the Senate leadership during  his first year in the Senate.   He is currently the chair of the Senate Republican Policy Committee,  a vital arm within our Republican leadership.   As I mentioned, he is the top Republican on the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.   In this position, we have worked together to; grow NIH funding, which  has increased 51 percent in the past 7 years; prioritize medical  research, and improve access to quality education.   Senator Blunt has also been instrumental in protecting the Hyde  amendment and other long-standing pro-life provisions in this bill.   As the chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural  Ceremonies, he planned and spoke during the 59th Presidential  inauguration in 2021.   This was an important moment for our Nation.   While Senator Blunt's service in the Senate has been significant, I  would be remiss if I didn't mention that he was also a powerful force  in the House of Representatives, where he was elected seven times to  represent Missouri's seventh district.   In the House, Roy was elected the majority whip earlier in his career  than any Member of Congress in eight decades.   He also served as the acting House majority leader for a period of  time.   Senator Blunt has a reputation for being a statesman and a  longstanding record of working in a bipartisan manner to get things  done.   His dedication to the betterment of our country has been invaluable.   I want to thank Senator Blunt for his service, as well as his wife  Abigail, along with his four children and six grandchildren.   Annette and I have enjoyed their friendship over the years.   I wish Senator Blunt the best in his next chapter.    Madam President, today I wish to honor the  retirement of Judith Adams from the Alabama State Port Authority after  28 years of impactful service. Judy has played an integral role in the  growth and development of the Port of Mobile, which has been one of my  greatest legislative priorities. Without Judy, the Port of Mobile would  not be what it is today. I would be remiss to not formally thank her  for all of her hard work.   In July of 1990, Judy was hired by John Dutton, then director of the  State dock system of Alabama, to work on media relations and serve as  the port's representative in legislative efforts. Four years later,  Judy was named the official liaison between the Federal Government and  the Alabama State Port Authority, overseeing the transfer of the Navy  homeport to the port.   Following her success in that role, Judy was promoted to  superintendent at Middle Bay and ran the Theodore Operations. She  continued to prove herself a viable asset and climbed the ranks again  in 2002 to become manager of media relations.   She was a key facilitator of multiple economic development projects,  including landing APM Terminals in 2008, which has been a catalyst for  skyrocketing activity at the port. She also oversaw teams that  recruited Aker Solutions ASA, Berg Spiral Pipe Corporation, and the  ThyssenKrupp projects to Mobile. In partnership with the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers, Judy led community outreach efforts that resulted  in a successful Record of Decision for the port's harbor deepening and  widening program.   Serving the State of Alabama with such depth of knowledge, Judy's  final role as the senior vice president of internal and external  affairs oversaw everything she had accomplished in her wide-ranging  career with the Alabama State Port Authority. With Judy's significant  involvement, the Port of Mobile has become the fastest growing gateway  for containerized cargo in the United States.   Since joining the port in 1990, Judy has worked with four U.S.  Senators, four Members of Alabama's First Congressional District, eight  Governors, four mayors, and countless county commission, city council,  and State legislative officials.   Judy has earned recognitions from GulfShipper for her outstanding  leadership and commitment to excellence in international trade and  transportation and the U.S. Marine Corps for her help with the 26th  Marine Expeditionary Unit's ``Training in an Urban Environment Exercise  (TRUEX) XXXVII'' conducted at Middle Bay Port.   A graduate of Louisiana State University and previous chair of the  American Association of Port Authorities Public Relations Committee,  Judy currently serves on the board of directors and executive committee  of the National Waterways Conference, Alabama Germany Partnership's  board of directors, Partners for Environmental Progress, and the Coosa- Alabama River Improvement Association.   Judy Adams helped shape a more prosperous future for the Port of  Mobile and the entire State of Alabama. The decisions she made and the  projects she championed will benefit our State for years to come. She  leaves behind a tenacious legacy that will not be forgotten, and I will  miss working with her.   I am proud to take this time to recognize her service with the  Alabama State Port Authority, which will continue to reap the fruits of  her labor. Her achievements and dedication to transforming the Port of  Mobile have not gone unnoticed. I join Judy Adams' friends, family, and  colleagues in wishing her the best of luck as she transitions into a  new chapter of her life.                            ____________________
