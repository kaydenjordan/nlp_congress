 Mr. Speaker, it has been 2 weeks since I last stood here  to ask the House to bring the Dream Act to a vote. Thirty-four of my  colleagues, my Republican colleagues, have sent a letter to Republican  Speaker Ryan asking for action to protect DREAMers before the holidays  because they understand the urgency.   What are we waiting for? Republicans continue to state that we have  until March to resolve this issue, but that is simply not true. 122  DREAMers lose protection every single day.                                time  1245    That means that 122 intelligent, hardworking Americans, by every  right except birth, are losing their ability to continue their  education, to work and contribute to our economy.   Are we willing to stop the deportations of hundreds of thousands of  young DREAMers or not?   This is not a partisan question. This is the question of who we are  as Americans. Let's put an end to the fear and uncertainty that  DREAMers have been living with these past few months.   We have been clear. This Congress must not finish this year without  providing a permanent fix for DREAMers, their families, and the  communities that depend on them. It is unconscionable. This is not who  we are.   Mr. Speaker, many of my Republican colleagues support action on the  Dream Act before the holidays. Many have said so publicly. The majority  of Americans want us to act now.   Mr. Speaker, 1,708 DACA recipients have lost their status since I  last stood here 2 weeks ago. This isn't hard. The fix is right in front  of us. It has been here all along.   We all know that the votes are here today, if this body only had the  courage to act. And I know that the Dream Act would pass today if we  only allowed it.   I ask my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that we  can immediately begin to bring the Dream Act and act on the floor  today.
