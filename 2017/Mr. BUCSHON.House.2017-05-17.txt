 Mr. Speaker, law enforcement officers across this  country go to work every day to serve and protect our communities.  These brave men and women risk everything to keep our communities and  our families safe and secure, and they do it selflessly.   I recently attended a ceremony in Putnam County, Indiana, honoring  the service and sacrifice of the Indiana State Police officers who have  given their lives in the line of duty. Yesterday I was at the White  House with Vice President Pence to recognize the dedication of the  Indiana Fraternal Order of Police and to remember the service of the  late sheriff's deputy of Howard County, Carl Koontz, who was killed in  the line of duty.   Events like these are somber reminders of what these heroes who stand  on the thin blue line, and their families, sacrifice on our behalf. We  should all be grateful.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation ensures that officers who fall in the  line of duty, and their families, receive the justice they deserve. I  urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation that confirms the  United States Congress stands behind our law enforcement.  [[Page H4239]]
