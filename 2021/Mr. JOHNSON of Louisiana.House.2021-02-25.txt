 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition  to the legislation that we are scheduled to consider on the floor  tomorrow, the so-called American Rescue Plan.   The sad truth, Madam Speaker, is that this bill does very little to  address the real issues impacting communities across the country.  Instead, the majority has elected to weaponize the reconciliation  process to push through a Democrat wish-list of what are, frankly,  left-wing policies.   Only 9 percent of this bill actually goes to combating COVID. But  Democrats have found the wisdom to insert $510 billion to bail out  poorly run blue States; $470 billion-plus for a policy that we know  will kill jobs; a $100 million earmark for a rail project in the  Speaker's district; a $1.5 million earmark for a bridge to Canada for  the Senate majority leader. All the while, there is still $1 trillion  in unspent funds from previous COVID packages.   Madam Speaker, these are just a few of the many deep flaws in the  Democrat COVID bill, and I am grateful so many of my colleagues are  coming forward to help highlight the shortcomings of this bill, and how  we should move forward to best serve the American people.   I urge everyone to oppose this monstrosity.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition  to H.R. 5, which many have already labeled the inequality act because  of the deep flaws contained in this bill.   H.R. 5 will undermine women's rights. It will strip parental rights.  It will gut religious freedom, and it will open a Pandora's box of a  universal right to abortion. And that is just to name a few of the  legislation's outrageous provisions.   In addition to the well-founded, substantive concerns that you will  hear a lot about in the next 45 minutes, the majority has decided to  throw process out the window. They brought this bill directly to the  floor.   We sit on the Judiciary Committee. We should have had a robust  discussion on the impacts of the legislation. We didn't. There has been  no committee action. There has been no hearing, no deliberation at all  by the committee of appropriate jurisdiction. And I think, many of us  think, that the reason for that is because the proponents didn't want  the bill to be exposed.   Listen, let's make one thing clear. There are people on both sides of  the aisle--all of us, everybody in this Chamber believes that all  people are entitled to dignity and respect.   We believe that every single person is made in the image of God and,  because of that, every single person has inestimable dignity and value.  We believe, as our founding document said, that God is the one that  endows us with the inalienable rights that we have. They ought to be  protected and respected.   But unfortunately, the Democrats' misguided effort here tramples all  over many of those fundamental rights that God gives us, the right to  life, the right to religious freedom.   While it is true that H.R. 5 does not include the word ``abortion''-- our colleagues keep reminding us of that--it does reference pregnancy  and ``related medical conditions'' as areas of protection against  discrimination. Everybody knows that this historically has led to the  inclusion of abortion. We are opening a door here for the rampant  taxpayer funding of abortions on demand; in addition to the myriad  number of conscience protections that exist for businesses and medical  professionals. You will hear a lot about that today as well.   It is telling that the text of the bill also directly undermines the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Let's remember, RFRA was widely  supported on both sides of the aisle and signed into law by President  Clinton in 1993. RFRA's lead Democrat sponsor was our colleague,  Representative Nadler. It passed the House by unanimous consent and the  Senate by a vote of 97-3.  [[Page H641]]    But now, the Equality Act, or the inequality act, explicitly  undercuts RFRA by negating its application to the underlying  legislation. In other words, those protections won't apply anymore.   This is unprecedented. It is dangerous. It is an attack on our first  freedom, the first freedom listed in the Bill of Rights, religious  liberty. This is something that our faith communities are deeply  concerned about and all of us are as individuals.   Look, I have to save time for my colleagues, and I will just conclude  by saying this bill is a severe blow to women's rights, to people of  faith, to every parent, every student, every medical professional and  so many more. Because we believe in the dignity and value of every  person, we have to oppose this dangerous, un-American legislation. I  pray that we will.
