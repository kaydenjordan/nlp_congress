 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay a  heartfelt tribute to Pastor James D. Corbett of Greenville, North  Carolina, to honor his long and illustrious service to God and to his  country.   In his younger years, Pastor Corbett served this great Nation of ours  in the United States Army. He then left military service to begin his  ministry.   In 1984, Pastor Corbett and the late Pastor Delores Corbett founded  Greenville Community Christian Church. God gave him a vision to  minister to the whole man: spirit, soul and body.   Pastor Corbett also currently serves as the Eastern Regional Director  and Trustee for the International Convention of Faith Ministries. Their  vision includes reaching communities with the Gospel and taking the  message of Jesus Christ around the whole world.   Lives are saved, healed, and delivered by the power of God through  his ministry. I have personally been blessed by his wonderful services  and sermons for many years now.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the accomplishments of a  wonderful man, a caring father, grandfather, and leader of his flock,  Pastor James D. Corbett, and recognizing all that he has done for his  community.  [[Page H6680]]                                ____________________
