 Mr. Speaker, I think we should talk about pain on the  floor today because, when you talk to physicians and OB/GYNs, they will  tell you that, if they are doing work, if they are doing an  amniocentesis, then that baby feels pain, that baby responds, that  child in the womb.   So I would encourage my colleagues, talk to Dr. Roe, talk to some of  the OB/GYNs who serve in this Chamber, because they fully understand,  as we understand, that the gift of life is not something that comes  through the law. That is a natural gift. That is a gift of God. And  that child who is receiving that life, who is held in the womb, if they  are poked or prodded or there is an uncomfortable situation, they  experience pain. That is why this legislation is referred to as the  Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.   I encourage support of this legislation.
