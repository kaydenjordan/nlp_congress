 Madam Speaker, last month President Biden announced a  vision to advance progress on his Unity Agenda in the year ahead. I am  encouraged by the agenda's focus on reducing veteran suicide, which has  been one of my highest priorities since coming to Congress. I am  encouraged by the specific focus on expanding outreach to justice- involved veterans, who may be at even greater risk for suicide.   In recent years, we have seen some signs of progress on this issue.  From 2018 to 2020, age- and sex-adjusted veteran suicide rates fell by  nearly 10 percent.   However, with nearly 17 veterans still dying by suicide every day--a  rate that is more than 50 percent higher than suicides among nonveteran  adults--we know that we have much more work to do to save lives.   Part of the administration's agenda is an important focus on  increasing lethal means safety, which is an intentional, voluntary  practice to reduce suicide risk by limiting access by those in crisis  to lethal means, like medication, firearms, and sharp instruments that  can be used to inflict self-directed violence.   The data on lethal means safety are clear. People who reduce their  access to lethal means during times of heightened risk are reducing  their risk of dying by suicide.   Given the robust evidence on the effectiveness of lethal means safety  in preventing suicide, the Trump administration implemented a  requirement for every clinician at the Veterans Health Administration  to complete a lethal means safety training so that they would be  prepared to have conversations with the veterans they care for about  this lifesaving practice.   Thanks to this requirement, nearly 100 percent of Veterans Health  Administration clinicians have completed the Department's lethal means  safety training. However, the training remains optional for all other  staff, including at the Veterans Health Administration, Veterans  Benefits Administration, vet centers, and vocational rehabilitation  facilities.   This lack of a mandate has consequences. Without a requirement to do  so, a mere fraction of 1 percent of VA's nonclinical employees have  completed the Department's lethal means safety training. What this  means is that every day we have veterans who could be in crisis  interacting with VA employees who might be able to identify risk  factors and have lifesaving conversations, but these VA staff are not  trained to do so, and we could be losing our veterans because of it.    That is unacceptable, and that is why I introduced the Lethal Means  Safety Training Act, which would make the Department's evidence-based  training a requirement for all VA staff who regularly interact with  veterans in their work, as well as community providers and family  caregivers.   I will continue my work to get this passed in Congress, but no  legislation is needed to expand VA's existing training requirement to  other VA employees. Unfortunately, the administration's announcement  last month did not include any plans for the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs to use his existing authority to expand the Department's lethal  means safety training requirement.   The Secretary of Veterans Affairs already has the authority to take  this lifesaving action today, and I once again call on him to do so  immediately. Every day that VA does not take this simple step is  another day that we are leaving valuable tools in our toolbox unused.  It is another day that we will lose nearly 17 veterans to suicide.   Not every single death can be prevented with an expanded lethal means  safety training requirement, but at no cost to the Department and with  no need for additional legislation, there is no reason to further delay  on implementing this policy.   The Secretary has an opportunity to help save the lives of our  veterans with the stroke of his pen, and I urge him to do so  immediately, by expanding the Department's lethal means safety training  requirement to all staff who regularly interact with veterans in their  work. This step would build on the meaningful actions the Secretary has  already taken and other steps announced by the President last month.                            ____________________
