 Madam Speaker, inflation threatens  American families due to the out-of-control spending by President Joe  Biden.   Biden inflation directly impacts the day-to-day well-being of  American families. Inflation is currently rising at the fastest pace in  13 years. And Biden has proposed an irresponsible $3.5 trillion deal  that will increase taxes.   Last month, consumer prices jumped 5.4 percent. Gas prices are up a  huge 45.1 percent, and milk is up 5.6 percent. What Biden doesn't seem  to realize is that these costs negatively affect the lower and middle  class more than anyone else. Wasteful spending and taxes will only make  matters worse. Inflation is Biden taxation, and the American families  deserve better.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. God bless the  courageous citizens of Cuba standing up for freedom and liberty from  the failed socialist oppressors.                            ____________________
