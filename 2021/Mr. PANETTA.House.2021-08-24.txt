 Mr. Speaker, I rise with pride and in support of  tonight's passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.   As we know, the right to vote is fundamental to our Nation. That is  why we should be doing everything possible not to make it more  difficult to vote but to enhance voting rights.   H.R. 4 does that by modifying the Voting Rights Act to restore and  strengthen its antidiscrimination enforcement authorities.   Now, in my district, prior to the Shelby decision, we had a voting  rights county. But, clearly, the threats to our ability to vote are not  limited to my district as this year alone 18 States across the country  have passed 30 laws making it harder to vote.   That is why I voted for this bill. That is why John Lewis served and  sacrificed, and that is why he crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 1965  and in 2020 when I was honored to cross it with him, hand in hand.   Tonight, we not only upheld the legacy of John Lewis but, by passing  H.R. 4, we were able to eventually provide citizens with more  opportunity to vote in our democracy.                            ____________________
