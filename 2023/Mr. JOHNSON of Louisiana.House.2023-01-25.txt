 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Republican  Conference, I send to the desk a privileged resolution and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 56         Resolved, That the following named Members be, and are       hereby, elected to the following standing committees of the       House of Representatives:        Comittee on Appropriations: Mr. Rogers of Kentucky, Mr.       Aderholt, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Carter of Texas, Mr. Calvert, Mr.       Cole, Mr. Diaz-Balart, Mr. Womack, Mr. Fleischmann, Mr. Joyce       of Ohio, Mr. Harris, Mr. Amodei, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Valadao,       Mr. Newhouse, Mr. Moolenaar, Mr. Rutherford, Mr. Cline, Mr.       Reschenthaler, Mr. Mike Garcia of California, Mrs. Hinson,       Mr. Tony Gonzales of Texas, Ms. Letlow, Mr. Cloud, Mr. Guest,       Mr. Zinke, Mr. Clyde, Mr. LaTurner, Mr. Carl, Mrs. Bice,  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my  Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I would like to kick off our  first Wednesday Special Order Hour of the year by extending my  congratulations and warm wishes to all of our colleagues, all the new  Members, all the Members who are returning here. We have very, very  important work to do in the 118th Congress.   I want to thank our House Democrat counterparts, as well, for working  with us to ensure a smooth transition from the minority to the  majority. It is an important part of our institution, and we are  grateful for how this has gone so far.   We should all be rooting for the success of this Congress, obviously,  because when Congress succeeds, everyone in our country benefits; and  so we have an important responsibility before us.   We are under no illusion that the governing in such a closely divided  body over these divided times is going to be any easy task. We know  that. We know what the challenges are.   But we are also under no illusion that Congress has been operating as  it should be. We think this can be done better, and our endeavor here  is to show everyone how.   This problem that we faced here has been around for a long time. Look  at just what happened in the last Congress. We had trillions upon  trillions of dollars in government spending, which sent inflation  soaring.   We had votes on immensely consequential, complex, 1,000-plus page  bills sent to us just hours before we were called to vote upon them.   We had Congress steadily outsourcing its authority over to unelected  bureaucrats in the executive agencies.   We had Members dial into congressional hearing, literally, from their  bedrooms and their basements. We had Members voting by proxy while they  were on vacation abroad.    With the 118th Congress, we are here to declare that those days are  over. The House is getting back to work. We are ending remote voting  and remote committee work in the House. That is going to restore  greater transparency and accountability in the legislative process.   I actually believe that when we restore in-person work, as this was  designed to be done, as the Founders intended, as they drew it up, it  is going to have an added benefit because I believe it will help us  rebuild comity and foster more civility in the House.   I am not going to belabor this point, but I would just say, at the  end of last  [[Page H316]]  year, Congress passed a 4,155-page bill. We spent $1.7 trillion on that  omni; and I think it was one of the worst government funding bills in  the history of Congress.   Instead of individual bills to fund each Federal agency one by one,  with a roll call vote and amendments and deliberation process, we  didn't have any of that. We had all the agencies lumped together right  before the end-of-the-year deadline with dozens of unrelated policies  attached to it. I mean, everything from electoral college changes to  retirement changes, cosmetics regulation, healthcare policies, salmon  fishing, and horse racing regulations, all crammed in there together,  under the guise of a government funding bill.   The process for passing this bill was almost as ugly as the  substance. It was written behind closed doors, I mean, literally,  behind closed doors by a handful of people. It was brought to the House  for a vote before anybody could possibly read it, much less debate or  amend it.   Is there a single Member, is there a single Member of this body who  thinks that is the way we should conduct the people's business? I don't  think so.   So this should go without saying, but if we are going to fund each  government agency and make changes to those unregulated policies, we  should do it in regular order. We should do it in the regular process.   It should require a full, open debate in committee and on the floor,  with the opportunity to make amendments. Republicans are committed to  do this. We are back in charge, and that status quo that we have had  here, where there is no transparency, no accountability, outright  disregard for regular order, those days are over.   Campaign season is over. The House has elected our Speaker, and now  it is time to get to work.   Madam Speaker, tonight, with the remaining time that we have in our  hour, we reserved the time because we want to introduce the American  people to some of the bright, new Republican Members that have joined  the body here. They are going to discuss some of the problems that are  currently facing our country.   They bring a fresh, new perspective to this, and their voices are  very, very important. And we are also going to talk a little bit about  the Republican vision for how we are going to address all of these  crises.   We are in charge. We are here ready to work, and I am delighted to  introduce a few of these key Members.   I would start first, Madam Speaker, by yielding to the gentleman from  east Texas, Congressman Nathaniel Moran. I will say just a moment  before I yield him the time, that we are neighboring districts. I  represent Northwest Louisiana, and then right over the Texas border is  my friend there. He is replacing the great Louie Gohmert who has  finally retired from Congress.   I will tell you just a quick bit about Nathaniel. He is formerly a  West Point student, a graduate of Texas Tech University. He has a B.A.  in Russian language and area studies, an MBA, and a law degree. He had  a civil practice in the east Texas area, focused primarily on business  and commercial litigation and transaction work.   He served on the City Council in the city of Tyler, Texas. He was  mayor pro tem and, ultimately, he was appointed the Smith County judge,  and he served in that capacity from 2016 until he was elected to  Congress in 2022.   The thing about a county judge in Texas is they are, effectively, the  boss in that area. They hold all the power. They do all kinds of stuff.  They are not just a judge in a court; they are like an administrator  over the whole area; and he did it so well.   What I love about him most is he is a family man who is dedicated to  his faith, and he is a patriot. They have four children, just like we  do. He represents a great area, and we are delighted to have him.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Moran).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Texas. Texas is well represented, and the First District certainly is.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to introduce next for his first Special  Order hour speech one of the bright lights in the new incoming class in  the 118th Congress, Representative Mike Lawler from New York. He  represents the 17th Congressional District there, which includes  Rockland County, Putnam County, and portions of Westchester and  Dutchess Counties.   Before serving in the U.S. House, he represented New York's 97th  District in the State Assembly and served on really important  committees there--banks, education, housing. He has a broad range of  experience.   In the New York State Assembly--this is a neat statistic--he passed  more bills than any other member of his conference. It really is a  testament to his ability to work in a bipartisan, pragmatic fashion to  approach the problems that we face. That is a skill that is going to  come in handy here.   He previously served as a deputy town supervisor and as a senior  adviser to a county executive. He was also the executive director of  the State Republican Party in New York--that is no small task--and did  a great job there.   He graduated from Manhattan College with degrees in accounting and  finance. He was the valedictorian there, I would note, but his greatest  accomplishment, of course, is his wife and daughter. They live in Pearl  River.   We are delighted to have Congressman Mike Lawler here. Madam Speaker,  I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lawler).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from New  York.   School choice is such an important issue. I love what he said:  Education is the civil rights issue of our time. So well said.   Madam Speaker, there is a theme here tonight. We brought in incoming  Members of the freshman class of the 118th Congress from the largest  States, I think. It is not just a coincidence that we chose them for  that duty tonight. We have had Texas and New York, and we will go to  Florida next.   I am delighted to introduce a new Member from there, Representative  Cory Mills. I will tell you just a little bit about him.   He is a decorated U.S. Army combat veteran and recipient of the  Bronze Star. He left his home State of Florida to serve his country in  uniform and then served further our U.S. State Department and other  government agencies in both Afghanistan and Iraq.   In fact, he served with the 82nd Airborne Division and was a member  of the Joint Special Operations Command, Combined Joint Task Force 20  in Iraq. He spent significant time there, 7 years of service in Iraq  and approximately 2 years in Afghanistan. He served in the Kosovo  campaign in 2000. He has traveled to the front lines of Ukraine during  the Russian invasion to provide information for USAID and Department of  State officials.   He is a busy guy. President Trump appointed him to the Pentagon as a  Department of Defense adviser and foreign policy expert.   With his wife, I love that he, in the private sector, cofounded PACEM  Solutions International LLC and PACEM Defense LLC.   We love that he is here with us because he is a husband and a father,  a patriot and a combat veteran, an entrepreneur, a foreign policy  expert, and a true American conservative. We are going to have a lot of  work for him to do.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mills).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and I  thank him for his service to our country. We are glad he is here.   Madam Speaker, we have many bright lights from Florida. Another one  that I would like to introduce next is Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna,  who is here to serve her first term. She represents Florida's 13th  Congressional District.   She is a member of the House Freedom Caucus and the Second Amendment  Caucus, and is already very busy here on the grounds.   She is the first Mexican-American woman elected to the United States  Congress to represent the big State of Florida. She was raised by a  single mother in one of southern California's low-income neighborhoods.  She tells the story often that she experienced firsthand the  devastating consequences of radical, Big Government policies in cities  like the one she grew up in. It was a tough childhood.   She joined the military at a young age and she went on to graduate  from the University of West Florida with a bachelor's degree in  biology. She served in the U.S. Air Force, and that is where she met  her husband Andy, who is a Bronze Star recipient who earned a Purple  Heart when enemy combatants shot at him in Afghanistan.   She brings an extraordinary work ethic and an inspiring life story  and her fresh perspective to our Republican Conference. We are so happy  to have her join our group here and our conservative cause.    Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Luna).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend. That is  such an important issue and we can't talk about it enough. Thank you  for drawing the Nation's attention to it tonight.   Madam Speaker, our final new Member that we wanted to introduce  tonight comes from another big State, and that is California.   I want to tell you a little bit about Representative Kevin Kiley. He  serves the people of California's Third District in the House. He is  from that district. He was born there. He attended the local public  high school there. His mom was a special education teacher. I guess  that inspired him because he began his career as a 10th grade English  teacher at Manual Arts High School in inner city LA.   He chaired the English Department there. He led his students to  significant academic gains and he founded an award-winning speech and  debate team.   After graduating law school, he helped prosecute the civil case  against China's Huawei Technologies for intellectual property theft. He  defended the   [[Page H320]]  Constitution in California courts--we have that in common. We did a lot  of that work in the courts before we came to Congress. He became a  prosecutor and he represented the people of the State of California  against violent felons as a deputy attorney general.    He was first elected to the California State Assembly in 2016, and he  did some significant work there in his tenure. He introduced  significant school choice legislation. He authored ground-breaking new  laws and protections for sexual assault victims, and privacy and  criminal justice reform, and freedom of speech. In fact, in 2020, he  was named the National Legislator of the Year for that work for  advancing economic freedom.   I could go on about his bio, but I do want to mention this one little  minor note. He has a bachelor's degree from Harvard, a law degree from  Yale, and a master's in secondary education from Loyola Marymount.  Clearly, he is overqualified to serve in the U.S. Congress, but we are  glad he is here. I think he brings a lot to this body and will be an  extraordinary Member.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Kiley).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend.  California's Third District is well-represented as everyone can see.   Madam Speaker, as is also obvious by the sample of new Members that  we presented here tonight from New York, Florida, California, and  Texas, this is an extraordinary class of Republican Members who have  joined our conference here in the Congress. We look forward to serving  with them. These will be fateful days for our country, and there is  much hard work ahead in the 118th Congress.   Madam Speaker, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 5 o'clock and 49 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, January 26, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.
