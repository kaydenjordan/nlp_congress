 Madam President, first, this morning, I join  colleagues on  [[Page S5856]]  both sides of the Capitol in expressing our grief and sadness at the  passing of our House colleague, Chairman Elijah Cummings.   In his over more than two decades in the House of Representatives,  Cummings became a living legend in his native Baltimore. By all  accounts, he was a powerful and passionate voice on the national stage  and was a strong advocate for his neighbors, his district, and his  values. He counted close friends and admirers from all across the  political spectrum.   The Capitol will lower its flags today to mark this significant loss  and remember a life well lived. The Senate unites our prayers with  those in the House for Maya, Elijah's wife; for his children; and for  all of the colleagues, friends, and staff who will miss him greatly.                            ____________________     Madam President, on an entirely different matter, I  was encouraged to see yesterday's display of bipartisan concern in the  House of Representatives for sustaining America's global leadership  and, specifically, over the damaging impact of hastily withdrawing that  leadership from Syria.   Back in January, I led a forward-looking debate here in the Senate on  these very issues. I sponsored an amendment to S. 1 that earned the  support of a bipartisan supermajority--70 Senators. We went on the  record as opposing a premature exit from Syria or Afghanistan and  emphasized the need for sustained American leadership in the fight  against terrorism.   I was disappointed when a number of leading Democrats, including my  counterpart, the Democratic leader, and most of our colleagues who are  running for President, voted against this bipartisan consensus, but,  overall, a huge majority of the Senate spoke up strongly.   I know many of us are keen on engaging in these important issues  further in light of recent events. As the Senate debates our Middle  East policy and contemplates what action to take, I believe it is  important that we make a strong, forward-looking, strategic statement.   For that reason, my preference would be for something even stronger  than the resolution the House passed yesterday, which has some serious  weaknesses. It is so narrowly drafted that it fails to address the  plight of imperiled Sunni Arab and minority Christian communities in  Syria. It is backward-looking, and it is curiously silent on the issue  of whether to actually sustain a U.S. military presence in Syria,  perhaps to spare the Democrats from having to go on the record on this  key question.   So my first preference is for something stronger than the House  resolution. I look forward to continuing to engage with my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle as we chart the right course, and I expect  many of us will have much more to say on the subject very soon.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, this week, I  have been discussing how Washington Democrats have sought for 3 years  to effectively nullify the Trump Presidency. They have tried to cancel  out the voters' decision in 2016 and dodge the consequences of  Secretary Clinton's defeat whether it be through the 3-year-old  impeachment parade that the House Democrats have been leading or  through the unprecedented delays and obstruction that has been visited  on the President's nominations here in the Senate.   Well, our Democratic colleagues will today mount yet another effort  to fire up the time machine. They want to move forward with legislation  that would undo a major regulatory reform success story of the Trump  administration's and reopen the Obama administration's disastrous War  on Coal. Specifically, they want to try and revive the so-called Clean  Power Plan, which is a dangerous, misguided policy that the Trump  administration has rightly done away with. We will be voting on this  resolution later today.   The basic facts haven't changed since this job-killing scheme was  first put forward back in 2014. This relic of the Obama administration  would have further buried the producers of affordable American energy  under a mountain of stifling redtape. It would have created overlapping  local, State, and Federal standards, unrealistic compliance deadlines,  and would have set up a Washington bureaucracy that would effectively  root for American energy to fail. It is no wonder, by one analysis,  that 125,000 jobs would have been on the chopping block had President  Obama gotten his way.   The workers in my State know better than anyone the true costs of the  last administration's misguided War on Coal. Kentucky workers know what  happens when plants that create jobs and generate affordable  electricity at the same time are simply shut down.   That is why I have been proud to lead the fight in ending the  regulatory War on Coal. It is why I wrote every Governor in the country  in 2015 and raised my concerns about the Obama administration's  dangerous Clean Power Plan scheme, because, even today, nearly 3 years  into an administration that is not at war with American energy,  Kentucky miners continue to feel the effects of the previous  administration's policies.   We also know that the full effects of the Clean Power Plan would have  stretched far beyond coal country. The ripples of this harmful proposal  would have been felt across the country by Americans in paying their  power bills.   One independent report predicted that consumers in 40 States,  including Kentucky, would have seen double-digit percentage increases  in their electricity costs, and by the Obama officials' own admissions,  the proposal would have hit low-income and minority communities the  hardest. Let me say that again: Low-income and minority populations  would have been hit the hardest by the double-digit electricity bill  increases in four out of every five States. That is quite a rap sheet  for a Federal policy.   In a nation in which carbon emissions have already been trending  downward, this proposal would have sold off our economic edge to  overseas competitors whose emissions are, actually, steadily climbing.  It would have taken the legs out from under American job creators while  some of the world's leading polluters would have continued to roar  right past us. It would have literally shipped our economic  competitiveness to places like China and India.   Here is how experts estimated the effect of all of this self- inflicted economic damage on the climate: a one one-hundredth-of-1- degree difference by 2050. Here is the impact estimated to have  happened if it had gone forward--a one one-hundredth-of-1-degree  difference by 2050. Think how deeply you would have to be in the grip  of leftwing ideology for that trade-off to sound like a good deal for  American families.   Today's effort to revive this bad policy is being pushed by the same  Senate Democrats who, overwhelmingly, could not bring themselves to  vote against something as absurd as the Green New Deal back in March.  Unfortunately, we know there is a considerable appetite among Democrats  to inflict huge economic harm on American workers and American families  just so we can better comply with this new green religion.   But here is the good news for my constituents in Kentucky and for  hard-working Americans across the Nation: Senate Republicans are on the  case, and we will not let far-left fashions take precedence over the  common good of our country.   The American people have elected an administration and a Senate  majority that trusts workers and job creators, not Washington  bureaucracies. We have spent years cleaning up the mess of  overregulation that the Obama era has left behind, and we will continue  to stop the Democrats from reenacting that damaging history.   So I would urge all of my colleagues to join with us today and oppose  these efforts to nullify a Presidency and take us backward.   Let's vote to keep this ill-conceived, leftwing policy on the shelf,  where it belongs.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there are two bills at  the desk due a second reading en bloc.  [[Page S5857]]     In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provision of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, our Democratic colleagues insist that  despite their political differences with President Trump, they are  still prepared to tackle important legislation and do our work for the  American people.   Well, next week they will have an opportunity to prove it. Congress  has fallen badly behind schedule on appropriations. It has been a month  since my Democratic colleagues filibustered government funding on the  floor, blocking defense funding and a pay raise for our servicemembers.  We need to get moving. The country is watching. It is time to make  progress.   So in just a moment, I will file cloture on motions to proceed to two  government funding bills, setting up votes for next week.   In order to meet Democrats halfway, the first House shell we will  vote on will be a package of domestic funding bills. If we can get  bipartisan support to take up that domestic funding bill, we will stay  on it until we complete it. I hope Chairman Shelby and Senator Leahy  can work together to craft a bipartisan substitute amendment.   Afterward, we will turn to a second package, including the defense  funding that our Armed Forces and commanders need, especially in this  dangerous time and considering current events, plus resources for other  priorities such as the opioid epidemic. So we will be voting next week,  and I urge all of our colleagues to move in that direction. Let's make  good on all the talk about bipartisanship and finally make progress  toward funding the government.                            ____________________     I send a cloture motion to the desk.
