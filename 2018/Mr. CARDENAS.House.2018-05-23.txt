 Mr. Chairman, first I would like to thank Chairman Mac  Thornberry and also Ranking Member Adam Smith for their fine work on  this and allowing me to bring my amendment to the floor.   My mindfulness amendment would create a pilot program to train  members of the Armed Forces in mindfulness stress reduction techniques  before deploying to combat zones.   According to the VA, mindfulness practice has the potential to  benefit individuals with PTSD. Using mindfulness to strengthen reaction  to stress together with existing empirically supported PTSD treatments  may allow patients to persevere through trauma processing.   Rather than waiting to apply these treatments after the traumatic  event, why not prepare our brave young men and women who are being sent  into combat zones ahead of time?   A prior study with the Marines suggested mindfulness training was  beneficial for attention, working memory, as well as mood. My amendment  would expand this training to all branches of the Armed Forces,  including the Coast Guard. It would require a report on the success of  this training with stress management and preventing PTSD.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.
