 Mr. President: This year, Northwest Missouri State  University set a record when it became the first Division II school to  win the men's basketball and football championships in the same season.   It also became the first Division I or II school in the past decade  to win titles in both those sports in the same year.   Located in Maryville, about one hundred miles north of Kansas City,  Northwest Missouri State University was established in 1905.   With five NCAA championships already under their belt, Bearcats  football began their 2016 season with the goal of adding another title  to their great program. Under head Coach Adam Dorrel, they finished  their record-setting year with a victory over the University of North  Alabama in the brutally cold Division II championship game last  December. The Bearcats have now gone 55-2 over four seasons, and their  30 straight victories over the last two years is the longest current  win streak in all of NCAA football.   But the men's basketball team gave Bearcats fans plenty more to cheer  about. After a very successful regular season, the Bearcats entered the  Division II tournament with a 29-1 record. And on March 25, they  defeated Fairmont State in the NCAA Division II championship game, a  first in the program's history.   Finishing the year with a near perfect record, Coach Ben McCollum  earned his third MIAA Coach of the Year honor. And the Bearcats' guard,  Justin Pitts, earned several honors and was named the DII Bulletin  Player of the Year.   Congratulations to Northwest Missouri State University on a  phenomenal year. Fans across the state are excited for another great  year as the Bearcats spend the off-season preparing to defend their  hard fought championship titles.                            ____________________
