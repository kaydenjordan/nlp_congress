 Mr. Speaker, on May 19, we recognized Armed Forces Day.  This is a day set aside to honor the brave men and women serving in the  U.S. military across the country.   In central Washington, this day was celebrated by the Ephrata  community at an event put on by the American Legion. The annual Nacho/ Taco Feed and Dessert was first started by 9-year-old Justin Pederson,  who wanted to help veterans in the area take the Honor Flight to  Washington, D.C.   I have had the distinct honor to welcome Honor Flight veterans from  central Washington, and it was an opportunity that I will never forget.  The Honor Flight enables veterans from World War II, the Korean war,  and the Vietnam war, to visit the memorials that have been erected for  their service.  [[Page H4246]]    I want to thank Justin and the American Legion in Ephrata for their  work to support the Honor Flight. Spending the afternoon learning about  the once in a lifetime experiences from local veterans is an  excellent way to recognize military members. I look forward to greeting  more veterans from Washington in the future.                            ____________________
