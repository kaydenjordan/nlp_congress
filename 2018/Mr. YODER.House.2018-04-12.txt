 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the Give Seven Days  challenge that began in my district in Kansas this week, an outreach  program founded by a woman named Mindy Corporon.   Mindy tragically lost both her father, William, and her 14-year-old  son, Reat, in the horrific shooting at the Jewish Community Center and  Village Shalom in Overland Park back in April of 2014.   Who among us would have questioned Mindy if she slipped into despair  after such a loss? Losing a parent is difficult enough, and losing your  child on the same day is something no person should ever have to  endure. But instead of despair, Mindy has chosen love, faith, kindness,  and remembrance.   She founded Give Seven Days, which challenges young and old to  embrace diversity across race, religion, and culture. It also honors  the memory of William, Reat, and Terri LaManno, the third victim of the  attack.   Mr. Speaker, let's all follow Mindy's example. Let's remember those  we have lost and, in their memory, create a wave of positive change for  the future.   Let's make a ripple and change the world.                            ____________________
