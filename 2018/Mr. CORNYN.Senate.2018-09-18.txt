 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last night, the Senate Judiciary Committee  announced that there would be an additional public hearing to address  the allegations of misconduct that had been made against Judge Brett  Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court. So far,  all we have is an accusation--one that, frankly, has a lot of holes in  it as far as the time and circumstances under which this alleged event  occurred. Nonetheless, it is a very serious allegation about misconduct  that one claims happened about 36 years ago when she, Judge Kavanaugh,  and others were involved as teenagers.   Judge Kavanaugh and the other individual allegedly involved have said  that this incident did not happen. They unequivocally deny the claim,  and, thus far, no other individuals have corroborated the accuser's  statement.   The reason we find ourselves in this very unusual situation, where we  have actually had the confirmation hearing of the nominee and we find  it necessary to have a supplemental or additional hearing is that our  Democratic colleagues failed to raise this accusation so that it could  be handled in a bipartisan, regular manner in which the Judiciary  Committee handles background investigations, understanding that when  somebody goes through a background investigation, sometimes information  comes up that is particularly sensitive, sometimes embarrassing; maybe  it is about financial matters or other personal matters. So the  practice of the Judiciary Committee is to have those background  investigations handled with great care by specially cleared  individuals. Then, following the hearing, the open hearing, that  information will be shared with members of the committee, and they can  then ask any questions they may want to ask in a closed session.   We did not have that opportunity because the ranking member did not  even alert members of her own party about the existence of this  accusation that she had had for some 6 weeks. So we weren't able to do  the sort of due diligence that has come to be the practice of the  Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan basis. The ranking member, who was  forwarded the allegation, did not even attend the closed session where  we considered the background investigation that had been done on Judge  Kavanaugh, and, as I said, she didn't do anything with the allegation  for almost 2 months.   What is clear is that this allegation has been handled--or I should  say egregiously mishandled--up until now. But that is no excuse for us  to continue to do the same. We need to return this process to its  ordinary rules and procedures. We will take these accusations with the  seriousness they deserve, and that is in a way that is fair to both the  alleged victim and the judge himself.   Because of our friends on the other side's fondness for gotcha  moments and political theater throughout the confirmation process, so  far that fairness has mostly been lost. It has been denied the victim,  who said that she wanted privacy, and it has been denied Judge  Kavanaugh, who has flatly disavowed the claims. He had no opportunity  during his confirmation hearing, either in open or in closed session,  to answer questions about these allegations. This has really been a  driveby attack on the character of this judge.   Again, it is a serious accusation that we will take--and have taken-- seriously, but, unfortunately, this process has gotten away from being  about getting to the truth and has been more about gamesmanship and  delay. The timing and the way in which this allegation was sprung  attest to that. That is why, initially, I was somewhat skeptical about  rewarding this bad behavior by calling for another public hearing. I  had confidence in the committee's usual process for dealing with  situations like this, which would ensure that both sides would be heard  and that sensitive matters would be handled with the sensitivity they  deserve.   When I spoke to him yesterday, Judge Kavanaugh's commitment to  transparency and eagerness to address these false allegations head-on  was clear.   When members of the committee met yesterday to discuss a possible  path forward, we agreed that a supplemental hearing was in order. I  went along with that consensus point of view.   I want to commend Chairman Grassley for his leadership, and I  certainly support his decision to hold an additional hearing next  Monday. As he said yesterday, anyone who comes forward under  circumstances like this deserves to be heard in an ``appropriate,  precedented and respectful manner.'' How our colleagues across the  aisle conduct themselves will prove whether they are actually  interested in getting to the truth of these allegations or whether this  is just an exercise in character assassination.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, last night we voted on  a very important piece of legislation called the Opioid Crisis Response  Act, which came to us from the HELP Committee; that is, the Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.   Thanks to Chairman Alexander, the chairman of the HELP Committee, and  as a result of his hard work and the contributions of 70 Senators and 5  standing committees, we were able to come up with a package that had  overwhelming support. I believe it was 99 to 1, if I am not mistaken.   The House has already passed its version of this legislation, so it  was important that we do the same and get the bill to the President  soon. I am happy to report that we have now done that.   Included in this Opioid Crisis Response Act was something called the  STOP Act, which is a bipartisan piece of legislation that imposes new  requirements on the U.S. Postal Service and Customs and Border  Protection. It will close loopholes that are currently being exploited  by drug traffickers to evade detection when shipping synthetic opioids,  like fentanyl, because so few of those postal packages are actually  inspected to find out whether they include drugs like fentanyl.   The package we voted on also includes a bill I sponsored with the  senior Senator from California called the Substance Abuse Prevention  Act, believing that we need to do something, not only about the supply  side of the problem but the demand side as well. This piece of  legislation is important because it will reauthorize the Office of  National Drug Control Policy. We need a strategy, and we need an Office  of National Drug Control Policy, not only to articulate but also to  help execute that strategy.   This bill will also seek to reduce demand for illegal drugs in a  variety of ways: education for medical providers, expanding drug  awareness campaigns, and funding drug courts and nonprofits that  provide interventions to people struggling with addiction.   I have seen drug courts in action, and they actually work. People who  commit offenses involving illegal drugs can actually be monitored and  given wraparound care and support not only to help them deal with their  addiction but also to help them reenter a productive society.   Unfortunately, Texas is no stranger when it comes to illegal drugs.  In fact, one in three Texans responded to a recent poll saying that  they knew somebody addicted to painkillers. One in three said they knew  somebody addicted to painkillers. Last year, close to 3,000 Texans died  from drug overdoses. That is nearly triple the number in 2000. That is  simply unacceptable. Eighteen years have passed, and the number is  three times higher.   Experts have said it is estimated to rise again by 6 percent this  year. Those numbers are about real human beings and are a tragedy.  Clearly, something is not working.   That suspicion is confirmed by the researchers who are saying that  overdoses are now the leading cause of maternal deaths in my State. In  Texas, emergency room personnel have said that they are seeing younger  and younger children gaining access to these addictive opioids, and  patients  [[Page S6216]]  are making violent threats when they are not given the prescriptions  they need to address their addiction.   I wish I could say that this was just some bad movie or an episode of  ``Breaking Bad'' and that we could turn it off or change the channel,  but we simply can't.   This spike in drug use has occurred across the entire Nation, and it  has multiple causes. There are enterprising drug entrepreneurs, some of  them in China with new equipment and labs and marketing schemes and  sales platforms.   Then there is the role of the drug cartels, primarily south of the  border. These drug cartels' operations are increasingly sophisticated,  and their income streams have become diversified, including fuel theft.  In the words of one person with knowledge of this matter, they are  commodity agnostics. These cartels will ship drugs; they will ship  people; and they will traffic children for sex. They will do anything  to make money, and they care nothing about their victims.   Then we know there is also the social isolation and breakdown in  American communities that help contribute to this crisis. There are  those men and women who, for their own reasons, turn to drugs for  relief, either unaware of the dangers they pose or naively thinking  that perhaps they are strong enough to avoid the attraction of  addiction.   In many places, illegal drugs are now resulting in more deaths than  criminal homicides, car crashes, or HIV. We know we have a jaw- dropping, society-wide problem on our hands. According to the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention, 72,000 Americans died last year as  a result of drug overdoses--72,000. It is incumbent on us to do  everything we can, including passing this opioid legislation and  working in tandem with State and local governments, as well as  nonprofit groups and religious ministries.   In the Texas capital of Austin, where I live, one of these groups is  called Bridge of Angels. Every Sunday, it meets under an overpass right  where Interstate Highway 35 cuts through the heart of Austin. Drug  users and others struggling go there, and they find people who will  listen and people who will help. But if you stay on Interstate Highway  35 and, instead of exiting, head south for 3\1/2\ hours, eventually you  will hit Mexico. I-35 proceeds all the way to Laredo and, of course,  Nuevo Laredo, all the way on the other side of the border.  Unfortunately, that interstate and others are some of the conduits used  to transport drugs from Mexico right to America's doorstep.    U.S. Customs and Border Protection, led by leaders like my friend,  Rio Grande Valley Sector Chief Manny Padilla, and the new, very  impressive Border Patrol Chief, Carla Provost, whom I met with last  week, do everything in their power to detect these poisons before they  can make it over to the U.S. side. Many times, they are successful, but  the smugglers are cunning, and they are driven by a ruthless profit  motive. They hide drugs inside of food and drink containers, luggage,  metal panels and equipment, and their cars and trucks. They are quite  clever about when and how they cross the border, so sometimes these  drugs get through, and then they spread.   As Chief Provost testified recently, one of the ways drugs make their  way across the border is that the cartels, who are moving people from  Central America, both unaccompanied minors and family units--because  they know that it is such a labor-intensive job to process these  children and these family units at the border because they require  special procedures, many times the drug cartels will use that as a  diversionary tactic to move drugs through another part of the border.  So we are more vulnerable than I think perhaps most of our people  recognize.   Of course, we know these drugs are hawked to children, to teenagers,  and they are sold and distributed all across the country. What starts  south of the border doesn't stay south of the border; it ends up in our  neighborhoods, our schools, our hospitals, and, unfortunately, in our  funeral parlors.   The point I want to make is the point I tried to emphasize last week,  which is that our War on Drugs is Mexico's War on Drugs too.   I was in Mexico City about 3 weeks ago. Many of our outstanding  professionals at the American Embassy say that many of the people in  Mexico regard the drug and the immigration problem as our problem, not  their problem. Well, it is their problem when more people have died of  violence in Mexico--drug-related cartel violence--from 2007 to today  than have died in Afghanistan and Iraq combined, and it is getting  worse. To me, that is not just an American problem; that is a Mexican  and American problem.   In 2006, Felipe Calderon, the President of Mexico, initiated an armed  response to the cartels that were wreaking havoc in his country and,  based on some estimates, now control more than a third of the country's  geographical territory. Let me pause and reemphasize that. Now,  according to some estimates, the drug cartels control a third or more  of Mexico itself--a country of 125 million people, with a 1,200-mile  common border with the United States of America, and that is just the  Texas portion. Because of their success in displacing traditional  authorities and usurping the role of law enforcement and government in  many parts of the country, these cartels have sometimes created what  has been referred to as a ``parallel state'' in Mexico--ungoverned by  anyone except for the drug cartels. As a matter of fact, law  enforcement can't even get into these areas for fear of being wiped  out.   The Mexican legal system tries to keep up, and certainly the country  has developed laws and institutions that certainly I in no way want to  denigrate, but because of corruption and these powerful criminal  organizations, a genuine rule of law is missing in many large swaths of  the country and has been for generations.   Again, our Mexican friends say: Well, if it weren't for the demand  for these drugs in the United States, it wouldn't fuel these cartels  and the violence that goes along with it. They have a very important  point. But this is not just an American problem; this is, as I said, a  Mexican and an American problem.   I hope that I have been able to sketch how difficult these deep- seated drug-related problems are for us to resolve, but we can't--we  don't have the luxury of ignoring them or pretending they don't exist.  They are real, and they are taking the lives of Americans on a daily,  hourly, minute-by-minute basis, and they affect all segments of our  society.   Thankfully, the United States has partnered with Mexico in recent  years through programs like the Merida Initiative and directed funds  toward strengthening communities and empowering the Mexican criminal  justice system and judicial system so that a culture of impunity no  longer exists. What I mean by that is if criminals feel that they can  commit crimes, including murder, and that they will never be charged  and convicted and imprisoned, then there is no deterrence, and so the  killings continue. We have also collaborated on intelligence matters  and have cooperated in a variety of ways on providing security.   But we have to do even more, I believe, together, on our side of the  border--the drug demand--and on the Mexican side. At least based on the  criminal violence last year rising to perhaps its highest levels ever  before seen, our investments aren't paying off, and we need to double  down, working with our Mexican partners in the commitment not only to  provide the rule of law and eliminate impunity but to slow down and  hopefully ultimately stop the flow of these illegal drugs that are  killing so many Americans.   The consumption of these drugs in Mexico, at least, is not as high as  it is in our country, but it is growing. Their people are suffering  severe harm in that country--harm due to cartel violence and criminals  targeting politicians, the clergy, journalists, and innocent civilians,  in addition to the addictions. In the United States, as I mentioned,  overdose levels have skyrocketed.   My point is that the opioids package we have now passed is one way we  show our commitment to address these developments. It is how we say  enough is enough. Again, I wish I could be confident that our efforts  will stop and fix this problem once and for all, but they do represent  a significant step in the right direction.   With this legislation, we will reduce the use and supply of illicit  drugs and encourage recovery of those suffering  [[Page S6217]]  from addiction. We will support caregivers, and we will drive  innovation and long-term solutions. It is a powerful first step as we  continue, with our friends in Mexico, to work together hand in hand to  fight this terrible scourge.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3464         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
