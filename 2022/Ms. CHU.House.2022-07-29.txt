 Mr. Speaker, we are the only country in the world where mass  shootings continually happen. They happen in schools, grocery stores,  malls, hospitals, parades, you name it. In America, there has not been  a single week in 2022 without a mass shooting.   Weapons of war, especially, have no place in our streets or schools  or our grocery stores. They have no place in nail salons or churches or  shopping malls.   About their horrific impact on children like this, a trauma surgeon  said the tissue destruction is almost unimaginable. Bones are exploded.  Soft tissue is absolutely destroyed. It is like a bomb went off.   But we in Congress can end this. We can end this uniquely American  plague of mass death caused by gun violence. I support the assault  weapons ban because we cannot wait to act until the next mass shooting.  We must pass this bill today.
