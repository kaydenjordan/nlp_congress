 Mr. Speaker, I rise to continue a series of 1-minute  speeches on cool science topics. Today I recognize the work of  scientists working in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica to develop  geological metal maps. Researchers developed a three-dimensional  electronic mapping system that is being used to detect large precious  metal deposits in the United States.   With funding from NSF, researchers mapped out the Nokomis deposit in  northern Minnesota, which is estimated to contain 10 billion pounds of  copper, 3.1 billion pounds of nickel, 4 million ounces of platinum, 9  million ounces of palladium, and 2 million ounces of gold. The value of  these metal deposits will more than pay for the science investment to  develop this technology.   Congress should support research that furthers the understanding of  our incredible universe, including the ground beneath our feet.                            ____________________
