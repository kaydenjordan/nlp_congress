 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 308 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 308         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2192) to       amend the Public Health Service Act to eliminate the non-      application of certain State waiver provisions to Members of       Congress and congressional staff. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill  [[Page H4115]]       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  During further consideration of the bill (H.R.       1628) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of       the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2017,       as amended, pursuant to House Resolution 228, the further       amendments printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution shall be considered as adopted.    The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The gentleman from  Georgia is recognized for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave      Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on House Resolution 308, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to bring  forward this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee.   Over the past few weeks, the Rules Committee has had the opportunity  to hear from numerous stakeholders, from the chairs and ranking members  of committees of jurisdiction to the Members who have offered  amendments.   Most recently, last night we heard testimony from Mr. MacArthur and  Mr. Upton to explain their amendments and address any questions from  the committee members, and from Ms. McSally to explain her legislation.                                time  0915    This rule provides for further consideration of H.R. 1628, the  American Health Care Act, and incorporates three amendments--the  Palmer-Schweikert amendment, the MacArthur amendment, and the Upton  amendment--that strengthen the underlying bill.   It also provides for consideration of H.R. 2192, legislation authored  by Representative McSally, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Energy  and Commerce.   Mr. Speaker, all across our country, the Affordable Care Act  continues to strip hardworking Americans and families of access to  affordable, quality medical care and offer them skyrocketing premiums  and anemic provider networks in return.   Democrats smuggled ObamaCare through with little regard for the  procedure, left lofty and empty promises that benefit simply a  bureaucratic machine. Seven years later, we have seen these promises  evaporate as ObamaCare patients lose access to their doctors and lose  the very insurance plans they were promised would remain intact.   Our friends across the aisle claim that coverage has been expanded  and individuals who never had quality health care before now have  access. Mr. Speaker, I wish that were true, but it is not. I wish my  colleagues and I didn't hear from neighbor after neighbor who can't  find a doctor to accept ACA insurance or who avoids medical care  altogether because their deductibles reach higher than the clouds. But  we do hear from them because Americans are suffering as insurance  providers flee from the not-so-free market.   You see, coverage doesn't mean access to care. Unfortunately, we have  heard all too often that individuals may have health coverage, but they  can't use it because their premiums and deductibles are too high for  them to actually afford the care.   What good does the coverage do a woman who earns $22,000 a year and  has a $5,000 deductible?   What good does it do a young family to have insurance that no  provider in their community accepts?   What good does it do to say we want to grow the economy and create  jobs when American businesses are struggling to keep their doors open  due to the ObamaCare mandate?   We have witnessed insurers dropping out of the exchanges and seen  premiums climbing while consumers are left with less and less choice.  Five States have one option and no choice for health insurance, and  nothing guarantees that their residents will keep that much.   ObamaCare has hijacked the free market, and it has taken some  Americans' liberties with it. We must remember that exchanging freedom,  choice, self-determination for securities at the hands of Big Brother  too often leaves us with neither liberty nor security.   We know that ObamaCare was designed to make a single-payer system  inevitable. And to the extent that a single-payer system means a zero- choice system, the prophecy has already come true.   Families can no longer choose to save for retirement or pay their  mortgages because premiums suck up all the oxygen in their budget.  Individuals who want to purchase a PPO cannot because their county only  offers HMO plans. Disabled Americans who depend on Medicare find that  ObamaCare has given more Federal funding to able-bodied Americans than  our more vulnerable neighbors.   In my district, a young mother who wants to take her young son to the  family doctor post-ObamaCare can't because she can't find a physician  who accepts her new insurance.   Brittany Ivey and her husband have struggled under the consequences  of the Affordable Care Act. Mrs. Ivey was working part-time at a small  business that provided her family with health insurance until the  effects of ObamaCare on the insurance market raised her premiums  sharply. This drove the Ivey family into the individual market, where a  midlevel plan took 65 percent of her monthly gross income, even after a  small Federal subsidy. Unable to afford insurance through her employer,  Mrs. Ivey turned to the Federal exchange, where she obtained a plan  that neither she nor her children's doctor would accept.   The Affordable Care Act robbed Americans of the ability to choose  health care that worked for them, and the Affordable Care Act destroyed  the insurance market along with the benefits that competition and  innovation offer all of us. The American people deserve better.  ObamaCare replaced our doctors with bureaucrats because that is what  socialized medicine does.   The American Health Care Act is our last chance to get off the  Federal ferris wheel before we are locked into a healthcare system that  takes us nowhere and offers neighbors nothing but heartburn.   The American Health Care Act guts the most egregious provisions of  ObamaCare, rolls back the law's taxes, restores flexibility to the  States, and helps to make quality care more accessible and affordable.   Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons I came to Congress is to repeal and  replace ObamaCare and rein in our Nation's bloated, ballooning  entitlement system. The American Health Care Act does that by, for the  first time, making major reforms to an entitlement program--Medicaid.  It rolls back the Medicaid expansion under ObamaCare, one of the  fundamental pillars, and it makes structural changes to the program to  ensure it only goes to the individuals it was intended to help.   The American Health Care Act allows States to establish work  requirements for able-bodied adult Medicaid enrollees. It lets States  choose between the per capita cap and a flexible Medicare block grant,  and it increases the growth rate to cover disabled and elderly Medicaid  populations.   The bill enacts patient-centered reforms, increases access to  healthcare savings accounts, and creates a Patient and State Stability  Fund to help stabilize insurance markets that have contracted during  ObamaCare.   Over the course of the last several weeks, we have worked in this  House to strengthen the bill. We have listened to feedback from  constituents, neighbors, stakeholders, and each other.    Importantly, coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions is  maintained as a baseline within the bill. An  [[Page H4116]]  amendment from Mr. MacArthur further protects individuals' preexisting  conditions from being denied coverage.   While the amendment provides States with additional flexibility by  allowing them to seek a waiver, individuals with preexisting conditions  will not be left out to dry. In fact, there are conditions attached to  the waiver that ensure States use funds provided by the bill, should  they receive a waiver, to set up high-risk pools for those very  individuals. With the addition of the Upton amendment, the bill  provides $108 billion to help States fund programs such as high-risk  pools.   Mr. Speaker, my home State of Georgia has very different needs than  California. That is why I think it makes sense to give States more say  in what works for their populations. Our plan does this, but it does so  in a way that ensures protections exist for vulnerable populations like  the elderly, disabled, and children.   The rule also provides for Representative McSally's legislation to  ensure that Members of Congress are treated the same as all Americans.  I fully support this bill and firmly believe elected officials should  be required to live under the same laws as those they were elected to  represent.   President Trump has made his support of the American Health Care Act  and its strengthening amendments clear, and I stand with him in  supporting this legislation to gut ObamaCare and rescue the American  people.   Mr. Speaker, average premiums rose by 40 percent or more in 11 States  just this year. The statistics and the stories speak for themselves. We  must act to dismantle ObamaCare, and the Affordable Care Act does that.   I support the rule before us today to provide for further  improvements to the bill and look forward to supporting both the rule  and the underlying bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for  the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, pathetic, that is the word to describe this process and  this bill. If the American people could sue Congress for malpractice,  my Republican friends would be in deep trouble.   How could you do this? How could you do this to the American people?  How can you do this to the people you represent?   You are taking away essential healthcare protections. You are  allowing insurance companies to discriminate against people with  preexisting conditions. You are supporting a bill that will throw 24  million people off of their health care and cut Medicaid by $880  billion to give a $1 trillion tax break to the wealthiest people in  this country.   What is wrong with you guys?   Today's rule self-executes three of the newest Republican amendments  to the Republican health plan. This means, without any sort of debate  or discussion whatsoever, the Palmer, MacArthur, and Upton amendments  will magically pass the House.   What I find so hard to believe about this latest backroom deal is  that they actually make this bill worse. I didn't think that was  possible, Mr. Speaker.   To shore up support amongst this Chamber's most conservative faction,  Representative MacArthur and others made a deal with President Trump to  gut protections for individuals with preexisting conditions and to  eliminate essential health benefits like maternity care, mental health  treatment, and prescription drug coverage, just to name a few. These  are among the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act.   The American people were justifiably outraged, and they showed up by  the thousands to townhalls to express their anger. And there were some  on the Republican side who actually got it. They listened to their  constituents and they had the courage to stand up and say no.   But when Republican leaders came up short in their whip count,  Representative Upton ran to the White House and concocted a deal with  President Trump to try to win back votes. His amendment adds a measly  $8 billion spread out over 5 years in a futile attempt to soften the  devastating effect that this bill will have on millions and millions of  Americans with preexisting conditions.   Now, $8 billion over 5 years sounds like a lot, but when we are  talking about an entire country, it really isn't. Don't take it from  me. Robert Graboyes from the conservative Mercatus Center said:   ``The $8 billion amount is a pittance. Spread over 5 years, it's a  fifth of a pittance.''   This is not a leftwing organization. This is an organization funded  by Koch Industries, the Koch brothers. My friends love the Koch  brothers.   What's more, some analysts have already estimated that an additional  $200 billion will be needed over a decade to adequately fund high-risk  pools. So this amendment is billions upon billions upon billions of  dollars short. And as the Center for American Progress points out, the  Upton amendment ``will have almost no effect.''   Now, my colleagues who have been won over by this should be ashamed  of themselves. We are supposed to fix problems and help people, not  merely settle for political cover that can be used in a press release.  $8 billion to cover a $200 billion shortfall? Back where I come from,  we call that being a cheap date. I guarantee you, your constituents are  going to figure this out, and they will not be happy.   So to so-called moderate Republicans who have contorted themselves  this week to try to find a fix to the damage being done to the people  with preexisting conditions, I have breaking news: I have a magic  bullet fix if Republicans really want to protect people with  preexisting conditions. Are you ready? Brace yourselves. Don't change  the law. Everyone is already protected by the Affordable Care Act,  including people with preexisting conditions and those who struggle to  find affordable care. Let me say to my colleagues that to claim or  imply that this Republican plan covers preexisting conditions is a lie,  plain and simple.    Now, let me say a few words about the process that has been used to  bring this bill to the floor. It has been a disaster from start to  finish, with secret negotiations, backroom deals, and bribes to buy off  factions within the Republican Conference. There have been no hearings  on this bill whatsoever. And the Republican leadership couldn't even  slow down long enough to receive a score from the CBO.   I have one simple question: What is the rush? Wait a week and get a  CBO score. Why is that such a radical idea?   Mr. Speaker, are Republican leaders jamming this bill through to  appease Donald Trump?   Are they concerned that a new CBO score will confirm what we already  know is true, that this bill will be devastating to the people of this  country, force even more people to lose their health care, especially  to older, sick, and low-income Americans.   Or maybe, Mr. Speaker, Republican leaders are worried that their  colleagues will go home over this weeklong break and actually hear from  their constituents who overwhelmingly oppose this effort to repeal the  Affordable Care Act.   Honestly, I don't know how my Republicans friends can defend this  terrible, closed, authoritarian process. It is an absolute disgrace.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill, or, better yet, I  urge my Republicans colleagues to do what they did a couple of weeks  ago and pull this disastrous bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on the Budget.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on the Budget.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  0930    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if my colleagues are aware  of this since we are moving so quickly here, but I want to flag for  everyone an important op-ed in The Hill by the executive director of  the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center. She points out that in the latest  version of this legislation, rape can once again be categorized as a  preexisting condition as it often was before the Affordable Care Act.   I include her column, entitled ``Health `reform' will make sexual  assault survivors sick,'' in the Record.          Health `Reform' Will Make Sexual Assault Survivors Sick                            (By Gina Scaramella)         So far, we know that about 24 million Americans stand to       lose their health insurance coverage if the Affordable Care       Act (ACA) is replaced with the American Health Care Act       (AHCA). We know that most of those 24 million people will be       low-income.        We also know that groups of people who experience       significant health care disparities, such as lesbian, gay,       bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, and Black and Latino       people, will be among those who risk losing the most if the       ACA is repealed. To that list, we must add survivors of       sexual violence.        Before passage of the ACA in 2010, sexual assault survivors       who had sought medical care for their injuries could be       denied health insurance coverage at a later date. The reason?       Health insurers often categorized rape as a pre-existing       health condition.        In one widely reported case, a 45-year-old woman met two       men at a bar in Florida who bought her a drink. Hours later,       she found herself lying by the side of the road with injuries       indicating that she had been raped and that the men had       spiked her drink. Her doctor prescribed a treatment of anti-      viral, post-HIV exposure drugs to protect against HIV       transmission.        When the woman lost her health insurance several months       after the attack, she was unable to obtain new insurance due       to the health care treatment she had received for the       assault. She went without health insurance for three years.        Stories like these prompted the National Women's Law Center       to launch a campaign called ``Being a Woman Is Not a Pre-      Existing Condition.'' It was so popular that then-House       Speaker Nancy Pelosi adopted the phrase in her pro-health       reform talking points with media, and the New York Times ran       an explainer on the ways in which health insurers treated       women as if they were just one giant pre-existing condition.        The AHCA initially retained the ACA's ban on discrimination       against people with pre-existing conditions. But an amendment       to the AHCA bill offered last week by New Jersey Congressman       Tom MacArthur and North Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows       would make it easier for health insurers to deny coverage to       people with pre-existing conditions.        By letting states waive the ACA prohibition on charging       people with pre-existing health conditions higher premiums,       protections for those who've previously been medically       treated for sexual assault would be gutted.        Perhaps more alarming, though, is the MacArthur-Meadows       amendment's provision allowing states to also seek waivers       from the ACA's requirement that essential health benefits be       covered by health insurance plans. Essential health benefits       include preventive health care services that most of us take       for granted. These include tests for blood pressure and       cholesterol, mammograms, and vaccinations. Essential health       benefits also include coverage for mental health care and       substance abuse treatment.        Sexual violence survivors face acute treatment needs in the       aftermath of an assault such as care for gynecological       injuries, other physical trauma, sexually-transmitted       diseases, and pregnancy. But sexual violence takes many       forms: incest: ongoing sexual abuse outside of the family,       sexual assault, sexual harassment or exploitation, and rape.       Each of these types of assault puts the survivor at risk for       various potential negative physical health and mental health       outcomes.        For example, an adult survivor of childhood sexual abuse is       at a higher risk for psychiatric disorders. Women and men who       have survived rape as adults are at higher risk of post-      traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and substance       abuse--any of which can significantly interfere with daily       living. No one can deny that there is a direct line between       having survived sexual violence, and an increased risk of       physical and mental health problems.        The mental health impacts of sexual violence are deep and       often longstanding. Survivors need long-term access to       nonjudgmental health and mental health services to reduce       their suffering and mitigate as much as possible the stress       that recovery from sexual violence puts on intimate family       relationships, and obligations related to school and work.        It is hard to see any good coming from this latest attempt       to repeal the ACA and all of the care it has brought to       survivors of sexual violence.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene).   Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, this destructive legislation hurts middle  class families and threatens massive disruption to our healthcare  system. And it has only gone from bad to worse.   Stripping protections from 133 million Americans with preexisting  conditions isn't just wrong, it is inhumane. Nobody in this country  should go bankrupt trying to afford the medical care they need to stay  alive.   This isn't about politics; it is about human decency and who we are  as Americans. It is about people like Jackie, a cancer survivor from  Snohomish who says the Affordable Care Act saved her life.   She wrote to me saying: ``My cancer recurred, but I was covered. I  was able to complete my treatments without having to worry about how to  put food on the table. Or being left to die. Because of the ACA, I  survived.''   We all have stories like this in our districts, but some of my  colleagues aren't listening. I hope they find the courage and the  wisdom to vote ``no'' on this dangerous legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Castro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   At this time, I think one of the interesting things is, as discussed,  the criticism of this. I think it was just a reminder, Mr. Speaker, of  what happened 7 years ago when our healthcare market, which could have  been helped by many good ideas, was decided to be taken on a very  unhealthy bent. We are now paying the price for that. We are going to  continue to see that unless we change it. We are changing that for the  better.   One of the strongest voices that we have had in this body is someone  who has actually taken it as his living to take care of people. Dr.  Burgess not only came to this Congress with a strong voice of not only  what doctors and the medical profession have, but I think it gives us  an insight into what patients need as well. He has been a clarion voice  through this whole process, before ObamaCare, during the disaster of  ObamaCare, and now as we look to fix the problems that have existed.   I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Burgess).    Will the gentleman yield?   Mr. McGOVERN. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.    Will the gentleman yield?   Mr. McGOVERN. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.    Will the gentleman yield?   Mr. McGOVERN. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.    I thank the gentleman for yielding. As a  wonderful manager of time, he will be able to parse the time as best he  may see fit. I have other speakers who probably will be coming by, so I  will just encourage the manager to manage his time well.   Mr. McGOVERN. It looks kind of lonely over there. It speaks volumes  about how much support there is for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  [[Page H4122]]  American College of Physicians in opposition to the bill.                                 American College of Physicians,                                                     April 24, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Majority Leader       McConnell, and Minority Leader Schumer: On behalf of the       American College of Physicians (ACP), I am writing to urge       Congress to move away from the harmful changes to patient       care that would occur if the American Health Care Act (AHCA)       were to become law, and to instead work for bipartisan       solutions to improve the Affordable Care Act (ACA) rather       than repealing and replacing it. We believe that the AHCA,       which would repeal and replace the most important coverage       and consumer protections created by the ACA, is so       fundamentally flawed that it cannot be made acceptable. We       understand that the leadership in the House of       Representatives continues to explore ways to bring a modified       version of the AHCA to a vote, based on a draft amendment       reportedly being developed by Representatives MacArthur and       Meadows, a summary of which was made available to the public       through news organizations. This amendment would make the       harmful AHCA even worse by creating new coverage barriers for       patients with pre-existing conditions and weakening       requirements that insurers cover essential benefits.        The American College of Physicians is the largest medical       specialty organization and the second-largest physician group       in the United States. ACP members include 148,000 internal       medicine physicians (internists), related subspecialists, and       medical students. Internal medicine physicians are       specialists who apply scientific knowledge and clinical       expertise to the diagnosis, treatment, and compassionate care       of adults across the spectrum from health to complex illness.        The draft MacArthur-Meadows amendment would create what is       known as the ``Limited Waiver Option'' that would allow       states to eliminate or severely weaken vital ACA Title I       consumer protections--specifically, community rating and       essential health benefits (EHBs)--returning the country to       the pre-ACA days when persons with pre-existing       ``declinable'' medical conditions in most states were priced       out of the market and the insurance products available in the       individual market did not cover medically necessary services.        Specifically:        The MacArthur-Meadows amendment would create an option for       states to obtain Limited Waivers from certain federal       standards that would gut existing law consumer protections.       Based on a summary of the draft amendment, states could seek       Limited Waivers for:        Essential Health Benefits (EHBs)        Community-rating rules, except for the following       categories, which are not waivable: Gender or Age (except for       reductions of the 5:1 age ratio previously established) or       Health Status (unless the state has established a high-risk       pool or is participating in a federal high-risk pool)        To obtain the waiver, states would only need to ``attest       that the purpose of their requested waiver is to reduce       premium costs, increase the number of persons with healthcare       coverage, or advance another benefit to the public interest       in the state, including the guarantee of coverage for persons       with preexisting medical conditions. The Secretary shall       approve applications within 90 days of determining that an       application is complete.'' [Emphasis added in italics].        In other words, as long as a state attested that there was       a ``benefit to the public,'' insurers would be once again       allowed to charge more to people with pre-existing       conditions, or decline to cover needed benefits like       physician and hospital visits, maternity care and       contraception, mental health and substance use disorder       treatments, preventive services, and prescription drugs.        This would take us back to the days when people had to fill       out intrusive insurance company applications to document       their previous health history, even before being advised what       the premium would be based on their individual health risk.       Unlike community rating, which bases premiums based on the       expected costs associated with all persons in the insurance       pool (adjusted only by age, tobacco use, and family size),       the Limited Waiver would again allow insurers in states that       obtain a waiver to again charge people exorbitant and       unaffordable premiums for their pre-existing conditions.        Before the ACA, insurance plans sold in the individual       insurance market in all but five states typically maintained       lists of so-called ``declinable'' medical conditions       including asthma, diabetes, arthritis, obesity, stroke, or       pregnancy, or having been diagnosed with cancer in the past       10 years. Even if a revised bill would not explicitly repeal       the current law's guaranteed-issue requirement which requires       insurers to offer coverage to persons with pre-existing       conditions like these guaranteed issue without community       rating allows insurers to charge as much as they believe a       patient's treatment will cost. The result would be that many       patients with pre-existing conditions would be offered       coverage that costs them thousands of dollars more for the       care that they need, and in the case of patients with       expensive conditions like cancer, even hundreds of thousands       more.        An amendment to the AHCA reported out of the Rules       Committee on April 6th to establish a ``Federal Invisible       Risk Sharing Program,'' which would create a fund that states       could use to reimburse insurers for some of the costs       associated with insuring sicker patients, would not offset       the harm done to patients with pre-existing conditions by       allowing the Limited Waiver of community rating and essential       benefit protections. The pre-ACA experience with high-risk       pools was that many had long waiting lists, and offered       inadequate coverage with high deductibles and insufficient       benefits. Unless a national high-risk pool is supported with       a massive infusion of funding it will not be sufficient to       cover the millions of people with pre-existing conditions       that would be denied or charged more for coverage under       the AHCA. One paper estimates that a national high-risk       pool would cost $178.1 billion a year, roughly $176.4       billion more than the annual funding provided to the       Invisible Risk Sharing Program. Also, shifting people out       of the existing health insurance marketplace to a high-      risk pool would undermine the assurance that enrollees       could keep their existing coverage.        The Limited Waiver Option will also allow states to seek       waivers from the essential health benefits required of all       plans sold in the individual insurance market, with the       result that millions of patients will be at risk of losing       coverage for essential services like maternity care, cancer       screening tests and treatments, prescription drugs,       preventive services, mental health and substance use disorder       treatments, and even physician visits, prescription drugs and       hospitalizations.        Prior to passage of the ACA, 62% of individual market       enrollees did not have coverage of maternity services, 34 did       not have substance-use disorder-services, 18% did not have       mental-health services and 9% did not have coverage for       prescription drugs. A recent independent analysis found that       the AHCA's repeal of current law required benefits would       result in patients on average paying $1,952 more for cancer       drugs; $1,807 for drugs for heart disease; $1,127 for drugs       to treat lung diseases; $1,607 for drugs to treat mental       illnesses; $4,940 for inpatient admission for mental health;       $4,555 for inpatient admission for substance use treatment;       and $8,501 for maternity care. Such increased costs would       make it practically impossible for many patients to avail       themselves of the care they need. The result will be delays       in getting treatment until their illnesses present at a more       advanced, less treatable, and more expensive stage, or not       keeping up with life-saving medications prescribed by their       physicians.        Allowing states to eliminate the EHB will threaten our       nation's fight against the opioid epidemic. A study concluded       that with repeal of the ACA, ``approximately 1,253,000 people       with serious mental disorders and about 2.8 million Americans       with a substance use disorder, of whom about 222,000 have an       opioid disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance       coverage.'' Finally, allowing states to drop important       benefits like maternity, substance use disorder treatment,       and preventive services will do little to reduce premiums. A       report by Milliman found that the main drivers of premium       costs were ambulatory patient services, hospitalization, and       prescription drugs. These are crucial services that form the       core of any health insurance plan.        To be clear: while some younger and healthier persons might       be offered lower premiums in states that obtained a ``Limited       Waiver'' of community-rating and essential health benefits,       it would be at the expense of making coverage unaffordable       for those who need it most, older and sicker persons, and       result in skimpy ``bare-bones'' insurance for many others       that does not cover the medical care they would need if and       when they get sick.        Finally, even without the Limited Waiver Amendment, ACP       continues to believe that the AHCA has numerous other       provisions and policies that that will do great harm to       patients including:        The phase-out of the higher federal match in states that       have opted to expand Medicaid and the ban on non-expansion       states being able to access the higher federal contribution       if they choose to expand Medicaid;        Converting the shared federal-state financing structure for       Medicaid to one that would cap the federal contribution per       enrollee;        Providing states with a Medicaid block grant financing       option;        Eliminating EHBs for Medicaid expansion enrollees;        Imposing work or job search requirements on certain       Medicaid enrollees;        Regressive age-based tax credits, combined with changes       that will allow insurers to charge older people much higher       premiums than allowed under current law;        Continuous coverage requirements for patients with pre-      existing conditions;        Legislative or regulatory restrictions that would deny or       result in discrimination in the awarding of federal grant       funds and/or Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program       funding to women's health clinics that are qualified under       existing federal law for  [[Page H4123]]       the provision of evidence-based services including, but not       limited to, provision of contraception, preventive health       screenings, sexually transmitted infection testing and       treatment, vaccines, counseling, rehabilitation, and       referrals, and;        Elimination of the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which       provides billions in dollars to the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention to prevent and control the spread of       infectious diseases.        The College strongly believes in the first, do no harm       principle. Therefore, we continue to urge that Congress move       away from the fundamentally flawed and harmful policies that       would result from the American Health Care Act and from the       changes under consideration--including the proposed ``Limited       Waiver'' amendment--that would make the bill even worse for       patients. We urge Congress to instead start over and seek       agreement on bipartisan ways to improve and build on the ACA.       The College welcomes the opportunity to share our ideas for       bipartisan solutions that would help make health care better,       more accessible, and more affordable for patients rather than       imposing great harm on them as the AHCA would do.            Sincerely,                                               Jack Ende, MD, MACP,                                                         President.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Cancer Action Network against this bill.                                              Cancer Action Network,                                         American Cancer Society,                                                        May 3, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: The American       Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) is deeply       concerned about the reports of additional amendments to the       American Health Care Act (AHCA), including one that would       allegedly add $8 billion in new spending for state high-risk       pools. This amendment is particularly egregious because it       would further incent states to apply for waivers from       current-law market rules that protect patients with pre-      existing conditions.        Historically, state high-risk pools have fallen short of       providing coverage of prevention, treatment and follow-up       care for cancer patients and survivors. Segmenting people       with cancer and other serious illnesses away from the private       marketplace and into high-risk pools absent an adequate and       permanent source of public funding has never been an adequate       solution.        Between 1976 and 2010, 35 states created high-risk pools to       cover individuals who could not otherwise purchase insurance       in the private market, usually because of a pre-existing       condition. Every one of those risk pools experienced net       operating losses year after year. Furthermore, high-risk       pools did not result in lower premiums. All of them set       premiums above the non-group market average or standard rate       in the state, usually by 150-200 percent. Only a few states       provided additional premium assistance for low-income       individuals, leaving many who could not afford premiums       priced out of the program. Most states also imposed waiting       periods before covering preexisting conditions. An individual       with a prior cancer diagnosis often had to wait 6-12 months       before the high-risk pool would cover the costs associated       with cancer treatment or follow-up survivorship care. Most       states imposed limitations on coverage with either lifetime       or annual limits. And most plans offered deductibles of       $1,000 or higher. Neither AHCA, nor the new amendment would       fully protect patients from any of those conditions.        Cancer patients and survivors need insurance coverage that       is affordable, readily accessible, and protects them from       pre-existing condition exclusions, annual and lifetime caps       on coverage and extraordinary out-of-pocket costs. Past       experience has shown that high-risk pools failed to meet       these basic needs, yet still were a drain on state budgets.        As we have indicated in our earlier letters, there are       reasonable fixes that could be made to the current law. We       stand ready to work with you to develop policies that improve       the law and encourage a robust health insurance market that       provides affordable and comprehensive coverage options.            Sincerely,                                             Christopher W. Hansen,                                                         President.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  American Society of Clinical Oncology against this bill.                                                 American Society of                                               Clinical Oncology,                                                     April 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, On behalf of the American Society of       Clinical Oncology (ASCO), I write to express our strong       opposition to the American Health Care Act (AHCA), as       currently amended. As the leading professional society       representing more than 42,000 physicians worldwide who care       for people with cancer, ASCO has a unique perspective on the       law's potential impact on cancer patients. Our core mission       is to ensure every patient with cancer has meaningful access       to high quality care. We believe Congress shares this goal       and our comments today are in the spirit of advancing that       common purpose.        In January 2017, as Congress embarked upon the repeal and       replacement of the Affordable Care Act, ASCO shared a set of       guiding principles that support improvements to the current       health care system. We also put forth specific areas where       people with cancer need protections. Our principles rest on       the belief that any health system reform must ensure all       people affected by cancer receive high-quality care. ASCO's       first principle states, ``all Americans should have access to       affordable and sufficient healthcare coverage regardless of       their income or health status. To ensure protected access,       the current ban on preexisting condition limitations,       elimination of annual and lifetime coverage caps, and       maintenance of guaranteed renewability should be preserved.''       We take the position that ``any efforts to reform the       healthcare system at the national, state, or local levels       should ensure that individuals with healthcare insurance can       continue to access affordable insurance without       interruption.'' The amended AHCA violates these principles.        Studies show that when cancer patients do not have adequate       insurance they receive less care, receive it later, and have       worse outcomes than those with better insurance coverage.       Uninsured and under-insured families facing a cancer       diagnosis experience significant stress. They often are       unable to meet out-of-pocket expenses and even forgo cancer       care in order to pay for necessities of daily living. The       AHCA as currently constructed will create or worsen these       barriers to care. It will add costs to the system, decrease       access to appropriate treatment and increase existing       disparities in care.        We are especially concerned with provisions allowing state       waivers that could erode important protections for patients       with cancer, including pre-existing condition safeguards,       coverage of essential services, and access to affordable       health insurance. Removing these protections from current       federal law allows for a weakening of these critical       provisions in some states and establishes a system of       inequitable protections across state lines for cancer       patients. We urge policymakers to ensure that robust       requirements are in place to ensure that all insurance       products cover the full scope of services and therapies that       cancer patients require.        ASCO strongly opposes passage of the AHCA in its current       form. We welcome the opportunity to address these issues--and       to work toward a better proposal--with you and your staff.            Sincerely,      Daniel F. Hayes, MD, FASCO, FACP,        President, American Society of Clinical                                                          Oncology.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine against this bill.                                                American Congress of                                         Rehabilitation Medicine,                                                        May 2, 2017.      Re Deep Concerns with the American Health Care Act and           Related Amendments.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The American Congress       of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) writes in reference to the       American Health Care Act (AHCA), H.R. 1628, and the MacArthur       Amendment to the bill. ACRM is an organization of       rehabilitation professionals dedicated to serving people with       disabling conditions by supporting research and services that       promote health, independence, productivity, and quality of       life; and meet the needs of rehabilitation clinicians and       individuals with disabilities.        ACRM is seriously concerned that current House proposals       will undercut the federal coverage standard for       rehabilitation and habilitation services and devices       established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Access to       rehabilitation enables individuals experiencing injuries,       illnesses, and disabilities to maximize their quality of life       by enhancing their health, function, and independence. We       believe that any ACA repeal and replace bill that advances in       the House and Senate must maintain access to rehabilitation       and habilitation services and devices.        In particular, the AHCA (H.R. 1628, as amended) includes a       provision that would allow states to apply for waivers       exempting them from compliance with important patient       protections that are required by the Affordable Care Act       (ACA), including premium rating ratios based on age,       protections for consumers disallowing medical status       underwriting (i.e., community rating), and requirements for       insurers to cover a defined package of essential health       benefits (EHBs), which include rehabilitative and       habilitative services and devices. We are deeply concerned       these EHB changes will curtail access for both children and       adults in Medicaid expansion states, as well as private ACA       health plans. ACRM believes that these provisions will       significantly undermine the health insurance coverage that       patients need.        ACRM urges Congress to work in a bipartisan manner to       improve access to affordable, comprehensive care for all       Americans,  [[Page H4124]]       including those with disabilities and chronic conditions       needing rehabilitation and habilitation services and devices.                                     Douglas Katz, MD, FACRM, FAAN,                                                    ACRM President.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities in strong opposition to this  bill.                                             Consortium for Citizens                                               With Disabilities,                                                     April 28, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: The Consortium for Citizens with       Disabilities (CCD) is strongly opposed to the amended       American Health Care Act. The amended American Health Care       Act retains the original bill's proposals to dramatically cut       Medicaid services that are vital to people with disabilities       and seniors through per capita caps, which CCD has opposed.       The new amendments--including permitting states to seek       waivers from the protections for people with pre-existing       conditions and from the requirement to provide essential       health benefits--makes the amended AHCA even more harmful to       people with disabilities. We urge you to oppose this       legislation.        Medicaid provides services and supports that maintain the       health, function, independence, and well-being of 10 million       enrollees living with disabilities. For many people with       disabilities, being able to access timely needed care is a       life or death matter. The American Health Care Act changes       the way that the Federal Government funds Medicaid--rather       than paying states based on the actual costs of healthcare       for people in Medicaid, it sets a cap on the amount of       federal support, a cap that is totally unrelated to the       actual costs of needed care for enrollees. This cap is       designed to cut Medicaid, and the bill uses those cuts to pay       for unrelated tax cuts. Slashing federal support for       Medicaid, which is already a lean program, will force states       to cut services and eligibility that put the health and       wellbeing of people with disabilities at significant risk.        The newest amendments to the American Health Care Act make       the bill even more harmful to people with disabilities. The       new amendments would allow states to easily obtain waivers       that would allow them to charge higher premiums to people       with pre-existing conditions, including people with       disabilities. They also would allow states to seek waivers       from the Affordable Care Act's requirement to provide       essential health benefits, including crucial services for       people with disabilities such as mental health and substance       use disorder services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative and       habilitative services and devices, preventative and wellness       services and chronic disease management, and pediatric       services. These waivers jeopardize the Affordable Care Act's       protections for people with pre-existing conditions,       including people with disabilities, and CCD opposes any roll-      back of those protections.        The ACA helped millions of people with disabilities and       others to gain access to affordable and comprehensive health       insurance. The amended American Health Care Act is       insufficient to help people with disabilities meet their       healthcare needs, and we urge you to oppose the bill should       it come to a vote.            Sincerely,        Health Task Force Co-chairs: Bethany Lilly, Bazelon Center       for Mental Health Law; Dave Machledt, National Health Law       Program; Peter Thomas, Brain Injury Association of America;       and Julie Ward, The Arc of the United States.        Long Term Services and Supports Co-chairs: Alison Barkoff,       Center for Public Representation; Nicole Jorwic, The Arc of       the United States; Sarah Meek, Lutheran Services in America       Disability Network; and Laura Weidner, National Multiple       Sclerosis Society.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton.)    Mr. Speaker, I think it is interesting today  since we would not be here today if there was not the problems that  you, Mr. Speaker, and I have seen.   One-third of this country has one insurer, premiums with double-digit  increases, people who can afford--maybe even with subsidies the amount  of their plan can't afford the deductibles and co-pays. They go to  doctors who won't take their insurance.   We are not here by mistake, Mr. Speaker. We are here because  ObamaCare is an abject failure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  Children's Leadership Council opposed to this bill.                                  Children's Leadership Council,                                                        May 1, 2017.        Dear Representative: The Children's Leadership Council       opposes the American Health Care Act (AHCA) because it would       jeopardize health care for millions of babies, children,       youth and families. We urge you to vote NO on this       legislation.        The Children's Leadership Council (CLC) is a coalition of       organizations dedicated to improving the lives and       opportunities of America's children. Nationwide, CLC members       work to advance the health, education and well-being of       babies, children and youth in order to prepare them for       school, work, and life. The CLC is the only national       children's coalition solely dedicated to supporting       investments in our nation's children and youth; and       collectively, CLC's members have affiliates, partners, and       members in every state in the nation.        The Affordable Care Act and Medicaid play a crucial role in       the lives of children, including those facing the greatest       challenges such as children in poverty; children suffering       abuse and neglect; children in foster care, and children with       disabilities. Medicaid, for example, provides coverage for       approximately 37 million children, including children with       disabilities, children in foster care and children from low-      income families. Children are the largest group of Medicaid       recipients, and nearly 40 percent of all the nation's       children rely on Medicaid and CHIP for their healthcare.       Medicaid provides health care treatment and preventive       services, mental health care, case management and       transportation services to and from medical appointments for       children who are low-income or disabled. The AHCA's changes       to Medicaid would radically restructure a program that has       worked for more than 50 years to support children's health.       The Medicaid cap would shift $839 billion to stages, forcing       them to cut eligibility, benefits, or provider rates that       could have disastrous health consequences.        There is no question that the massive cuts to Medicaid,       increased premiums likely for millions of families, and       eliminating the Essential Health Benefits requirements under       current law will seriously harm children and families.       Maternity benefits would be among the many medical services       no longer guaranteed if this bill were to become law. The       massive Medicaid reductions in substance abuse treatment will       add to the increases nationwide in the need for child welfare       services because of the surge in opioid addiction. Families       caring for children with disabilities will find supports for       care at home jeopardized.        With a record 95% of children with health coverage in our       country, the AHCA would turn back the clock on progress for       children. And recent proposed changes to the bill would       further undermine consumer protections that make health care       out of reach for low-income children and their families--thus       making the already harmful bill worse for children. Polling       conducted by the Children's Leadership Council found 71       percent of parents, including 67 percent of Independent       parents (of children under the age of 18), want increased       investments in programs that help children in the areas of       education, health and nutrition, not less as proposed by the       AHCA.        Congress has a strong history of working on a bipartisan,       bicameral basis on issues, policies and programs important to       children. It is our hope and expectation that members of       Congress continue this history, as Congress works on       improving our nation's healthcare system. This legislation       would be a dangerous step backward. We strongly urge you to       vote NO.            Sincerely,                                                  Randi Schmidt,                                      Executive Director, Children's                                                Leadership Council.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Paralyzed Veterans of America against this bill.                                  Paralyzed Veterans of America,                                        Washington, DC, May 3, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: Paralyzed Veterans of       America (PVA) urges  [[Page H4125]]       rejection of the latest version of the American Health Care       Act (AHCA). PVA is the nation's only Congressionally-      chartered veterans' service organization solely dedicated to       representing veterans with spinal cord injury and/or disease.       Consequently, we are very concerned about the conflicting       information circulating about this legislation and the       adverse impact it could have on our members and millions of       other people with disabilities.        As we understand it, the AHCA cuts $880 billion out of the       Medicaid program in order to finance tax cuts that will       explode the deficit and largely assist upper income       individuals, corporations, and providers. The Medicaid       changes are particularly devastating to people with       disabilities. Under the cap and cut proposal, the federal       government would no longer share in the costs of providing       health care services and community services beyond the capped       amount. This would eliminate the enhanced federal match for       the Community First Choice Option under Medicaid that       provides attendant care services in the community. Thanks to       this program, many poor veterans with serious non-service-      connected disabilities have been able to move from nursing       homes into their communities. The AHCA also weakens Medicaid       by ending the Medicaid expansion earlier and offering       Medicaid block grants to states. Data from the Robert Wood       Johnson Foundation shows expansion has helped thousands of       veterans and their caregivers.        For veterans and PVA members in particular, the AHCA       continues several problematic policies of the ACA as well as       troubling new provisions that could affect the ability of       many veterans and their family members to afford health       insurance in the private market. The underlying AHCA bill:        Continues to exclude CHAMPVA beneficiaries--dependents of       the most catastrophically disabled veterans--from the       dependents' coverage policy up to age 26.        Fails to remove the prohibition on enrollment into the VA       health care system for Priority Group 8 veterans, thus       denying these veterans access to the principal health care       system for veterans.        Denies access to tax credits making health insurance       affordable to anyone eligible for a host of other federal       health programs, including those ``eligible'' for coverage       under Title 38 health care programs. This would prevent many       veterans who may be ``eligible for'' but not enrolled in the       VA health care system from accessing these tax credits       intended to help people buy insurance.        Not only do the changes made to the original version of the       AHCA continue its failure to protect veterans and people with       disabilities, they make these circumstances worse. The latest       changes would allow states to seek waivers that would allow       insurers to charge higher premiums to people with pre-      existing conditions, including people with disabilities. The       new amendments also would allow states to seek waivers from       the ACA's requirement that certain essential health benefits       must be provided, including crucial services for people with       disabilities such as prescription drugs, rehabilitative and       habilitative services and devices, preventative and wellness       services and chronic disease management. The combination of       these changes would make it nearly impossible for people with       pre-existing conditions to find affordable plans that cover       basic health care services.        Throughout these past few months, the American people have       been calling for a bipartisan effort to improve the nation's       health care system. Congress should heed these voices, stop       its pursuit of the flawed American Health Care Act and work       together through regular order to strengthen all Americans'       access to affordable, high quality health care.            Sincerely,                                                        Carl Blake,                                      Associate Executive Director.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  March of Dimes opposed to this bill.                         [From the march of dimes]   Under AHCA, Over 6 Million Women of Childbearing Age Will Lose Health                                  Coverage         Dear Representative: Prior to 2010, low-income adult women       could generally only obtain Medicaid coverage after they were       pregnant. By the time they enrolled in this coverage, many of       the best opportunities for guaranteeing a healthy pregnancy       and healthy baby had already been missed.        Today, states that have expanded Medicaid can extend       Medicaid coverage to low-income women of childbearing age,       giving them the chance to get healthy before they get       pregnant. The March of Dimes estimates that approximately 6.5       million low income women of childbearing age are currently       covered under Medicaid expansion, giving them access to       treatment for tobacco use, obesity, substance abuse, and       other conditions that can have a major impact on future       pregnancies. Between 2012 and 2015, the rate of uninsurance       among women of childbearing age dropped by 40%, with much of       that decline attributable to Medicaid expansion.        The American Health Care Act (AHCA) would do away with       these advances by rolling back Medicaid expansion. Its       fundamental restructuring of the traditional Medicaid program       would also likely lead to significant coverage losses or       restriction of services to beneficiaries, including pregnant       women. These changes do a serious disservice to low-income       women and families by denying them access to the care they       need to lead healthy lives and, ultimately, have healthy       pregnancies and give birth to healthy infants.        The MacArthur amendment and other proposed changes to the       AHCA do not address these issues. Women, infants, families,       and communities will bear the longterm cost if health care       for women of childbearing age and pregnant women is       shortchanged and more babies are born sick as a result. The       March of Dimes urges all Representatives to oppose the       American Health Care Act.            Sincerely,                                                 Stacey D. Stewart,                                                         President.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  AFSCME in strong opposition to this bill.                                                         AFSCME,                                                        May 3, 2017.      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million working       and retiree members of the American Federation of State,       County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to       express our continuing opposition to the American Health Care       Act (AHCA), notwithstanding the addition of the Upton       amendment.        The harm that AHCA will impose on ordinary Americans is       breathtaking in scope. As the Congressional Budget Office has       detailed, 24 million will lose their health care coverage.       The Medicaid program will be cut by $839 billion and       restructured, ending the guarantee that the federal       government will fund a specified share of state Medicaid       costs. The bill makes coverage more expensive, especially for       lower-income families and older workers and it undermines the       financial strength of Medicare. And the MacArthur amendment       makes a very bad bill worse by allowing states to opt out of       Affordable Care Act protections that ensure that people with       pre-existing conditions will be able to obtain comprehensive,       affordable health care. Moreover, the MacArthur amendment       would allow insurance companies to re-impose caps on annual       and lifetime limits, even in employer-sponsored coverage,       putting the health care of those with catastrophic illnesses       or injuries at risk.        Under the Upton amendment, grants to states that could be       used for high-risk pools will be increased by 6% or $8       billion over five years. This is a paltry increase. Even the       conservative Mercatus Center described the increase as a       ``pittance.'' High-risk pools would still be grossly       underfunded, even if states put all of the $138 billion in       grant funding into them. We urge the Congress not to ignore       the previous experience with state high-risk pools. By       segregating those with pre-existing conditions into separate       coverage we know they will face higher premiums, benefit       exclusions, annual and lifetime limits on coverage and       waiting lists.        It is unacceptable that this bill eliminates $500 billion       in taxes on the wealthiest 2%, health insurers,       pharmaceutical manufacturers and medical device makers, while       taking health care away from millions. Moreover, the bill       retains the 40% tax on high cost health plans, which will       undermine employer-sponsored insurance for working families       by hollowing out coverage and increasing out-of-pocket       expenses, although it delays the implementation for six       years.        The bottom line is that this bill would cause millions to       lose their health coverage. Most of those with pre-existing       conditions would return to the days when even inadequate       coverage was unaffordable. The bill would drive up costs for       those who are older and lower-income, shift costs to states,       fail to protect employer-sponsored coverage, weaken public       health and undermine the solvency of the Medicare trust       fund--all the while providing tax cuts for the wealthy and       well-connected.        The priorities demonstrated by this bill are upside down.       We urge you to oppose this bill.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,                            Director of Federal Government Affairs.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  National Farmers Union in strong opposition to this bill.                                         National Farmers Union,                                                        May 3, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: I write on behalf of nearly       200,000 members of the National Farmers Union (NFU) who are       engaged in all forms of farming and ranching. NFU has already       spoken in opposition of the American Health Care Act (AHCA)       because of the estimated 24 million Americans who would lose       coverage as a result. The most recent amendment to the AHCA       only moves further away from NFU's member-driven policy of       affirming ``the right of all Americans to have access to       affordable, quality health care.''        Farming is a dangerous occupation, ranking 6th in       occupational fatality rates. The injury rate for agricultural       workers is also 40% higher than the rate of all workers.       Finally, the average age of farmers in the United States is       over 58 years. U.S. health care policy must take into account       the unique needs of the men and women who provide food and       fiber for our country and much of the world.        Our current health care system is not without its problems,       but progress has been  [[Page H4126]]       made since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The       current structure of tax credits and premium subsidies help       farmers maintain consistent coverage, especially during       downturns in the farm economy. The expansion of Medicaid has       proven beneficial to rural communities, where the rate of       enrollment is higher than in urban America. The Health       Insurance Marketplace, while certainly in need of stabilizing       measures, makes coverage more accessible for many farm       families.        The correlation between a strong Medicaid program and the       success of rural hospitals has become evident during the       influx of rural hospital closures over the last six years.       Seventy-eight rural hospitals have closed since 2010 with       over 80% of those located in states that opted out of the       Medicaid expansion. With another 673 hospitals at risk of       closure, the AHCA's proposed Medicaid cap could have       devastating consequences for rural communities.        In 2012, 75 percent of farms sold less than $50,000 in       agricultural products and 57% had sales less than $10,000.       Young farm families that don't receive additional income or       health benefits from off-farm jobs would find it extremely       difficult to purchase health insurance. The proposed       legislation would also hurt older farmers. Easing       restrictions on what insurance companies can charge older       customers will leave older farmers facing increased premiums       of thousands of dollars, despite the larger subsidies some       would receive.        The modified AHCA bill also has a significant negative       impact on those with pre-existing conditions. It's estimated       that 40 percent of 50- to 64-year-olds would be denied       coverage in the individual market without the Affordable Care       Act's protections for those with preexisting conditions. The       waiver option would mean that a large number of farmers in       many states would be forced into high-risk pools. This       legislation is woefully short in funding for those high-risk       pools, leaving individuals with preexisting conditions to       contend with increased premiums, higher deductibles and       longer waiting periods for coverage.        Affordable access to quality health coverage is a high       priority for all Americans. As you consider how to best       improve our health care system, we ask that you give serious       consideration to the needs of farmers and ranchers. While       there is certainly room for improvement in current policy,       the American Health Care Act will only hurt family farmers       and rural communities across the country. NFU requests that       you oppose the proposed legislation.        We appreciate your efforts to provide all Americans with       high-quality comprehensive health insurance. Thank you for       your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                     Roger Johnson,                                                         President.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the distinguished ranking  member of the Committee on Ways and Means.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  National Education Association in strong opposition to this bill.                                                        May 3, 2017.      Hon. James P. McGovern,      House of Representatives, House Office Building, Washington,           DC.        Dear Congressman McGovern: On behalf of our three million       members and the 50 million students they serve, we strongly       urge you to oppose H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act as       amended. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that by       2026, the original bill would provide $883 billion in tax       cuts while taking health coverage away from 24 million       people, including some of the most vulnerable among us--the       poor, the sick, the elderly, and the children who constitute       more than half the current Medicaid enrollment. Votes on this       issue may be included in NEA's Report Card for the 15th       Congress.        The April 25 amendment made the original bill even worse.       It allows states to jettison existing essential health       benefit requirements, thereby permitting health plans       covering millions of people once again to exclude coverage       for maternity and newborn care, pediatric dental and vision       services, mental health and substance use services, and other       crucial benefits. The May 3 amendment is the equivalent of a       tiny bandage on a gaping wound. The cost of setting up       separate pools or premium assistance programs for people with       pre-existing conditions far exceeds the $8 billion spread       over five years the amendment provides--nationwide, at least       $25 billion per year would be required, according to the       Kaiser Family Foundation.        Both the original and amended American Health Care Act       threaten to return this country to the days when annual and       lifetime dollar-based limits on the use of essential health       benefits shifted tremendous financial and health risks to       working families. Insurance companies could charge people       with pre-existing conditions many times more than they charge       healthy people--just as they did before the Affordable Care       Act. Millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions would       be at risk of losing health coverage or face premiums so high       only the very wealthy could afford them--the same people who       benefit from the massive tax cuts in the original bill.        Specifically, we are concerned that this legislation will:       Lead to drastic cuts in Medicaid benefits and eligible       beneficiaries. The American Health Care Act radically       restructures how Medicaid is funded. Instead of the federal       government paying a percentage of actual Medicaid spending,       each state will get a set amount. States will choose between       a block grant, a lump sum payment, and a ``per capita cap,''       a flat amount for certain Medicaid beneficiaries. Either way,       state budgets will take a big hit: the share of revenue spent       on Medicaid will rise from 24.5 percent in 2017 to 28 percent       by 2025, according to Moody's Investors Service. To       compensate for the loss of federal support, states are likely       to divert money from education to health care as well as       limit the number of Medicaid beneficiaries, the scope of       Medicaid benefits, or both.        Hit the students most in need the hardest. Under the       Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Medicaid       reimburses schools for mental health care, vision and hearing       screenings, diabetes and asthma management, wheelchairs and       hearing aids, and more. Federal support is substantial--for       example, in 2015 California schools received about $90       million from Medicaid, Florida schools about $63 million, New       York schools about $137 million, Pennsylvania schools about       $131 million, and Texas schools about $250 million (Source:       Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, compilation of 2017 data).       Capping federal support for Medicaid will shift costs to the       states, jeopardizing services essential for students to learn       and thrive, especially those with disabilities.        Increase the cost of health care for those least able to       afford it. The American Health Care Act provides largely age-      based tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year--far       less than today's subsidies. For example, according to Kaiser       Family Foundation calculations, a 60-year-old earning $20,000       a year in Lincoln, Nebraska, now gets $18,470 to help buy       insurance and additional subsidies to help with deductibles       and co-payments. Under the American Health Care Act, she       would get a $4,000 tax credit for the premium and nothing for       other out-of-pocket health  [[Page H4127]]       care costs. By 2026, the average subsidy under the American       Health Care Act would be half the average subsidy under the       Affordable Care Act, according to CBO.        Tax ``high cost'' employer-sponsored health coverage. We       recognize that the American Health Care Act postpones the       effective date of the 40 percent excise tax on such plans       until 2026. But this tax--a back-door pay cut for millions of       working families--needs to be fully repealed.        Enhance tax breaks for the rich. The American Health Care       Act nearly doubles the amount of money that can be socked       away in tax-free health savings accounts--at least $6,550 for       individuals and at least $13,100 for families in 2018. It       also repeals a 3.8 percent investment tax and 0.9 percent       surcharge on wages above $250,000--a savings of about       $195,000 per year for the top 0.1 percent of earners,       according to the independent Tax Policy Center.        Weaken the individual insurance market and employment-based       coverage. The American Health Care Act eliminates penalties       for individuals not buying--and large employers not       providing--health coverage. But premiums go up 30 percent if       coverage lapses for more than 63 days--for example, when       someone loses her job and cannot afford to buy health       insurance until she gets another one. Overall, CBO predicts       substantial increases in out-of-pocket costs for low- and       moderate-income people due to the decline in subsidies and       increase in deductibles and other cost-sharing. Some       employers may gut their health plans or stop offering       coverage altogether, since they will no longer be penalized       for doing so.        The American Health Care Act plays Robin Hood in reverse.       It reneges on the promise to deliver better, cheaper health       coverage for all Americans, giving the richest among us       massive tax cuts while causing the number of people without       insurance to rise from 28 million today to an estimated 52       million in 2026, according to CBO.        We strongly urge you to oppose the amended American Health       Care Act--deeply flawed legislation that is even worse than       the original bill.            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,                                    National Education Association.

Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       physicians, certified nurse-midwives/certified midwives, and       nurse practitioners who provide care for the women of       America, along with our patient partners, we stand together       for women and families and against House passage of the       MacArthur (R-NJ) Amendment to the American Health Care Act       (AHCA, H.R. 1628). Rather than support recent gains in       women's access to healthcare and coverage, the MacArthur       Amendment and AHCA turn back the clock and reverse hard-won       progress. We stand ready to continue work with Congress to       advance legislation that promotes women's health, healthcare       and coverage.        In our letter of March 22, 2017, we expressed opposition to       the AHCA because it threatened women's access to care       protected by Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) requirements,       eliminated the Medicaid expansion, cut qualified providers at       Planned Parenthood from the Medicaid program, and made severe       reductions to Medicaid and other programs critical to women       and newborns. We said that important health initiatives for       women and newborns should be built upon and improved--not       rolled back.        However, the MacArthur Amendment to AHCA places women's       health and coverage at even greater risk. The MacArthur       Amendment would enable states to waive EHBs including those       for maternity and newborn care, preventive services, and       services for mental health and substance use disorders; to       waive community rating rules; and to shunt patients with       costly healthcare conditions or illnesses into unproven       government high risk pools. Supporters of the bill claim this       bill maintains protections for those with preexisting       conditions, but allowing states to waive coverage of EHB and       charge people more based on their health status renders the       promise of coverage for preexisting conditions to be       meaningless. If all that the Secretary may require of a state       waiver application is an un-validated attestation that the       purpose of their requested waiver is to reduce premium costs,       increase the number of persons with healthcare coverage, or       advance another benefit to the public interest in the state,       including the guarantee of coverage for persons with pre-      existing medical conditions, it is meaningless in protecting       health, quality healthcare and coverage. Women and families       must not be made to suffer, lose access to care and coverage,       and pay higher healthcare costs.        EHB is a critical protection that ensures women have       guaranteed access to a robust set of health care services.       Making certain categories of coverage optional--such as       maternity care--would not substantially lower the premiums       that people pay for health coverage. For example, the       requirement for maternity care as an EHB is not a source of       health cost growth. Rather, by sharing risk across a broad       population of beneficiaries it provides vital protection for       women and families from the risk of tens of thousands of       dollars of out-of-pocket costs associated with normal       physiologic labor and delivery, cesarean section, and birth       complications. In exchange for monthly premium costs of just       $8-14 according to one recent analysis, the maternity care       EHB provides significant security for people wishing to grow       their families in the U.S. Furthermore, since everyone is at       some point a newborn, childbirth affects all of us. Enabling       exclusion of maternity care from health coverage denies       people access to the care that everyone deserves for the best       start in life.        Congress should move to protect and advance health, quality       care and coverage, particularly for women and newborns, and       not to endanger them as the AHCA and the MacArthur Amendment       would do. Americans of both parties agree. A recent Kaiser       Family Foundation poll found ``relatively few Americans want       to see the president and Congress decrease funding for a       variety of different health priorities--including spending       for reproductive health services for lower-income women (21       percent).''        When women have access to quality, evidence-based,       affordable care throughout their lives, they enrich our       workforce, achieve higher levels of education, reach their       goals, and actively contribute to the success of their       families and their communities. We urge the U.S. House in the       strongest possible terms to get it right, not fast. The AHCA       and the MacArthur Amendment turn the clock back on women's       health and should not move forward.        We stand ready to continue assisting Congress in advancing       health policy that supports women's access to high quality       healthcare and coverage, and is effective at controlling and       reducing the costs that people pay for their healthcare.            Sincerely,        American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Nurse-      Midwives, American College of Physicians, American Congress       of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, National Association of       Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health, National Partnership       for Women & Families, Planned Parenthood Federation of       America.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want you to look and keep your eyes  on who will feel the TrumpCare's mother of all bombs of health care  dropped on the American people. God have mercy on your soul.   I am a person living with a preexisting disease. I am a breast cancer  survivor. This heartless and callous bill, with 24 million-plus people  being thrown off of health care and the reverse Robin Hood of stealing  from the poor and the seniors laying in their beds, and you are doing  an age tax that is five times more than any other young person has to  pay, is disgraceful, as well as the pittance that you have given for  preexisting conditions, which is $8 billion. They say you need $25  billion.   Then you are telling the States to get a waiver. They are going to  celebrate. And then you are saying to Trump, the king, that we have the  votes to drop that mother of all bombs of health care.   Let me just simply say: I want to stand with the people. I want her  to live in dignity and to be able to get well. I want to make sure that  Medicaid is provided for working families. I don't want the poor to  sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, to steal bread from the  market because they can't get any health insurance.   God have mercy on your soul.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee and the  representative of a congressional district that has benefitted  enormously from the Affordable Care Act, I rise in strong and  unyielding opposition to H.R. 1628, the so-called ``American Health  Care Act,'' which more accurately should be called ``Trumpcare, the Pay  More for Less Act.''   I oppose this third and latest reincarnation of Trumpcare for several  compelling reasons:   1. Trumpcare forces families to pay higher premiums and deductibles,  increasing out-of-pocket costs.   2. Trumpcare will take away health care from 24 million hardworking  Americans.   3. Trumpcare would gut Essential Health Benefits and protections for  Americans with pre-existing conditions.   4. Trumpcare forces Americans aged 50-64 to pay premiums five times  higher than what others pay for health coverage, no matter how healthy  they are.  [[Page H4128]]    5. Trumpcare shortens the life of the Medicare Trust Fund and  ransacks funds that seniors depend on to get the long-term care they  need.   Mr. Speaker, 85 months ago, on March 23, 2010, redeemed a promise  that had been unfulfilled for nearly a 100 years, when he signed into  law the landmark Affordable Care Act passed by the Democratic  controlled 111th Congress.   Seven years later, the verdict is in on the Affordable Care Act: the  American people have judged it a success.   As reflected in the most recent public opinion polls, 61% of  Americans approve of ObamaCare and oppose efforts to repeal it, the  highest approval rates on record to date and continuing an inexorable  upward trend over the past several years.   Mr. Speaker, the reason Americans are adamantly opposed to Republican  repeal efforts, including the third iteration of Trumpcare now before  us is that Obamacare is no longer a bogey cooked up in Republican  talking points but a life-saving and life affirming measure that they  experienced in their own lives.   Americans think it is beyond crazy to repeal a law that has brought  to more than 20 million Americans the peace of mind and security that  comes with knowing they have access to affordable, high quality health  care.   Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 17.1% of Americans  lacked health insurance; today nearly nine of ten (89.1%) are insured,  which is the highest rate since Gallup began tracking insurance  coverage in 2008.   Because of the Affordable Healthcare Act:   1. insurance companies are banned from discriminating against anyone,  including 17 million children, with a preexisting condition, or  charging higher rates based on gender or health status;   2. 6.6 million young-adults up to age 26 can stay on their parents'  health insurance plans;   3. 100 million Americans no longer have annual or life-time limits on  healthcare coverage;   4. 6.3 million seniors in the ``donut hole'' have saved $6.1 billion  on their prescription drugs;   5. 3.2 million seniors now get free annual wellness visits under  Medicare, and   6. 360,000 Small Businesses are using the Health Care Tax Credit to  help them provide health insurance to their workers;   7. Pregnancy is no longer a pre-existing condition and women can no  longer be charged a higher rate just because they are women.   We are becoming a nation of equals when it comes to access to  affordable healthcare insurance.   With all of this progress, and the prospect for more through further  refinements, who in their right mind would want to go back to how it  used to be?   The answer seems to be only the President and House Republicans who  call the Affordable Care Act and its enviable record of success a  ``disaster.''   Americans know a disaster when they see one and they see one in the  making: it is called ``Trumpcare,'' masquerading as the ``American  Health Care Act,'' which will force Americans to pay more, get less,  decimate the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and give a massive tax cut  for top 1 percent.   Americans are right to be alarmed and angered by what the Trump  Republicans are trying to do by rushing to vote on a Trumpcare bill  before it can be scored by highly respected and nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office.   What we do know for sure is that this Trumpcare bill is a massive  $900 billion tax cut for the wealthy, paid for on the backs of  America's seniors, the vulnerable, the poor, and working class  households.   Trump gave the game away on March 20, 2017 in one of his trademark  pep rallies:   ``We want a very big tax cut, but cannot do that until we keep our  promise to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.''   This ``Robin Hood in reverse'' bill is unprecedented and breathtaking  in its audacity--no bill ever tried to give so much to the rich while  taking so much from the poor and working class.   When they were forced to pull Trumpcare 1.0 from the floor because  they lacked the votes to pass, House Republican leaders responded by  adding an amendment (Trumpcare 2.0) that made the original bill even  worse.   Trumpcare 2.0 would allow states to jettison existing essential  health benefit requirements, thereby permitting health plans covering  millions of people once again to exclude coverage for maternity and  newborn care, pediatric dental and vision services, mental health and  substance use services, and other crucial benefits.   All this accomplished was a hemorrhaging of support from the moderate  wing of the Republican Conference who feared the repercussions of  leaving millions of Americans with preexisting conditions without  health insurance so the Trump Republicans invented Trumpcare 3.0 to  provide $8 billion over five years to offset the cost of setting up  separate pools or premium assistance programs for people with pre- existing conditions.   This pittance is not designed or intended to help real people with  preexisting conditions, but to provide cover for House Republicans to  walk the plank.   According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, at least $25 billion per  year would be required, not $8 billion spread out over five years as  provided for in Trumpcare 3.0.   Trumpcare represents the largest transfer of wealth from the bottom  99% to the top 1% in American history.   This callous Republican scheme gives gigantic tax cuts to the rich,  and pays for it by taking insurance away from 24 million people,  leaving 52 million uninsured, and raising costs for the poor and middle  class.   In addition, Republicans are giving the pharmaceutical industry a big  tax repeal, worth nearly $25 billion over a decade without demanding in  return any reduction in the cost of prescription and brand-name drugs.   To paraphrase Winston Churchill, of this bill, it can truly be said  that ``never has so much been taken from so many to benefit so few.''   The Pay-More-For-Less plan destroys the Medicaid program under the  cover of repealing the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion.   CBO estimates 14 million Americans will lose Medicaid coverage by  2026 under the Republican plan.   In addition to terminating the ACA Medicaid expansion, the bill  converts Medicaid to a per-capita cap that is not guaranteed to keep  pace with health costs starting in 2020.   The combined effect of these policies is to slash $880 billion in  federal Medicaid funding over the next decade.   The cuts get deeper with each passing year, reaching 25% of Medicaid  spending in 2026.   These steep cuts will force states to drop people from Medicaid  entirely or ration care for those who most need access to comprehensive  coverage.   The Pay-More-For-Less plan undermines the health care safety net for  vulnerable populations.   Currently, Medicaid provides coverage to more than 70 million  Americans, including children, pregnant women, seniors in Medicare,  people who are too disabled to work, and parents struggling to get by  on poverty-level wages.   In addition to doctor and hospital visits, Medicaid covers long-term  services like nursing homes and home and community-based services that  allow people with chronic health conditions and disabilities to live  independently.   To date, 31 states and D.C. have expanded Medicaid eligibility to  low-income adults, which, when combined with the ACA's other coverage  provisions, has helped to reduce the nation's uninsured rate to the  lowest in history.   Trumpcare throws 24 million Americans off their health insurance by  2026 according to the Congressional Budget Office.   Low-income people will be hit especially hard because 14 million  people will lose access to Medicaid by 2026 according to CBO.   Trumpcare massively shifts who gets insured in the nongroup market.   According to CBO, ``fewer lower-income people would obtain coverage  through the nongroup market under the legislation than current law,''  and, ``a larger share of enrollees in the nongroup market would be  younger people and a smaller share would be older people.''   The projected 10% reduction in premiums is not the result of better  care or efficiency--it is in large part the result of higher-cost and  older people being pushed out of a market that is also selling plans  that provide less financial protection.   People with low incomes suffer the greatest losses in coverage.   CBO projects the uninsured rate for people in their 30s and 40s with  incomes below 200% of poverty will reach 38% in 2026 under this bill,  nearly twice the rate projected under current law.   Among people aged 50-64, CBO projects 30% of those with incomes below  200% of poverty will be uninsured in 2026.   Under current law, CBO projects the uninsured rate would only be 12  percent.   Being uninsured is not about ``freedom.''   Speaker Ryan has argued that people will happily forgo insurance  coverage because this bill gives them that ``freedom.''   The argument makes as much sense as the foolish claim that slaves  came to America as ``immigrants'' seeking a better life.   The freedom to be uninsured is no freedom at all to people in their  50s and 60s with modest incomes who simply cannot afford to pay  thousands of dollars toward premiums.   They do not really have a choice.   The claim of our Republican friends that Trumpcare provides more  freedom to all Americans calls to mind the words of Anatole France:   ``The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the  poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread  from the market.''  [[Page H4129]]    Trumpcare raises costs for Americans nearing retirement, essentially  imposing an ``Age Tax.''   The bill allows insurance companies to charge older enrollees higher  premiums than allowed under current law, while reducing the size of  premium tax credits provided.   Again, these changes hit low-income older persons the hardest.   A 64-year-old with an income of $26,500 buying coverage in the  individual market will pay $12,900 more toward their premiums in 2026,  on average.   Trumpcare raises costs for individuals and families with modest  incomes, particularly older Americans.   A recent analysis found that in 2020, individuals with incomes of  about $31,000 would pay on average $4,000 more out of pocket for health  care--which is like getting a 13% pay cut.   And the older you are, the worse it gets.   An analysis by the Urban Institute estimates that for Americans in  their 50s and 60s, the tax credits alone would only be sufficient to  buy plans with major holes in them, such as $30,000 deductible for  family coverage and no coverage at all of brand-name drugs or many  therapy services.   Another reason I oppose the Trumpcare bill before us is because its  draconian cuts in Medicaid funding and phase-out of Medicaid expansion  put community health centers at risk.   Community health centers are consumer-driven and patient-centered  organizations that serve as a comprehensive and cost effective primary  health care option for America's most underserved communities.   Community health centers serve as the health care home for more than  25 million patients in nearly 10,000 communities across the country.   Across the country, 550 new clinics have opened to receive 5 million  new patients since 2009.   Community health centers serve everyone regardless of ability to pay  or insurance status:   1. 71% of health center patients have incomes at or below 100% of  poverty and 92% have incomes less than 200% of poverty;   2. 49% of health center patients are on Medicaid; and   3. 24% are uninsured;   4. Community health centers annually serve on average 1.2 million  homeless patients and more than 300,000 veterans.   Community health centers reduce health care costs and produce  savings--on average, health centers save 24% per Medicaid patient when  compared to other providers.   Community health centers integrate critical medical and social  services such as oral health, mental health, substance abuse, case  management, and translation, under one roof.   Community health centers employ nearly 100,000, people and generate  over $45 billion in total economic activity in some of the nation's  most distressed communities.   Mr. Speaker, community health centers are on the front lines of every  major health crisis our country faces; from providing access to care  (and employment) to veterans to addressing the opioid epidemic to  responding to public health threats like the Zika virus.   We should be providing more support and funding to community health  centers; not making it more difficult for them to serve the communities  that desperately need them by slashing Medicaid funding.   Trumpcare Republican plan leaves rural Americans worse off.   Mr. Speaker, health insurance has historically been more expensive in  rural areas because services cost more and it is hard to have a stable  individual market with a small population.   Under the Affordable Care Act, premium subsidies are tied to local  costs, which helps keeps premium costs down.   But they are not under the Republican plan.   So, under the Republican plan residents in rural areas, who tend to  be older and poorer, will pay much more and get much less health  insurance.   What the Affordable Care Act, and its repeal means in the lives of  real people:   At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, the powerful and compelling  reasons to reject Trumpcare lie in the real world experiences of the  American people.   Let me briefly share with you the positive, life affirming difference  made by the Affordable Care Act in the lives of just three of the  millions of Americans it has helped.   Joan Fanwick: ``If Obamacare is repealed, I don't know if I'll live  to see the next President''   ``After nearly a decade of mysterious health scares, I was diagnosed  with an autoimmune disorder called Sjogren's syndrome last year, when I  was a junior at Temple University.   ``It's a chronic illness with no known cause or cure, and without  close medical surveillance and care, it can lead to life-threatening  complications (like the blood infection I frequently experience).   ``For me, having this disorder means waking up every morning and  taking 10 different medications.   ``It also means a nurse visiting my apartment every Saturday to  insert a needle into the port in my chest, so I can give myself IV  fluids throughout the week.   ``Without insurance, my medical expenses would cost me about $1,000  per week--more than $50,000 per year. And that doesn't even include  hospitalizations.   ``My medical bills aren't cheap under Obamacare, but I can afford  them.   ``Under Obamacare, insurance companies aren't allowed to cut you off  when your costs climb so right now, the most I personally have to pay  out of pocket is $1,000 per year.''   Brain Norgaard: ``I am a small business owner and leadership trainer  who Obamacare has helped tremendously.''   Brian Norgaard, a Dallas, Texas resident called my office to express  his opposition to Trumpcare and to offer share how the Affordable Care  Act has helped small business owners like himself:   ``I am a small business owner and leadership trainer who Obamacare  has helped tremendously.   ``My wife and I both own small businesses in the Dallas, Texas area  and as a result of the huge savings we received after paying lower  [healthcare] premiums under Obamacare, we were able to reinvest those  saving into both of our businesses and the community.   ``And the healthcare we received was quality, at that.''   Ashley Walton: ``For cancer survivors, we literally live and die by  insurance''   Ashley Walton was 25 when a mole on her back turned out to be  melanoma.   She had it removed, but three years later she discovered a lump in  her abdomen.   She was then unemployed and uninsured, and so she put off going to a  doctor.   She tried to buy health insurance. Every company rejected her.   Ashley eventually became eligible for California's Medicaid program,  which had been expanded under the Affordable Care Act.   The 32-year-old Oakland resident credits her survival to the ACA.   Without it, ``I would likely be dead, and my family would likely be  bankrupt from trying to save me.''   Before any of our Republican colleagues supporting this bill cast  their vote, I urge them to reflect on the testimony of Joan, Brian, and  Ashley, and on this question posed by a constituent to Sen. Cotton of  Arkansas at a recent town hall:   ``I've got a husband dying and we can't afford--let me tell you  something.   ``If you can get us better coverage than this [Obamacare], go for it.   ``Let me tell you what we have, plus a lot of benefits that we need.   ``We have $29 per month for my husband. Can you beat that? Can you?   With all the congestive heart failures, and open heart surgeries,  we're trying. $29 per month. And he's a hard worker.   $39 for me.''   Like a horror film of yore with monsters and vampires, both the  original Trumpcare and its sequels threaten to return this country to  the days when annual and lifetime dollar-based limits on the use of  essential health benefits shifted tremendous financial and health risks  to working families.   Insurance companies could charge people with pre-existing conditions  many times more than they charge healthy people--just as they did  before the Affordable Care Act.   Millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions would be at risk  of losing health coverage or face premiums so high only the very  wealthy could afford them--the same people who benefit from the massive  tax cuts in the original bill.   I urge all Members to reject Trumpcare, one of the most monstrously  cruel and morally bankrupt legislative proposals ever to be considered  in this chamber.   To paraphrase a famous former reality television personality,  ``believe me, Trumpcare is a disaster.''   We should reject it and keep instead ``something terrific'': and that  is the Affordable Care Act, regarded lovingly by millions of Americans  as ``Obamacare.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if I had to defend ObamaCare, I would go into hysterics,  too.         Since ObamaCare went into effect, the insurance choices and       coverage have gotten lower and the costs have gotten higher.       Virtually no doctors take the marketplace insurance so I'm       left to change doctors who I've seen for over 30 years and       switch to ``new'' doctors who I don't trust, and who cannot       provide the same healthcare benefits I've received in the       past. I have a brain tumor that I have monitored by a very       skilled neuro-oncologist. Not anymore. The three choices I       was given via healthcare.gov aren't even honored forms of       insurance for this doctor.   [[Page H4130]]     Yes, it left them out again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Indiana  (Mr. Messer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, even with, again, the muddled hysterics, there is  nothing in this bill, even if you have preexisting coverage now, there  is nothing that says you lose it. Let's at least get the facts  straight.   Also, let's talk about families and why we are here.         Despite Obama's promises, my plan was canceled at an       affordable $450 a month when ObamaCare was implemented. My       new plan has gone up every year and for 2017 will be over       $1,300 a month. My husband and I cannot keep up with these       increases. Soon it will be a choice between food and housing       or health care.    Virginia from Florida.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have been waiting also for my friends across the aisle  to stand up and say that ObamaCare is a failure. I guess they can't.  For the last 7 years, the voters have.   Small business owners and American entrepreneurs:         As an entrepreneur with two special needs children, the ACA       is an expensive nightmare. Both my husband and I are small-      business owners and must pay for individual insurance. We are       on the highest deductible plan offered to us, a monthly       premium over $1,000, and outstanding medical bills that we       are struggling to pay off. We have seen our premium go up at       least 14 percent and the expenses of care, lab, et cetera.       With all exceptions, to the President, he is offering to his       corporate friends. We are the ones who get ignored.    That is the true face of ObamaCare.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Barton).   (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I believe probably the reason  they won't vote for it is they don't understand it, because preexisting  conditions  [[Page H4134]]  are covered. If you have coverage now, nothing in our bill, no matter  what would come from the State or anyone else, would lose the  preexisting conditions. I guess it is just easier to talk your talking  points and have your poster and go from there.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Mast).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  American Public Health Association in strong opposition to the  Republican bill.                                American Public Health Association,                                                       May 4, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Public       Health Association, a diverse community of public health       professionals who champion the health of all people and       communities, I write to express our continued strong       opposition to H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of       2017, legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The       amended bill would be even worse for the nation's health than       the original proposal and does nothing to improve the health       of the American public. Additionally, the bill would have the       greatest negative impact on the health of the most vulnerable       Americans.        According to the March Congressional Budget Office       analysis, the legislation would result in 14 million       Americans losing health insurance coverage in 2018. By 2026,       CBO estimates 24 million individuals would lose coverage,       taking the uninsured rate up to a staggering 52 million,       nearly double the number of Americans who would lack       insurance under existing law. The bill would cut critical       premium subsidies for low- and middle-income families and       phase out the ACA's Medicaid expansion. Under the proposal,       many, especially low-income and older Americans, would pay       higher premiums, receive lower subsidies and be subject to       higher out of pocket costs, including higher deductibles and       co-pays for plans that provide less coverage. Health       insurance coverage is critical to preventing disease,       ensuring health and well-being and driving down the use of       costlier providers of care. Unfortunately, this proposal will       result in a greater number of people losing coverage than the       number of people who have gained coverage under the       Affordable Care Act, putting many at risk of premature death       due to the lack of access to critical health services.        The amended bill would be even worse for public health than       the original bill that was pulled from the House floor in       late March. The amended bill would allow states to opt-out of       requiring health plans to cover the 10 essential health       benefits such as maternity care, mental health and substance       abuse disorder services and prescription drug coverage. It       would also allow insurers to charge significantly higher       premiums for people with pre-existing conditions and possibly       allow insurers to charge older adults even higher premiums.       The inclusion of a mere $8 billion over five years will do       little to help people with pre-existing conditions who could       see drastically higher premiums leaving millions in the       individual and small group market with no protections from       insurer discrimination.        The bill would also eliminate the Prevention and Public       Health Fund, the first and only mandatory funding stream       specifically dedicated to public health and prevention       activities. The fund has already provided more than $6       billion to support a variety of public health activities in       every state including tracking and preventing infectious       diseases like the Ebola and Zika viruses, community and       clinical prevention programs, preventing childhood lead       poisoning and expanding access to childhood immunizations.       Eliminating the fund would devastate the budget of the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The fund       currently makes up 12 percent of CDC's budget and eliminating       this funding stream would force Congress to replace the       funding through the regular appropriations process where       resources for nondefense discretionary programs are already       too low.        Not only would the bill phase out the Medicaid expansion       under the ACA, it would also make other troubling changes to       the Medicaid program, converting it to a per capita program.       The most recent CBO analysis estimated the bill would cut       federal spending on Medicaid by $839 billion over the next       decade, drastically cutting resources to states, many of       which are already struggling with tight budgets. The bill       would also block Medicaid reimbursements to Planned       Parenthood for one year--which CBO estimates will lead to       less access to care, more unintended births and more costs       for the Medicaid program.        While the Affordable Care Act is not perfect, the law has       made progress in addressing the biggest challenges facing our       health system including the rising costs associated with our       health care system, uneven quality of care, deaths due to       medical errors, discriminatory practices by health insurance       providers and the shrinking ranks of the nation's primary       care providers. The ACA has made progress in shifting our       health system from one that focuses on treating the sick to       one that focuses on keeping people healthy. We ask you to       oppose this and future efforts to repeal or weaken the ACA.       Instead, we urge you to work on a bipartisan basis to improve       and build upon the successes of the ACA and to work to       provide health insurance coverage to the more than 28 million       who still lack coverage. We look forward to working with you       to create the healthiest nation in one generation.            Sincerely,                                           Georges C. Benjamin, MD,                                                Executive Director.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, the Republican healthcare bill is reckless  and heartless:   It increases the cost of premiums and deductibles;   It imposes an age tax on older Americans;   It unravels protections for patients with preexisting conditions;  [[Page H4135]]    It eliminates maternity care, substance abuse treatment, and  prescription drug coverage;   It does away with lifetime limits and annual caps.   President Trump's claim that people with preexisting conditions will  be covered is false, and it is a betrayal. It will have threatening  consequences for millions of Americans. It will cost lives.   If this passes today, the American people should be in the street to  call out the immorality of this legislation. They should decry this  offense against humanity and this offense against the American people.  I call on the American people: Do not let them get away with it.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago, our friends across  the aisle put partisan interests above the health of the American  people, and we are seeing the results of that today. In fact, a small- business owner from Missouri says:         I recall the days before the ACA when we would receive a 2-      inch notebook that contained multiple quotes from different       health insurance companies. Now our options are listed on a       single legal-sized sheet of paper. We only received three       quotes for 2017, and just two of them were adequate for our       region. In 2013, our insurance cost $180,000 for 92 lives       with a $2,000 deductible. In 2016, we paid $252,000 for just       61 lives who face a $5,000 deductible. Our options are       dwindling, our costs are skyrocketing, and our employees are       ultimately suffering because of the ACA.    Again, a defense of the defenseless or a positive solution for  America; that is what we are offering.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate it, but it is  amazing the concern for rural health care now under ObamaCare when much  of rural America has been down to one provider. That is not a choice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Speaker, I am still waiting on a couple  more speakers, but I am ready to close whenever the gentleman is.   Mr. McGOVERN. Well, I am not really prepared to close because my side  has a ton more to say, but I am out of time.    Mr. Speaker, I will tell Mr. McGovern, it is  his time to manage.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and  given the fact there were no hearings or anything else, it would have  been nice to have a little bit more time.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule that would change the rules of the House to  prevent this bill or any other healthcare-related legislation from  being considered if it does not have a CBO cost estimate or if it would  deny health coverage or require higher premiums due to preexisting  conditions; impose lifetime limits on health coverage; prevent  individuals under age 26 from being covered under their parents' plan;  reduce the number of people receiving health care under the Affordable  Care Act; increase costs to seniors by reopening the doughnut hole and  raising prescription drug costs; require people to pay for preventive  services, including cancer screenings; reduce Medicare solvency or  change the Medicare guarantee; or reduce Federal taxes on the 1 percent  of the population with the highest incomes or increase taxes on the 80  percent of hardworking Americans earning moderate to low incomes.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous materials, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was no objection.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, none of us on this side are claiming that  the Affordable Care Act is perfect. In fact, for 7 years, we have been  prepared to work with our Republican colleagues in a bipartisan way to  make it even better, to cover more people, to find ways to lower costs;  but for 7 years, my Republican colleagues had no interest in doing  that. All they wanted to do was repeal the bill, repeal the bill,  repeal the bill and offer no alternative.   Now we see their alternative, and it is an awful alternative. It is a  disaster. It is an alternative that came not out  [[Page H4136]]  of a deliberative process, but out of some back room somewhere. People  haven't even read this bill. They don't even know what it does because  we are not even waiting for a CBO score. This is a pathetic process  that everybody should be ashamed of.   Let me just say, to claim or to imply that the Republican plan covers  people with preexisting conditions, it is a lie. It is a lie. Let's be  honest about it. This does not cover people with preexisting  conditions. To come on the floor and say it does, to try to fool  people, well, you may get away with it in the short term, you may get a  headline, but I will tell you, people will figure out soon enough when  they are denied healthcare coverage, when they see their costs rise and  rise and rise.   To have a healthcare bill that throws 24 million Americans off of  health insurance, you should be ashamed.   To have a healthcare bill that cuts Medicaid by $880 billion to give  a tax cut to the wealthiest people in this country, you should be  ashamed.   I spent a good deal of my time reading letters from organizations  like the National Farmers Union, the AARP, the Cystic Fibrosis  Foundation, Paralyzed Veterans of America, March of Dimes, the American  Medical Association, on and on and on, organizations that have  dedicated their lives to helping people in this country that know  something about this subject.                                time  1030    And when it comes down to who do I trust, them or you, on whether or  not your bill covers people with preexisting conditions, there is no  contest. I trust them. They see what you are trying to do. They  understand that this bill is a fraud.   It is unconscionable to not only me and to people on our side, but to  people who are watching this debate--Democrats, Republicans, and  independents alike--that we would be spending time debating a  healthcare bill that will make life worse for people in this country.  Any kind of healthcare bill that came to this floor ought to be about  expanding coverage and lowering cost. We want to work with you on that.  Instead, you come to a bill that is going to rip health care away from  tens of millions of people.   How can you do this? How can you do this to the American people? How  can you do this to your constituents?   This is a terrible bill. You should vote ``no'' on it or, better yet,  pull it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   What we have seen for the last few minutes, I would probably get up  and cheer, too. Because now you look at it this way. What they want to  claim as a disaster or recognize as a disaster, they didn't recognize 7  years ago. They chose to cram it down America's throat, and for 7 years  the American people have said: No. Stop it. We don't want a healthcare  system from government that takes freedom away from us and that removes  it from us.   We have been presented with a list of letters from folks who are  against this bill. Well, it is just a quick reminder to those, Mr.  Speaker, who may be wanting to remember. Some of these same folks were  the same folks who said ObamaCare was great, and who gave letters of  support. I guess they are trying to cover up for 7 years of their first  mistake.   When we understand this--let's go to some experts. I will just  clarify them as experts, Mr. Speaker.   President Bill Clinton calling ObamaCare, last year, the craziest  thing in the world. He summed it up pretty well. Because what summed up  here is they forgot the American people.   Republicans have decided that we are going to put the American people  back in control. We are not going to continue to hear from Pam in  Nebraska, who is self-employed and lost her insurance four times under  ObamaCare and twice because of the Nebraska failed startup.   If we are going to talk about misleading the American people, it  started 7 years ago, and it ends today. It ends today. The American  people deserve better. They have been thrown under the bus for 7 years.  They deserve an insurance market that is open, that is accessible, and  that does cover preexisting conditions.   If you want the deception, follow the other side. If you want the  truth, follow this side.   Mr. Speaker, if I had to defend the last 7 years and offer nothing  into the faces of these, yeah, I would have been hysterical on the  floor this morning, too. And that is exactly what we have seen.   So for those who may be, it is time to vote ``yes'' on the rule,  ``yes'' on this bill, and start giving back to America the liberty and  freedom for a healthcare system that is the best in the world and has  been attacked for 7 years. Again, that ends today.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment To H. Res. 308 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:        Sec. 3. Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of       Representatives is amended by adding at the end the following       new clause:       RESTRICTIONS ON CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS                           RELATING TO HEALTHCARE         13.(a) It shall not be in order to consider a bill, joint       resolution, amendment, or conference report which includes       any provision described in paragraph (b).''        (b) A provision referred to in paragraph (a) is a provision       which, if enacted into law, would result in any of the       following:        (1) The denial of health insurance coverage to individuals       on the basis that such individuals have a pre-existing       condition or a requirement for individuals with a preexisting       condition to pay more for premiums on the basis of such       individuals having such a preexisting condition.        (2) The elimination of the prohibition on life time limits       on the dollar value of health insurance coverage benefits.        (3) The termination of the ability of individuals under 26       years of age to be included on their parent's employer or       individual health coverage.        (4) The reduction in the number of people receiving health       plan coverage pursuant to the Patient Protection and       Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and Education Affordability       Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111-152).        (5) An increased cost to seniors for prescription drug       coverage pursuant to any changes to provisions closing the       Medicare prescription drug `donuthole'.        (6) The requirement that individuals pay for preventive       services, such as for mammography, health screening, and       contraceptive services.        (7) The reduction of Medicare solvency or any changes to       the Medicare guarantee.        (8) The reduction of Federal taxes on the 1 percent of the       population with the highest income or increase the tax burden       (expressed as a percent of aggregate Federal taxes) on the 80       percent of the population with the lowest income.        c) It shall not be in order to consider a measure or matter       proposing to repeal or amend the Patient Protection and       Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and the HealthCare and       Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111-      152), or part thereof, in the House or in the Committee of       the Whole House on the state of the Union unless an easily       searchable electronic estimate and comparison prepared by the       Director of the Congressional Budget Office is made available       on a publicly available website of the House.        (d) It shall not be in order to consider a measure or       matter proposing to repeal or amend the Patient Protection       and Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and the Health Care and       Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111-      152), or part thereof, in the House or in the Committee of       the Whole House on the state of the Union, that is called up       pursuant to a rule or order that makes an amendment in order       or considers such an amendment to be adopted, unless an       easily searchable updated electronic estimate and comparison       prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office       reflecting such amendment is made available on a publicly       available website of the House.        (e) It shall not be in order to consider a rule or order       that waives the application of paragraph (a), paragraph (b),       paragraph (c), or paragraph (d). As disposition of any point       of order under paragraphs (c) through (e), the Chair shall       put the question of consideration with respect to the order,       conference report, or rule as applicable. The question of       consideration shall be debatable for 10 minutes bythe Member       initiating the point of order and for 10 minutes by an       opponent, but shall otherwise be decided without intervening       motion except one that the House adjourn.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the  [[Page H4137]]       consideration of the subject before the House being made by       the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous question is to       give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the       House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920,       to the effect that ``the refusal of the House to sustain the       demand for the previous question passes the control of the       resolution to the opposition'' in order to offer an       amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party       offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous       question and a member of the opposition rose to a       parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R.-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.
