 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, for years, our  country's prosperity was broadly shared. The difference between rich  and poor wasn't too big. When the economy grew, most Americans  benefited. The saying was that ``a rising tide lifts all boats.''   But today, income inequality is at its highest level in nearly a  century. The top 1 percent take home about 20 percent of all income.   But this story is not being told by economic indicators like GDP. GDP  tells us how fast or slow our economy is growing, but not how that  growth is spread across income levels.   I am working to change that. The Joint Economic Committee, where I  serve as vice chair, held a hearing this week to examine proposed  measures to track inequality. These new measures are included in my  legislation, the Measuring Real Income Growth Act.   Under my bill, GDP growth will be analyzed by income level. It will  tell us who the economy is working for and who is left behind, and it  will help us craft policies to start reducing inequality so a rising  tide really does lift all boats.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I thank the  chairwoman for yielding and for her leadership on the committee.   Mr. Chair, I strongly support H.R. 1815, which is just plain common  sense, and I congratulate my colleague and friend for his leadership  and hard work on this bill.   We want investors to understand the disclosures that companies,  brokers, and advisers are required to give them.   What would be the point of requiring disclosures that the vast  majority of investors don't even understand? If they don't understand  the disclosures--or worse, if they haven't even read the disclosures-- then they are not making their investment decisions with all the  information that they need.   The best way to ensure that investors understand the disclosures is  actually to engage in investor testing of proposed disclosure forms.                                time  1245    Disclosures that a sophisticated institutional investor might  understand or that the experts on the SEC staff might understand might  not be clear and understandable to the average retail investor.   This isn't surprising. The SEC staff who designed these disclosures  are typically lawyers and not disclosure design experts. That is why it  is important to require the SEC to engage in investor testing of these  disclosures. That way, they don't end up requiring a disclosure that  simply does not work.   Quite frankly, I don't understand why anyone would oppose this bill,  because that would be the equivalent of saying that you don't want  investors to understand the disclosures. And if you think the SEC has  the authority to do investor testing, then why would you oppose simply  codifying that authority? Other agencies have done effective usability  testing for disclosures.    MALONEY of New York. The Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, under Director Cordray, engaged in extensive  consumer testing of new disclosure forms that it was proposing for  prepaid cards. It came up with two different proposed disclosure forms  and then field-tested the two forms for months before finalizing the  prepaid card rule. That is the kind of data-driven regulation that  helps consumers, investors, and, ultimately, all market participants  because it improves trust in the entire financial markets.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
