 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Chairman Neal, for all  of his hard and great work. He never gave up; he never gave in. He kept  the faith, and he kept his eyes on the prize.   I thank all of my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, from  the Ways and Means Committee for finding a way to get us to the point  where we are today.   Twenty-six years ago, I opposed NAFTA with every bone in my body. I  never thought the day would come when we would have the opportunity to  right some of the wrongs in that agreement.   NAFTA failed our workers. It failed our Mexican brothers and sisters.  It failed Mother Earth.   NAFTA destroyed the hopes and dreams of a generation. It wiped out  communities. It started a race to the bottom.   With this vote, we have a chance to reset the clock, to chart a new  path, and to create a new trade model.   We can always do more, but today, we build a new foundation for trade  policy, a floor that reflects our values as a people and as a nation.   I thank the working group and all of our trade staff for working day  in and day out. They were determined to do right.
