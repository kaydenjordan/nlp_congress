 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medical  Nutrition Therapy Act of 2021, along with my colleague from Michigan,  Senator Peters. Our bill would expand Medicare beneficiaries' access to  Medical Nutrition Therapy, or MNT, which is a cost-effective component  of treatment for obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and  other chronic conditions. At a time when we have seen many diet-related  chronic conditions contribute to poor COVID-19 outcomes, increasing  access to MNT should be part of the strategy to improve disease  management and prevention for America's seniors. The Medical Nutrition  Therapy Act would make two important changes to support patients,  improve health outcomes, and reduce unnecessary health care costs.   First, it would expand Medicare Part B coverage of outpatient medical  nutrition therapy services to a number of currently uncovered diseases  or conditions--including prediabetes, obesity, high blood pressure,  high cholesterol, malnutrition, eating disorders, cancer, HIV/AIDS,  gastrointestinal diseases including celiac disease, and cardiovascular  disease. Currently, Medicare Part B only covers outpatient MNT for  diabetes, renal disease, and post-kidney transplant.   Second, the bill would allow more types of providers--including nurse  practitioners, physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists, and  psychologists--to refer patients to MNT. This is especially critical  for a rural state like Maine where a NP or PA may be one's trusted  primary care provider.   MNT counseling is provided by Registered Dietitian Nutritionists  (RDNs) as part of a collaborative health care team. It is evidenced- based and proven to positively affect weight, blood pressure, blood  lipids, and blood sugar control. Nutritional counseling by RDNs is  recommended by the National Lipid Association to promote long-term  adherence to an individualized, heart-healthy diet. Through MNT,  individuals benefit from in-depth, individualized nutrition  assessments. Follow-up visits help reinforce important behavior and  lifestyle changes and increase compliance.   Seniors deserve improved access to this cost-effective medical  treatment, but many older adults are missing out under the current  Medicare policy. Marcy Kyle, a RDN from Rockport, Maine, has seen many  patients denied access to medically necessary MNT. One of her patients  with prediabetes was referred by his primary care physician for MNT at  age 64. At that time, his private insurance covered the service, and he  booked the first available appointment the following week. That same  week, this patient turned 65 and transitioned onto Medicare. You can  imagine his surprise upon arriving for his appointment and learning  that MNT would not be covered. Fortunately for that patient, the  outpatient facility changed its process to prevent similar situations,  but this example demonstrates how the current restrictions can be  detrimental for older adults at a critical juncture in their journey to  better health.   Another unfortunate example from Maine was a patient with a new  Celiac Disease diagnosis complicated by severe weight loss. His private  insurance covered MNT as Celiac Disease is a controllable disease with  proper nutrition. But when transitioning from private insurance to  Medicare, this patient, too, lost his access to MNT. This truly is a  lost opportunity since we know early treatment with MNT can prevent  future and more serious health complications and chronic conditions in  older adults. Conditions such as prediabetes and Celiac Disease should  be covered.   The health and financial crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic  makes access to MNT even more important. Seniors with diet-related  conditions have suffered more than any other population in terms of  experiencing the worst health outcomes, including death. According to  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) data, among those  hospitalized with COVID-19, 84 percent of patients had hypertension, 68  percent had hyperlipidemia, 51 percent had diabetes, and 35 percent of  patients were obese. Tragically, many of these patients were never able  to leave the hospital because they passed away. In addition to the  human cost, there is a financial one: the impact on the Medicare  program.   This should not come as a surprise since the health and economic  impact of chronic diseases is staggering. According to the U.S. Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention, 90 percent of the $3.5 trillion  that the United States spends annually on health care goes to the  treatment of people with chronic diseases and mental health conditions.  Preventing chronic diseases, or managing symptoms when prevention is  not possible, is one way to reduce these costs. This is particularly  important for the Medicare program as more than two-thirds of seniors  on Medicare live with multiple chronic conditions. As one Registered  Dietitian Nutritionist in Maine told me, ``we all know a dollar spent  on prevention saves many health care dollars in the long run and is the  right thing to do for our seniors at a time when they have limited  budgets.''   The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 2021 is supported by nearly 50  national organizations, including the Academy of Nutrition and  Dietetics, the American Diabetes Association, the Endocrine Society,  the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, and  UsAgainstAlzheimer's.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to improve  access to cost-effective medical treatment for Medicare patients with  chronic diseases.   Thank you, Mr. President.                            ____________________
