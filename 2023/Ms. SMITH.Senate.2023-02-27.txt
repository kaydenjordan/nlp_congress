 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place the  bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to my  own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m.  on Tuesday, February 28; that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session  and resume consideration of the Walker nomination, postcloture; that at  11:30 a.m. the Senate vote on confirmation of the Walker nomination and  that following the cloture vote on the Whitehead nomination, the Senate  recess until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings; that at  2:15 p.m., if cloture has been invoked on the Whitehead nomination, the  Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination; further, that if cloture  has been invoked on the Martinez-Olguin nomination, the vote on  confirmation be at 4:30 p.m.; finally, that if any nominations are  confirmed during Tuesday's session, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's actions.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.
