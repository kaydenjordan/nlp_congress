 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, earlier this morning, it was my honor to  join with President Biden, the Vice President, Leader McConnell, the  Speaker, and other congressional leaders in paying a final tribute to  our former colleague, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.   From defending our country in World War II, where he fought the Nazis  on the hillsides of Italy, to dedicating his final years advocating  with disabled Americans and veterans, Senator Dole redefined and  elevated what it means to serve our country. By 21, he had given more  of himself than most of us give in a lifetime, and then he kept going  for 70 years after that.   Leader Dole, rest in peace. Thank you for all you did to make our  country better. And I extend my condolences and prayers to his wife,  Senator Elizabeth Dole, their family, and all who mourn the loss of the  gentleman from Kansas.                                 Debt Ceiling    Mr. President, now on the debt ceiling.   Later today, the Senate is going to hold a crucial vote that will  enable us to address the debt ceiling on a fast-track basis, avoiding  the prospect of a catastrophic, calamitous default on our sovereign  debt.   The proposal I worked on with Leader McConnell will allow Democrats  to do precisely what we have been seeking to do for months, what I have  been coming down to the floor advocating since the fall: provide a  simple majority vote to fix the debt ceiling without having to resort  to a convoluted, lengthy, and ultimately risky process.   The Nation's debt has been incurred on a bipartisan basis, so I am  pleased that this responsible action will be taken today to facilitate  a process that avoids a default.   I want to thank Leader McConnell for working with us on this  agreement. Our multiple conversations were fruitful, candid,  productive.   This is the responsible path forward: no brinksmanship, no default on  the debt, no risk of another recession.  [[Page S9054]]    We still have a few more steps to take before we completely resolve  this matter, but I am optimistic that after today's vote we will be on  a glide path to avoid a catastrophic default.                            Build Back Better Act    Mr. President, now on Build Back Better. In the first 9 days of  December, Democrats have made very good progress on some of our largest  priorities for the month. We successfully avoided a needless government  shutdown. We cleared the path to address the debt ceiling and avoid a  default. And now we are close to passing an annual Defense bill on a  bipartisan basis, as we have done for decades.   Last night, I filed cloture on NDAA and, for the information of my  colleagues, we will vote early next week to move forward on this bill.   Soon we will be able to turn to another crucial item on our December  to-do list: passing Build Back Better in time for Christmas. We remain  on schedule to bring this bill to the floor of the Senate before  December 25. Yesterday, four Senate committees released their titles of  the Build Back Better Act, and the Congressional Budget Office released  scores for those titles. More titles and scores are scheduled to be  released this week.   For the knowledge of all Senators, the text and scores can be found  online at the Senate Democrats' and CBO websites. So it is available to  everybody.   Senate Democrats have also wrapped up all of our final meetings with  the Parliamentarian's office. Those are the meetings where just  Democrats talked to the Parliamentarian. Republicans also get their  chance alone. And now we anticipate that the bipartisan Byrd bath-- where both sides are together to make their case to the Parliamentarian  and argue back and forth--we expect those to start next week.   I want to thank the Parliamentarian's office and all of our  committee's staff for working so hard this week to bring us to this  point.   For all the reasons we should pass Build Back Better, I want to talk  about one in some detail this morning: extending the child tax credit.   During the holiday season, American families are looking for every  option to lower costs, make ends meet. So the best thing we can do is  pass Build Back Better before some critical tax breaks from the  American Rescue Plan--above all, the child tax credit checks--come to a  premature end. That is one thing no American should want.   COVID isn't over, and so these checks shouldn't lapse either. On the  contrary, they should keep going. Roughly 35 million families will get  their next $300-per-child check in the mail on December 15, and we need  to assure that they will get their checks in January, too, without any  glitch. As a number of outlets have reported, families are at risk of  seeing these checks end after December, if we don't take action.   So let's get this done. Let's pass and enact Build Back Better into  law before Christmas so families won't see their checks come to a halt  in the coming months, and families, as they are doing their Christmas  shopping, can be assured that new checks will be coming over the next  year.   For the tens of millions of families that have taken it on the chin  during COVID, an extra $300 per month, per child could be what helps  the parents stand on their own two feet. That is extra money for  groceries, fill up the tank at the gas station, pay for diapers.   These are not luxuries. These are not handouts. They are daily  essentials that nobody should have to worry about in today's day and  age. In an affluent society, no one should have to worry about these  things, and that is what these checks do: they bring a little more  fairness into our economy.   They say to poorer people: You can have a chance and, more  importantly, your children can have a chance. That is part of the  American dream.   Of course, Build Back Better will do more than that. It will, for  example, provide the largest investments to date to fight climate  change.   I have been working with my colleagues for months to make sure our  climate investments will be robust, effective, and will lay a  foundation for us to keep taking action to fight the climate crisis  here in Congress in the future.   Climate change costs our country tens of billions of dollars every  time that storms we used to label ``once in a century'' slam us. Build  Back Better will help us address the climate crisis by lowering  emissions, making our communities more resistant to disasters, and  protect our planet for the next generation.   Our work on Build Back Better will keep going until we get the job  done.                                STUDENT LOANS    Finally, on student loans, Mr. President, as the year comes to an  end, tens of millions--tens of millions--of Americans face another  looming deadline they cannot afford. Soon, the Federal Government's  moratorium on student loan payments will expire, and payments are set  to resume in February of next year.   Yesterday, I joined with my colleagues Senator Warren and  Representative Pressley to call on the Biden administration to extend  the pause on student loan payments. The pause expires in January, and  it has been paused because of COVID. It ought to be extended. COVID is  not over, and students still have these huge burdens. They are just  readjusting to life, where they may have missed school or missed jobs  or not gotten fully paid. So we need to certainly pause these payments.  But we also urge the administration to take the next important step in  granting borrowers relief by canceling student loan debt.   As we keep recovering from COVID, as Americans are looking to cut  costs and make ends meet, now is precisely the wrong time for us to  allow this commonsense moratorium to end. According to one study, it  could strip away more than $85 billion--$85 billion--from American  families over the coming year. At a time like this, that just makes no  sense. We should give student loan payers a break and keep the  moratorium going.   Should the moratorium be allowed to expire, the burden will fall the  heaviest on those who are least prepared to shoulder it--on low-income  borrowers and borrowers of color, who typically take out more loans  than White Americans and end up paying them back over a much longer  time horizon.   On the flip side, the President's decision to extend the moratorium  over the course of the year was precisely--precisely--the right thing  to do. It has allowed borrowers to focus on saving up for these hard  times, to save up for emergencies, and to pay down other forms of debt.  We should keep it going.   This is about taking one commonsense, easy step to save people costs.  It is about racial equality. It is about giving people more  opportunities to build wealth and achieve the American dream. The  administration can do it on its own. They don't need any kind of  congressional approval. We know how arduous those things are around  here.   Should the moratorium be extended, the administration should take  further action to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt per  borrower. Imagine the economic activity we can see if tens of millions  of Americans are suddenly freed from crushing student loan debt. They  can buy homes, start a business, buy a car, or help send their own kids  to college. What a boom that would be for our country, especially at a  time now when it is needed.   For decades, higher education was considered a ladder up for tens of  millions of people--for immigrants, people of color, and working-class  families--but, today, it is an anchor weighing too many down. These  Americans deserve relief. They deserve help. They deserve to have the  moratorium extended and their student debt canceled.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I just would like to speak about the vote  we had--the first vote.   I am really pleased that this Chamber just passed legislation setting  up a fast-track process with debt ceiling legislation--no  brinksmanship, no default on the debt, no risk of another recession.  Responsible governing won the day. This is now headed to the  President's desk.   I want to be clear. This is about paying debt accumulated by both  parties. So I am pleased we were able to facilitate a process with the  support of Members from both parties that avoids a needless and  catastrophic default and cuts to Medicare.   This was a bipartisan process, and I hope there can be more. And I  want to thank Leader McConnell for working with us in good faith to get  to this point.   We started this month with a daunting to-do list, but we have made  significant progress and are on track to get the work done. To repeat,  we did this with no brinksmanship, no default on debt, no risk of  another recession. It was responsible governing that won the day, and  now the bill is headed to the President's desk.   I expect--after this legislation is signed, I expect new legislation  will be introduced to increase the debt limit, and we intend to pass it  by December 15. The American people can breathe easy and rest assured  there will not be a default.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations: Calendar No. 359 and 361; that the  Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without intervening action or  debate; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate; that any statements  related to the nominations be printed in the Record; that the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate resume  legislation session.
