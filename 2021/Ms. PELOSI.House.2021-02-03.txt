 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank  him for his great leadership of the Joint Economic Committee, a place  where we can really think in a way that is entrepreneurial and  successful for the American people. His private sector experience, as  well as respect for the public sector and the nonprofit sector, equips  him well to lead that important committee and to take us to the floor  on this bill, following the Budget Committee, under the leadership of    John Yarmuth, a tireless worker for the budget and this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that a budget should be a statement of our  national values. What is important to us as a nation should be  reflected when we put a budget together.   It is curious to me to hear the distinguished gentleman on the other  side of the aisle. It would be ludicrous if it weren't so deadly  serious.   Mr. Speaker, $1.9 trillion, the President of the United States has  determined is necessary to meet the needs of the American people at a  time of a pandemic, at a time of consequences to our economy that are  drastic--and I will go on to that in a moment. $1.9 trillion, which is  almost exactly the cost of the Republican tax break that they gave to  the richest people in America; 83 percent of the benefits went to the  top 1 percent.                                time  1630    This legislation, which helps meet the needs of the American people,  to be considered a tax break bill for the rich, it is pathetic. It is  pathetic. The fact of this Congress is that somebody can say things  that aren't true on the floor, but if you say that they said something  that was untrue, you would be called out of order.   But I would just say, the facts are these. $1.9 trillion, when you  add in the interest--Mr. Green from Texas referenced this--if you add  in the interest, $1.9 trillion, $2 trillion, added to the national  debt, with no stimulus for our economy, only debt for our children.   Instead, here today, we have a bill that meets the needs of the  American people. In the election, the American people cast their ballot  for big, bold action and decisive leadership to turn the coronavirus  pandemic and economic crisis around. Since then, the need has  accelerated drastically. The time for decisive action is now.   Mr. Speaker, that is why, today, we will pass a budget resolution to  pave the way for a landmark coronavirus rescue, a rescue plan, which  will do what is needed to save lives and livelihoods.   We hope that Republicans in Congress would support a legislative  package that will bring real relief to people and to our communities.   Passing this budget does not preclude reaching a bipartisan  agreement. I would rather not work under reconciliation, but if that is  the way we have to work in order to get results for the American  people, we must use every option at our disposal. But I am hopeful that  we can have bipartisanship.   That does not ensure that Congress can move forward and meet the  country's needs. The need for this action could not be more urgent, and  Americans cannot afford to wait. They cannot afford any further delay.   Tens of millions of Americans have been infected. Nearly half a  million have died, with one-fifth of those deaths occurring over the  past month.   Meanwhile, tens of millions of workers are jobless; food and housing  insecurity is skyrocketing; and school closings threaten our children's  education. And our most vulnerable communities are bearing the brunt of  these crises, as the underlying health and economic disparities  continue to grow.   President Biden's American Rescue Plan will take a comprehensive,  strategic, and science-based approach to tackling the public health and  economic crises. Here is what it will do.   It will put money in the pockets of the American people. It will put  vaccines in the arms of the American people. It will put children back  in school and workers back to work.   It will crush the virus and help us safely reopen schools, mounting a  national vaccination campaign that includes community vaccination  sites, ramping and scaling up testing and tracing, addressing shortages  of PPE, investing in high-quality treatments, and addressing healthcare  disparities.   It is sinful, Mr. Speaker, to see how few people in our communities  of color have had access to vaccines up until now, but that will change  under President Biden and with this legislation.   It will deliver immediate relief to working families bearing the  brunt of the crisis, providing $1,400 checks per person to households  across America and providing housing and nutrition assistance. Tens of  thousands of people are food insecure in our country. Maybe 17 million  children are food insecure in our country.   Access to safe and reliable childcare--let me say it again, safe and  reliable childcare--and affordable healthcare, expanded unemployment  insurance, and enhanced tax credits for families, low-income working  families.   Finally, the plan will support communities struggling with the  economic fallout, providing a lifeline for the hardest hit small  businesses, especially those owned by minorities, and honoring our  heroes. Yes, $350 billion to honor our heroes, about one-fourth of what  you were giving to the top 1 percent in our country in your tax bill.   Why is that important? Because these are the entities, State and  local county governments, townships, and the rest, that provide the  services that the people need: healthcare workers, first responders,  police and fire, transportation, sanitation, food workers, our  teachers, our teachers, our teachers. They need the State and local  governments to be funded. That is very important. In a bipartisan way  across the country, it has bipartisan support. So, yes, it is $350  billion.   Again, it is to meet the needs. These people risk their lives to save  lives, and now they may lose their jobs because of the cost of the  coronavirus and the lost revenue from the pandemic.   Finally, the plan would support communities struggling with the  fallout, again, providing a lifeline--that is this point I am making  now--for hardest hit small businesses, as I mentioned, that are owned  by minorities, frontline health workers, teachers, transit workers, and  other essential workers risking their lives to save ours. It bears  repetition.   The cost of inaction is growing by the day. If we don't enact this  package now, we could end up with 4 million fewer jobs this year, and  it could take a year longer to return to full employment. An entire  cohort of young people may have lower lifetime earnings because they  were deprived of another semester of school.   Millions of parents, particularly moms, can be forced to stay at  home, reducing their wages and future job prospects. I believe the  figure is 100  [[Page H311]]  percent. But just about 100 percent of the jobs lost in December were  women.   But if this package is passed and enacted in full by March, economic  growth is projected to jump by nearly 8 percent this year and then by  an additional 4 percent next year. At that pace, we will create 7\1/2\  million jobs this year alone and a total of 10 million jobs by the fall  of 2022, reaching full employment.   But don't take it from me. Experts agree that this bold action is  needed, especially as interest rates are at historic lows and the  return on small investments has never been higher.    As Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, of whom we are very proud,  stated:         Without further action, we risk a longer, more painful       recession now and long-term scarring of the economy later.       Right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest       thing we can do now is act big. In the long run, the benefits       will far outweigh the costs.    Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said just last  week:         It is better to err on the side of too much rather than too       little. Interest rates are at practically zero, inflation is       low, unemployment is high. You don't need a textbook to know       that this is when you push on the fiscal accelerator.    Also last week, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell,  stated:         I am much more worried about falling short of a complete       recovery and losing people's careers and lives that they       built because they don't get back to work in time. I am more       concerned about that and the damage that will do.    Reconciliation bills have passed on a bipartisan basis 17 times in  recent years, including one that I participated in to pass the  Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, which delivered lifesaving  healthcare to nearly 10 million children.   As I said, the need for action could not be more urgent. Americans  cannot afford further delay.   Listen, listen, listen to your constituents. We should all be  listening to our constituents. They are our bosses. We must meet their  needs.   Listening to our constituents, respecting President Biden's proposal  to meet their needs, we must work together to save their lives and  their livelihoods.   I wish we could have a strong bipartisan vote on this budget bill  because, as I said, this budget is a statement of our values, and our  values are that we are here to meet the needs of America's working  families. It is about our children, their health, their education, the  economic security of their families, a safe world for them to thrive, a  world at peace in which they can reach their fulfillment. It is always  about the children.   It is not about heaping mountains of debt on them, as they did in  their tax scam that they passed, and then to have the nerve to call  this a tax break for the wealthy when it has low-income tax credits,  childcare tax credits, refundability, billions of dollars for the  working poor in our country.   Economists and the Treasury Secretaries of both parties have said, if  you really want to turn the economy around, help the neediest the most,  help the neediest first. We do this in this legislation as we bolster  the middle class and crush the virus.   Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote.
