 Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring attention to National Small  Business Week. Celebrated for over 50 years, we take this week to  recognize the hard work, dedication, and sacrifices of America's  entrepreneurs and small business owners and the important role that  they play in our Nation.   Today, there are over 30 million small businesses in America,  accounting for nearly 60 million employees, or just about half our  workforce. They are the keystone of our national economy.   As a former small business owner myself, I know what it takes to make  payroll, attract customers, train and manage employees, and, at times,  struggle just to keep the lights on. I can attest, it is not easy.   Today, thank God, small businesses in America are experiencing  economic prosperity like never before, yet challenges remain. As  policymakers, we must foster an environment in which small businesses  can thrive, with limited regulations and tax policy that rewards hard  work and incentivizes growth.   We are a nation of small businesses, and small businesses deserve our  national support.                            ____________________
