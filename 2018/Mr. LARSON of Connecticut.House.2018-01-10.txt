 Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, January 10,  2018, I missed rollcall votes 5-7 on the motions to adjourn from Mr.  Espaillat, Mr. Gutierrez, and Mr. Grijalva. I was attending meetings  off-campus and was not able to return for these unexpected votes that  were not on the House schedule. If I had been present for these votes,  I would have voted: ``Nay'' on rollcall vote 5 on the motion to adjourn  from Mr. Espaillat, ``Nay'' on rollcall vote 6 on the motion to adjourn  from Mr. Gutierrez, and ``Nay'' on rollcall vote 7 on the motion to  adjourn from Mr. Grijalva.                            ____________________
