 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Pallone for yielding  time.   I rise today in opposition to H.R. 382, the Pandemic is Over Act.  This is an effort by our Republican colleagues to hastily terminate a  public health emergency designation that will have damaging effects on  our Nation's veterans and those who care for them.    Currently, this emergency designation grants our government a number  of critical flexibilities that not only allow it to work more  efficiently and effectively but that are essential to support America's  veteran population.   When we passed the CARES Act in 2020, we did so carefully and  thoughtfully to ensure that veterans would be able to safely and  quickly access the care they needed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  We also ensured the Department of Veterans Affairs and its employees  had the tools and flexibilities they needed to meet their mission.   I am especially concerned by the risk that would be caused by hastily  terminating healthcare providers' ability to prescribe controlled  substances via telehealth. This will severely impact millions of  patients' access to medications they need to manage chronic pain,  complex mental health conditions, and substance abuse disorders.   Veterans who experience these conditions at greater rates than their  nonveteran counterparts are among those who would be severely affected.   VA estimates at least 47,000 veterans have active controlled  substance prescriptions from prescribers they have never seen in  person. A sudden termination of the public health emergency would mean  all of them would need immediate in-person visits with their  prescribers in order to continue their treatments.                                time  1500    An additional 247,000 veterans have active controlled substances  prescriptions through virtual care at VA, and many of these veterans'  continued access to medications could also be at risk.   During the public health emergency, we also specifically addressed  the unique health and safety needs facing homeless veterans. Those  actions included ensuring that veterans experiencing homelessness had  access to basic needs, like shelter, food, clothing, and  transportation, while also ensuring service providers had the funding  they needed to maintain social distancing and distribute those in need  across multiple facilities to reduce the spread of COVID-19.   What we learned from the pandemic is that providing these  foundational basic needs to homeless veterans and service providers  works in promoting housing security.   Last week, VA announced it housed over 40,000 veterans experiencing  homelessness in 2022, surpassing its goal of housing 38,000 veterans.  That tremendous accomplishment can be directly attributed to the  authorities Congress put in place during the pandemic.   Rolling back those flexibilities now would mean more veterans would  go without the resources they need to survive.   If my Republican colleagues are so insistent on ending the public  health emergency prematurely, I hope they are equally insistent on  ensuring that we quickly make permanent those pandemic authorities that  veterans need.   I am proud to support Congresswoman Nikema Williams' bill, H.R. 491,  the Return Home to Housing Act, and cosponsor Congresswoman Cherfilus- McCormick's bill, the Healthy Foundations for Homeless Veterans Act.    These bills will ensure that there is no lapse in the  care and resources homeless veterans need when the public health  emergency designation ends, and I hope my Republican colleagues will  support them.   The Biden administration announced last night it intends to extend  the COVID-19 emergency declarations to end on May 11. Unlike my  colleagues on the other side who want to irresponsibly put an end to  the national emergency today, the additional time gives the agencies  and Congress time to ensure there is no disruption in care and services  for veterans.   My Republican colleagues have a choice to make. They can continue to  insist on pushing an agenda that politicizes the pandemic, terminate  the public health emergency designation prematurely, and wholly  disregard the disastrous impact such an action would have on veterans,  or they can put aside this shortsighted approach and use their newfound  control of Congress to actually do the job they were sent to Washington  to do: pass legislation that helps our Nation's veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 382.
