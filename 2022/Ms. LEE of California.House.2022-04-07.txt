 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of my  incredible constituents, Mrs. Daisy Murray, who will be celebrating her  104th birthday on Monday, April 11. Mrs. Murray has been a resident of  San Leandro for more than 30 years and has made many wonderful  contributions to our East Bay community.   Mrs. Daisy Murray was born in 1919 to a family that was only a few  generations removed from slavery, as her grandmother was the daughter  of an enslaved person. Mrs. Murray's parents faced racism and violence  living in the South, and when they got married, they relocated to Ohio,  where Ms. Daisy was born and raised.   I think it was in the mid-1970s, Mrs. Murray founded the Sojourner  Truth Manor, the first affordable residency for adults and seniors in  the country created by an African-American businesswoman.   I worked very hard on this when I was a student at Mills College, and  I remember a woman we called Ms. Dorothy, worked with Mrs. Murray on  this. It is still a thriving community, the affordable housing  community. It is located in Oakland on Martin Luther King Jr. Way. It  still exists to this day, and it has housed generations of adults and  seniors in need.   On behalf of the 13th Congressional District of California, I want to  thank Mrs. Daisy Murray for her many good works and everything that she  has done to enrich our East Bay community. I wish her a happy 104th  birthday. Happy birthday, Mrs. Daisy Murray.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I am glad to be able to speak  on behalf of H.R. 3807, which will deliver more funding to restaurants  and small businesses, which really deserve their Representatives to  speak up, stand up, and work for them because they desperately need our  help. We must deliver on their behalf.   Madam Speaker, I thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairwoman Velazquez, and  Congressman Blumenauer for their tremendous leadership in working so  diligently in bringing this bill to the floor.   H.R. 3807 continues Democrats' effort to help our small businesses  and restaurants recover from the economic costs of COVID-19. These  small businesses are the economic and cultural lifeblood of our  communities, so we established the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, and  other support programs, in the American Rescue Plan.   The ARP delivered billions of dollars to help people in businesses  make it through this crisis. Almost 600 restaurants and bars in my  district alone received more than $212 million to keep their doors open  and to support their employees and families.                                time  1015    However, we know that this crisis is still not over, and we must  deliver more assistance. We must pass this bill today, and I strongly  urge my colleagues to vote ``aye.''
