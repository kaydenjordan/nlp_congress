 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask why.   Why are we, with hours to go before a government shutdown, wasting  precious time debating bills that are so extreme, so backward, that  they clearly have no chance of becoming law?   Why, this week, have we spent more time voting to defund individual  salaries of public servants than passing a bill that would prevent  millions from going unpaid?   Why are we focused on the baseless and bogus impeachment inquiry than  the fact that if we do not prevent a shutdown, we will be asking  members of our military, our law enforcement officers, our TSA agents,  and our traffic controllers all to come to work to protect our Nation  without a paycheck?   The livelihoods of thousands of families in my district are being put  at risk, as well as the benefits of millions more--nutrition benefits,  SBA loans, taxpayer assistance, and Social Security services.   Mr. Speaker, I ask why, but I also ask when. When will this Chamber  get back to governing, get off this fantasy island of budgeting and  actually govern?                            ____________________
