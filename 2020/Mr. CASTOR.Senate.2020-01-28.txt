 So to your knowledge, there was no malicious       intent in moving the transcript to the compartmented server?         And even on the code word server, you had       access to it?        Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. Yes.         So at no point in time in your official duties       were you denied access to this information, is that correct?        Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. Correct.         And to your knowledge, anybody on NSC staff       that needed access to their official duties always was able       to access it, correct, people that had a need to know and a       need to access it?         OK.    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Now, Mr. Morrison testified that he recommended  restricting access to the transcript, not because he was concerned  there was anything improper or illegal, but he was concerned about a  potential leak and, as he put it, how that ``would play out in  Washington's polarized environment'' and would ``affect bipartisan  support our Ukrainian partners are currently experiencing in  Congress.''   He was right to be concerned, potentially, about leaks because the  Trump administration has faced national security leaks at an alarming  rate. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, himself, said concerns about leaks  seemed justified, and it was not unusual that something would be put in  a more restricted circulation.   Now, what else is in the record evidence? Mr. Morrison explained his  understanding of how the transcript ended up on that server.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          To the best of your knowledge, there was no       malicious intent in moving the transcript to the       compartmented server?
