 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  life of a valued member of the Savannah community, Jerry Marshall Gill.   Jerry was born in Bogalusa, Louisiana, in 1931. He and his family  moved to Savannah when he was at the young age of 5.   Once in Savannah, Jerry attended Commercial High School, where he  stood out immediately as a gifted basketball player.   From Commercial High, Jerry proceeded to Armstrong Junior College  before answering the call to join the United States Marine Corps. Jerry  was called to Active Duty in 1950 and served in the Korean war.   Back home, he was a volunteer for the Georgia Affiliates Federal  Credit Unions for over 42 years, where he received ``Volunteer of the  Year,'' the ``Lifetime Achievement Award,'' and the ``Credit Union  House Hall of Leaders Award,'' which is displayed here in D.C. in the  D.C. Credit Union House.   After retirement, Jerry worked with the Georgia Affiliates Credit  Union for another 12 years.   Jerry's life of service was further demonstrated in his commitment to  his fellow veterans. He volunteered with the USO and was a member of  the Veterans Council League for many years.   We will all dearly miss Jerry, his wisdom, and his service.                            ____________________
