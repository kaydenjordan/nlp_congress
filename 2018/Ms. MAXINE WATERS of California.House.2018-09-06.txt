 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank  Congresswoman Barbara Lee and Congressman Jamie Raskin for organizing a  Special Order to follow the 1 minutes to honor the memory of our dear  friend and former colleague, Congressman Ron Dellums.   Ron Dellums was an unabashed progressive icon, and a strong and  outspoken advocate for his constituents, veterans, people of color, and  other vulnerable communities during his 13-term tenure in the United  States Congress.   Understanding the unique problems facing the African-American  community, Ron Dellums joined with 12 fellow civil rights giants,  including Lou Stokes, Bill Clay, Shirley Chisholm, to create the  Congressional Black Caucus in 1971. True to his creed, the CBC remains  the conscience of the Congress today and has grown to a historic 48  members.   As a former U.S. Marine, Ron Dellums was one of the most outspoken  opponents of the Vietnam war. In Congress, he led an effort to educate  the American public of war crimes that were committed during the  Vietnam war.   In 1993, he also made history as the first African American chair of  the House Armed Services Committee.   However, one of Ron Dellums' greatest achievements is one that is  also dear to my heart, ending apartheid in South Africa. As a member of  the California State Assembly and a national board member of Trans  Africa, I had the privilege of working with Ron Dellums to pass  legislation at the State and Federal level that forced the United  States to divest from apartheid, the regime in South Africa.                            ____________________     I would like to thank Congresswoman  Barbara Lee and Congressman Jamie Raskin for organizing a Special Order  Hour to honor the memory of our dear friend and former colleague,  Congressman Ron Dellums.

However, one of Ron Dellum's greatest achievements is one that is  also dear to my heart: ending apartheid in South Africa. As a member of  the California State Assembly and a national board member of  TransAfrica, I had the privilege of working with Ron Dellums to pass  legislation at the state and federal level that forced the United  States to divest from the apartheid regime in South Africa.   While I authored, and fought to enact California Assembly Bill 134,  which passed in August 1986 and made California the first state to  divest its $12 billion in state pension funds tied to the apartheid  regime in South Africa, Ron Dellums was simultaneously championing  similar legislation in the U.S. Congress. His historic bill, the  Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, gained enough support to not  only pass in both chambers of Congress, but to also override President  Ronald Reagan's veto in 1986.   Though he retired from Congress after 27 years of service, Ron  Dellums maintained his dedication to his community and was elected  mayor of his hometown, Oakland, California, in 2007.   The incomparable Ron Dellums--a passionate drum major for peace,  inspiring community leader, effective politician, and lifelong public  servant--left an indelible mark on the City of Oakland and in the  hearts of so many people across this country who also love him.   Though our hearts are heavy, I join the Congressional Black Caucus  and the entire U.S. Congress in celebrating his service to our nation.
