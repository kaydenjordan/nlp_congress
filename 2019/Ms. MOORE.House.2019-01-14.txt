 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  California for yielding.  [[Page H532]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleague from Missouri in asking my  colleagues to support H.R. 430 and to vote ``yes'' on this legislation.   Now, this is just a short-term, 6-month extension of the Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families program because we could not sign off on  the negotiated 2-year extension from the omnibus. Therefore, the  program has lapsed, and it is imperative that we move this legislation  quickly, get it cleared through the House, sent over to the Senate, and  signed into law.   Needy Americans are relying on us to do this. There are several  States that have absolutely no TANF dollars, zero carryover funds to  insulate against the prospect that this reckless shutdown will persist  and impact our most vulnerable citizens.   While my State is not one of the 23 States that have less than one  quarter of Federal TANF funding in reserve, our reserve is not  gigantic. At the current spend-down rate of funds in Wisconsin, we are  projecting that these funds will only last until early May, so this is  of some urgency.   Just let me remind you, Mr. Speaker, about the importance of  extending this program. This bill will allow HHS to send States,  Tribes, and territories overdue funds that they depend upon to help  level the playing field for struggling parents trying to work and to  support their families, tools like childcare assistance,  transportation, job training, money for basic needs, and services like  food and diapers.   I want to remind you, Mr. Speaker, that three-fourths of current TANF  recipients are children, usually living in poverty with their parents  or grandparents.   Mr. Speaker, as a former welfare recipient who rose out of poverty  with the help of cash assistance, SNAP, and higher education, I  understand how critically necessary it is for Americans to have access  to our Nation's safety net known as TANF.   Mr. Speaker, I will never forget the spring of 1996, when Wisconsin  Governor Tommy G. Thompson decided to end welfare as we knew it.                                time  1700    I was a State senator at the time. I stood on the floor and  filibustered until the wee hours of the morning with 100 amendments.  Then in the fall of 1996--it was a gigantic error of judgment, in my  estimation--Congress, on a bipartisan basis, followed Governor  Thompson's lead and replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children  with TANF, a program that turned into a block grant, having absolutely  no connection with people's ability to get work.   It imposed work requirements, whether there was any viable work there  or not. It limited educational opportunity for women, thus creating a  permanent underclass of workers. It does not provide promised childcare  and training, the very things that are most helpful for helping people  get employed.   While this proposal has been adopted by Congress and signed into law,  I have known, since 1996, that I would spend the rest of my career  trying to right-size this program and make sure that the program not  only met people's basic survival-level needs but actually worked toward  helping people lift out of poverty.   I am looking forward to this 116th Congress, when we can reenvision  welfare reform, because this imperfect program needs to continue to  assist struggling families to meet those basic needs. Forty-three  million Americans currently live in poverty and some in extreme  poverty.   I remind the Speaker that our Nation is only as strong as its most  vulnerable population. Instead of criminalizing welfare recipients and  creating more barriers for the poor, we must help lift them up so that  they, too, can escape poverty, join the economy, and add to our tax  base.   Let's pass this bill, and let's use the next 6 months provided by  this legislation to work together to enact long-overdue changes to TANF  that will restore childcare, incentivize education, and move away from  punitive time limits.   I ask my colleagues to vote for H.R. 430, and then I urge them to  join me in reenvisioning the program.
