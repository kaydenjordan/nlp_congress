 Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, tonight the Senator from Maryland, Mr.  Cardin, and I and a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators, have submitted a  resolution reaffirming the strong alliance between the United States  and Australia. I wish to speak about that for a few minutes.   I don't know what happened during last week's telephone call between  the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Australia,  but I do know this: The people of the United States do not have better  friends than the people of Australia.   We are more than friends. As one Australian told me when our family  lived there thirty years ago, ``Well, we're mates all right. The  English may be our ancestors but you Americans are our cousins. First  cousins. We started out the same kind of people. Underprivileged, a  long way from home, doing the same kind of thing, looking for a new  life. Found a hard life. Hoped it would be a better one for our  children. Each wave of new ones lifted up the last ones. A pioneering  spirit in the countryside here. In America, too.''   Even though they live down under on the other side of the world, for  a century Australians have stood with us every time we are at war, and  we have stood with them. During World War II, when Australian troops  were fighting in North Africa and Europe, and the Japanese were bombing  Darwin four times a day, the United States came to the rescue. In 1992,  Dick Cheney and I, as members of President George H.W. Bush's Cabinet,  traveled to Australia to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Battle  of the Coral Sea, when the U.S. Navy stopped Japan's advance. Today, no  two countries trust one another and cooperate in security arrangements  more than Australia and America. We trade, we visit one another, and  our  [[Page S749]]  students study in each other's universities.   Thirty years ago, our family lived an American dream and we moved to  Australia. We arrived on Australia Day, January 26, 1987, 199 years  after the first fleet of English settlers sailed into Sydney Harbor.  After 8 years of swiveling in the Governor's chair, on the very day I  was sworn out of office, my wife Honey and I and our four children flew  to Sydney for Six Months Off in the ``Land Down Under.'' It was my  wife's idea: an opportunity for a retreat from the merry-go-round of  power and to discover what really was important.   We rented a home in view of the most beautiful harbor in the world,  bought an Australian car, and I learned to drive on the wrong side of  the road. Our four children walked to Australian schools, and we all  sank deeply into the culture of America's favorite cousins. I attended  Chester A. Arthur Society meetings, where Australian Parliament members  competed to show that they know more about American history than United  States Senators do. We spent the night in the South Wales bush. We saw  9-foot crocodiles in the Northwest Territory. We traveled by train to  see the Melbourne Zoo and took a horseback trip across the Snowy  Mountains. It didn't take long for us to understand what Mark Twain  meant when he wrote: ``When a stranger from America steps ashore in  Sydney . . . the thing that strikes him is that it is an English City  with American trimmings.''   We made friends then that exist to this day. Last year, four of those  friends, the Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr and the Australian  Ambassador to the United States Kim Beazley and their wives, spent the  weekend with us at our home outside the Great Smoky Mountains in  Tennessee. We cherish those friendships and our country's relationship  with Australia. It is always appropriate for the U.S. Senate to  reaffirm the importance of that relationship, and I am glad to join  Senator Cardin and a long list of bipartisan U.S. Senators to do that  again today.   To offer a more complete understanding of what makes the Australians  our favorite cousins, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record chapter 30 from my book ``Six Months Off,'' written after our  time in Australia.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         Chapter 30--First Cousins         ``When a stranger from America steps ashore in Sydney . . .       the thing that strikes him is that it is an English city with       American trimmings.''--Mark Twain, Following the Equator        You would have thought the Sydney taxi driver, who was       English, was speaking of his barely grown-up stepchildren.        ``They hate the English, the Australians. Why? Because they       realize we're superior. Minute they find out you're from       England they've got a chip on their shoulder. It's the       convict thing--you know they came from convicts. It's the       darndest thing I've ever gotten myself into. I've been here       four years and now I've got a superiority complex.''        The taxi paused at the entrance to the harbor bridge, but       no one was waiting to take the toll. I had read in the       morning Herald how toll-takers were striking in support of       the postal workers, who had stopped carrying mail while they       bargained for a pay increase. We sped on across without       paying and the genealogy lesson continued. ``Master the       little quirks of living here and you know it's not a bad       place, but the Aussies still need convincing of the fact.       They'll find their own identity one day. Then they won't have       to come on so strong. Over the years England ruled a bit too       heavily here, but the Aussies are their own people now. They       don't have to always prove themselves to anybody, but they       do.''        The Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton Wentworth Hotel was       crowded with guests, black-tied and long-gowned for the       Australian-American Bicentennial Dinner. Honey and I found       our places and introduced ourselves and found that the other       ten who were dining with us at large round table number 27       were all Australian. We sat down and then were immediately       invited to rise so that the American ambassador could toast       the queen of Australia. The governor-general of Australia       responded with a toast to the president of the United States,       and we sat again.        ``He is the only man in Australia for whom everyone will       always stand,'' explained the lady on my right, as the       governor-general began speaking so gently that the raucous       table talk in the ballroom quieted.        ``It is a happy accident of fate that the Constitution of       the United States was being signed in 1787 just as our first       fleet was sailing eastward across the Atlantic from Rio to       Cape Town on the third leg of its ten-months long voyage. The       fleet carried a cargo of convicts who would have been on       their way to Georgia had not the American Revolution       succeeded and denied the British the opportunity to send       their prisoners to America.''        The lady on my right, who wore a white dress and dangling       gold earrings, whispered, ``It's the 'in' thing now, you       know, to trace back to see if your ancestors were on the       first fleet. A lot of people have always known they were       descended from lawbreakers, but very few had been willing to       spend money to prove it.''        The governor-general was proceeding toward a triumphant       conclusion. ``The links between our two nations have evolved       from earliest times. Out pioneers, like yours, were as       unlikely a band as one could conceive. Your gold rush spilled       into ours. Our constitution has been built on yours. Our       soldiers have died together and we have shared freedoms of       speech and of associations and of laws and of humanities and       of civil liberties--and now both of us are a melting pot. We       read your prose, we speak your poetry and watch your plays       and films. We even watch your terrible TV dramas!''        Applause and generous expressions of affection erupted all       around, and the governor-general smiled, cautiously       retreated, and sat, and Dame Leonie Kramer of the University       of Sydney rose and strode to the microphone and spoke       bluntly.        ``We are profoundly interested in one another, but we are       more profoundly ignorant. Americans, for example, are       enchanted that this is the land of the crocodiles but they       don't seem to have enough sense to stay out of the water when       they are here.''        Dame Leonie Kramer then sat, and our table plunged into       grilled fresh fish and boiled asparagus tips and hot       conversation.        The car dealer on my left said, ``When I was in America,       they thought we had roos hopping in the streets and crocs in       the swimming pools and abos behind the fences.'' His short-      cropped hair and narrow tie and innocent eagerness would have       made him a perfect candidate for the role of father in a       1950s American family television series.        His plumpish wife agreed. ``Most Americans can't find       Australia on the map, and even when they do you always have       to prove to them that it's as bi as the United States.''        Her husband laughed. ``One bloke coming to the America's       Cup almost went back when he found out Perth is as far from       Sydney as L.A. is from New York.''        A tanned young blond woman, sitting between the car dealer       and me, said, ``I was skiing in Denver once, was on the lift,       and an American man was in the next seat and he was trying to       come on to me, and so he asks me, `In Australia it's summer,       isn't it?,' and I say `Right.' And then in a minute he says,       `And what month is it in Australia?'''        The Australians especially enjoyed that, which encouraged       the blonde, who turned to me and asked, ``How do you like       Australia?'' She asked this in the same worried way       Californians used to question visiting New Yorkers.        I said, ``It's beautiful and friendly, but what surprises       me is how much like America it is. Sometimes I think I'm at a       family on another planet.''        The blonde said, ``It is another planet, orbiting in sight       of the big ones but never to be one.''        The plumpish wife of the car dealer agreed. ``We always       seem to be missing something.''        I said, ``But, for an American, coming to Australia is       almost better than going home again. When you try to go home       again it's a disappointment. It's only nearly perfect. But       when you come to Australia it's such a pleasant surprise how       nearly perfect it is.''        The car dealer said, ``I reckon everyone in America must       have heard about your family reunion. Three hundred thousand       of 'em coming this year. That's what the telly said.''        The lady in the white dress and earrings on my right asked,       ``Isn't Australia just the flavor-of-the-month in America?       Couldn't we just as well be Timbuktu?''        ``It's more than that,'' her thin and red-faced husband       said. He was a member of Parliament.        Honey, who was sitting on the right of the member of       Parliament, suggested, ``Some Americans come here looking for       `The America that Was.' ''        The M.P. said, ``Some of us hope America is the ``Australia       the Might Be.' ''        The car dealer leaned across the table and said to them,       ``And you'll both be disappointed. Australia's the land of       bushmen and sheepshearers and croc hunters in about the same       way America's the land of Hopalong Cassidy and the cowboys.''        His plumpish wife supported him. ``Crocodile Dundee's a       fairy tale, isn't that right? And America's not really like       Miami Vice.'' She didn't seem entirely sure.        I said, ``Sometimes we don't know so much about ourselves.       Sometimes we're visitors in our own countries.''        Waiters arrived with plates of an Australian dessert called       a Pavlova--whipped cream and fresh papaya in meringue shell--      and exclamations over its fluffiness only temporarily       diminished the conversation.        ``Well, we're mates, all right.'' The car dealer could not       tolerate a lull. ``The English may be our ancestors, but you       Americans are our cousins''.        ``First cousins,'' said the thin, red-faced member of       Parliament, whom I sensed correctly was preparing to make a       statement. ``We started out the same kind of people,       underprivileged, a long way from home, doing  [[Page S750]]       the same sort of thing, looking for a new life. Found a hard       life. Hoped it would be better for the children. Each wave of       new ones lifted up the last ones. A pioneering spirit in the       countryside here. In America, too.''        ``I love America!'' exclaimed the wife of the Australian       bicentennial chairman who was sitting across the table. Her       cheerful face had been hidden behind an enormous centerpiece       of flowers. ``When they sing `New York, New York' I get       excited with the best of 'em. It's our second home. It opens       your eyes a bit, doesn't it, to get out of your own       country.''        ``When you do, we look awfully small.'' The speaker was a       dour bald gentleman sitting next to her, who might have been       seventy, a plywood manufacturer who was rather obstructed by       the centerpiece. For the moment, he held the floor. ``Our GNP       is about the size of the GNP of Los Angeles.''        The blond woman said, ``Australia's a village, same names       always popping up.''        The plywood man said, ``Americans have got a head start and       size and location and better education, and they have more       self-confidence.''        This resonated with the blond woman's male guest, whose       name I never got in all the din and who now decided to talk       to me. ``We follow America. You regulate the stock market, so       we do it, too. You change school curriculum. We do it, too.       Don't think about it. Just do it.''        ``We'd have been better off to start with pilgrims and a       revolution, instead of convicts,'' said the plywood       manufacturer.        ``We could have used an Alamo,'' suggested the car dealer.       ``We had Gallipoli,'' said the blonde's friend.        ``Wouldn't it have been nice to have something in the       center besides a red desert?'' sighed the plywood man's wife.        The last of the fluffy Pavlova had been scraped from the       plates, and the coffee and mints arrived.        The young blond woman suddenly turned to me and insisted,       ``I reckon I ought to have a quarter of a vote every time you       elect a president. I should. After all, we sit here half our       time waiting for American to do something. Our prime minister       can't make a deal with Gorbachev. No one's wondering what       Australia's trade policy will be. We have to depend on you.''        ``We already do,'' said the member of Parliament. ``Do       what?'' asked the blonde.        ``Depend on America. For defense. For things we really       enjoy. Ask any of our school kids. I've done it. `Where would       you like to go on this planet?' and nine out of ten say,       `Disneyland.' The script for every Australian Tonight show       was prepared by an American until recently.''        The car dealer was saying to Honey, ``We never can have       anything like the things that you have in America. There're       not enough of us Aussies. Disneyland and interstate       highways--things that are ordinary to you--are a wonder to       us. Space stations. All the museums in Washington, D.C.''        ``Another reason we can't is what's happening on Pitt       Street,'' intoned the plywood manufacturer.        ``The esplanade work?''        ``The lack of it. Did you hear the workers complained about       passersby harassing them for leaning on their shovels? And       that yesterday the arbitration board awarded them a twenty-      seven-cent wage increase because of the harassment!''        The blond woman's date said, ``Watch them on MacQuarie       Street, at the restoration, the workers smearing suntan oil.       It would make a good frame for `still life.' I watched them       from my club window yesterday at lunch.''        The car dealer said, ``Sunday's Herald said United stewards       works twice as much as Qantas stewards.''        I said, ``You see that on flights to Tokyo. The same Qantas       crews going up on Monday and coming back on Thursday. And       last month the Bridgestone Tire Company president told me his       tire plants work three hundred forty-five days in Japan and       America, and the Bridgestone plant in Adelaide works only two       hundred ten.''        The plywood man looked positively funereal. ``We're       unusual, all right. We pay double time for afternoon work,       for overtime, for vacation. We pay for days off on a       butchers' picnic and a bakers' picnic--everybody has a picnic       and we pay for that. How are we going to compete with the       rest of the world when we're on a picnic?''        Now the men were enjoying long cigars and the ladies were       doing their best to survive the haze, and my watch said the       dinner had already lasted three hours.        Honey said. ``I see a lot of Japanese cars and American       fast foods, but I don't hear much proper English. Is it       because I'm American and just don't notice it?''        ``It's because we've changed,'' said a lady across the       table who up till now had been mostly listening. ``We moved       here in 1978. We decided Sydney winters were better than       English summers, so we sold our house in London. Then,       Australians still spoke of `going home' to England. Now, no       one talks about `going home.' Australianness is coming out       all round. We're more American, too, but mainly we're prouder       of being Australian.''        The wife of the member of Parliament said to Honey, ``Read       our children's books. I'll send you some for your children.       Instead of stories about English hobgoblins, there are more       about aborigine spirits and stories full of the sounds of       frogs croaking and of the didgeridoo, hostile and growling       like the bely of the earth.''        Honey said, ``The new Sheraton in Yulara was lovely, brown       like the desert and built like sails.''        The wife of the M.P. said, ``Our Australianness came out       all right when they tried to kill the brumbies in the Snowy       Mountains. Put a stop to that.''        Honey said, ``We've seen a lot of Australia in David       Williamson's plays and Mary Gilmore's poetry and Ken Done's       bright splashy painting . . .''        ``. . . and Fred Elliot's old marine watercolors even if he       was drunk a lot,'' I added.        The wife of the plywood manufacturer said, ``And I believe       we're learning that our harsh vast spaces and distance from       everyone sometimes can be a wonderful advantage.'' Those were       the first words she had uttered in nearly two hours.        From behind the centerpiece of flowers came the cheerful       contribution of the wife of the bicentennial chairman.       ``Eight hundred ten of our eight hundred thirty shires have       bicentennial committees.''        The member of Parliament added, ``At least now we toast the       queen of Australia instead of the empire.'' His wife, on my       right with white dress and earrings, asked me, ``Have you       tried the wichety grubs, the moth larvae the abos used to       eat? They're all the rage. Large and crispy and in all the       best restaurants.''        ``No,'' I said, ``but I have been to the beaches and I have       thought about those convicts who were laughing at the       aborigines standing there sandy and naked and greasy. Now,       the descendants of some of those first-fleet convicts are on       the same beaches, sandy and naked and greasy.''        The member of Parliament had arranged himself into speaking       position. ``Remember. The English left us. We didn't leave       them. They joined the Common Market. Gave us five years to       adjust our exports.''        This roused the car dealer, who said, ``It goes back to the       last war. Churchill said, `Let them have Australia. We'll win       it back.' Our boys were on the other side, fighting in North       Africa and in Europe and the Japanese were bombing Darwin       four times a day. The Americans saved us.''        His wife, who was finishing off his mints, too, agreed.       ``Two Christmases ago there were ten thousand American       sailors in Perth and some family took every one of `em home       for the holidays.''        The lights dimmed and the official bicentennial film began.       Trumpets heralded the arrival of the first fleet of       ``settlers'' on Australia's Identity Day, January 26, 1788,       and violins moved the story quickly along into the nineteenth       century, and then lingered amid the excitement of the gold       rush at Ballarat.        I whispered to the wife of the member of Parliament, ``It       didn't mention that the `settlers' were convicts.''        ``No worries,'' she said. ``The first bicentennial logo       forgot Tasmania. Had to make a new one. But it's a good       thing, our bicentennial. Helps us remember important       things.''                            ____________________     Reserving the right to object.    That would mean the chairman of the committee would  speak last.    I have no objection.    Mr. President, will you please let me know when 4  minutes has expired and then when 5 minutes has expired, and then I  will allocate to the Senator from South Carolina the last 2\1/2\  minutes.    Mr. President, I am voting for Betsy DeVos because she  will implement our law fixing No Child Left Behind the way we wrote  it--to reverse the trend to a national school board and restore control  to classroom teachers, to local school boards, to Governors, and  legislators--because she has been at the forefront of the most  important public school reform in the last 30 years--public charter  schools--and because she has worked tirelessly to give low-income  children more of the same kind of choices that wealthy families have.   Twenty-two Governors in this country support Betsy DeVos.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record their names,  including former Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor Mitt Romney, former  Governor John Engler, and 462 organizations and elected officials who  support Betsy DeVos for Education Secretary.

I wonder. We treated her just like we did President Obama's  Education Secretaries. She offered to meet with the Democrats in  December. They refused. She finally met with them in their offices.   Then she testified for 90 minutes longer than either of President  Obama's Education Secretaries before our committees.   Then there were followup questions. We asked President Obama's  Education Secretaries 53 and 56 questions; they asked her 1,400  questions. Then they met, and one of their Members announced that they  all agreed to vote against her before she had a chance to answer the  questions. What does that say about those questions?   She has conflicts of interest? We have a procedure for that, an  independent conflicts of interest office, the Office of Government  Ethics. The head was appointed by President Obama, confirmed by the  Senate. He has an agreement with every Cabinet member about conflicts  of interest. He wrote a letter to us 8 days before we voted on her and  said she would have no conflict of interest if she followed this  agreement.   So plenty of time for questions, no conflict of interest. What is the  problem?   One, her support for public charter schools. Some people don't like  that. But 2.7 million children attend them. They were founded by the  Democratic Farmer-Labor Party in Minnesota. They have now grown to  6,800 schools. They are the most effective public school reform in 30  years.   School choice. What is wrong with giving low-income Americans more  choice and better schools? We have done it since the GI bill from  1944--taxpayer money following veteran students to Notre Dame, Yeshiva,  Harvard, the National Auto Diesel College. Has it hurt the public  universities, of which I used to be President of one? It has helped  them. Then, more people went to private schools, and now more people go  to public colleges.   Betsy DeVos has committed to no more Washington mandates. No more  national school board, no Washington mandates for vouchers, no  Washington mandates for common core, no Washington mandates for  specific kinds of teacher evaluations with Betsy DeVos in charge of the  Department of Education.   One year ago, we had no Education Secretary. I asked President Obama  to appoint one, even though I knew he would appoint John King, with  whom I disagreed. I promised that if he did, we would promptly confirm  him, and we did. We asked him 53 questions, not 1,397. We didn't say he  had conflicts of interest when the Office of Government Ethics said he  did not.   I know my friends are surprised about the election, but wouldn't they  be really surprised if he appointed someone from within the education  establishment to be the Secretary of Education? Wouldn't you be  surprised that a Republican President would be for charter schools? Are  you really surprised that a Republican President has appointed an  Education Secretary who wants to give low-income children more choices  of schools? Are you surprised that a Republican President has nominated  an Education Secretary who wants to reverse the trend to a national  school board and restore local control?   I am supporting her because she wants to do that, because she has led  the most effective--    Thank you, Mr. President.   She has led the most effective public school reform movement over the  last 30 years and she has a commitment to help low-income children.   I would say to my Democratic colleagues, we confirmed President  Obama's first Education Secretary in 7 days--on the day he was  inaugurated; his second one in 3 weeks, just as we will Betsy DeVos  today. You may disagree with the new President, but the people elected  him, and I urge you to give the new Republican President the  opportunity to choose his own Education Secretary, just like we did  with the Democratic President 8 years ago and a year ago, even though  we disagreed just as much with their view on Federal policy on local  schools as you do with her policy and President Trump's policy on  school choice.    Mr. President, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
