 Madam Speaker, Americans everywhere are feeling the real  effects of inflation due to the Democrats' reckless spending spree.   Basic and time-tested economics show that more money in the  marketplace leads to inflation, especially when it is created by new  debt.   Families across the country are paying $10, $20, $30 more on  groceries each week. Gas prices are up nearly 50 percent.   Remember the ads for the $6 burger that used to be $3.99? You used to  see it on TV. Well, they are actually going to be $6 pretty soon the  way things are going.   Democrats claim that they are working for the American people. Their  policies are, in fact, hitting middle-class families hard. The American  people are noticing.   It is no coincidence that inflation has increased every month during  the Biden administration. They need to understand that all the money  they keep spending directly and negatively impacts real Americans.
