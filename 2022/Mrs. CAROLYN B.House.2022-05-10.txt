Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 224, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 5302 Galveston  Road in Houston, Texas, as the ``Vanessa Guillen Post Office  Building.''

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 700, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 303 East  Mississippi Avenue in Elwood, Illinois, as the ``Lawrence M. `Larry'  Walsh Sr. Post Office.''   Mr. Larry Walsh Sr. was an American farmer, public servant, and  dedicated member of the Will County community. In 1970, he began his  career in public service as a member of the Elwood School Board. He was  then elected as Jackson Township Supervisor in 1973, where he served  until December 2004. Mr. Walsh also served on the Will County Board in  1974 and 1992.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6386, to  designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at  450 West Schaumburg Road in Schaumburg, Illinois, as the ``Veterans of  Iraq and Afghanistan Memorial Post Office Building.''   Our nation's veterans do not sign up for a normal job. They enlist  knowing full well that they may be injured or killed in service to our  country.   Over the last 20 years of conflict, more than 2.3 million Americans  served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Of these service members, more than  6,800 were killed and tens of thousands more have suffered the scars  and trauma--both seen and unseen--of serving in combat.   It is our responsibly to remember and honor all of their sacrifices.   This bill will ensure that their service is never forgotten.   I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in honoring the brave men  and women who sacrificed so much over the last two decades serving our  country in Iraq and Afghanistan by supporting this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 6386.   I congratulate Mr. Krishnamoorthi on his excellent bill. I am  prepared to close. I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6614 to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4744 Grand  River Avenue in Detroit, Michigan, as the Rosa Louise McCauley Parks  Post Office Building.   Mrs. Rosa Louise McCauley Parks was born on February 4, 1913, in  Tuskegee, Alabama. She attended elementary school in Pine Level,  Alabama, and eventually went on to attend the Alabama State Teacher's  College High School. Unfortunately, she was not able to graduate with  her class due to the passing of her grandmother. Mrs. Parks further  delayed her education to take care of her family when her mother fell  ill. She eventually received her high school diploma in 1934 after  marrying Raymond Parks on December 18, 1932.   In the 1930s, Mrs. Parks was an early activist in the effort to free  the Scottsboro Boys. With her husband, Raymond, she worked as the  secretary and later the youth leader of the local branch of the NAACP.   Mrs. Parks' refusal to surrender her seat to a White male passenger  on a Montgomery, Alabama, bus on December 1, 1955, triggered a wave of  protests that reverberated throughout the United States. Her courageous  act changed America's view of Black people and redirected the course of  history.   After her arrest, Black people in Montgomery organized and promoted a  boycott of the city bus line that lasted 381 days. Inspired by the  Montgomery protests, other actions took shape in the form of sit-ins  and eat-ins to demand equal rights for all people.   From 1965 to 1988, Mrs. Parks worked for Congressman John Conyers'  staff as he represented what was then the First Congressional District  of Michigan.   In February 1987, she co-founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute  for Self Development with Ms. Elaine Eason Steele in honor of her late  husband Raymond. The goal of the institute was to motivate and empower  youth not targeted by other programs to achieve their highest  potential. Mrs. Parks saw the energy of young people as a real force  for change.   Mrs. Parks received more than 43 honorary doctorate degrees, hundreds  of plaques, certificates, citations, awards, and keys to many cities,  such as the NAACP Spingarn Medal, the UAW's Social Justice Award, the  Martin Luther King, Jr., Non-Violent Peace Prize, and the Congressional  Gold Medal in 1999.   In September of 1996, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of  Freedom by President Bill Clinton. In the State of Michigan, the first  Monday after February 4 has been designated as Mrs. Rosa Parks Day.   On October 24, 2005, Mrs. Parks peacefully passed away.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in honoring the  life of this great civil rights activist by naming the Post Office at  4744 Grand River Avenue in Detroit, Michigan, as the Rosa Louise  McCauley Parks Post Office Building.

Everyone in his family and community knew that Lance Corporal Tucker  chose a life of service, and his mother confirmed his commitment to the  U.S. military, saying he was a ``lifer.''   On June 7, Lance Corporal Tucker called his mother to let her know  about the timeline of his latest mission. Unfortunately, at 11 a.m.,  Ms. Bagwell recalls having a horrible headache, which she later learned  occurred at the time of her son's death.                                time  2300    I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of  Lance Corporal Tucker by naming the post office at 305 Highway 15 North  in Pontotoc, Mississippi, as the ``Lance Corporal Marc Lucas Tucker  Post Office Building''.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman  from South Carolina has no further speakers, I am prepared to close.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 209, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3508) to designate the facility of the United  States Postal Service located at 39 West Main Street, in Honeoye Falls,  New York, as the OCW4 Christian J. Koch Memorial Post Officeo.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3508         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CHRISTIAN KOCH MEMORIAL POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 39 West Main Street, in Honeoye Falls, New       York, shall be known and designated as the ``CW4 Christian J.

(b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``CW4 Christian J. Koch Memorial Post       Office''.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5  [[Page H4791]]  legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 3508 to designate the facility of the U.S.  Postal Service located at 39 West Main Street in Honeoye Falls, New  York, as the ``CW4 Christian J. Koch Memorial Post Office''.   Chief Warrant Officer Koch grew up in the York/Leicester area and was  a 1999 graduate of York Central School District. Before enlisting in  the National Guard Infantry in March of 2000, he studied mathematics at  Brockport State.   He graduated second in his basic training class with honors and was  immediately awarded a slot in Airborne School and assigned to the A  Company 1st Battalion 108th Infantry.   He was soon promoted to E5 and given a slot in Air Assault School, a  distinct honor. In 2004, Chief Warrant Officer Koch was accepted into  Warrant Officer School and went on to attend flight school and graduate  in 2008. He was then deployed to Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom  from 2008 to 2009, where he flew supplies and personnel.   Throughout his training and Active Duty, he served as an honor guard  for veterans' funerals, participated in Veterans Day ceremonies, and  had his unit featured in the Geneseo Warplane Museum. In addition, he  participated in Operation Noble Eagle, guarding the northern border and  the Ginna Nuclear Power Plant following the tragedy of 9/11.   Sadly, on January 20, 2021, Chief Warrant Officer Koch lost his life  during a training mission with the New York State National Guard. He is  survived by his wife and four children.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in honoring Christian's legacy  by naming the post office at 39 West Main Street in Honeoye Falls, New  York, as the ``CW4 Christian J. Koch Memorial Post Office''.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 3508, and I yield back the balance of my time.
