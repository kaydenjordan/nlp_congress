 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, which was originally about NASA and went  through the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, has seen more  than 700 pages of election law tacked onto it just late last night. If  it were to become law, it would give up to $7.2 million of public  funding to the campaigns of each one of my colleagues, all of us. This  is not about voting rights. This is about power and control.   Mr. Speaker, $7.2 million is more money than most Americans can even  dream of having. Yet, here we are considering another Democrat bill  that takes public funding and, instead of giving it to the American  people, puts it in the campaign coffers of Members of Congress. Members  who vote for this bill are voting to line their own campaign coffers,  all while falsely telling the American people that we have a voting  rights crisis in this country and that we must pass this bill because  the era of Jim Crow 2.0 is upon us.   It is the definition of corruption.   Thankfully, the American people don't seem to be buying the  Democrats' rhetoric. According to polling, more Americans, including  Independents, believe voting laws are too lax and insecure than those  who believe voting laws are too restrictive.   No matter how many times the President and other Democrats get up in  front of the American people and try to manufacture a voting rights  crisis in this country by using rhetoric like Jim Crow 2.0 or now  comparing Republicans to Democrat-elected segregationist Bull Connor,  as President Biden suggested this week in Georgia, there is still no  evidence of widespread voter suppression.   In our hearings in the House Administration Committee over the last 3  years, no one has ever produced a single voter who was eligible to vote  but wasn't able to. In fact, 2020 saw the highest voter turnout in 120  years, and, according to Pew, 94 percent of Americans say it is easy to  vote.   Misrepresenting and, in some cases, flat-out lying about the laws  States have passed to increase voter confidence in our elections is  also part of the Democrats' playbook to manufacture a voting rights  crisis. In fact, President Biden has earned four Pinocchios for his  false claims about Georgia's voting laws. The laws these States are  passing to bolster voter confidence make it easier to vote than ever  before while protecting the integrity of our elections.  [[Page H157]]    Georgia's new ``voter suppression law'' has more days of early, in- person voting than New York, and Texas' ``voter suppression law'' ends  pandemic exceptions like universal drive-thru voting and 24-hour  voting. Neither existed in Texas before 2020. Neither widely exists  even in blue States. I think most of us can agree that nothing good can  come from 24-hour, drive-thru voting.   The bill we are considering today is not about increasing voting  rights for the American people, and this is not a compromise. This bill  still contains the worst provisions of H.R. 1.   It still publicly funds Members' campaigns; nationalizes and  centralizes our election system; makes Merrick Garland the election  czar; puts unelected bureaucrats in charge of States' voting laws,  instead of the American people; destroys the First Amendment; weakens  States' ability to maintain accurate voter rolls; prevents States from  implementing strict voter ID laws, despite the majority of Americans  supporting voter ID laws; and the list goes on and on.   As terrible as those provisions are, nothing screams this bill isn't  for the American people more than the fact that it gives every one of  us, every Member of Congress and their own campaigns, up to $7.2  million in public funding. The old saying is: Follow the money. I think  that is incredibly relevant here.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, defending democracy $7.2  million at a time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Steil), a member of the House Administration Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), my good friend and the ranking  member on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining  on both sides?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney), the founder of the Election  Integrity Caucus and my good friend.  [[Page H158]]         Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record  the Committee on House Administration Republicans' ``Elections Clause''  report.                                          House of Representatives,                               Committee on House Administration,                                    Washington, DC, August 12, 2021.      Rep. Rodney Davis, Ranking Member  Report--The Elections Clause: States' Primary Constitutional Authority                               Over Elections                              Executive Summary         Republicans believe that every eligible voter who wants to       vote must be able to do so, and all lawful votes must be       counted according to state law. Through an examination of       history, precedent, the Framers' words, debates concerning       ratification, the Supreme Court, and the Constitution itself,       this document explains the constitutional division of power       envisioned by the Framers between the States and the federal       government with respect to election administration. Article       1, Section 4 of the Constitution explains that the States       have the primary authority over election administration, the       ``times, places, and manner of holding elections''.       Conversely, the Constitution grants the Congress a purely       secondary role to alter or create election laws only in the       extreme cases of invasion, legislative neglect, or obstinate       refusal to pass election laws. As do other aspects of our       federal system, this division of sovereignty continues to       serve to protect one of Americans' most precious freedoms,       the right to vote.        The Constitution reserves to the States the primary       authority to set election legislation and administer       elections--the ``times, places, and manner of holding of       elections'' and Congress' power in this space is purely       second to the States' power. Congress' power is to be       employed only in the direst of circumstances. Despite       Democrats' insistence that Congress' power over elections is       unfettered and permits Congress to enact sweeping legislation       like H.R. 1, it is simply not true. History, precedent, the       Framers' words, debates concerning ratification, the Supreme       Court, and the Constitution itself make this exceedingly       clear.        The Framing Generation grappled with the failure of the       Articles of Confederation, which provided for only a weak       national government incapable of preserving the Union. Under       the Articles, the States had exclusive authority over federal       elections held within their territory. but, given the       difficulties the national government had experienced with       State cooperation (e.g., the failure of Rhode Island to send       delegates to the Confederation Congress); the Federalists,       including Alexander Hamilton, were concerned with the       possibility that the States, in an effort to destroy the       federal government, simply might not hold elections or that       an emergency, such as an invasion or insurrection, might       prevent the operation of a State's government, leaving the       Congress without Members and the federal government unable to       respond. Indeed, as counsel for the Democrat Members of our       Committee so keenly observed:        For the Founders, particularly during the Federal       Constitutional Convention, the primary concern was informing       the discussions of federal elections in Article I was the       risk of uncooperative states. For example, Alexander Hamilton       noted that by providing states the authority to run       congressional elections, under Article I, Section 4,       ``risk[ed] `leaving the existence of the Union entirely at       their mercy.' '' Following the failings of the Articles of       Confederation, the Founders looked for processes that would       insulate Congress from recalcitrant states. Indeed, ``[t]he       dominant purpose of the Elections Clause, the historical       record bears out, was to empower Congress to override state       election rules, not to restrict the way States enact       legislation[,]'' and that ``the Clause `was the Framers'       insurance against the possibility that a State would refuse       to provide for the election of representatives to the       Federal Congress.' ''.        Quite plainly, Alexander Hamilton, a leading Federalist and       proponent of our Constitution, understood the Elections       Clause as serving only as a sort of emergency fail-safe, not       as a cudgel used to nationalize our elections process.       Writing as Publius to the people of New York, Hamilton       further expounds on the correct understanding of the       Elections Clause: ``T[he] natural order of the subject leads       us to consider, in this place, that provision of the       Constitution which authorizes the national legislature to       regulate, in the last resort, the election of its own       members.''        When questioned at the States' constitutional ratifying       conventions with respect to this provision, the Federalists       confirmed this understanding of a constitutionally limited,       secondary congressional power under Article 1, Section 4:      Maryland:        Convention delegate James McHenry added that the risk to       the federal government [without a fail-safe provision] might       not arise from state malice: An insurrection or rebellion       might prevent a state legislature from administering an       election.      North Carolina:        An occasion may arise when the exercise of this ultimate       power of Congress may be necessary . . . a state should be       involved in war, and its legislature could not assemble, (as       was the case of South Carolina and occasionally of some other       states, during the [Revolutionary] war).      Pennsylvania:        Sir, let it be remembered that this power can only operate       in a case of necessity, after the factious or listless       disposition of a particular state has rendered an       interference essential to the salvation of the general       government.        John Jay made similar claims in New York. And, as       constitutional scholar Robert Natelson, notes in his       invaluable article, The Original Scope of the Congressional       Power to Regulate Elections, Alexander Contee Hanson, a       member of Congress whose pamphlet supporting the Constitution       proved popular, stated flatly that Congress would exercise       its times, places, and manner authority only in cases of       invasion, legislative neglect or obstinate refusal to pass       election laws [providing for the election of Members of       Congress], or if a state crafted its election laws with a       `sinister purpose' or to injure the general government.''        Cementing his point, Hanson goes further to decree, ``The       exercise of this power must at all times be so very       invidious, that congress will not venture upon it without       some very cogent and substantial reason.'' In Floor debate       during the 117th Congress concerning H.R. 1, the Democrats'       intended nationalization of elections, Ranking Member Davis       argued, as he has many other times, that:        According to Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution,       States have the primary role in establishing ``[t]he Times,       Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and       Representatives.'' Under the Constitution, Congress has a       purely secondary role in this space and must restrain itself       from acting improperly and unconstitutionally. Federal       election legislation should never be the  [[Page H159]]       first step and must never impose burdensome, unfunded federal       mandates on state and local elections officials. When       Congress does speak, it must devote its efforts only to       resolving highly significant and substantial deficiencies.       State legislatures are the primary venues to correct most       issues.        In fact, had the Democrats' view of the Elections Clause       been accepted at the time of the Constitution's drafting--      that is, that it offers Congress unfettered power over       federal elections--it is likely that the Constitution would       not have been ratified or that an amendment to this language       would have been required. Indeed, at least seven of the       original 13 states--over half and enough to prevent the       Constitution from being ratified--expressd specific concerns       with the language of the Elections Clause. However,       ``[l]eading Federalists . . . assured them, . . . that, even       without amendment, the [Elections] Clause should be construed       as limited to emergencies.''        Three states, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island,       specifically made their ratification contingent on this       understanding being made express:      New York:        Under these impressions and declaring that the rights       aforesaid cannot be abridged or violated, and the       Explanations aforesaid are consistent with the said       Constitution, And in confidence that the Amendments which       have been proposed to the said Constitution will receive       early and mature Consideration: We the said Delegates, in the       Name and in [sic] the behalf of the People of the State of       New York Do by these presents Assent to and Ratify the said       Constitution. In full Confidence . . . that the Congress will       not make or alter any Regulation in this State respecting the       times places and manner of holding Elections for Senators or       Representatives unless the Legislature of this State shall       neglect or refuse to make laws or regulations for the       purpose, or from any circumstance be incapable of making the       same, and that in those cases such power will only be       exercised until the Legislature of this State shall make       provision in the Premises[.]      North Carolina:        That Congress shall not alter, modify, or interfere in the       times, places, or manner of holding elections for senators       and representatives, or either of them, except when the       legislature of any state shall neglect, refuse or be disabled       by invasion or rebellion, to prescribe the same.      Rhode Island:        Under these impressions, and declaring, that the rights       aforesaid cannot be abridged or violated, and that the       explanations aforesaid, are consistent with the said       constitution, and in confidence that the amendments hereafter       mentioned, will receive an early and mature consideration,       and conformably to the fifth article of said constitution,       speedily become a part thereof; We the said delegates, in the       name, and in [sic] the behalf of the People, of the State       of Rhode-Island and Providence-Plantations, do by these       Presents, assent to, and ratify the said Constitution. In       full confidence . . . That the Congress will not make or       alter any regulation in this State, respecting the times,       places and manner of holding elections for senators and       representatives, unless the legislature of this state       shall neglect, or refuse to make laws or regulations for       the purpose, or from any circumstance be incapable of       making the same; and that [i]n those cases, such power       will only be exercised, until the legislature of this       State shall make provision in the Premises[.]        This clearly demonstrates that the Framers designed and the       ratifying States understood the Elections Clause to serve       solely as a protective backstop to ensure the preservation of       the Federal Government, not as a font of limitless power for       Congress to wrest control of federal elections from the       States.        This understanding was also reinforced by debate during the       first Congress that convened under the Constitution. ``During       the first session of the First Congress . . . Representative       Aedanus Burke unsuccessfully proposed a constitutional       amendment to limit the Times, Places and Manner Clause to       emergencies. But those on both sides of the Burke amendment       debate already understood the Elections Clause to limit       Federal elections power to emergencies.        For example, the recorded description of opponent       Representative Goodhue's comments notes that he believed the       Elections Clause as written was intended to prevent ``. . .       the State Governments [from] oppos[ing] and thwart[ing] the       general one to such a degree as finally to overturn it. Now,       to guard against this evil, he wished the Federal Government       to possess every power necessary to its existence.'' With any       change to the original text therefore unnecessary to achieve       Burke's desired goal, Mr. Goodhue voted against the proposed       amendment.        Similarly, proponent Representative Smith of South Carolina       also believed the original text of the Elections Clause       already limited the Federal Government's power over federal       elections to emergencies and so thought there would be no       harm in supporting an amendment to make that language       express. So, even the records of the First Congress reflect a       recognition of the emergency nature of congressional power       over federal elections.        Similarly, the Supreme Court has supported this       understanding. In Smiley v. Holm, the Court held that Article       1, Section 4 of the Constitution reserved to the States the       primary authority to provide a complete code for       congressional elections, not only as to times and places, but       in relation to notices, registration, supervision of voting,       protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt       practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and       canvassers, and making and publication of election returns;       in short, to enact the numerous requirements as to procedure       and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order       to enforce the fundamental right involved. And these       requirements would be nugatory if they did not have       appropriate sanctions in the definition of offenses and       punishments. All this is comprised in the subject of ``times,       places and manner of holding elections,'' and involves       lawmaking in its essential features and most important       aspect.        This holding, of course, is consistent with the       understanding of the Elections Clause since the framing of       the Constitution. The Smiley Court also held that while       Congress maintains the authority to . . . supplement these       state regulations or [to] substitute its own[]'', such       authority remains merely `` `a general supervisory power over       the whole subject.' '' More recently, the Court noted in       Arizona v. Inter-Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc. that ``[t]his       grant of congressional power [that is, the fail-safe       provision in the Elections Clause] was the Framers' insurance       against the possibility that a State would refuse to provide       for the election of representatives to the Federal       Congress.'' The Court explained that the Elections Clause ``.       . . imposes [upon the States] the duty . . . to prescribe the       time, place, and manner of electing Representatives and       Senators[.]'' And, while, as the Court noted, ``[t]he power       of Congress over the `Times, Places and Manner' of       congressional elections `is paramount, and may be exercised       at any time, and to any extent which it deems expedient; and       so far as it is exercised, and no farther, the regulations       effected supersede those of the State which are inconsistent       therewith[]'', the Inter-Tribal Court explained, quoting       extensively from The Federalist no. 59, that it was clear       that the congressional fail-safe included in the Elections       Clause was intended for the sorts of governmental self-      preservation discussed in this Report: ``[E]very government       ought to contain in itself the means of its own       preservation[.]''; ``[A]n exclusive power of regulating       elections for the national government, in the hands of the       State legislatures, would leave the existence of the Union       entirely at their mercy. They could at any moment annihilate       it by neglecting to provide for the choice of persons to       administer its affairs.''                                  CONCLUSION         It is clear in every respect that the congressional fail-      safe described in the Elections Clause vests purely secondary       authority over federal elections in the federal legislative       branch and that the primary authority rests with the States.       Congressional authority is intended to be, and as a matter of       constitutional fact is, limited to addressing the worst       imaginable issues, such as invasion or other matters that       might lead to a State not electing representatives to       constitute the two Houses of Congress. Our authority has       never extended to the day-to-day authority over the ``Times,       Places and Manner of Election'' that the Constitution clearly       reserves to the States. Unfortunately for Democrats, this       clear restriction on congressional authority means that we do       not have the power to implement the overwhelming majority--if       not the entirety--of their biggest legislative priority, H.R.       1 and related legislation, which would purport to nationalize       our elections and centralize their administration in       Washington, D.C. Thankfully, the Framers had the foresight to       write our Constitution so as to prevent those bad policies       from going into effect and preserve the health of our       republic.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a  report by Common Cause that is titled: ``Maryland General Assembly  Approves Gerrymandered Congressional Map.''               [From the Common Cause Maryland, Dec. 8, 2021]     Maryland General Assembly Approves Gerrymandered Congressional Map         Today, the Maryland General Assembly passed HB 1--the       congressional districting plan adopted by the Legislative       Redistricting Advisory Commission (LRAC). The map is now       headed to Governor Hogan's desk.    Statement of Joanne Antoine, Common Cause Maryland Executive Director         When the redistricting process is led by politicians, the       maps will be drawn to benefit the politicians--and that's       exactly what state legislators have done today.        While we were encouraged by the General Assembly's       willingness to improve transparency and access throughout the       process in comparison to the 2011 redistricting cycle, they       have chosen to maintain the status quo.        They had an opportunity to do what's in the best interest       of Marylanders for the next decade and have chosen, yet       again, to wait on a national solution. While I'm not       surprised, I am disappointed.        Thank you to public for making their voices heard and       Delegate Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery) for taking a stand       against partisan gerrymandering here in Maryland and       nationwide by being the lone Democratic vote against the       congressional map.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, you can tell it must be  NFL playoffs, as I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Owens), my good friend and our Super Bowl champion from the Oakland  Raiders.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), the ranking member of the House  Judiciary Committee and my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Donalds).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald).    I reserve the balance of my time, Mr.  Speaker.                                time  1030     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  Georgia an additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that  reminder.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the State of  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    I reserve the balance of my time, Madam  Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    The gentleman is also my friend. I  appreciate it. I enjoyed the debate and, Madam Speaker, I am prepared  to close, if I may.   Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   It is friendships like this with Mr. Butterfield, that I look around  this Chamber and I think we, as Americans, should be celebrating what  America is doing right. Look at the diversity of who serves here in the  U.S. House of Representatives.   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was necessary to stop discrimination,  and it has worked.   But make no mistake, today's bill is not a voting rights bill.  Today's bill, unfortunately, is a bill that leads to lining your own  campaign coffers with public funds.   Now, Speaker Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, was here on the floor  today. And no matter how many times she says it, that there are no  taxpayer funds, it doesn't make it true.   Let me go through it. What happened is, the original H.R. 1 when  proposed last Congress did have taxpayer funding of political  campaigns, our own campaigns. But now they take the first ever  corporate money, through corporate fines. They put it into the  Department of the Treasury's laundering machine, and it comes out as  part of the Department of the Treasury. Those are not public funds.   Does that mean when you send your check to pay your taxes and it goes  to the Department of the Treasury, that those aren't public funds?   Every single person who votes ``yes'' for this bill that is not a  voting rights bill is voting to line their own campaign pockets. That  is not what the American people want.   Ninety-four percent of Americans said it is easy to vote. We have  asked, time and time again, give me one person to show up at a hearing  that said that they wanted to vote in the last election and couldn't,  not one person has walked through that door. Not one person has showed  up on a Zoom call, not one person.   Why in the world do we continue to try to gaslight the American  people into thinking that this is about voting rights? This is not  about voting rights. This about lining your own campaign coffers.   This is about breaking a tradition in the Senate. This is about  taking over and winning elections for one side over the other.   Vote ``no'' on this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.
