 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Since this bill was marked up in the last Congress, the very same  plausibility standard used in this bill was adopted by the Federal  Circuit Court of Appeals in which fraudulent joinder cases arise with  the greatest frequency.   Last Congress, Ranking Member Conyers said of the bill, it should  simply pick one of the existing articulations in the fraudulent joinder  standard and codify that into law. At the time, the plausibility  approach was applied by some district courts, but just last year, the  Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals adopted the same plausibility standard  this bill contains in a case called International Energy.   The Fifth Circuit stated: We must consider whether the plaintiff  pleaded ``enough facts to state a claim to relieve that is plausible on  its face.'' The plaintiff in that case petitioned for rehearing en  banc, but the rehearing was denied, with not a single judge on the  Fifth Circuit requesting a vote.   In just the last year, district courts in the Fifth Circuit have  issued more than 40 fraudulent joinder decisions without much  difficulty and with the results that indicate just the sort of  reasonable reform that would occur nationwide when we get this bill  passed into law.   So this is about making the system work and opening the door to the  Federal courts so companies from foreign states are not unfairly,  potentially disadvantaged.   The other piece of this that is easy to neglect is the local  defendant. I don't know if the gentleman across the aisle has ever been  sued. I have friends who have been sued. It is an emotionally and  financially devastating procedure. You have got to take time off from  your life and business to defend it. You have got to hire a lawyer,  which is incredibly expensive. This is to protect the innocent third  parties and open the doors to the Federal courts and just make it  fairer and easier.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this bill is not about protecting big corporations.  This bill is about protecting the small-business owner or the employee  who is fraudulently joined into a case who has to go out and hire his  or her own lawyer.   I remember something my law school professor once told me back in the  day at St. Mary's University School of Law in San Antonio, Texas, and  it stuck in my mind ever since: When you get sued, you may be able to  beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.   It is expensive, it is emotionally draining, and it is time  consuming.   I have no problem at all, and this bill is not designed to protect  corporations. It is designed to protect, just as its name states,  innocent parties. These are people who are joined solely to defeat  diversity jurisdiction. We are just changing the standard slightly to  one adopted by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to make it much more  fair to these innocent parties.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in the gentleman from Georgia's  example, this bill wouldn't apply at all. If my grandmother were  assaulted in a nursing home, I would certainly sue the nursing home  company. I would also join the person who actually did it who most  likely definitely will be a resident of the State that the lawsuit was  going in. There would clearly be a plausible cause of action against  that tortfeasor.   Mr. Chairman, I didn't practice personal injury law. I was an  agriculture lawyer. But this would be an easy case for me to prove in  his example. We are not trying to protect anybody who has done  something wrong. We are trying to protect people who are joined into a  lawsuit solely for the purpose of forum shopping.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, this really is about trying to stop bringing phony  cases in. You are bringing phony defendants in, and that is what we are  trying to stop. We have got to be fair about this.   It is not often that we have the opportunity to protect innocent  local folks and businesses from costly and meritless lawsuits. This is  an opportunity to rein in forum shopping and abuses by trial lawyers  and hold them to a good faith standard in litigation. We can do that by  passing a bill that is just a few pages long. That is the opportunity  we have today.   All this bill does--all this bill does--is say that innocent, local  parties--mostly small businesses--can't be added to a lawsuit for forum  shopping purposes, and it only prohibits this when there is no  plausible case against these small businesses or the case against them  isn't brought in good faith.   Who could argue with that?   Mr. Chairman, for that reason, I urge all my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment should be roundly  opposed for the simple reason it doesn't protect any victims, but it  also victimizes local parties in the types of cases covered by the  amendment.   The purpose of the underlying bill is to allow judges greater  discretion to free innocent local parties--that is, innocent people and  innocent small businesses--from lawsuits when those innocent local  parties are dragged into a case solely because a plaintiff's attorney  wants to do some forum shopping.   These innocent local parties have, at most, an attenuated connection  to the claims made by the trial lawyer against some national company a  thousand miles away. These innocent local parties shouldn't have to  suffer the time, expense, and emotional drain of a lawsuit when the  plaintiff can't even come up with a plausible claim. The base bill  protects these innocent local parties from being dragged into a lawsuit  as a party just to keep the case in State court.   Now, let's bring in this amendment, which denies the bill's  protection to innocent local parties adjoined to a lawsuit simply  because the legal allegations in the case fall into one arbitrary  category and that one is in another. It is terribly unfair.   This amendment would allow these things to happen to innocent people  in the name of allowing trial lawyers to scuttle the hydraulic fracking  industry through lawsuits. Innocent people are innocent people, and  they should be protected against being dragged into lawsuits regardless  of the nature of the case.   This doesn't deny anybody access to the courts. It protects innocent  parties from being dragged into a case for forum shopping.   Every single one of the gentleman's cases will be heard in court.  They will have their day in court and they will have justice based on  the facts.   This bill does not protect wrongdoing corporations. This bill  protects people who are dragged into a lawsuit strictly for procedural  purposes.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am not going to get sucked into a  debate of hydraulic fracking. Being from Texas, we might have a whole  difference of opinion on that.   But I do want to point out, with respect to this bill, it doesn't  deny anyone access to courts, it doesn't deny anyone access to justice  regardless of what claim. I don't think it is fair we take out one  particular claim or not one particular claim. That seems to go against  fundamental fairness as well.   This bill is all about fairness. It is about fairness to keep people  from being dragged into court solely because a plaintiff's attorney  needs a local defendant to avoid diversity jurisdiction.   I oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment and support the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment continues to victimize  innocent local parties just because they happen to be in an insurance  case.   The underlying bill is designed to protect folks from being dragged  into a lawsuit just to facilitate forum shopping by plaintiffs'  attorneys.   The purpose of this bill is to allow judges greater discretion to  free these innocent local parties. They are the ones that are suffering  as a result of this.   This amendment denies the bill's protection to innocent local parties  joined to a lawsuit simply because the legal allegations in the case  fall into one arbitrary category rather than another, just like the  previous amendment. It is terribly unfair. Innocent people are innocent  people, and they should be protected from being dragged into a lawsuit  regardless of the nature of the case.   The rules we have developed in this great country to protect the  innocent are rules of general application, such as the rules protecting  people's rights to have their side of the story told and the rules  protecting people from biased or inaccurate testimony.   We should all be appalled by the suggestion that these general  protections designed to protect innocent people from criminal liability  should be suspended because the case is one of assault and battery or  murder or somehow relates to insurance. It is the same kind of logic.                                time  1545    Our country is rightfully proud of its principles providing due  process and equal protection, but these concepts are meaningless if  they are only selectively applied to some type of cases and not others.  And for the same reason, we should all be outraged at the suggestion  that the rules of fairness, designed to protect the innocent, should be  suspended in civil law cases because a case involves one particular  subject matter or another. But that is exactly what this misguided  amendment does.   This amendment would allow a plaintiff's lawyer to drag an individual  insurance adjuster into a lawsuit even when the applicable State law  makes it absolutely clear that only insurers, not individual people,  are subject to bad faith claims. How does the sponsor explain this to a  person like Jack Stout, why a lawyer pulled him into a bad faith  lawsuit targeting State Farm? Mr. Stout was a local insurance agent who  merely sold a policy to the plaintiff, met and spoke with the plaintiff  once, and had nothing to do with processing the plaintiff's homeowner's  insurance claim. A Federal District Court in Oklahoma found he was  fraudulently joined and dismissed the claim against him, but under this  amendment, the innocent person would have been stuck back in the  lawsuit.   What about a person like Douglas Bradley, where the plaintiff's  lawyer named him as a defendant in a bad faith lawsuit against an  insurer? In that case, the complaint included Mr. Bradley, an insurance  agent, as a defendant in the caption of the case. It referred to  defendant, singular, not defendants. Throughout the entire pleadings,  it didn't even mention his name. A Federal District Court in Indiana  dismissed this claim against him as fraudulently joined, but under this  amendment, this innocent person would have been stuck back in the  lawsuit. It is not fair, it is expensive, and it is emotionally  draining to these innocent parties.   For that reason, I urge opposition to the amendment and support of  the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Nunes) having assumed the chair, Mr. Simpson, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 725) to  amend title 28, United States Code, to prevent fraudulent joinder, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials to H.R. 985.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, recently an independent research firm surveyed  companies in 26 countries and found that 80 percent of those companies  that were subject to class action lawsuits were U.S. companies, putting  those U.S. companies at a distinct economic disadvantage when competing  with companies worldwide.   But the problem of overbroad class action doesn't just affect U.S.  companies. It affects consumers in the United States who are forced  into lawsuits they don't want to be in. How do we know that? We know  that because the median rate at which consumer class action members  take the compensation offered in a settlement is incredibly low. That  would be 0.023 percent. That is two-hundredths of a percent. That is  right, only the tiniest fraction of consumer class action members  bother to claim the compensation awarded them in a settlement. That is  clear proof that vastly large numbers of class members are satisfied  with the products they purchase, don't want compensation, and don't  want to be lumped into a ginormous class action lawsuit.   Federal judges are crying out for Congress to reform the class action  lawsuit system, which currently allows trial lawyers to fill classes  with hundreds and thousands of unmeritorious claims and use those  artificially inflated claims to force defendants to settle the case.  Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has recognized that ``A court's  decision to certify a class . . . places pressure on the defendant to  settle even unmeritorious claims.''   Judge Diane Wood of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, appointed  by President Clinton, has explained that class certification ``is, in  effect, the whole case.'' And as one appeals court judge, nominated by  President Obama, wrote in his dissent in a recent class action case,  ``The chief difficulty we confront in this case arises from the fact  that some of the members of the class have not suffered the . . .  injury upon which this entire case is predicated and that could  constitute as many as 24,000 consumers who would have no valid claim  against the defendants under the state laws even if the named  plaintiffs win on the merits.''   He went on to chastise the other judges who allowed the class action  to proceed, writing ``if the district court does not identify a culling  method to ensure that the class, by judgment, includes only members who  were actually injured, this court has no business simply hoping that  one will work.''   The purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of  evaluating similar, meritorious claims, not to provide a way for  lawyers to artificially inflate the size of a class to extort a larger  settlement fee for themselves, siphoning money away from those actually  injured, and increasing prices for everyone.   Just look at an accounting of recent class action settlements. The  SUBWAY food chain was sued in a class action because trial lawyers  complained their foot-long subs weren't a full foot long. As part of  the settlement, small amounts were paid to the 10 class  representatives, but the millions of other class members received  nothing; not a dime, not a sandwich. Meanwhile, the lawyers were  awarded $520,000 in fees. The settlement was appealed, and during oral  arguments Judge Diane Sykes remarked that ``A class action that seeks  only worthless benefits for the class should be dismissed out of hand.  That's what should have happened here. . . . This is a racket.''    The Coca-Cola Company was sued in a class action lawsuit involving  Vitaminwater. Class members received zero dollars in the settlement.  The lawyers were awarded $1.2 million in fees.   In a case involving Facebook, the company agreed to settle the case  by paying class counsel $3 million. Zero dollars were paid to class  members. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the deal, but in a withering  dissent, Judge Kleinfeld observed that ``Facebook users who had  suffered damages . . . got no money, not a nickel, from the defendants.  Class counsel, on the other hand, got millions.''   This bill includes several reforms. It prevents people from being  forced into a class with other uninjured or minimally injured class  members, only to have the compensation of injured parties reduced. It  prevents trial lawyers from using incestuous, litigation-factory  arrangements to gin up lawsuits. It requires courts to use objective  criteria in determining who is injured in a class action and how  compensation will actually reach the victims. It requires that injured  victims get paid first, before the lawyers, and that lawyer fees be  limited to a reasonable percentage of the money received by victims.   It requires judges to itemize exactly who gets what in a class action  settlement and who is paying and controlling the lawyers. It requires  all the rules governing class action be followed, that expensive  pretrial proceedings be put on hold while the court determines if the  case can't meet class certification requirements, and allows appeals of  those class certification orders so justice can be done faster.   It ensures lawyers don't add plaintiffs just for forum shopping  purposes, and it requires the verification of allegations in  multidistrict pretrial proceedings, ensuring defendants receive due  process while plaintiffs, not lawyers, get the benefits of any cost  savings achieved by the multidistrict pretrial process.   H.R. 985 also contains provisions to include much-needed transparency  into the asbestos bankruptcy trust system. On too frequent an occasion,  by the time asbestos victims assert their claims for compensation, the  bankruptcy trust formed for their benefit has been diluted by  fraudulent claims, leaving these victims without their entitled  recovery.   The reason that fraud is allowed to exist within the asbestos trust  system is the excessive lack of transparency created by plaintiffs'  firms. The predictable result of this reduced transparency has been a  growing wave of claims and reports of fraud.   This bill strikes the proper balance of transparency and preserving  the dignity and medical privacy of asbestos victims while also  minimizing the administrative impact on the asbestos trusts. This bill  saves the money in these trusts, which is a limited amount of money, to  make sure future claimants, many of whom are veterans, have the  opportunity to seek and receive compensation for their injuries and  prevent double-dipping and fraud.   Please join me in supporting this bill on behalf of consumers and  injured parties everywhere.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out to my colleague across the  aisle that over the past several Congresses, we have had multiple  hearings on class action reform and asbestos trust litigation, all of  which are easily and publicly available.   I further would like to go on to say this bill doesn't prevent any  claim from being brought as a class action--zero, zip, none. All it  does is maximize the recovery of the victims.   Under this bill, a class action lawyer's fees are pegged to a  reasonable percentage of the money actually received by the client  under the settlement. What that will do is incentivize lawyers to make  the maximum amount available to their clients, to seek the maximum  recovery for their client.   Under this bill, class action lawyers will no longer be able to agree  to settlements that give them millions of dollars and get their clients  absolutely nothing, or maybe a coupon, if they are lucky.   Under this bill, a class action lawyer will get more in fees as long  as they agree to a settlement that actually means that their clients,  the actual plaintiffs, are getting a reasonable amount of money.  Imagine that: incentivizing lawyers to do the best work for their  clients. That is what this bill does.   I would also like to talk for a second about the asbestos portion of  this. I have to say that this is a little troubling for me. The  disclosure requirements in the FACT Act portion of this bill requires  less than would be required in a State court pleading for damages. It  is the minimum amount of information necessary to make sure somebody  isn't double-dipping. It specifically protects medical records and  social security numbers. It is designed as a fraud prevention tool.   The argument that this is designed to protect companies that  manufactured asbestos is flawed. This is designed for the asbestos  trust--companies that have gone bankrupt and set aside large amounts of  money to be paid to the victims of asbestos. This protects the assets  in those trusts, not the tortfeasor companies. We are making sure there  is enough money in these trusts to pay future victims by stopping  fraudulent claims today.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Clearly there are two groups of individuals who we are not fearful  will commit fraud. It is our Nation's veterans and servicemembers. At  the same time, there is no reason to distinguish between the disclosure  obligation of veteran servicemembers and the disclosure obligations of  ordinary citizens.   This FACT Act provision is designed to protect veterans from fraud  and make sure our future veterans who are exposed and other people who  are exposed in their jobs to asbestos have the resources available  because the company that actually made the asbestos is most likely  bankrupt and out of business now.   There are finite resources in these trusts, and we owe it to our  servicemembers and to future victims of asbestosis or mesothelioma to  make sure there is money there to take care of their medical bills and  compensate them for the injuries. That is the purpose of the FACT Act  portion of this bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am going to have to beg to differ with my colleague from across the  aisle.   Fraud has been documented in news reports, State court cases, and in  testimony before the Judiciary Committee.  [[Page H1979]]    The Wall Street Journal conducted an investigation that found  thousands of dispiritedly filed claims. Court documents in many States,  including Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and  Virginia, attest to widespread fraud. Most recently, a bankruptcy case  in North Carolina uncovered a startling number of dispiritedly filed  claims.   Additionally, the Judiciary Committee heard testimony over the course  of four hearings about the FACT Act, during which witnesses repeatedly  testified that fraud existed within the asbestos trust bankruptcy  situation. Keep in mind that the fraud reported today has been in spite  of the lack of disclosure that exists.   Consistent with other multimillion-dollar compensation programs,  there is fraud occurring in the asbestos trust system, and the FACT Act  will go a long way to uncovering that fraud. The FACT Act is designed  to provide the minimum amount of transparency necessary to prevent this  fraud while protecting the personal information of those victims of  asbestos.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to address the fact that there have been numerous hearings on  the FACT Act and the problems associated with it. There was one hearing  before the Judiciary Committee on the Constitution on September 9,  2011. There were three legislative hearings before the Subcommittee on  Regulatory Reform, Commercial, and Antitrust Law, one during the 112th  Congress, one during the 113th Congress, and one during the 114th  Congress. I am sure the gentleman's staff could have gotten him copies  of those.   I also point out that the minority used these opportunities to call  witnesses that were representatives of the plaintiffs' asbestos trial  bar. They called the attorneys to voice their concern about the bill,  not the victims. In fact, the minority called the same witness for  three out of the four hearings. Now they claim that asbestos victims  were never provided an opportunity to testify.   The Judiciary Committee has provided ample opportunity to include  asbestos victims' views on the legislation in the record, and there are  many letters and statements from victims in the record.   In closing, I do want to say--going back to the class action part of  this bill for a second only--that only the tiniest fraction of  consumers in class actions bother to claim the compensation awarded  them in the settlement. That is clear proof that the vastly large  number of class members are satisfied with the products they have  purchased, don't want compensation, and don't want to be lumped into a  gigantic class action lawsuit.   Federal judges are crying out for Congress to reform the class action  system, which currently allows trial lawyers to fill classes with  hundreds and thousands of meritorious claims and use those artificially  inflated classes to force defendants to settle the case.   As I recounted, class action settlements have left lawyers with  millions of dollars while victims receive absolutely nothing or a  coupon, at best. The bill prevents people from being forced into class  actions with other uninjured or minimally injured members only to have  the compensation of injured parties reduced. It requires that lawyer  fees be limited to a reasonable percentage of the money injured victims  actually receive. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   I also want to talk a second about the FACT Act. We hear these  stories about these corporations that did all of this wrong. Many of  them are bankrupt, and the only money available to the victims are the  money that has been set aside in these asbestos trust funds. When an  unscrupulous attorney makes a claim against multiple trusts or files  claims in Federal court and State court, it is difficult, if not  impossible, to find out if that claim has already been made. The FACT  Act makes that easily available while providing privacy necessary to  protect the victims.   The FACT Act is designed to protect the future victims and make sure  there is money there for the children, for the veterans, for the  hardworking Americans who are injured by asbestos but whose symptoms  have not yet manifested. Sometimes these asbestos-related diseases take  decades to show up, and there needs to be money there to take care of  those folks. That is what this legislation is intending to do, not to  protect corporations.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill that provides much-needed  reform to the class action system and to the asbestos trust system.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the FACT Act is designed to require  increased transparency to combat fraud committed against asbestos  trusts. This amendment strikes the requirement that asbestos trusts  publish the very data that is necessary to detect fraud between the  trusts and State tort proceedings. In its place, this amendment calls  for only a quarterly report with an aggregate list of demands received  by the trusts.   The simple aggregation of information is worthless in allowing  parties to make a meaningful inquiry into whether or not they are being  defrauded. This amendment guts the bill, and I urge opposition.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the FACT Act requires that a very basic  amount of information be released to protect against fraud against the  asbestos trust system. I am standing with future victims of asbestos.   The diseases associated with asbestos typically don't manifest  themselves for decades, in some cases, beyond or after exposure. These  trusts are being drained by fraudulent and duplicative claims. These  requirements of disclosure prevent that fraud by requiring the minimal  amount of information being required. In fact, a judge with 29 years of  bench experience testified before the Committee on the Judiciary that  the FACT Act provides more protection in terms of confidentiality of  records than the legal system is able to do.   This is commonsense legislation, does not invade people's privacy,  and preserves these trust funds to make sure all victims are  compensated. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Jackson  Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prevent asbestos  trusts from disclosing claims information submitted by individuals  living in public housing in its quarterly reports and in response to  information requests.   There is no reason to distinguish between the disclosure obligations  of individuals living in public housing and the disclosure obligations  of ordinary citizens. To the extent that claimants do not affirmatively  identify themselves as living in public housing, this amendment would  require asbestos trusts to determine whether claimants qualify in these  categories, further draining them of funds needed to compensate future  victims.   The FACT Act balances the need for transparency and protecting  claimants' privacy. The FACT Act excludes any confidential medical  records and the claimants' Social Security numbers. We should ensure  that bankruptcy asbestos claims are processed in an open, fair, and  transparent method in order to protect the limited amount of money  reserved for compensating future asbestos victims.                                time  1745    The FACT Act should apply uniformly to all claimants, and it should  not impose disparate burdens relating to individuals living in public  housing.   Mr. Chairman, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, I am not sure how this bill applies to  government ethics at all.   This bill is a simple bill that tells trial lawyers not to sue  innocent local people in businesses just so they can forum shop. It  tells them that all they have got to do is show a plausible case before  they can proceed and that they have got to proceed in good faith.   It has nothing to do with what the amendment proposes. This is to  protect innocent folks from being sucked into lawsuits by trial  lawyers.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and support the  underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
