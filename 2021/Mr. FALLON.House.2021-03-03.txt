 Mr. Speaker, I have only been here 2 months, and in that  [[Page H1027]]  time, I have seen some bad legislation. To date, this is one of the  worst that I have seen.   The age of consent has always coincided with the franchise. For  nearly 200 years, it was 21. Then, in the 1970s, they changed it to 18.  Our society has agreed since then, for 50 years, that 18 is when a  child becomes an adult. I find it interesting that our friends across  the aisle don't want to have 16- and 17-year-olds tried as adults when  they commit violent adult crimes, yet they want those 16- and 17-year- olds to have the franchise. Some even, believe it or not, want 16- and  17-year-olds who are convicted of murder to be able to vote while they  are in prison after they have been convicted.   Mr. Speaker, this is a horrible amendment, and I respectfully request  that all of our Members join us in voting ``no.''
