 Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a close, dear, and  beloved friend, almost like a brother, Congressman Elijah Cummings.   This great man, this brother, spent 36 years in public service to his  people, his home State, and to our country. He was a leader who loved  this Nation, all of its people, and fought until his very last breath  for those who had been left out and left behind.   He dedicated every single moment of his life to strengthening and  preserving our Union. He spent every waking moment thinking of those  who were hurting and suffering. He focused all of his energy into this  Congress and the people we represent.   Mr. Speaker, it was an honor to know and to love him. It was an honor  to serve with him. It was a great honor to consider him my brother and  my friend.   Sometimes people would confuse us and say: ``Hello, Elijah,'' or,  ``Hello, John Lewis'' to him, and we would joke about it. We would  laugh about it.   Mr. Speaker, I say to the people in Maryland and people around our  Nation and people around the world: We have lost a warrior. I don't  think we will be so lucky or so blessed to see the likeness of this man  again.   As a nation and as a people, we owe Chairman Cummings a debt of  gratitude. There are no words to describe the loss of our brother, our  friend, and our colleague who lived up to this great and powerful name.  It hurts so deeply that all I can do is keep his wife, his family, and  all who knew and loved him in my constant prayers.   Elijah, we hope to see you again one day. Blessed be your name.
