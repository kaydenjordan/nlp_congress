 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, ever since its ill-advised inception and  inclusion in the Dodd-Frank Act, Republicans have been largely unified  about many, many issues with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   Its unconstitutional, unaccountable leadership structure has been  litigated before the Supreme Court. Its unaccountable funding  structure--chiefly, the fact that its funding comes from the Federal  Reserve and not the duly elected Members of Congress--will likely be  addressed during the Court's October session.   None of us know, nor should we presume to know, what the Court will  decide on the latter issue. Nevertheless, as written, the underlying  bill addresses concerns with the funding structure by funding the CFPB  through the regular appropriations process.   This amendment retains that provision at a level of zero.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is amazing to me somehow this country  made it a couple hundred years without the CFPB, and now we can't wake  up in the morning without it.   The CFPB operates off a fundamentally flawed assumption that our  fellow Americans, the little guy, is a rube and they lack the agency  and the intelligence to choose products and services that fit their  needs and, instead, must be infantalized while further empowering a  government that does not have their best interests at heart.   Their vilification of mundane services provided by banks and credit  unions leaves our constituents with fewer and more expensive options.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Donalds).                                time  1115     Mr. Chair, I remind everybody that the CFPB was an all- Democrat conference. There were no Republicans.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman).    Mr. Chair, I yield the remainder of my time to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment reduces the amount available  for salaries and expenses of the Federal Trade Commission to FY19  levels at just over $306 million.   It should come as no surprise that I disagree with the Biden  administration's weaponization of the Federal Trade Commission.   Much like other Biden administration approaches to financial services  regulation, the FTC policies under Chair Lina Khan threaten to disrupt  entire sectors of the American economy by moving away from the consumer  welfare standard toward arbitrary metrics that aim to break up  companies--or stop them from merging--simply because they are too big.   I mean, we can't even be bothered, as my friend on the other side of  the aisle says, with the consumer not having the capacity to determine  what is in their best interests, which is affronting enough. I mean,  all us dumb rubes out here in America, we don't know what the heck we  are going to do without the government to tell us what to do. We can't  even do that now. We just have to come up with arbitrary things that we  don't like and then weigh in.   The FTC has targeted the following standard businesses and business  practices, citing several concerns, including, the charging of  advertising and other fees to sellers that sell on Amazon or advertise  using online platforms.   Mr. Chairman, when you want to buy something, it is going to cost you  something. Somebody has to pay for that. That is how business is done.   Other FTC concerns include the use of noncompete clauses in  contracts, and the idea that mergers themselves--rather than downstream  effects on consumers--negatively impact consumers.   Unfortunately, this government seems focused on killing successful  American business instead of staying out of its way.   Most, if not all, of these practices are agreed upon in contracts  between two willing parties. If you don't like what is in the contract  provisions, whether it is a noncompete clause or you have to pay for  your advertising, there is a simple remedy not involving the  government: Just don't sign the contract. It is pretty easy.   In the last couple years, the level of FTC salaries and expenses has  increased from just over $300 million to $430 million in FY23. That is  $130 million in extra salaries and expenses. I don't need to tell  everybody here, I hope, but we are $33.7 trillion in debt--the last  time I checked the debt clock, 2 days ago--and there ain't no end in  sight.   As my young daughter told me when she looked at the debt clock for  the first time, she said, Well, it doesn't stop. Yeah, no kidding. It  doesn't stop, because this place just keeps spending like there is no  tomorrow. If we keep going, there might not be a tomorrow for this  country.   I appreciate that the bill's author wrote it at a lower level than  FY24. It shouldn't be too tall a request to lower that number even  further to prepandemic levels when, oh, by the way, just a couple years  ago, the government was still too big and was spending more money than  it took in then, especially given the questionable tactics of this  administration's FTC.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the good gentleman from the State of  Maryland says, well, you are on your own. You are on your own. I don't  know.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Well, the gentleman said it over and over again--you are  on your own, implying that we are saying you are on your own.   In 2019, we were on our own somehow, I guess, because that is what  this goes back to. Somehow, we made it to 2023, by the grace of God, I  guess, because the good gentleman also refers to the twenties, so I  imagine it is the 1920s.   Well, it is the 2020s, and things have changed a little bit. I know  that my good friend from the other side of the aisle and I are a little  bit older, but neither of us were around in 1920. Things have changed a  little bit.   Now, as a young man, I pumped gas for a living. I do know the  difference between gasoline and diesel and kerosene because I have a  nose, and I can read.   Sure. Do mistakes happen? Do people put gasoline in diesel and diesel  in gasoline? They changed the size of the nozzle, by the way, in case  you can't figure that out. If you can read, and most people in America  can read, they can figure it out.   The point is, we are not a bunch of rubes, and we don't need the  government to figure out all this stuff for us.   We don't need the government wiping our rear end every time we go to  the bathroom, but that is what you would have us believe, that that is  what we need, that Americans are so dumb, they can't do it without the  Federal Government.   Somehow this country survived a couple hundred years, and not only  survived, became the greatest country on the planet, and it wasn't  because the Federal Government was wiping our rear end the whole way.   I urge adoption, and I yield the balance of my time.
