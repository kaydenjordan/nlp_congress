 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Johnson for holding  this incredibly important Special Order this evening.   For 23 years, I had the privilege of serving my hometown of Duluth,  Minnesota, as a police officer. I know firsthand the sacrifices law  enforcement officers make for the safety and security of their  communities.   Policing is a noble profession and often a dangerous one. Ninety-one  officers have been shot so far in 2021.   Despite this danger, countless men and women still put on the  uniform, leave their loved ones behind, and put their own lives on the  line every day.   During National Police Week, we celebrate and honor these heroes, but  they deserve our respect for more than just 1 week. They deserve it  year-round and so do their families.   This past year has been especially challenging for our law  enforcement officers. There are some in the media and some in this very  Chamber who choose to vilify our police officers for the actions of a  few bad apples. Some have even called to defund the police. This  reckless and dangerous message has had a chilling effect on our  society.   Low morale is causing some officers to retire early. New officer  recruitment is strained, and crime is on the rise in many cities.   This irresponsible rhetoric must change, and I call on all of my  colleagues to help.   We must all honor the noble profession of policing, which has  provided every one of us here in this Chamber with safety and security.  We must all encourage the American people to respect the rule of law  and those who are entrusted to enforce it.  [[Page H2256]]    I, for one, am proud to stand here today, to publicly send my thanks  to our dedicated police officers and to honor those who have made the  ultimate sacrifice.   To all my brothers and sisters in the blue and brown, please know  that you are appreciated, needed, and valued. God bless, and may He  protect you all.                                time  1815
