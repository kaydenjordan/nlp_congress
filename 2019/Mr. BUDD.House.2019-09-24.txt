 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight my bill, the Virtual  Apprenticeship Tax Credit Act of 2019, which I introduced last week.  [[Page H7873]]    Despite booming economic growth as a result of the American Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act, nearly 7 million jobs in America remain unfilled.   Mr. Speaker, I can't tell you how many employers from my district  have struggled to find workers with the technical competencies to  compete for in-demand, good-paying jobs.   So when it comes to workforce development, we need innovative ideas  and partnerships between businesses and institutions of higher  education. That is why I introduced the Virtual Apprenticeship Tax  Credit Act of 2019, which offers a tax credit to employers who invest  in the funding of virtual apprenticeship programs. It is my hope this  will open more doors for students from all backgrounds.   When it comes to learning and workforce development, there shouldn't  be a one-size-fits-all approach. Put simply, there needs to be more  virtual apprenticeship opportunities for our students.                            ____________________
