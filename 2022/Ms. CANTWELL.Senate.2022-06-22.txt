 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, later this afternoon, we are going to  vote on Mary Boyle to be a Consumer Product Safety Commissioner. This  organization, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, works on the  frontlines to protect consumers from dangerous and defective products,  and Ms. Boyle's confirmation will give the Commission a full complement  of Commissioners to complete its important work.   The Consumer Product Safety Commission is responsible for regulating  the safety of more than 15,000 everyday products and helps keep  hazardous products out of our homes and away from our families. The  Agency is responsible for investigating hazards, effectuating product  recalls, issuing and enforcing product safety standards, and informing  consumers and manufacturers about potential dangers and how to avoid  them. The CPSC's work literally saves lives and prevents injuries.   We know that Ms. Boyle is well qualified for this position and that  she will make consumers a top priority and their safety a top priority.   Now is an important time for the Consumer Product Safety Commission  [[Page S3052]]  to be well equipped to fight for these consumer safety issues. We need  it to remain a strong force in keeping unsafe and defective products,  including children's toys, infant rockers, household appliances, and  other issues in the development space, like elevators and space  heaters, out of the market.   When it comes to recalls, for example, this year the Consumer Product  Safety Commission and three residential elevator manufacturers  announced the recall of 70,000 residential elevators that posed a  serious risk of injury and, tragically, death to small children. I am  encouraged to see that the Consumer Product Safety Commission is taking  action on this heartbreaking issue. There is more to be done, and we  need a Commission that will follow through.    The Commission is also responsible for investigating tragedies, such  as home fires that might have been caused by defective products. In  fact, the Consumer Product Safety Commission was quickly on the scene  in the Bronx earlier this year when a fire from a space heater caused  the death of 17 people, including 8 children. When I sent a letter to  the Consumer Product Safety Commission asking them to look further into  this issue, they acted quickly and knew that we had to investigate.   While these investigations are still ongoing, we need assurances that  if a defective product is found to be the cause, that the Consumer  Product Safety Commission is going to be fully equipped to take action.   I also want to mention with respect to the Consumer Product Safety  Commission's rulemaking authority that the Commerce Committee recently  passed the STURDY Act, a bill that would speed up the Consumer Product  Safety Commission's rulemaking process to deal with furniture tipovers.   Unfortunately, many furniture items are designed in such a way that  they can tip if a child grabs or climbs upon them, with the potential  of very tragic consequences. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has  been undertaking a rulemaking to ban unsafe furniture items by imposing  strict tipover testing requirements. I hope we will see a safety  standard for this very soon.   Over the course of more than a decade at the Commission, Ms. Boyle  has worked on these issues in senior positions across the Consumer  Product Safety Commission, including as General Counsel and Deputy  General Counsel before assuming her current role as Executive Director.   As the Consumer Product Safety Commission's General Counsel, Ms.  Boyle served the Agency's chief legal officer--providing legal, policy,  and strategic advice on a multitude of regulatory, statutory, fiscal,  litigation, and enforcement issues--and examined proposed product  safety rules and standards. So I think she is well qualified for this  job. She worked with the Department of Justice on Federal court  litigation in which the Commission was involved.   In her current role as Executive Director, she is the chief operating  officer of the Agency, ensuring that it meets program and operational  and administrative functions. She is more than well-versed in the  Agency's processes and eminently qualified to hit the ground running as  a Commissioner.   Over 90 different organizations have written to my office in support  of her nomination, including the AFL-CIO, the Consumer Federation of  America, the National Consumers League, Kids in Danger, and many, many  more organizations.   I want to say to all my colleagues, I hope you will vote to confirm  Ms. Boyle to ensure that the Consumer Product Safety Commission can  move forward so that these important issues can be addressed and  Americans can find safer products in their homes.   I look forward to working with Ms. Boyle at a critical time for the  Agency in making sure that these products are safe and that Americans  are protected from dangerous and defective products.               Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15  today, the Senate vote on the motion to discharge the Freeman  nomination; further, that immediately following that vote, the Senate  vote on confirmation of the Boyle nomination as under the previous  order; and that if the nomination is confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate and the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now recess until 2:15.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:45 p.m., recessed until  2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Ms. Rosen).                            ____________________
