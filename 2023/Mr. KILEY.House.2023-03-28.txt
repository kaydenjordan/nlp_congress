 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Lower  Energy Costs Act, which does something a little unusual for a piece of  legislation. It actually does what it says it is going to do, the Lower  Energy Costs Act.   It is going to lower costs for Americans and, in particular, my State  of California, where we pay the highest energy costs in the country. It  will do that by lowering utility bills, by reducing gas prices, and by  reducing the cost of everyday goods by reducing the cost of transport.   It will do this by making our country more energy independent,  enhancing our capacity for domestic energy production.   There are a number of other benefits to this, by the way. It will  create jobs here in the United States. It will enhance our national  security. It is much better for the environment than energy produced  elsewhere.   It is the affordability facet that I really want to focus on because  my top priority as a member of this new House majority is focusing like  a laser on reducing the cost of living for Americans who have been  crushed under the weight of runaway inflation.   As background, the first thing that we did in this new Congress was  we voted to repeal the 87,000 IRS agents who were hired by the last  Congress. This is going to spare countless Americans, middle-class  Americans, from highly intrusive audits.   The next month, in February, I managed to secure an opinion from the  IRS. This was specific to California taxpayers. This reversed guidance  given by the California tax authority saying that you needed to pay  taxes on those tax refunds that you got in the mail last year or early  this year.   We managed to secure an opinion from the IRS saying you don't have to  pay taxes on that, saving Californians several hundred dollars with  that step alone.   It is H.R. 1, this bill, the Lower Energy Costs Act, that is the most  important step yet to lower the cost of living for people in California  and across the country. Here is exactly how the bill did this.   Number one, it is going to reduce your utility bills by repealing  $6.4 billion in taxes on natural gas. This was part of the Biden  administration's energy program last year, which, of course, caused gas  prices to go over $7 a gallon in many places. Also part of that was a  major tax that was placed on natural gas.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has found that this tax  is ultimately paid for by Americans through higher home heating costs  and utility bills.                                time  1915    H.R. 1 repeals this tax, and consumers will pocket those savings  through lower utility bills.   The second effect of this legislation will be to reduce gas prices,  and that is primarily done through reforming our broken permitting  process. Now, this might sound like sort of an arcane issue, but it is  fundamental to the high, out-of-control cost of gas that we have been  dealing with in this country, where we have a broken permitting process  that blocks projects for months, for years, often indefinitely, through  never-ending Federal reviews, not to mention frivolous litigation.  [[Page H1520]]    This bill will streamline the permitting and review process by  capping reviews at 1 year for environmental assessments and 2 years for  environmental impact statements, more than enough time. There is also  going to be a 120-day deadline implemented on filing a lawsuit on final  agency actions concerning energy projects.   The bill also requires the Department of the Interior to resume  quarterly sales of onshore oil and gas leases, among many other steps,  which will unleash the American energy sector, create middle-class  jobs, and increase the supply of gas available to reduce prices at the  pump.   Finally, it is worth mentioning the other overall effect of this  bill, which is to reduce the cost of everyday goods and services. By  reducing the cost of gasoline, every good transported to a store,  whether it is groceries, furniture, or any other everyday necessities  are going to be cheaper to transport, and those savings as well will be  passed on to consumers.   I am proud to stand with my colleagues in the new majority in  supporting this legislation, in fighting to reduce inflation, and to  making the American Dream accessible to more people.
