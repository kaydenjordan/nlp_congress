 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the  Congressional Broadcasters Caucus and a former radio sports announcer,  I would like to acknowledge and celebrate that this year is the 100th  anniversary of the first commercial radio broadcast.   In fact, it was in my home State of Pennsylvania that station KDKA  made the first commercial broadcast. This revolutionary idea brought  news to people before they had to read about it in the newspaper.   For a century now, radio broadcasts have crossed towns, cities, and  States across our Nation to bring us the sense of kinship we have come  to expect from stations that are invested in our communities.   We are looking forward to the next 100 years of radio entertaining,  connecting, and informing Americans.                            ____________________
