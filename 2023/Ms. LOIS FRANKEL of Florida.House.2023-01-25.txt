 Madam Speaker, I rise today to mark the  50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the historic Supreme Court decision  that gave women legal access to abortion.   Now, 50 years later, an extreme MAGA Supreme Court has reversed Roe,  taking us to a new dark place in history; and now Republicans are  racing full steam ahead toward a nationwide abortion ban, creating  hardship and even death for pregnant women, and prison for their  doctors.   To that, I say, my, my, my.   People, not politicians, should have the freedom to control their own  reproductive destinies. On the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I rise  to say that the American people want more freedom, not less; and that  means the ability of each person to make the personal decision about  their health, their lives, and their future.                            ____________________
