 Madam Speaker, I rise today because reproductive  healthcare is a human right, but it is under threat.   For nearly half a century, the fundamental right to abortion has been  upheld by courts. Now, the Supreme Court appears poised to roll back  this precedent and steal away the rights of 170 million American women  to make their own healthcare decisions. This ruling will create  healthcare deserts across the country where women will not have access  to the reproductive healthcare they need when they need it. We cannot  allow this to happen.   The House passed the Women's Health Protection Act, which will codify  the Roe v. Wade decision and protect abortion access in the United  States. The Senate must follow our lead. We must abolish the filibuster  to end minority rule and guarantee basic rights and access to  reproductive healthcare. We cannot rely on the Supreme Court to uphold  Roe, and so I call on Congress to do so.                            ____________________
