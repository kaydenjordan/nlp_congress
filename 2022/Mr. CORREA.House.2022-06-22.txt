 Madam Speaker, a soldier takes his oath of service,  swearing allegiance to our country and to our flag. When 92-year-old  Korean war vet Ignacio Gonzales saw a young man take his American flag  from his porch, he went into action.   The 92-year-old Ignacio chased the man down, retrieved the American  flag, and returned it to its proper place in front of his home. Later  on, he laughingly told his wife: ``They didn't know I could run that  fast.''   After the flag incident, his son, Vicente, told his father: ``It is  not worth the danger, Dad, chasing down a hoodlum to retrieve your $20  flag.'' Ignacio corrected his son and said: ``This isn't just a flag.  This American flag flies in memory of your uncles, George and Manuel  Gonzales.''   Both fought in World War II. George fought in the Battle of the  Bulge, and Manuel fought in the Rhineland campaign. Ignacio fought in  the Korean war and was awarded many medals, including the Combat  Infantry Badge that is given only to soldiers who fought in active  ground combat.   Ignacio passed away quietly on June 9, and I have never been more  proud of one of my countrymen. He was also a graduate from Anaheim High  School, my alma mater. He was class of 1949.                            ____________________
