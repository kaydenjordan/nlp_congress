The text of the motion is as follows:         Mrs. Black moves that the House concur in the Senate       amendment to House Concurrent Resolution 71.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the motion  shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget.   The gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black) and the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.  [[Page H8243]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Senate amendment to H.  Con. Res. 71, the budget resolution for fiscal year 2018.   Passing a budget is never easy, and it has, once again, been a  challenge this year. But I am encouraged with where we are now, and I  am pleased that the Senate did its work by approving a budget, one that  we can support in order to unlock tax reform for the American people.   Without question, there are plenty of things that I wish were  included in what the Senate passed, ideas that the House put forward  earlier this month when we approved our budget. For example, I still  feel strongly about addressing unsustainable mandatory spending, and  that hasn't changed. The growing burden of debt caused by mandatory  spending is a real problem that cannot be ignored.   We owe it to the American people to do something, to offer serious  reforms that ensure government programs are financially sustainable and  working well for generations to come, and I think we will tackle this  important issue in the future. Really, we don't have a choice.   But despite any shortcomings of the Senate-passed budget, I am  encouraged that it does reflect the shared priorities of both Chambers.  Moving forward with this budget is also supported by our President.   I want to remind my colleagues that before final passage last week,  the Senate did include numerous provisions previously passed by the  House, and I was proud to be involved in those negotiations with the  leaders of the House, the Senate, and the White House.   For example, the Senate-passed budget creates a mechanism that would  permit the Budget Committee chairman to adjust the budget allocations  if there is future legislation signed into law that revises the BCA  spending caps.   The Senate-passed budget also includes numerous improvements to the  House budget's enforcement that are designed to strengthen fiscal  discipline. Because we worked together to find a common ground, we can  move ahead toward tax reform and expand upon the ideas in the  conservative framework unveiled last month.   Throughout my nearly 7 years as a Member of the House, Republicans  have talked about modernizing our outdated and overly complicated tax  system, and today, we have the opportunity to take that next big step  to unlock tax reform for the American people, fulfilling the promise  that we made long ago to our constituents.   By advancing tax reform, we can help Americans keep more of their  hard-earned paychecks; we can make it possible for most Americans to  file their taxes on a simple postcard; we can level the playing field  for business and help them compete better globally; and we can empower  entrepreneurs and small businesses, encouraging them to create more  jobs.   This budget acknowledges that our economy is in desperate need of a  jolt, and the tax cuts included in the Senate-passed budget hold that  promise of doing just that. Put simply, we have the opportunity to make  history by reforming our tax system for the first time in nearly three  decades.   President Trump is with us on this, and I agree that we must move  quickly, and that is why I urge my colleagues to pass this budget  today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0915     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the Senate amendment to H. Con. Res. 71.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the Senate amendment to H. Con. Res. 71.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock), a member of the Budget  Committee.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, unsustainable government spending drives both taxes and  debt.   The budget resolution sets the spending architecture for the fiscal  year. The House version provided for $200 billion of enforceable  mandatory spending reductions over 10 years and balanced within the  decade. The Senate amendments gut these provisions, squandering the one  opportunity Congress has each year to bring mandatory spending under  control, taking us another year closer to a sovereign debt crisis. This  is tragic, and I condemn it in the strongest terms.   The Senate, though, has retained just one key provision from the  House budget. It makes tax reform possible this year. Tax reform is  essential to economic growth, and economic growth is essential to  confront our debt.   Many are alarmed that it provides for $1.5 trillion of additional  debt, but this is due solely to the Senate's rules that require tax  cuts to be scored only as revenue losses without taking into account  economic expansion.   During the Obama years, our economy grew at an average of 1\1/2\  percent, annually. That is about half the average rate since World War  II. Reagan averaged 3\1/2\ percent. Reagan did this by reducing the tax  burdens that were crushing our economy. He slashed the top income tax  rate from 70 percent down to 28 percent, and income tax receipts nearly  doubled because of the economic expansion he unleashed.   Taxes driven by spending are the greatest threat to our economy  today, and debt driven by spending is the greatest threat to our  future. Controlling spending is currently impossible in the Senate. So  it is obvious that we can't balance the budget and reduce our debt  without significantly increasing economic growth; we can't increase  economic growth without tax relief; and we can't get tax relief without  the provisions in the Senate budget.   Arthur Laffer, the architect of the Reagan tax policy, forecasts that  the corporate tax reform alone will increase GDP growth at a rate that  should generate a temporary bump of 5 percent, settling down to an  average of 2.6 percent over the decade. This will add $5 trillion to  the American economy and directly increase revenues to all levels of  government between $1.8 trillion and $2 trillion.   We have tried a static approach to tax policy during the Obama years.  The economy stagnated and the debt doubled.   I remember what it was like in the Reagan era. Wages were rising and  opportunities for better jobs were everywhere. There was a sense of  optimism that comes with prosperity and abundance. When we abandoned  these policies, we lost that prosperity to a decade of despair.   I want my kids to know what that sense of relief and optimism was  like, what it feels like when morning dawns again on the American  economy. This resolution starts that transformation, and I urge its  adoption.    Mr. Speaker, I just must make a comment on what went on  in Kansas and the attribution that this was Mr. Laffer's idea.   I know Mr. Laffer personally and have had a conversation with him  about his plan and suggestion. It was not followed. So I do want to  lift up his good name and say that his plan was not followed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Johnson), a member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Johnson), a member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), a member of both our Budget Committee and  the Appropriations Committee.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the chairwoman  for a phenomenal job.   Look, our current fiscal environment, according to the CBO, they  project that the growth of our economy will be 2 percent or less for  the next decade.   I am reminded of what a good friend and Democratic colleague in the  Budget Committee said one day: That 3 percent growth, that is just a  dream, that is unrealistic.   Yet, before the storms hit, what did we see as far as our economic  growth of the country: 3.1 percent economic growth, something that one  of our colleagues, Democratic colleagues, said was a pipe dream.   This is, in large part, because excessive regulations have been  curtailed by both the administration and by Congress; but to keep that  momentum, we need to pass tax reform.   It will lead to a sustained strong economy. It will again lower the  tax burden to our families. It will lead to increased wages for  families, for the middle class, for individuals for the first time in  such a long time, allowing the American people to keep more of their  hard-earned money. It would make small-, mid-, and large-sized  businesses more competitive so they can create millions of additional  jobs here in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will allow us to do real tax reform to  keep the economy growing, to get the economy going, to get the American  people working again, and this is an essential part.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone's support.    Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying that the Devil is in  the details. And those details have not been released yet, so it is  difficult for me to understand how my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle make assumptions on just what this tax plan will do, calling  it things such as snake oil, when I can assure you that, as a member of  the Ways and Means Committee, it is our goal and intent that the people  in the middle- and low-income categories will see tax relief.   I also want to remind them that what we know was the Devil in the  details is the details given to the American people a number of years  ago on the Affordable Care Act--which is neither affordable nor caring,  in my opinion--was that people would see a return of about $2,500 on  the average in their pocket as a result of the Affordable Care Act's  policies, and what we saw and what we are seeing now is a big increase  in those premiums. Certainly they have not received $2,500 in their  pocket.   They were told they could keep their doctor, which we knew wasn't  true, and the other kinds of things that were done that caused people  to lose their insurance in my very own State, because we had a plan the  people liked and people wanted to keep but could not because of the  mandates that were put on by the Affordable Care Act.                                time  0945    I want to remind my friends from the other side of the aisle that  maybe the thing to do is to wait and see what really is in the plan,  because the devil is in the detail, and I think you may like it enough  that you perhaps will even vote for this tax plan that does give a jolt  to the economy and does help the American people, especially in the  lower- and middle-income, to keep more of their hard-earned dollars in  their pockets.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), a member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Walker), who is the chair of our RSC.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Walker), who is the chair of our RSC.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Flores).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Flores).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Ferguson), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I almost can't sit here and not make a comment on my colleagues'  budget on the other side of the aisle. All of a sudden, they seem to be  very concerned about deficits when, as a matter of fact, their budget  assumed almost $1 trillion worth of deficits in their budget.   I want to also say that our committee did a really good job in having  a balanced budget, and we are, obviously, looking at a budget from the  Senate that we are going to be taking up so that we can do tax reform.   But they also, in addition to that, had $2 trillion worth of new  taxes that they placed on the American people. So all of a sudden, this  purity of worrying about these deficits just makes me scratch my head,  and about raising taxes on the people when their own plan did the very  opposite of what we are trying to do is cut taxes. They added $2  trillion worth of taxes.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my extreme honor to yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our majority whip, who is a  wonderful member of our Conference.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mooney).   Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, we had a Democratic  President, John F. Kennedy, who cut taxes when he was President. I  think he would take issue with a lot of the things that have been said  by his own party.   It has been 30 years since we addressed taxes in this country.  President Ronald Reagan addressed it 30 years ago. We are way overdue  for tax cuts in the United States of America.   Everybody knows that the 35 percent tax rate on corporations has  driven companies overseas. West Virginia saw, just a couple of years  ago, one of our largest remaining corporate headquarters, Mylan  Pharmaceuticals, relocate overseas to avoid the taxes that are too high  in this country. We all know that is a problem. We have a plan we are  putting forward to try to solve it.   I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle: Where is your  plan?   You have no plan. This is all political. All you do is make political  attacks. You have had meetings recently and said: Don't offer a plan.  Let's just attack the Republicans for their plan.  [[Page H8253]]    At least we have a plan to address this because hardworking taxpayers  in West Virginia and America need and expect us to deliver on these tax  cuts. So I rise in strong support of the budget today so we can move  forward with our tax cut plan.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my delight to yield 2 minutes to  the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), who is the chairman  of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 30  seconds remaining.    Mr. Speaker, in 30 seconds, I want to once again say  thank you to my colleague from the other side. I have enjoyed working  with him. This is history. We are going to make history.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in their support of the  budget because doing so means that we can truly benefit the American  people, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the previous question is ordered.   The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Black).   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
