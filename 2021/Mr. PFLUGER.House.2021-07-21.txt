 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of the precious  lives of our unborn. Last week, my colleagues in the Appropriations  Committee voted to authorize taxpayer-funded abortions by passing a  spending bill that omits the Hyde amendment.   The Hyde amendment prohibits taxpayer dollars from being used to fund  abortions and it has saved an estimated 2.5 million lives. It has been  included in every appropriations package since 1976 until now. The move  to eliminate Hyde is another blatant attack on the sanctity of life,  following this administration's budget proposal that has also failed to  include the Hyde amendment and other pro-life policies in Federal  programs.   This is a crucial moment for all of us to uphold the inherent dignity  of human life. Every unborn child should have the right to life. There  are few greater priorities. I will continue to do everything in my  power to protect the vulnerable, to safeguard taxpayer consciences, and  to preserve the sanctity of life. We must protect the Hyde amendment.                               Liberty for Cuba     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate for liberty, for  freedom. For over 60 years, the Cuban people have been oppressed by the  worst impulses of a brutal regime and the failed promises of Communist  propaganda. What we are seeing today is those people are saying  ``enough is enough.'' The Cuban people are shouting ``libertad'' for  freedom, waving American flags and rising up to finally demand  independence and autonomy over their own lives.   Cuba is showing us in real time. In fact, they are showing the world  in real time that massive government control over society simply does  not work, and how its demise quickly spirals into deadly conditions of  poverty, starvation, and hopelessness.   I recently had the chance to speak to a Cuban American and a Cuban.  Their stories are horrific about the atrocities that their own  government is using, the violence, that they are using to control the  society.   This is causing enough desperation that Cubans will stare down their  oppressors in the streets. They will risk their lives, crossing  treacherous waters on homemade rafts to reach the shores of America,  the shores of freedom.   The truth is clear: The United States remains the beacon of freedom  and democracy around the world. We must do everything in our power to  keep it that way and valiantly support liberty at home and abroad.                          Fleeing of Texas Democrats     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express disappointment in  the dereliction of duty of Texas Democrats who last week in the State  legislature decided to flee the State to keep the Texas House from  taking any action during the special session.   This stunt, complete with private jets and plenty of congratulatory  media coverage, slows the passage of initiatives including: family  violence prevention, property tax relief; support for our teachers; and  a widely supported bill to strengthen election integrity.   The majority of Texans support safeguarding our elections.  Unfortunately, colleagues in the Texas House are peddling lies about  the election integrity bill. In reality, this measure merely disbands  COVID-19 voting protocols that had never been used prior to 2020, while  creating a more secure voting process.   Showing ID, proving who you are in a State and Federal Government  election allows thousands of people to enter illegally every single  day, and ending voting at 4 o'clock in the morning. It is time for the  media and the Washington elites who are cheering on this charade to see  it for what it really is: political theater. Texans deserve better.                            ____________________
