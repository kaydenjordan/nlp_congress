(e) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall apply with respect to plan years beginning on or after       January 1, 2024.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1916.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in full support of H.R. 1916, the Ensuring  Lasting Smiles Act. On behalf of the 4 percent of American children  born annually with congenital anomalies or birth defects, I am very  proud to sponsor this much-needed legislation.   This bill will ensure that health plans do not deny or delay  medically necessary treatment of congenital anomalies. In many cases,  coverage for well-known anomalies, like heart defects or spina bifida,  is already the standard. But for babies who have oral defects such as  cleft palates, skeletal defects, congenital cataracts, or hearing  defects, insurance companies have systematically denied or delayed  medically necessary treatments.   I became a sponsor of this legislation after Kevin Koser testified at  our Health Subcommittee, which you are a member of, Madam Speaker,  about his beautiful son, Kannon. He shared with the subcommittee how  Kannon asked Santa Claus for teeth so he could ``chomp big bites'' of  food.   I was really shaken by that and by the fact that in our country, such  a rich and great country as America, we would put treatment that allows  a child to eat out of reach because of insurance red tape.   A baby named Rosie in my congressional district is one of the 1,300  babies born in the United States each year with congenital cataracts.  In just a few months, her family spent over $4,000 out of pocket on  contact lenses for her. Without these lenses, babies like Rosie are  blind, and they have no chance of ever developing normal vision.   These stories are repeated across our country every single day, but  today is the day that we can begin to change that. This legislation is  one of the most popular bills in the House, with 316 bipartisan  cosponsors, including more than half of the Republican Conference.   The time has come for this important, popular, and much-needed bill  to finally pass the House of Representatives.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the bill that we are taking up today was  passed by the Energy and Commerce Committee. It hasn't changed. The  gentleman, Mr. Griffith, had an amendment. He withdrew it. He had the  opportunity, but he withdrew it.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank the gentleman for his kind comments about me. I think that  there are a couple of important points to be made. And that is that CBO  estimates that insurers will respond to this bill by raising premiums  by less than 0.1 percent. What CBO does not score are the savings from  providing this needed medical care because that medical care goes on  and on and on. And the costs to families are exorbitant.   As I said earlier today, I think this is a very good bill. I  acknowledge all the advocates from all over the country that worked so  hard to bring us to this moment.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to the vote today on this bill that has  been with us since 2020, and I yield back the balance of my time.
