 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  increased cost of building materials, creating an affordability crisis  for housing in America.   This is, in part, because the COVID-19 pandemic has played a  significant role in harming our country's supply of lumber and building  materials. In addition, tariffs with Canada, along with long-term  reductions of domestic timber harvesting, have exacerbated the price  increases.   According to the National Association of Home Builders, prices of  materials to build houses, like oriented strand boards, are up more  than 400 percent since last spring. The average price of lumber has  quadrupled.   This supply cost has increased the price of a new house, a new  single-family home, by nearly $40,000 per unit.   I urge Congress and the Biden administration to take action to  address the lumber supply chain, such as increasing domestic harvesting  of timber and negotiating new lumber agreements with Canada. This is a  way we can effectively reduce the cost of housing. We need to build  more housing.                            ____________________
