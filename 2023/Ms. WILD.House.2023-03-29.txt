 Madam Speaker, on March 1 of this year, drug manufacturer  Eli Lilly announced its plan to institute a $35 cap on out-of-pocket  insulin costs. Two weeks later, Novo Nordisk announced plans to cut its  insulin prices by up to 75 percent. Just 2 days after that, Sanofi  announced their decision to cut the U.S. price of its most prescribed  insulin by 78 percent and cap costs at $35 for those with private  insurance.   Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi make up roughly 90 percent of the  insulin market in the United States, a market that for decades has been  characterized by skyrocketing costs and unbelievable price gouging.   Some might say that these price-capping announcements are examples of  corporate responsibility.   Let me correct the record: I say it is about damn time. I say this  action is a hollow, decades-too-late example of big pharmaceutical  companies attempting to shirk regulation as they face the most  realistic possibility ever of being held accountable for price gouging  Americans. I say it is not enough because for a century, pharmaceutical  companies have been exploiting and profiting off Americans who depend  on insulin and other lifesaving medications to survive.   In 1923, the inventors of insulin sold the patent for just $1. They  felt it was unethical to profit from a discovery that would save so  many lives. How ironic. Since then, insulin costs have skyrocketed,  jumping 500 percent in just the past decade or so, with a vial costing  as much as thousands of dollars per month.   Americans represent 15 percent of the global insulin market, yet we  generate almost 50 percent of the pharmaceutical industry's insulin  revenue. That is not an accident. Big Pharma has for decades taken  advantage of the nonexistent regulation on drug pricing in the United  States to make billions in profit off insulin.   It is corporate greed, pure and simple, fueled by hundreds of  millions in dark-money lobbying to intimidate Congress from reining in  the industry. In 2022 alone, pharma and health product companies spent  a record $372 million lobbying against pricing regulations and Medicare  negotiations. Big Pharma is well organized, well funded, and well  connected. That is why last year's Inflation Reduction Act was so  historic. It was the first successful attempt in decades to curtail  this price gouging.   The work to lower drug prices is why I ran for office in the first  place. It has been one of my very top priorities since day one in  Congress, so much so that I have been called a dog with a bone when it  comes to the fight to get drug prices down.   I cosponsored and voted to pass the Lower Drug Costs Now Act. I voted  to pass the Affordable Insulin Now Act to cap the cost of insulin at  $35 per month for everyone. I introduced the bipartisan Fair Drug  Prices for Kids Act to lower costs for families by allowing States to  purchase medication at the lowest price offered by drug manufacturers.  I called on House and Senate leadership time and again to take swift  legislative action to lower drug costs. I stood with my constituents  affected by high insulin prices to call attention to the crisis they  face. I called for Build Back Better to include a measure enabling  Medicare to negotiate drug prices, and I helped pass into law the  Inflation Reduction Act that finally, finally realizes so many of these  priorities.   The Inflation Reduction Act capped the price of insulin at $35 per  month for Medicare beneficiaries. Now, Big Pharma sees the writing on  the wall. Their decision to lower insulin costs for everyone does not  come out of so-called corporate responsibility. This decision comes  because corporations are afraid that Congress, now having momentum,  will continue to take action to rein in their corporate greed. Eli  Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi could have, at any point in the last  century, capped the price of insulin and saved many lives. They are  only doing it now as part of a transparent PR campaign to stave off  further congressional action regulating drug prices. They can lower  costs at will, but they can also raise costs at will. That means we  must act because your ability to afford lifesaving medications should  not be dependent on the whims of Big Pharma's pricing decisions.   For the countless people across my district and across the country  who depend on lifesaving insulin, I am telling you that I will never  back down.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today, March 29, to commemorate Vietnam  War Veterans Day and honor those who served in this conflict.   We acknowledge and deeply appreciate the sacrifices made by our brave  soldiers, their families, and the communities that supported them.   We also need to make sure that we honor our POW-MIA Gold Star  families who lost their loved ones or still endure the uncertainty of  their fate during the war.   In addition to representing a large community of Vietnam vets, I have  the distinct honor of having a Gold Star daughter, Maureen Hickman  Caporaso, serve in my office. Her father, United States Air Force  Captain Vincent J. Hickman, is one of the 1,553 servicemembers still  unaccounted for to this day.   We must never forget the sacrifices of these families, and we must do  everything in our power to continue searching and bring closure to  those who still wait for their loved ones to return.   Why keep searching after all these years? Because you never leave a  fallen American behind.   To the veterans of the Vietnam war, we offer a long-overdue welcome  home. We honor your courage and your commitment to our country, and we  thank you for your unwavering dedication to defending our freedom.   Today, let us recognize the immense sacrifices made by our  servicemembers, their families, and the entire Nation during the  Vietnam war.                            ____________________
