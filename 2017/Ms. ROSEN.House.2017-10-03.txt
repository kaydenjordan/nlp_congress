 Madam Speaker, on October 3rd, on rollcall votes 546, 547,  548, 549, and 550, I was not present because I was tending to my  community in Las Vegas, in the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting  in United States history. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``Nay'' on rollcall vote 546, ``Nay'' on rollcall vote 547, ``Yea'' on  rollcall vote 548, ``Nay'' on rollcall vote 549, and ``Yea'' on  rollcall vote 550.                            ____________________
