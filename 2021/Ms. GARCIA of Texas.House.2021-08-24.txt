 Madam Speaker, I rise to call attention to the  importance of passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   Every American should have equal access to the ballot box. Our  democracy is stronger when everyone can participate. This should not be  controversial or politicized, it is about ensuring a very basic right  of every American.   Sadly, in my home State of Texas, the GOP has been trying again and  again and again to strip our right to vote. After three attempts to  pass a dangerous anti-voting bill, the Texas GOP has made it absolutely  clear that they do not really want communities of color, seniors, and  Latinos to vote.   The original Voting Rights Act was designed to stop this very kind of  behavior. Voter suppression was wrong then and it is wrong now.   Madam Speaker, I call upon my colleagues to vote for H.R. 4 so that  we can strengthen our democracy and build on the Voting Rights Act.  This bill will ensure that everyone has an equal right to vote.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4  and its efforts to protect access to the ballot box and advance justice  and democracy for all, including Latinos, which represent 77 percent of  my district.   We are all equal under the law and should be treated equally at the  ballot box. Recent attempts by the GOP-led legislatures in States like  my home State of Texas, demonstrate how urgent it is to protect our  democracy. These attempts could disenfranchise nearly 8 in every 10 of  my constituents.   Our country has one of the strongest democracies in the world, and it  is simply un-American to disenfranchise voters. I urge my colleagues to  pass H.R. 4, which would maintain elections free, fair, and accessible  to all eligible voters. Let's make our democracy stronger.   Si se puede. Yes, we can.   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 4.
