 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 15 minutes prior to the scheduled rollcall vote.    Mr. President, last week, the Biden administration  proposed a spending package that included funding meant for  humanitarian relief--$3.5 billion for migration and refugee assistance  in Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza; $5.7 billion for the U.S. Agency for  International Development. The Biden administration says that our money  will pay for ``life-saving humanitarian programming in Israel and areas  impacted by the situation in the West Bank and Gaza.''   We have two problems to address. First, the U.S. Government is scared  to call the terrorist attack a terrorist attack. Second, this is just  one more embarrassing example of the Biden administration's two-faced  approach to the people of Israel.   I have spoken at length about the money pipeline between Iran and  Hamas, but there is a similar pipeline that appears to be running  between Hamas and the U.S. taxpayer. Every dollar we send that is  earmarked for Gaza or the West Bank is another dollar Hamas can put  into their pocket.   Last week, I spoke about the U.N. Relief and Works Agency and how  this false humanitarian mission has been corrupted by Hamas and  terrorist sympathizers. This has been confirmed by multiple NGOs, the  media, Joe Biden's own advisers, and whoever published and then deleted  this post from the UNRWA Twitter account.   Hamas stole those supplies and UNRWA covered it up. Remember, this is  a U.N. body that pulls 93 percent of its funding from global  government. In 2021 alone, UNRWA took $338 million from the United  States, $118 million from the European Commission, and  [[Page S5134]]  hundreds of millions of dollars from individual European nations.   Since 2021, Biden has sent UNRWA a billion dollars. A billion  dollars. USAID funds more than $21 billion worth of UN programming, and  they sent millions of dollars to UNRWA. And now the President is ready  to send them billions more. If the American people knew what their tax  dollars were actually being used for, they would be outraged. And I  believe it is time for them to know.   We know that Hamas steals UNRWA money and supplies and stores their  weapons in UNRWA facilities. We also know that they fill those  facilities with human shields. But something that hasn't gotten nearly  enough attention is how our tax dollars are radicalizing the next  generation of Hamas extremists.   UN Watch published a report in March exposing UNRWA-affiliated  schools for what they are: indoctrination centers. Bear in mind, this  is UN Watch that published this report and exposed the U.N. Relief and  Works Agency for Palestinian refugees for what they were doing. One  employee shared an Instagram post calling a teenage Palestine Islamic  Jihad fighter who was killed in a shootout a ``little cub who fights  like a thousand lions.'' That was an employee of the U.N. Relief and  Works Agency who shared that Instagram post calling a teenage Jihadi  fighter a ``little cub who fights like a thousand lions.''   A teacher posted a picture of Hitler with the caption:         Hitler, are you sleeping? Wake up, honey, there are still       some people you need to burn.    UN Watch also found official curriculum from last year celebrating  Dalal Mughrabi. In 1978, she led a band of PLO terrorists in a massacre  that left 38 Israeli civilians dead. Thirteen of her victims were  children. Another piece of propaganda written for ninth graders  described the firebombing of a U.S. bus as a ``barbecue party.'' One  UNRWA teacher assigned seventh grade boys anti-Semitic poetry that  urged the students to expel Israelis ``with blood and flesh'' from  Palestine. All of this was subsidized by the American taxpayer.   Hamas is responsible for the October 7 massacre in Israel. But anyone  who believes that Hamas is a solo actor is willfully ignorant. They  have support. And right now, Biden's foreign policy is providing much  of that support, not only through the money pipeline but through his  absolute refusal to keep Iran in check. This isn't just a U.S. problem.  It is a worldwide problem that we will not solve until the money stops  flowing and Hamas is eradicated.   Fortunately, at least when it comes to UNRWA, accountability is built  in. Global governments provide that funding, which means we can take it  away. The United States needs to step up and lead.   I have introduced legislation to halt that funding until Iran is  expelled from the U.N. and investigated for violations. We have to get  this job done. Our legislation would accomplish two goals. It will  destroy that pipeline of taxpayer dollars from the United States to  Hamas and disrupt the Biden administration's policy of appeasement  toward Iran.   Everything President Biden has done has made this world more  dangerous. But nothing has had more immediate and catastrophic  consequences for our allies than his refusal to treat the Iranian  regime like the dangerous adversary that it actually is. He sent Robert  Malley, Ariane Tabatabai, and other Iranian assets to renegotiate the  failed nuclear deal. Administration officials allowed Ms. Tabatabai's  security clearance to stand even after it became clear she was  operating under the advice of Iranian officials. He agreed to hand over  a $6 billion ransom payment and then insisted that the world's most  prolific state sponsor of terror would dedicate every penny to  humanitarian aid.   And in the hours following the worst massacre of Jews since the  Holocaust, he insisted that there was no connection between Iran and  Hamas and their terrorist acts. Never mind that a week later, Hamas  leadership met with the Iranian foreign minister in Qatar.   Biden's foreign policy is fatally flawed; that has become evident.  And if we don't force him to reverse course, he will further endanger  the American people and our allies and our safety and security.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
