 Mr. President, I rise today to support my colleague, Senator  Kaine, in support of this resolution before us, a resolution that would  prohibit the United States from conducting offensive military strikes  against Iran unless or until some time as Congress may authorize it.   This is how security policy in our constitutional Republic is  supposed to work. It is how decisions like these are supposed to be  made. Congress authorizes the use of military force and the President-- as Commander in Chief--directs the military as it undertakes the effort  to complete its missions.   This arrangement gives the American people the best of both worlds--a  deliberative, representative legislature to declare war and a single,  decisive Commander in Chief to lead the troops.   Unfortunately, Congress has not upheld its end of this  responsibility. Our system of checks and balances--while very  beneficial to the American people and while giving us the greatest  opportunity to protect our freedom, our liberty, and our system of  government--imposes a degree of rigor and accountability on Congress,  which its Members, unfortunately, sometimes are inclined to shirk  whenever possible. This trend has sadly gained momentum for decades,  and it has done so under Presidents, House of Representatives, and  Senates of every conceivable partisan combination. Now, nearly two  decades into multiple wars without clear missions or paths to victory,  it is time for Congress to reassert, on behalf of our constituents, our  vital constitutional role in American warmaking.   Before addressing the merits of this particular resolution, let me  first dispel two very mistaken assumptions being made about it.   First, it is not about defying President Trump. Quite to the  contrary, this resolution supports President Trump and his particularly  deferential approach--one that defers to the American people, one that  accepts, at the outset, the fact that we can't fight wars all around  the globe in perpetuity, and we certainly can't and shouldn't do that  without the consent of the American people and that of their elected  representatives in Congress. Indeed, on this issue, President Trump is  the most restrained and the most Constitution-minded Commander in Chief  we have had in decades. I believe he is the most restrained and  Constitution-minded Commander in Chief we have had in my entire  lifetime. He is exactly the kind of partner Congress needs in order to  get the Constitution's warmaking process back on the rails--back on the  same rails that were designed in 1787.   Second, this resolution is not about condemning the strike against  General Soleimani last month. After all, the strike against Soleimani  worked. He was an enemy of the United States, with the blood of  hundreds of Americans and thousands of Iraqis, Syrians, and even other  Iranians on his hands. Everything we know about him and his work of  terror confirms that he was planning to kill again and to do so soon.   Rather, what this resolution is about is Congress reclaiming its  rightful powers to restore accountability and consensus to this most  grave of all public policy decisions that we, as Members of Congress,  are asked to make.   I understand why Members of Congress are OK with pretending to be  pundits on matters of national security, cheering the troops when  things go well and attacking the President when they don't, but we are  not just political pundits on cable news shows. We have a job to do  based on an oath that we took right here in this Chamber to uphold and  ``protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.''   In order to enable the President of the United States to do his job  correctly, we have to be willing to do ours. You see, this is part of  the evil design of the military industrial complex to convince Members  of Congress, first and foremost, that they don't have to and shouldn't  want to put their name on the line when it comes to war power. This  unfairly puts the blame and the accountability all on the President of  the United States. That is wrong.   Just as importantly, it disconnects the American people from their  elected representatives here in the Senate and in the House of  Representatives from a process that really could put not just American  treasure but also American blood--the blood of their own sons and  daughters--on the line. That is not right.   The Founders could not have been any clearer about this. That is  especially true when it comes to the greatest Founder of them all.  Remember when the Miami and Wabash Indians attacked Americans north of  the Ohio River between 1791 and 1794, President George Washington  carefully confined his military operations to exclusively defensive  measures. ``The Constitution,'' Washington wrote, ``vests the power of  declaring War with Congress, therefore no offensive expedition of  importance can be undertaken until after they shall have deliberated  upon the subject, and authorized such a measure.''  [[Page S1027]]    Our first President, George Washington, was a humble man, and he was  a modest man. One of my favorite paintings in this entire building can  be found in the Capitol Rotunda, where you see George Washington  handing his commission back to the Continental Congress. This at the  moment when he had ascended the apex of power; this at the moment when  he was the most respected, well-known person, certainly, in the Western  Hemisphere, possibly in the entire world; this at a moment when, in any  other land and any other point in world history, George Washington was  in a position to become a Monarch, a King, he chose not to be. He said  right then and right there: not on this soil; not on my watch. I am  handing my commission back to the Republican institution that employed  me to begin with.   So, yes, he was a humble man, and he was a modest man, but this  wasn't just an act of humility or modesty; it was duty. He understood  that he had taken an oath to uphold, protect, and defend the  Constitution of the United States. As President, he would not deviate  from it because he had taken an oath that he wouldn't.   Under the Constitution--whose drafting President Washington oversaw  before he was President of the United States, while he was President of  the Constitutional Convention and to which he swore an oath of office  later--the power to direct war would reside in him as President of the  United States as Commander in Chief, but the power to declare war  resided exclusively with Congress.   This was, of course, very different than the form of government that  we had left just a few years prior to that. Under our previous system  of government, the one based in London, the Parliament had no role in  declaring war. Declaring war was up to the Executive, the Monarch, the  King. The King could--and in many instances would and did--take the  country to war. It was the job of the legislative branch of government,  of the Parliament, to figure out what to do about it, how to fund it,  and where to go from there, but it was up to the King and the King  alone to take us to war.   This, Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 69, was exactly the  kind of system we didn't want. It would be up to Congress in the first  instance to declare war. Congress and Congress alone would have this  power. Why? Well, because it is the branch of government most  accountable to the people with the most regular intervals. When the  American people are called upon to put their own blood and treasure-- their own sons and daughters on the line in the name of safety,  security, freedom--nothing else can suffice but a vote in Congress.  George Washington understood that.   Donald Trump understands that today, and to his great credit,  President Trump has followed this standard. He has countered recent  Iranian aggression through economic sanctions. They are working, and it  appears that Iran is standing down. Tehran has already had to cut back  support for international terrorist organizations and its nuclear  program, and its oil exports are plummeting. Iran's economy has been  crippled, contracting by almost 10 percent. The Iranian people know it  is the fault of their own government, their own government officials.  Tens of thousands of Iranian protesters have taken to the streets to  protest their own government, even knowing that such action may lead  them to injury or imprisonment or even death.   Even the New York Times has admitted that the Iranian regime is  losing the will to confront the United States. There may be a pathway  to peace and prosperity for the Iranian people through sanctions relief  and trade if the Iranian Government is willing to cease its support for  radical Islamic militant organizations and abandon its pursuit of  nuclear weapons and ICBMs.   Until then, the United States, under President Trump's leadership,  will maintain maximum pressure through sanctions and defend the United  States from any further attacks.   I stand firmly behind President Trump in this course of action, and  like President Trump, I believe that we ought to avoid war if we can.  After nearly two decades of military entanglement in Iraq and  Afghanistan--much of which was fostered by Department of Defense  bureaucrats deceiving Congress and misleading the American people, as  we have recently tragically learned--the last thing we need is another  aimless, protracted conflict in the Middle East. The other last thing  we need is to have such a conflict occur without Congress even  authorizing it.   In any event, war with Iran is currently neither warranted nor  consistent with our strategic interests. To be very clear, under this  resolution, the President would retain all of his authority as  Commander in Chief to take defensive measures against active threats to  U.S. persons, assets, and the homeland, including our Armed Forces  abroad and our diplomats in U.S. Embassies, even without a declaration  of war or authorization for the use of military force. Such power  inheres and resides in article II. He already has that power. Nothing  in this resolution can or would or even attempts to undermine or erode  that power.   However, even when defensive measures are conducted, the  administration should share the justifying evidence with Congress.  This, you see, is how this inherent tension between, on the one hand,  the congressional war declaration of power in article I and, on the  other hand, the article II power that the President has as Commander in  Chief. This is how they are held in balance. It is for that  information-sharing process to be ongoing.   As a separate branch of government--the branch with the  constitutional prerogative over the power to declare war--we are not  required to simply accept an administration's talking points as a  matter of faith, especially after almost two decades of deception in  Afghanistan. Intelligence-sharing ensures that Congress can  appropriately determine whether it should or should not provide the  administration with further authority to conduct offensive military  force.   The intelligence so far shared with Congress on recent actions taken  against Iran has fallen short, but my main concern with the briefing  that I called the ``worst'' that I had ever witnessed on military  matters in my more than 9 years in the Senate was that we were given no  indication, whatsoever, that any ongoing offensive action against Iran  would occur with consultation and authorization from Congress. This was  inexcusable.   This was, moreover, not the President's approach. It was not  something that would have occurred in the President's presence. It  certainly is not something that would have been communicated by the  President, himself, because this is not how Donald Trump operates. That  briefing was not the President's fault. That briefing was the fault of  individuals who decided to go off on a detour of their own, forgetting  whom they represent. Worst of all, in that briefing, it was suggested  that engaging in public debate, discussion, and deliberation about  further military action in Iran--in other words, precisely what we are  doing right here and right now--would somehow empower our enemies and  undermine the morale of our men and women overseas. This is as false as  it is insulting to the American people and demeaning to the  constitutional framework to which each of us has sworn an oath. It is  contrary to our very form of government.   Constitutionally separated powers, exercised with accountability to  the people via checks and balances, are precisely what makes the United  States strong. Bowing to the politicians' impulse to avoid  responsibility and subvert our constitutional duty--that is what  empowers our enemies and undermines the morale of our Nation.    Whether the United States sends our young men and women into harm's  way, yet again, is on us--not to cheer or jeer but, rather, to decide  and stand accountable for. So, of course, that decision ought to be  made at the end of a very public debate that requires not only our  attention but our contributions and, ultimately, our assent. Our names  have to be on the line if we are going to offer up our fellow beings to  stand in harm's way.   For too long, Congress has deliberately and in a very cowardly manner  shrunk from its constitutional responsibility for its own narrow,  selfish, shallow, political interests. Yet, by taking itself out of the  process of debating and declaring war, Congress has taken the American  people out of the process, and that is simply unacceptable.  [[Page S1028]]    It is time to turn the page.   Osama bin Laden is dead, and so are the 9/11 terrorists. General  Soleimani is dead, and Iran is weakened and isolated. Saddam Hussein is  dead and has been out of power for a generation, and Iraq is a  sovereign nation that can and should dictate its own course. We now  face new challenges. Our priorities have rightfully changed, and they  must.   While this resolution speaks only to offensive action against Iran, I  believe it is time to repeal the 2002 AUMF and bring our troops in Iraq  home. It is also time to repeal the 2001 AUMF and bring our troops in  Afghanistan home. That is a question that we can and should address in  this body.   In the meantime, we as a body and as a nation should at least agree  that there is no justification for further military action in Iran in  the absence of a new authorization for use of military force or a  declaration of war by Congress.   This resolution is consistent with the President's desire to keep us  out of excessive, unnecessary, and especially undeclared,  unconstitutional wars. It is consistent with the vision of our Founding  Fathers, who sought to make it harder to enter into war by the  requiring of express consent from a bicameral legislature, and it is  consistent with the conviction that the American people, whose sons and  daughters lay down their lives to defend us, should get a say in this  matter.   President Trump wants to make America great again. I stand with him.  The military-industrial complex wants to make America Great Britain  again, and I stand strongly against the military-industrial complex.  Making America Great Britain again would include such things as giving  the executive the power and keeping the legislative branch out of the  power of declaring war. That is wrong. That is not what our  Constitution allows. It is not even what President Trump wants. We need  to support this resolution.                     Commemorating Utah Women's Suffrage    Mr. President, on February 14, 1870, a remarkable thing happened in  Utah--something that changed the course of history not just in our  State but in our entire Nation.   Seraph Young, a 23-year-old schoolteacher, became the first American  woman to cast a vote in a political election under an equal suffrage  law. It was a moment that both followed and preceded a long line of  remarkable contributions from Utah women--women who have pioneered and  led in our State and in our Nation.   Take Mary Fielding Smith, the wife of Hyrum Smith, who was one of the  early leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After  Hyrum was murdered, the resilient widow followed in Brigham Young's  footsteps. She took her children and led a group of pioneers across  1,300 miles of wilderness into the West. Through a combination of faith  and grit, she braved treacherous weather, a massive buffalo stampede,  and a myriad of hazards and successfully led the entourage to a  settlement where they could build a new life and live in freedom.   Other Utah women continued to blaze trails, and Martha Hughes Cannon  stands out among them. At a time when women rarely went to college,  Martha aspired to be a medical doctor. She earned a degree in both  medicine and pharmaceuticals. A skilled public speaker, she also earned  degrees in oratory and public speaking, which gave her four degrees by  the time she was 25 years old. In the late 19th century, she quickly  became a leader in Utah's burgeoning women's suffrage movement, and she  put her speaking skills to good use.   At a large suffrage meeting in 1889, held at Temple Square, she  argued:         No privileged class either of sex, wealth, or descent       should be allowed to rise or exist. All persons should have       the [same] legal right to be the equal of every other.    In the first year that women could vote and run in a Utah election,  Martha ran as a Democrat for one of the five State Senate seats. She  even ran against her own husband. She became the first woman to be  elected as a State senator either in Utah or in any other jurisdiction  in the United States, and she went on to sponsor many successful and  influential legislative proposals. All the while she was in public  office, she continued to run her private medical practice and raise her  three children.   It is, indeed, fitting that we will soon be installing a statue of  this extraordinary woman here in the U.S. Capitol Building.   Fast-forward to today, when Utah women are continuing to carry the  banner of public leadership and service.   We have Ruth Watkins as president of the University of Utah; Astrid  Tuminez as president of Utah Valley University; Noelle E. Cockett as  president of Utah State University; Deneece Huftalin as president of  Salt Lake Community College; and Beth Dobkin as president of  Westminster College.   We have Gail Miller, philanthropist and entrepreneur, who took over  the ownership of the Utah Jazz after Larry, her late husband, died. She  took over his other companies as well. She has led the team and  companies with exceptional grace, dedication, and success and has  helped their philanthropic arm champion education, homelessness, and  family causes. We also have Carine Clark, president and CEO of Banyan,  who is forging paths in Silicon Slopes and Utah's tech community.   In all different capacities and in all different fields, Utah women  are continuing to make invaluable contributions in our State and in our  Nation. These women have offered and continue to offer much needed  gifts to their families, communities, schools, churches, businesses,  and governments.   When Martha Hughes Cannon spoke before a U.S. Senate committee about  the success of women's suffrage in Utah, she said: ``The story of the  struggle for Woman's suffrage in Utah is the story of all efforts for  the advancement and betterment of humanity.''   As we approach the 150th anniversary of Seraph Young's groundbreaking  vote and as we enter the centennial year of the 19th Amendment, it is  only fitting that we honor the legacy of these remarkable women and all  they have given to my State and to our country.   I yield the floor.
