 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  2372, the Veterans Equal Treatment Ensures Relief and Access Now, or  VETERAN, Act, which I am proud to sponsor along with Congressman Sam  Johnson from Texas and a number of our colleagues.   The VETERAN Act would codify an existing Internal Revenue Service  regulation, allowing a veteran who is eligible for but not enrolled in  the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system to use a tax  credit to purchase health insurance. Language that would have codified  that regulation in law was removed from a draft version of the American  Health Care Act in 2017 earlier this year to comply with Senate rules.   While the removal of that language from the version of the bill that  ultimately passed the House in no way changed existing regulation or a  veteran's eligibility to receive a tax credit pursuant to it, it did  form a basis for politically charged assertions that the American  Health Care Act would harm veterans.   First, congressional intent is clear. Second, I am confident that the  IRS would interpret the relevant language of the American Health Care  Act in the same manner as it did similar language in the Affordable  Care Act under the President Obama administration.   Nevertheless, I am glad that the passage of the VETERAN Act today  will, once and for all, put an end to posturing over this issue and  codify Congress' expectation that veterans who are eligible for but not  enrolled in the VA healthcare system may continue to receive applicable  tax credits to purchase health insurance.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the passage of  the VETERAN Act today.
