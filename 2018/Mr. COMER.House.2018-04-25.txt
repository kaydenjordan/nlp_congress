 Mr. Speaker, I rise in celebration of a lifelong friend  and neighbor, Mrs. Dora Duncan Gillenwater Bartley of my hometown of  Tompkinsville, in the First District of Kentucky, who is celebrating  her 100th birthday today.   Dora Bartley's dedication to serving others rivals only her love for  her husband, James Dale Bartley, and their seven children.   Known throughout Monroe County for her abundant compassion and  unwavering work ethic, she has not only cared for her family, but also  welcomed abused and orphaned women and children into her home and  treated them as her own.  [[Page H3563]]    Throughout her life, she has been guided by her steadfast commitment  to her faith and has worked tirelessly for the benefit of others, not  only during her service as deputy jailer, but even after her retirement  through her involvement in distributing commodities and serving her  fellow senior citizens.   I am deeply thankful for her friendship and guidance throughout my  life, and I am honored to join with her friends and family, as well as  all who have benefited from her generous spirit, in celebrating this  milestone achievement. I wish Dora Bartley a happy 100th birthday and  many more joyful years filled with blessings.                            ____________________
