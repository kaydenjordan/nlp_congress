Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson of the House Committee on Science,  Space, and Technology, to waive consideration of H.R. 3684, as amended,  as well as my response to Chairwoman Johnson expressing appreciation  for her willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, the INVEST in America Act before us today is  generational transformational in terms of what we are going to do in  terms of 21st century surface transportation and water infrastructure.  We are going to move past the Eisenhower era of the 1950s.   During the Eisenhower era, the existential threat to the United  States was invasion or attack by Russia. The National Defense Highway  System was built to move military equipment to the coast, and it was  also built to evacuate our cities in times of nuclear war.   Now we have a different existential threat, which is climate change.  Tackling climate change is a Herculean task.   Some may ask: Why address it in the transportation bill?   In fact, we will hear that from the other side.   Because the transportation sector is the single largest carbon  emitter in the United States of America, and it would be foolish and  irresponsible to continue pouring taxpayer money into the old way of  thinking, that we must merely expand highways.   We know now that doing that creates induced demand. You add more  lanes, attract more cars and, before long, congestion returns and you  are right back where you started, except now you have bad traffic and  more carbon pollution.   According to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, in the last 25  years, we have built 35,000 lane miles in our 100 largest cities, and  the cost of congestion and delay have gone up six times.   Should we keep doing that?   No. It is not working.   There are alternatives. We have a great opportunity.   The infrastructure of the Eisenhower era is crumbling, threatening  safety, quality of life, and economic competitiveness. In fact, some of  the infrastructure we are living off, like the critical Baltimore rail  tunnel, was built in 1872. It is not going to last long. It is brick  and it is leaking water.   The tunnels under the Hudson are subject to failure in the not-too- distant future. They were built in 1908. We had great engineers at the  time, but now we have become so puny, we can't do big projects like  that.   No, that is not the United States of America. That is not the  American way. We can tackle these challenges, and we will. And climate  change is part of what we have to deal with.   I hear a lot from the other side about we want resilience.   Resilience to what? Sea level rise? Why is the sea level rising?   Hmm, I don't know.   Severe weather events?   Nope.   But in my region, just this week, an unprecedented heat wave-- unprecedented in the history of the United States and western Canada,  by far; 40 degrees above normal--pavement buckled and melted, cables  supplying power to transit melted, high tension lines sagged. Luckily,  we got the trees out from under them. They didn't cause fires this  time.   We have to rebuild this infrastructure to deal with the threats of  the 21st century, and this is a tremendous opportunity.   We have long had problems with inequality and racial injustice  perpetuated by transportation programs, policies, and funding  decisions. We have a major section in this bill to right those wrongs  and provide new opportunities for those communities and rejoin some of  those communities; social equity.   U.S. infrastructure was once the envy of the world. We are now 13th  and plummeting fast. We are kind of a joke around the world. China is  putting 6 percent of their GDP into transportation infrastructure. We  are putting in one-half of 1 percent.   We are going to compete with that?   Other competitive nations in Europe are putting in 2 or 3 percent of  their GDP. We are putting in a fraction of that.   You know, we have water mains that explode, sewers that back up, and  bridges that collapse. We have decrepit transit, $100 billion to bring  up to state of good repair, and it breaks down when people are trying  to get to work. We have potholes that cost every American between $560  and $1,000 a year in car repairs. The cost of delays is $170 billion,  which is way more than we are spending on investment in transportation  infrastructure.   A rising China is threatening to take over the future of  transportation in the world. We cannot let the Chinese do this yet  again and steal those jobs from America. We have to move toward the  future.   We have General Motors, all electric in 2035. The Ford electric  Mustang is outselling the fossil fuel Mustang. Hey, it is faster. I  have driven a semi-truck made by Volvo. But there are four  manufacturers making them, an 80,000-pound capable semi-tractor. Fred  Smith from FedEx is going all electric, but he says there is no place  to charge them.   We have to meet this challenge, and part of this bill is EV  challenging on the backbone of the national highway network.   We are also going to put significant funds into safety. We are having  huge  [[Page H3505]]  problems with safety: growing deaths in pedestrian, cycling, and  others. We have to promote those modes, make them safe. More people  will use them. We are making a major investment there, fossil fuel  free.   This bill is going to focus on bringing things to a state of good  repair. 47,000 bridges on the National Highway System need substantial  repair or replacement, and an infinite number of off-system bridges. We  are creating a new program for off-highway-system bridges; a new  program for rural bridges; a new program for the 10 most economically  significant bridges in the country, including ones like the Brent  Spence Bridge, which is going to collapse or be closed in 8 years,  connecting Kentucky and Ohio.    Those things are in this bill. If we don't do this bill, then we are  doomed to an even more inefficient and decrepit future.   We are going to make historic investments in transit, helping to  address, as I mentioned, the $100 billion state of good repair backlog.  We are closing the last loopholes in transit.   We are going to get two Chinese companies--predatory Chinese  companies out of here, making electric buses and rail. And we are going  to make all of that stuff in the United States of America and create  one heck of a lot of jobs. Maybe we will even export electric buses to  the rest of the world.   Then beyond that, you know, we are going to be a leader in the clean  energy economy. That is the future. It is the future. It is the  business case. It is where the corporations are going, except parts of  the fossil fuel industry. Even ExxonMobil is talking about spending  $100 billion on carbon capture and sequestration; even ExxonMobil.   But there are other parts of the fossil fuel industry that are, like,  ``No, you stick with us. Stick with fossil fuel. Don't allow them to do  this electrification stuff. Don't talk about climate change. Carbon  pollution doesn't do anything.''   No, none of that is true, and we have to deal with it.   It offers opportunities to communities of all sizes: urban, suburban,  and rural. There's a 50 percent increase for rural transit, $37 billion  from the Surface Transportation Program suballocated to local  communities, not the biggest cities. We create several new multimodal  discretionary grant programs, including the Community Transportation  and Community Climate grants, for local government applicants.   For the first time in a decade, we provided bipartisan member- designated projects. 109 Republicans applied for projects. Everyone was  offered $20 million under very strict guidelines agreed to by the  majority and the minority. We cleaned that up.   Some people are saying: Well, this is bad; it is poor.   No. Does the Federal DOT or your State DOT know what you need most in  your district? What your city needs? What your county needs?   You know better, but sometimes they just ignore it. They are focused  on the capitol; they are focused on the biggest cities; they are  focused on Washington, D.C., who knows what.   So we have those projects in this bill.   Someone said: Well, if the Republicans won't vote for it, are you  going to strip them out?   I said: No. These are meritorious projects that have gone through a  vetting process. They will stay in. This is helping local communities.   Now, I also have to say that we have had issues with the DBE-- Disadvantaged Business Enterprise--program at the Department of  Transportation. Discrimination is still a barrier for many to get into  constructing and maintaining our Surface Transportation Program.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a more comprehensive statement  about the need for this crucial program, along with a list of several  key studies on discrimination used to help inform the reauthorization  of the DBE program. It includes a historic $95 billion in rail  investment. That is about a 500 percent increase.   We are going to begin to join city pairs so people can get off the  highways.   Virginia is doing a great project. Instead of putting two more lanes,  which would be immediately congested, for $12 billion on I-95, they are  going to build a rail project with a new bridge over the Potomac River,  partnering with CSX for half the cost, and reduce congestion more and  give people a better commute. We need to be looking at that model  around the country.                                time  1715    The bill includes $32 billion for Amtrak. It also has money for a new  program, PRIME, the Passenger Rail Improvement, Modernization, and  Expansion program, a $25 billion competitive grant program for States  and localities to launch high-speed and intercity rail development.   It tackles big rail projects that need significant investment to get  off the ground. The $25 billion Bridges, Stations, and Tunnels, or  BeST--I mentioned the Baltimore tunnel earlier--directed grant program  funds bridges, stations, and tunnels that have total project costs of  $500 million or more, which cannot just be carried by local  communities.   I previously mentioned robust safety programs.   It also includes the first reauthorization of the Clean Water State  Revolving Fund since 1987.   When I was a county commissioner, we got a 75 percent match from the  Federal Government to build a system that is still serving a community  twice that size today. Today, if we went to the Federal Government for  a match, they would say, ``Sorry, we don't help you with wastewater.''   Wastewater does not observe city limits. It does not observe county  lines. It does not observe State lines. It does not observe  international boundaries. It is a national problem, and our communities  need help.   I was on a statewide call with county commissioners, 75 percent of  them Republicans. They are begging--begging--in these rural counties  for help with wastewater and drinking water. We have to step up to the  plate on that. This will be the first reauthorization in many, many  years.   We are going to move forward with this bill, and every part of this  bill is backed by the strongest Buy America requirements, labor  protections, and new investments in worker training safety. I wish some  of the other departments of the Federal Government, particularly the  Pentagon, would follow our model to create more jobs in America.   It is not enough just to transform it. We need to ensure our  investments create good-paying jobs, revitalize American manufacturing,  help us compete in the clean energy economy, and lead the world once  again, as we were the envy of the world in the 1970s and up to about  the early 1980s.   This is a chance to reform and rebuild our infrastructure for the  future. It is an opportunity to improve safety, equity, and access for  all Americans. It is an urgent call to confront the existential threat  of climate change and leave a better world for future generations.   This is a transformative bill that will improve mobility, economic  competitiveness, and the quality of life in communities across the  country. Infrastructure is calling, and Congress must finally answer  the call.   Chairman Peter DeFazio Statement for the Record on DBE Program and  Disparity Studies Submitted to the Record INVEST in America Act,  General Debate, June 30, 2021. I include in the Record:         The INVEST in America Act once again reauthorizes the       critically important Disadvantage Business Enterprise, or       DBE, program at the Department of Transportation.        Unfortunately, even with the DBE Program, discrimination       still haunts us in the market to construct and maintain our       federal surface transportation system. We hear about it from       constituents and others who work as contractors in the       transportation industry. We've read about it in personal       statements submitted by women- and minority- small business       owners from across the country. And we see it reflected in       mounds of statistical evidence compiled by my Committee. This       evidence includes many thousands of pages of rigorous       statistical analysis demonstrating clear disparities between       the capacity of minority- and women-owned businesses to       compete for federal dollars, and the utilization of that       capacity by federal contractors.        These studies represent thousands of pages of complex       rigorous analysis by many different authors in every region       of our nation. And while the findings are better than in the       early days of the DBE program, we still have a long way to       go. I'd like to just highlight a tiny fraction of the       information found in these studies:  [[Page H3506]]         Just so my colleagues don't think I am picking on their       states, let me start with Oregon. The 2016 ODOT Disparity       Study found that women- and minority-owned firms only won 61       cents on the dollar of what we would expect given their       availability on state and federally funded highway contracts.       Non-minority women, African Americans and Native Americans       did even worse at 52 cents, 58 cents and 49 cents       respectively.        In Texas DOT spending, women and minority owned firms as a       group won only 60 cents on the dollar of what we might have       expected for state-funded transportation projects given their       availability in the market. Non-minority women, African       Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans all did       worse. Indeed, African Americans won only 22 cents on the       dollar and Native Americans won only 18 cents on the dollar.       The numbers were even worse when considering only federal       funds--32 cents on the dollar when considering Federal       Highway Administration contracts alone.        For Maryland, which has had one of the more robust and       continuously operated DBE programs in the nation, DBEs still       get only 70 cents on the dollar of combined federal and state       transportation funding. For African Americans, the number is       50 cents, for Native Americans it's 43 cents and for non-      minority women, the number is 56 cents.        Sadly, in the transit industry, things are not much better.       For instance, an analysis of contracting for the Los Angeles,       California, Metropolitan Transportation Authority, found that       firms owned by women and minorities make about 74 cents on       the dollar of what we would expect given their representation       in the marketplace. For non-minority women, the number was 59       cents and for African Americans it was 51 cents.        These same troubling statistics are repeated in cities and       states that spend some of their budgets on surface       transportation and similar construction, architecture, and       engineering projects. For instance, the 2018 study for the       Nashville, Tennessee area found that women- and minority-      owned business enterprises got 54 cents of every one dollar       in construction prime contracting; Asian American firms were       at 25 cents on the dollar; and firms owned by Hispanic       Americans earned only 1 cent of every dollar of what we would       expect given their marketplace representation.        There's no doubt that things are better today than before       the DBE Program--more firms owned by women and minorities get       work than they did forty years ago. But the progress has been       slow, halting, and exceedingly fragile. One of the powerful       things about the disparity study evidence we have collected       is the diversity of approaches and analyses these documents       provide. Some studies, for instance, not only study       disparities in the public and private surface transportation       markets, but they also attempt to analyze what might occur if       the DBE program no longer existed. One interesting example is       found in the LA Metro study where they compared the       participation of minority- and women-owned firms on contracts       that had goals to encourage diverse participation and those       that did not. The results are stunning. On contracts with       goals, participation occurred at almost the level we would       expect given the presence of minority- and women-owned firms       in the marketplace and firms owned by minorities and women       earned 96 cents on the dollar--on contracts without goals,       they earned 53 cents on the dollar. The numbers are even more       startling for certain subgroups. On contracts with goals,       non-minority women actually exceeded parity (something that       regularly occurs for firms owned by non-minority males, but       rarely happens for firms owned by women and minorities). But       on contracts without goals, firms owned by non-minority women       earned only 37 cents on the dollar. Firms owned by Hispanic       Americans approached parity on contracts with goals (98 cents       on the dollar), but on contracts without goals, they earned       only 59 cents on the dollar. African American owned firms       earned only 64 cents on the dollar even on contracts with       goals, and on contracts without goals the number plummeted to       30 cents on the dollar.        Tragically, the COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated the need       for the DBE program. Preliminary data on the pandemic's       economic devastation shows a massively disproportionate       impact on small businesses in minority communities. An       article by Dr. Robert Fairlie published last year by the       Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, uses       statistics from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey       to illustrate just how devastating the COVID-19 pandemic has       already been for firms owned by minorities and women. His       analysis examines the drop in ``active businesses'' comparing       the numbers from mid-February 2020, just before the effects       of the pandemic became clear in the United States, to mid-      April, when the economy in much of the country had shut down.       During that time, all businesses experienced economic       devastation--but because of discrimination, the devastation       was far greater for businesses owned by women and minorities.       For instance, during this period the number of active       businesses owned by whites dropped 17 percent, but the number       of businesses owned by African Americans dropped 41 percent.       For Hispanic businesses, the number was 32 percent and for       firms owned by Asian Americans the drop was 26 percent. These       numbers are not just troubling, they are staggering, and the       pandemic is still not over.        Now, more than ever, as we prepare to spend billions of       federal dollars on transportation projects, it is urgent that       we ensure the process of awarding federal transportation       contract dollars is not discriminatory, and that minorities       and women are allowed to compete on an equal playing field       for those dollars.        Below is a list of dozens of disparity studies held on file       with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure       demonstrating the continued need for this essential program:              State and Local Disparity Studies From 2015-2021                                    Alaska         Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities       Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Study, Final Report & Final       Appendices, Prepared by the Alaska Department of       Transportation & Public Facilities Civil Rights Office       (2020).

[[Page H3508]]          Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.          House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                     Washington, DC, June 21, 2021.      Hon. Peter A. Defazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Defazio: I am writing you concerning H.R.       3684, the ``INVEST in America Act,'' which was ordered to be       reported out of the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure on June 10, 2021. Prior to this, I submitted a       jurisdictional claim letter for a sequential referral on this       bill on June 7, 2021 and the Office of the Parliamentarian       found this claim to be valid.        As a result of cooperative consultations with the Committee       on Science, Space, and Technology (``Science Committee'') and       in the interest an expedient consideration of H.R. 3684       before the House of Representatives, I will waive formal       consideration of this bill. I take this action with a mutual       understanding between our two Committees that by foregoing       consideration of H.R. 3684, the Science Committee does not       waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       this, or in similar, legislation.        Furthermore, I humbly request a letter confirming this       understanding and that this exchange of letters be included       in the bill report to be filed by the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure as well as included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       Finally, I ask that you support the appointment of Science       Committee conferees during any House-Senate conference       convened on this legislation.            Sincerely,                                          Eddie Bernice Johnson,                                   Chairwoman, Committee on Science,      Space, and Technology.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                      Washington DC, June 21, 2021.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Johnson: Thank you for your letter       regarding H.R. 3684, the INVEST in America Act. I appreciate       your decision to waive formal consideration of the bill.        I agree that the Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology (``Science Committee'') has valid jurisdictional       claims to certain provisions in this important legislation,       and I further agree that by forgoing formal consideration of       the bill, the Science Committee is not waiving any       jurisdiction over any relevant subject matter. Additionally,       I will support the appointment of conferees from the Science       Committee should a House-Senate conference be convened on       this legislation. Finally, this exchange of letters will be       included in the committee report filed by the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure and included in the       Congressional Record when the bill is considered on the       floor.        Thank you again, and I look forward to continuing to work       collaboratively with the Science Committee to ensure H.R.       3684 passes the House and is enacted into law.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,                                                             Chair.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), the chair of the Surface  Transportation Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Payne), the chair of the Railroads, Pipelines, and  Hazardous Materials Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Johnson), the chair of the Science, Space and Technology  Committee, and a senior member of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Huffman), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Titus), the chair of the Economic Development, Public  Buildings, and Emergency Management Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Brown), a member of the committee.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Ms. Bourdeaux).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Ms. Williams), a new and esteemed member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Malinowski), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining on  both sides?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Stanton), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Kansas (Ms. Davids), the vice chair of the committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, we have heard a lot from their side that we should  have worked with them. They offered an alternative. They have talked a  lot about how we are not putting money into bridges and highways. We  are putting in $333 billion, and they put in $310 billion, and I am not  even sure that they included anything on safety. They had zero on  rail--zero--and status quo for transit. That is a 21st century  transportation bill?   As I mentioned earlier, we have built 35,000 lane miles in the  hundred largest cities. Guess what? They are running out of space. They  have to tear down neighborhoods to build any more, and it is not  working.   Congestion is six times worse than it was 35 years ago. Americans  waste $170 billion a year in congestion. Business wastes time in  congestion.   We need to solve these problems, and we have to look at new ways of  solving these problems. What we have been doing since Dwight David  Eisenhower was great at the time. It doesn't work in the 21st century.   They continue to deny the threat of climate change or even the  existence of climate change. I tried to say: Okay, you can't  acknowledge climate change. Trump won't let you do that, and fossil  fuel contributors won't let you do that. How about this? You  acknowledge that there is a business case to be made.    GM is going all electric, all electric in 2035. Where are they going  to charge? You have four companies making 80,000-pound tractor semis.  Fred Smith, FedEx, going all electric in the near term--no place to  charge them except at fleet headquarters. They have to be able to  charge on the road.   But, no, we shouldn't invest in EV charging. We should just keep  doing the same thing. We should keep polluting the atmosphere.   But they do believe in resilience. We have to build up Louisiana and  other places, Florida, to deal with sea level rise. Why is the sea  level rising? We have to deal with extraordinary, unprecedented climate  events. We have to deal with those in rebuilding our infrastructure.  ``Oh, no. Why is that happening?'' ``Don't worry about that.''   We will do that, but we will not go to the root cause.   We are doing all three. We are rebuilding resilient; we are  rebuilding America and creating jobs. We are making the country more  efficient. And we are dealing with climate change. This is the 21st  century. Deal with the threats of the 21st century.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 508, I rise  to offer amendments en bloc No. 3.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendments en bloc, which  provides for the consideration of 19 amendments.   The amendments contained in this en bloc amend various provisions of  the bill. They would strike some of the highest priorities in a bill.  We just heard an impassioned speech from the gentleman from Louisiana,  talking about Louisiana sea-level rise, sinking, and all that, and  wanting to take on China and the world economy.   Well, guess what?   They are building the future. That is EVs and AVs. And they want to  strike all of the provisions in the bill that will provide for electric  charging.   So Fred Smith, no liberal Democrat going all electric with FedEx. GM,  going all electric. Four truck manufacturers making 80,000-pound  capable tractors. No charging stations in America.   Oh, that is not supposed to be the future?   That is the future. That is the future.   And we also--yeah, we deal with climate change. And I know you don't  believe in climate change on that side of the aisle. That is fine. I  wish you lived up where I do. You might just get a sample of what the  future is like.   Now, this strikes the Fix-It-First requirements that prioritize state  of good repair.   Oh, great. Let's go lay down more lane miles; 35,000 lane miles, the  hundred largest cities in America in the last 25 years, and congestion  is six times worse. It is called induced demand. Don't provide transit  alternatives. They kill transit. They kill rail. We are just going to  build more highways. We are going to pave over the entire city.   How much of it are you going to knock down?                                time  1945    It is not going to work. It didn't work. It hasn't been working. So  it is time to do something different.   It is time to fix what we have, the Eisenhower legacy, 47,000 bridges  in the National Highway System in desperate need of repair or  replacement, tens of thousands in rural areas and counties, new  programs in this bill to deal with those rural areas and counties.   They take out the $4 billion Clean Corridors program, as I said, for  EV charging and hydrogen fueling.   Madam Speaker, $8.3 billion for carbon pollution--they don't believe  in carbon pollution because the parts of the fossil fuel industry that  are enlightened are big contributors, and Donald Trump says we can't  believe in climate change. So, okay, got to take that out.   It prohibits any expenditures out of the highway trust fund, except  for road and bridge construction. That means no safety.   We are having record numbers of pedestrian and cycling deaths, and  this bill is going to make it safer for people to use alternative modes  in urban, suburban, and rural areas.   I am building a bike lane on a highway in a rural area that is  heavily trafficked by bikers to a winery in my district where there  have been fatalities. But, no, none of that. None of that in the bill.  We don't care about the pedestrian deaths. We don't care about the  cycling deaths. We don't care about safety. None of that. None of that  is in their proposal.   They say we are not doing enough on highways. We are doing more than  $20 billion more than they are on highways and bridges. But, oh, we are  ignoring the problem. No, we are not.   They eliminate the Capital Investment Grant Program in its entirety.   They allow the transfer of rural and small urban transit funding to  highways. I represent a very, very large district, bigger than a number  of your States, and I have a lot of rural areas and small cities, and  they want to have some options for transit. You would eliminate that.  Okay.   It eliminates rail funding: no Amtrak, no passenger rail.   Highways are funded at a lower level than we do, and that is going to  take care of the problem. That is kind of laughable.   These are just some of the really bad ideas in this amendment. This  is not the path to the future, not the path to the 21st century. It is  the path of the failed policies of the late 20th century that don't  work anymore.   We also need to hold States accountable. I know some States don't  like that. They don't want to be held accountable. They don't want to  fix it first. They don't want to be held accountable for fossil fuel  pollution. If you don't believe in climate change, you don't care: What  is the problem with fossil fuel pollution?   So this is ``Groundhog Day'' on their side of the aisle. Let's bring  back the failed policies of the 1990s and the early 2000s. Yes, they  were bipartisan, but they didn't deal with 21st century problems.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the balance of time  on each side.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Payne), who is the Chair of the Railroads, Pipelines,  and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 508, I offer  amendments en bloc Number 4.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this en bloc amendment,  which provides for the consideration of 38 amendments filed by Members  and made in order by the Committee on Rules. The amendments contained  in this en bloc touch upon various policy areas in the base bill.   The surface transportation amendments include:   Expressing the sense of Congress on the importance of protecting  workers in transition to electric vehicles.   Promoting a more diverse transportation workforce and more inclusive  work sites for infrastructure projects.   Allowing high-performing local public agencies to utilize enhanced  project delivery methods when appropriate.   Expanding the number of veterans in the transportation sector through  the Transportation Workforce Outreach Program.   Requiring EV supply equipment projects to be performed by qualified  electricians with proper certification.   Adding language to increase bridge resiliency for seismic events.   Strengthening reporting requirements under the Reconnecting  Neighborhoods Program.   Allowing private high-speed rail projects access to credit risk  premium subsidies for rail financing to develop high-speed rail  projects.   These are just some of the highlights of the amendments included. I  thank my colleagues for their thoughtful amendments to improve the  INVEST in America Act. I urge the adoption of the amendment. I will  remember to vote properly this time, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett).    I totally concur in the amendment.    Absolutely, I concur with the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Escobar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi).    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Well, we have heard the same tired arguments: Over 200 amendments in  committee from the Republicans.   And today, all day, on the floor: Not bipartisan.   It is pretty simple, if you deny climate change and you deny the need  to do things differently than the failures of the last 30 years in  building 35,000 lane miles and making congestion worse in our 100  largest cities; and you don't want to fund transit; and you don't want  to fund rail options; and transit includes rural areas and small  cities, which is a new emphasis in this program; if you don't want to  repair America's 47,000 crumbling bridges and national highway system,  you are proposing $20 billion less than we are for repairing bridges  and highways.   You object to the fact that we want States to fix things first, and  also to look at alternatives to paving over the whole country and  causing more induced congestion. You deny climate change. You deny  fossil fuel pollution.   I hope you don't go through what my region just went through. We have  had 50 people die in Portland. No one has air-conditioning there; two- thirds of the people don't. It has never been--it was 45 degrees above  normal. This is not normal.   Climate change is real. Keep up the denial and you are going to  destroy this country and the planet.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this totally contradicts the intent of the Congestion  Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program, a relatively small  program in terms of the entire bill, but a very, very important  program.   As I mentioned earlier, we have been doing the same thing for 30  years. 30,511 new freeway lane-miles in and around our 100 largest  urban areas. The cost of delay has gone from $16 billion a year to $166  billion a year, which wastes way more than we are spending to deal with  the problem, and delay is up a staggering 144 percent and pollution is  worse.   So this is an amendment that would say, okay, you can take the money  to deal with congestion mitigation and air quality, you can spend it to  build an HOV lane, and then after you toll people on that HOV lane-- maybe like in Virginia where you can pay $48 for 10 miles in the  Bentley lane during rush hour sometimes--and then they pay back the  money, then they convert it to a single-occupancy vehicle lane, voila,  we are back at another induced-demand congested road, the same  Groundhog Day strategy we have been doing for 30 years that doesn't  work.   HOV lanes and other operational improvements are eligible under the  CMAQ program. They are part of the solution, but not in this form. They  allow more people to move more efficiently in the most congested  transportation corridors by getting more than one person per car. But  this would only do that temporarily and then revert to one person per  car. Great idea.   So it allows van pools, car pools, and transit in these lanes. They  benefit all drivers. So in this case, we would say, well, yeah, for a  while, they will benefit car pools, van pools, and transit, but then we  are going to go back to putting single-occupancy vehicles in them. That  is not a solution to the problem.   It is of particular concern, because it allows for HOV restrictions  to be repealed without any analysis of the impacts on the traffic in  the corridor. Under this proposal, as I said, all of those who have  begun to use it, the families, transit riders, car poolers in HOV  lanes, they are going to go back into gridlock traffic with everybody  else. It is an extraordinarily bad idea whose time has not come.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, perhaps the gentlewoman has an absolute unique  circumstance in her district or her State. But to make this a national  policy for a program that is intended to deal with congestion  management and air quality would be a huge mistake.   I cannot support the amendment, I urge people to vote ``no,'' and I  yield back the balance of my time.
