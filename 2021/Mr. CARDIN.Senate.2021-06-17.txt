 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I take this time as the Chair of the  Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, better known as the  Helsinki Commission, as we celebrate our 45th anniversary.   The Helsinki Commission is the vehicle for U.S. participation in the  Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, representing 57  states that have come together under the OSCE, all the countries of  Europe, all the countries of the former Soviet Union, including those  located in Central Asia, the United States, and Canada.   Mr. President, this is a unique body in that it represents both the  executive and legislative branches of government. The executive branch  has representatives on the Helsinki Commission, and both the House and  Senate have Senators and Representatives that serve on the Helsinki  Commission.   I am very pleased to have as my co-leader Senator Wicker from  Mississippi as the Republican leader in the Senate on the Helsinki  Commission.   The Helsinki Commission has been responsible for elevating our moral  dimension to U.S. foreign policy. Its principles point out very clearly  that you cannot have security without dealing with good governance and  human rights; you cannot have economic progress unless you have  governance that respects the rights of all its citizens.   That is why I was so pleased when President Biden announced that his  foreign policy would be value-based, that as we participate in our  foreign policy challenges, it will always be wrapped in our values, and  his recent trip to Europe underscored that important lesson. And then  he issued, not 2 weeks ago, the statement that corruption is a core  national security threat and that we have a responsibility to fight  corruption in order to protect our national security.    I am so pleased of the accomplishments of the Helsinki Commission,  particularly from the human rights and human dimension. I go back to my  early days in the House of Representatives, when the Soviet Union still  existed and the challenges of Soviet Jews trying to emigrate from the  Soviet Union. It was the Helsinki Commission that was one of the  leading voices to help deal with Soviet Jews.   I think about trafficking in persons, modern-day slavery, and the  efforts that the United States did in leading that effort, including  passing landmark legislation in trafficking in persons and establishing  a rating system where every country in the world is rated on how well  they are dealing with fighting trafficking. Now this has become the  model, and so many countries have acted. It was the U.S. Helsinki  Commission that led the effort for what Congress was able to pass and  the international effort in order to fight trafficking in persons.   I think about the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against  humanity and genocide, and recognize that it was the Helsinki  Commission that pushed to hold those who were responsible for these  atrocities accountable, particularly as it related to the Balkan  conflict.   Then I think about the landmark legislation that was passed in the  Congress that deals with sanctions against  [[Page S4611]]  human rights violators, first the Magnitsky sanctions and then the  Global Magnitsky sanctions. It came out of hearings from the Helsinki  Commission and legislation that we authored. It is not only the  standard here in the United States. It has been adopted as the standard  in Europe, in Canada, and in other countries, to make it clear that  human rights violators will not be able to hide their illicit funds in  our banking system or visit our country.   Perhaps our strongest contribution is the oversight hearings that we  hold. We also passed the Elie Wiesel Atrocities Prevention Act. But  just last week we had a hearing in the Helsinki Commission on how we  can prevent atrocities from occurring in the first place. So I am very  proud of the accomplishments of the Commission.   Part of the responsibilities of every member state of the OSCE is  that we have the right to challenge any state's compliance with the  Helsinki Final Act Accords. So it is our responsibility to challenge  when Russia violates those provisions or we see violations in Turkey-- any member state you can challenge.   But we also have to do our own self-evaluation. As chairman of the  Commission, I have been using that opportunity to question conduct in  our own country when it does not match the responsibilities that we  should have. We saw that in the past in regard to the torture issues in  Guantanamo Bay.   My participation in the Helsinki Commission goes back to my early  days in the House of Representatives and some of my proudest moments of  representing our country on the international stage. Let me just give  you a few examples.   In February 1991, I joined a fact-finding mission to Latvia,  Lithuania, and Estonia. That is when the Soviet tanks were in Vilnius.  That is when the Soviet Union was demonstrating oppression against the  people of the Baltic States. It was a very sad moment of oppression,  and we went there to stand up for the people of the region, to let them  know that the United States never recognized the Soviet's occupation of  the Baltic States, and that we stood with the people and their  independence.   It was very interesting. We went from there to Moscow, and Mikhail  Gorbachev didn't want to have anything to do with us. He wouldn't have  a meeting with us, and he wouldn't acknowledge that we were there. But  we had a meeting with Boris Yeltsin, who at that time was the chair of  the parliament, and we got great visibility. And Yeltsin supported our  efforts to condemn the Russian use of force.   I have been to Germany several times. My first trip on behalf of the  Helsinki Commission was when it was a divided country, and we went to  East Berlin. We were the voices for those oppressed people whose voices  could not otherwise be heard, and we gave them hope that one day they  would see freedom.   I then returned when we were literally taking down the Berlin Wall,  and I joined in taking down part of the Berlin Wall. I have part of  that as a prized possession in my home.   I have returned to Germany as a united country and see what a  democratic Germany means and the work of our Commission to bring down  the Iron Curtain. Germany is now a leading democratic state and a great  ally of the United States.   I have been to Kiev, Ukraine, on several occasions. I was there  during the Maidan protests, where the people demanded democracy. And  then I had a chance to return and monitor the elections in Ukraine with  Senator Portman--again, a country that has been able to rid itself of  the oppression of the Soviet Union.   I have been very active in the Helsinki Commission in regards to the  Parliamentary Assembly. I chaired one of their three standing  committees. I had a chance to become vice president at the  Parliamentary Assembly.   Today, I acknowledge Senator Wicker, who is vice president. It points  out the bipartisan nature of the Helsinki Commission and our work on  the international platform                            ____________________     Mr. President, we could not have accomplished any of  these achievements without an incredible dedicated staff to the mission  of the Helsinki Commission, and I want to just acknowledge one  individual who recently announced that she is retiring, Erika Schlager,  after 34 years of service to the Commission and to the global  community.   Erika received her bachelor's degree from the University of North  Carolina in Greensboro, where she graduated magna cum laude and was  elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She earned her A.M. degree from Harvard  University in Soviet Union studies and her juris doctor degree with  honors from the George Washington University Law School. She studied at  Warsaw University as a Fulbright fellow and received a diploma from the  International Institute of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. Quite a  record.   She used that academic preparation to make a difference in the  world--and what a difference she made. Erika has been an unfailing  professional in her dedication to doing whatever is necessary to ensure  that the Commission meets its mandate and defends human rights abroad.  Her deep expertise, which she has honed over decades of work, is  renowned both among policy professionals in the United States and in  the countries of Central Europe that she followed for the Commission.   Erika is one of our Nation's top experts on Europe's most vulnerable  communities. She is a leading voice on Roma rights--Europe's largest  minority, with significant populations also in the United States.   I have joined Erika in the crusade to speak up for the Roma  population, a group that has been denied citizenship in so much of  Europe. What a difference she has made in their lives.   Erika has worked with Members of Congress, the Department of State  and the OSCE to address issues ranging from the enslavement and  sterilization of Roma to a permanent memorial in Berlin dedicated to  the Sinti and Roma victims of the Nazi regime, to annual recognition of  International Roma Day.   She has brought to my attention the candidacy of Ethel Brooks to be  the first Roma board member of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. I  know that Erika will continue to bring Roma perspective and history on  the Holocaust to further the tolerance, education, and human rights  work of the museum.   I have the honor of representing the Senate on the Holocaust Memorial  Museum board, and I can tell you that Erika is so deeply respected by  the professionals at that museum for the work she has done in  furthering the goal of that institution to prevent atrocities against  any groups of people.   Erika has long been one of my top advisers on the Holocaust  restitution and Europe's Jewish community. She has worked closely with  me over the years to raise concerns about the rise of Holocaust  revisionism in countries like Hungary and Poland; to foster  implementation of the Terezin Declaration on Holocaust Era Assets  measures to right the economic wrongs that accompanied the Holocaust;  and to hold accountable a French railway that transported thousands of  Holocaust victims to their deaths. She worked on all of these issues  and made significant progress.   Erika has been instrumental in ensuring that the Helsinki Commission  works to hold the United States accountable for our own human rights  record, examining U.S. policies and conduct concerning Guantanamo Bay  detention camps and U.S. policy regarding torture.   Erika's counsel greatly assisted me in my role as the Parliamentary  Assembly of the OSCE's Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism,  and Intolerance, where I was focused on human rights and justice here  at home and across the expanse of the 57 participating states of the  OSCE.   From the plight of African Americans and Muslims to migrants and  refugees, Erika has been integral to the Helsinki Commission's mandate  of upholding the myriad of human rights commitments defined in the  Helsinki Final Act and subsequent OSCE agreements.   In addition to her many professional milestones and achievements,  Erika retires from the Commission having left a deeply personal mark on  those she worked with, from diplomats and civil servants to the staff  of the Helsinki Commission. She is a natural teacher  [[Page S4612]]  with a gift of taking a complex issue and distilling it in a way that  makes it both relevant and accessible.   Erika has taught our diplomats at the Foreign Service Institute and  spoken at international meetings and at universities across the Nation  and around the world. She displayed her exceptional teaching ability at  the Department of State's annual training program on Roma rights, and  she has ensured that Roma civil society groups could also participate.   She has actively sought out dialogue and collaboration with new  colleagues to help deepen their understanding of the Helsinki  Commission's role, of the challenges the Commission could usefully seek  to address abroad, and of the unique tools at its disposal to do just  that.   Erika is always quick to ask about a colleague's well-being or  inquire after a family member's well-being. She has fostered  collegiality among the Commission's staff through her unfailing  kindness and good nature. In so doing, she has repeatedly demonstrated  how deeply she cares, not just for the work she has dedicated her  career to but also for the people whose great privilege it is to call  her a colleague and a friend.   I will say on a personal basis that I have benefited so much from her  friendship, from her understanding, from her strategic thinking, from  where we can make a difference. We know there are a lot of problems  around the world. We know we can't settle all the issues. But Erika  helped us focus on areas where we can make a difference, and thanks to  her input, we have made a difference.   I know I speak on behalf of all Helsinki Commission members and staff  and scores of other individuals--many who may not know her name--and  groups concerned about advancing human rights around the globe and here  at home when I say how we will miss Erika.   Henry David Thoreau said: ``Aim above morality. Be not simply good;  be good for something.'' Erika has embodied that maxim in her  professional career and in her life. She has made an enormous  difference, and she will continue to do so.   I wish her all the best with respect to her future endeavors. I know  we will continue to hear from her.   Thank you, Erika, for the way you served the Commission, our country,  and the global community.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President. I rise today to recognize the annual  commemoration of Juneteenth, the date on which the news of the end of  slavery reached the enslaved peoples in the Southwestern States. On  June 19, 1865, MG Gordon Granger and Union soldiers communicated the  news of liberation to one of the last remaining confederate outposts in  Galveston, TX. Over 2 years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the  Emancipation Proclamation, the enslaved individuals there had yet to  hear the good news.   Over the years, African-American communities nationwide and in  Maryland have developed rich traditions around this historically  significant date. For all Americans, Juneteenth offers an opportunity  to reflect upon and to educate ourselves further about the terrible  history of slavery and its enduring legacy. The story of Juneteenth  also reminds me of the gap between the values and principles that we  espouse and the realities of life for everyday Americans, in particular  the most vulnerable.   I have long supported legislation to add Juneteenth National  Independence Day to the list of legal Federal public holidays. After  many years, I am pleased that the Senate has finally passed it and hope  that the House will act swiftly to send this bill to President Biden's  desk.   In commemoration of this year's holiday, I want to take the  opportunity to reflect in more depth on a couple of ways that we  continue to see the clear impact of slavery today. One of the most  apparent legacies is access--or should I say lack of access--to the  ballot box. Study after study and the lived experiences of so many  individuals tell us that Black Americans still experience greater  barriers to voting than White Americans. One of the most important  tenets of our comprehensive legislation to protect democracy, the For  the People Act, S. 1, is enacting a Federal floor when it comes to  voting rights standards.   Spreading false or misleading information intended to suppress voting  and intimidate the electorate remains one of the most effective methods  used to keep individuals, particularly Black Americans and other racial  minorities, from voting. Advancements in our means of communication,  including the rise of social media platforms, have made it easier for  bad actors to use these strategies. During the 2020 election cycle,  robocalls targeting communities of color in Michigan, Pennsylvania,  Ohio, Illinois, and New York contained false information about how the  recipients' data would be shared if they voted by mail. I have  introduced legislation, along with Senator Klobuchar, to address these  problems by prohibiting individuals from knowingly deceiving others  about the time, place, eligibility, or procedures of participating in a  Federal election. Our bill to ban deceptive practices, S. 1840, would  also prohibit individuals from intentionally hindering, interfering  with, or preventing another person from voting, registering to vote, or  aiding another person to vote or register to vote in a Federal  election.   In 2020, more than 5 million individuals and as many as one in five  African Americans in some States were disenfranchised because of voter  suppression laws.   Many voter disenfranchisement laws today come from post-Civil War  efforts to stifle the 14th and 15th Amendments. Between 1865 and 1880,  at least 13 States enacted or expanded their felony disenfranchisement  laws. One of the primary goals of these laws was to prevent Black  Americans from voting. At least 11 of those States still bar  individuals on felony probation or parole from voting. Under our  Constitution, there is no legitimate justification for denying people  from having a voice in our democracy. Disenfranchising citizens who are  living and working in the community serves no compelling State interest  and hinders their rehabilitation and reintegration into society. My  Democracy Restoration Act, S. 481, would restore Federal voting rights  for all individuals immediately upon release from incarceration.   I am proud that both my Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation  Act and my Democracy Restoration Act are included within the For the  People Act.   Finally, I want to end by commending my home State of Maryland for  bipartisan restorative justice work over the past several years. The  Maryland General Assembly voted nearly unanimously in 2019 to  investigate the more than 40 documented racial terror lynchings that  took place in Maryland between 1854 and 1933, to hold public hearings  in communities where racial terror lynchings occurred, and to develop  recommendations that are rooted in restorative justice for addressing,  engaging, and reconciling those communities. The commission the State  established has received supplemental funding from the U.S. Department  of Justice's Emmett Till Cold Case Investigations Program for its  efforts. Because of this work, Governor Hogan issued posthumous pardons  last month for 34 victims of racial lynchings in Maryland.   This Juneteenth, I encourage all Americans to recognize Juneteenth as  an opportunity to reflect upon our Nation's shared history, to  recognize the enduring effects of slavery on our society, and to commit  to being involved in the redemptive work toward a more just and perfect  Union.                            ____________________
