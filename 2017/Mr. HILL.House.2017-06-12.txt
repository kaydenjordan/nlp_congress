 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Little Rock's  CHI St. Vincent for being named to the 2017 list of 100 Great Hospitals  in America by Becker's Hospital Review.   CHI St. Vincent Infirmary's history of excellence in patient care  dates back to 1888, when it began as a 10-bed charity hospital and the  first hospital in Little Rock.   Over the years, to meet increasing demand for patient care, in  addition to expansion for construction, the hospital has made four  moves to larger facilities. In 1906, the hospital opened Arkansas'  first nursing school, the St. Vincent's Infirmary School of Nursing.   I am proud to have come into this world at St. Vincent, as did our  two children.   I would like to thank CHI St. Vincent for continuing its 129-year  legacy of leadership in patient care centered on service and quality  care in central Arkansas.                            ____________________
