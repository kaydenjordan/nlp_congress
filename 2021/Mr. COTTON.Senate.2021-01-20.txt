 Mr. President, for the information of other Senators who  want to know if we have a vote tonight specifically on the nomination  of Avril Haines to be Director of National Intelligence, I was the last  person to object to holding that vote. I no longer object.   I wanted to have a question for the record answered. Miss Haines,  thankfully, responded to my question yesterday. I want to thank Senator  Rubio and Senator Warner for helping us get that answer.   Specifically, in her open session yesterday, she gave an answer to  Senator Wyden that suggested the intelligence community might reopen  investigations into detention interrogation programs from 2001 to 2006.  She clarified, in the private setting that we had, that she had no  intention to open up those investigations and expose operations  officers inside the CIA to criminal prosecution or adverse employment  action or even holding it against them in potential future promotions  or placements.   She has confirmed that in the written record. I am glad to see that  we are not going to reopen that period.   I want to thank Ms. Haines for providing the answer.   Most importantly, I want to thank our brave operations and  paramilitary operations officers in the CIA for what they do, always,  to keep this country safe. I am ready to vote on this nomination. I  believe the rest of the Senate is as well.   I yield back the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
