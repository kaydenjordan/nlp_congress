 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fellow  Kentuckian, Lisa Pisterman, from the Schnitzelburg community of  Louisville, KY. You may not know this unique neighborhood that dates  back to 1866. But you are all familiar with historic communities that  helped form the fabric of your own hometown or metropolitan area, and  you have witnessed many of them struggle to preserve their unique  heritage while remaining relevant in a modern economy.   To that end, Lisa Pisterman served as president of the Schnitzelburg  Area Community Council during a very challenging period when the  council had struggled to move forward. With Lisa at the helm, a new  sense of unity and purpose has emerged, and great things are happening.   In addition to her leadership on the council, Lisa has served as one  of the local historians, allowing natives of the community and  newcomers alike to reflect on its history and envision what is to come.   Lisa is the author of ``Louisville's Germantown & Schnitzelburg'' and  is currently working with other individuals to build the Germantown  Schnitzelburg History Museum where visitors can study this community's  contributions to our great Commonwealth.   As her friends and neighbors recognize Lisa this month as  Schnitzelburg's No. 1 Citizen, I want to personally thank her for all  she has done and continues to do for her community and to wish her  great success in the future.                            ____________________
