 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on behalf  of myself and Senators Hawley and Graham.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Cruz, along with Senators Hawley and  Graham, is for both sides--the counsel for the President and the House  managers:     =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S696, January 30, 2020, third column, the following  appears: The question from Senator Cruz, along with Senators  HAWLEY and GRAHAM, is for both sides--counsel for the President  and the House managers.      The online Record has been corrected to read: The question from  Senator Cruz, along with Senators HAWLEY and GRAHAM, is for both  sides--the counsel for the President and the House managers.    ========================= END NOTE =========================           Yesterday, Manager Demings refused to answer whether Joe       Biden sought any legal advice concerning his conflict of       interest on Burisma, the corrupt Ukrainian company that was       paying his son Hunter $1 million per year.        USA Today reported that, when asked about it, Vice       President Biden said, ``He hadn't spoken to his son Hunter       Biden about his overseas business.''        That account was contradicted by Hunter Biden, who told the       New Yorker that he told his father about Burisma, and ``Dad       said, `I hope you know what you're doing,' and I said, `I       do.' ''        Why do Joe and Hunter Bidens' stories conflict? Did the       House ask either one that question?    The White House Counsel goes first.   Ms. Counsel BONDI. Chief Justice, Senators, you heard our answer  regarding that yesterday, but it is very interesting that he said he  never spoke to his son about overseas dealings and that his son said  different things.  [[Page S697]]    Joe Biden was the point man for Ukraine. The Ukrainians were  investigating at that time a corrupt company, Burisma, and Zlochevsky,  its owner--an oligarch--who, by all media accounts, as we have  discussed, was extremely corrupt.   Hunter Biden was paid $83,000 a month--a month--to sit on that board  with having no experience in energy, no experience in the Ukraine, and  didn't speak the language. We clearly know that he had a very fancy job  description, and he did none of those things. He attended one or two  board meetings--one in Monaco. Then he went on a fishing trip with Joe  Biden's family in Norway.   The entire time, Joe Biden knows that this oligarch is corrupt.  Everyone knows that. There are news reports everywhere. No one will  dispute that. In fact, it raised eyebrows worldwide. Yet the Vice  President, by his account, never once asked his son to leave the board.  We wouldn't be sitting here if he did. He never asked his son to leave  the board. Instead, he started investigating the prosecutor who was  going after Burisma and this corrupt oligarch, who they say was corrupt  even by oligarch standards, who had fled the country--fled the  country--and was living in Monaco.   He does not ask him to leave the board. He does the opposite.   In 2015, what does he do? We know by reports he has close contact  with President Poroshenko. He travels to Ukraine twice. He links it to  the--he links their aid to the firing.   Same thing in 2016 at a White House meeting--links the aid to the  firing of the prosecutor; calls him four times in the 8 days up-- leading to the prosecutor--the prosecutor investigating Hunter Biden.  Yet he never says that. All cases closed.   Days before Biden leaves office, he jokes to Poroshenko that he may  have to call him every couple weeks to check in. Hunter Biden stays on  that board for 3 years--3 years.   Then we hear the video of Joe Biden bragging about firing the  prosecutor, linking it to aid. Then we have a 6-minute phone call.
