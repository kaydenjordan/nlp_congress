 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes,  and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Just a few days ago, the Nation was shaken by the violent and  destructive actions of an outrageous mob that stormed the Capitol and  attempted to gain access to this very Chamber, seeking to harm innocent  lives and disrupt democracy at work.   I vehemently condemn their lawless actions. This never should have  happened, and the perpetrators of these despicable crimes that took  place in this building must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the  law.   While Americans have the right to passionately voice their views and  peacefully dissent in protest, the siege on our Capitol last Wednesday  was the furthest thing from peaceful protest. As a result of the  violent and frightening events of the day, six lives have been lost.   This includes two courageous Capitol Police officers who put  themselves in harm's way to protect us, secure the building, and  restore order. We will never forget their selfless sacrifices and  bravery. Our deepest prayers remain with their families, friends, loved  ones, and the entire United States Capitol Police force as they grapple  with their heavy loss.   As we seek to pick up the pieces and move forward healing our Nation,  I am concerned that the majority is proceeding with the wrong course of  action.   Earlier today, Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee met and reported out  a rule for consideration of House Resolution 21. This is a nonbinding  resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence to convene the Cabinet  and declare President Trump incapable of executing his duties pursuant  to section 4 of the 25th Amendment.   I think this resolution is misguided and inappropriate for the  legislative branch to pursue. As such, I must oppose it.   Mr. Speaker, under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, when it  appears the President is unable to fulfill his or her duties, it is the  responsibility of the Vice President, with the concurrence of a  majority of the Cabinet, to initiate the process for making that  determination.   That responsibility, grave as it is, rests solely with the Vice  President. There is no role for Congress in this  [[Page H128]]  process. The only role for Congress arises later and only in the  circumstances where there is a dispute between the President and Vice  President about the President's ability to fulfill his or her duties,  but we are not faced with that situation now.   Nor is this resolution intended to designate, by law, another body  besides the Cabinet to exercise this power, which the text of the 25th  Amendment says it may do. Instead, with today's resolution, what the  majority is asking the House to do is to assume a power it does not  have. The House has no role in initiating section 4 of the 25th  Amendment, and we should not pretend otherwise. Instead, that power  lies with the Vice President.   And we should be very clear about what this resolution actually is.  It is an attempt to pressure the Vice President into performing a duty  he clearly does not believe is necessary at this time.   Mr. Speaker, I was here in the Capitol last week, as were all of my  colleagues. We all had the opportunity to watch Vice President Pence as  he fulfilled his duty under the Constitution. He showed sound judgment  and poise under pressure, and his actions were above reproach. Indeed,  he fulfilled his oath of office and acted in a manner befitting his  constitutional role. It was a statesman-like performance under the most  difficult of circumstances.   Despite witnessing the Vice President's sound judgment and ability to  fulfill his oath in person, the majority is now seeking to push him  into performing an additional action under the 25th Amendment. The Vice  President has not done what the majority wishes him to do, and so they  are bringing up this resolution now in effort to pressure him into  doing so.   This act, attempting to substitute the House's judgment for the Vice  President's, is not contemplated anywhere in the Constitution. As we  all saw last Wednesday, Vice President Pence's judgment is sound. There  is no need for the House to attempt to substitute its judgment for his  own.    I personally have strong faith in him, and I believe he will consider  his constitutional duty in the same manner that he carries out all of  the other constitutional duties assigned to him: in a forthright manner  that fulfills his oath of office and attests to his personal integrity.   Should the Vice President ever believe that the 25th Amendment needs  to be invoked, I have no doubt that Vice President Pence, both as a  leader, as a former House colleague, and as a friend, would exercise  good judgment with respect to performing that duty. That he has not  taken that action thus far is not an indication that the House needs to  push him to do so. His record of sound judgment should speak to us on  this issue.   As such, I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution. I urge a  ``no'' vote on the rule, a ``no'' vote on the underlying measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), who is my very good friend and  fellow member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to immediately bring up a resolution establishing  a bipartisan national commission on the domestic terrorist attack on  the United States Capitol.   This commission, modeled on the 9/11 Commission, will be charged with  examining and reporting upon the facts and causes relating to the  attack that occurred on January 6 of 2021 and with providing  appropriate findings, conclusions, and recommendations for corrective  measures.   I can think of no more appropriate path for Congress to follow, Mr.  Speaker, than to ensure that a bipartisan commission reviews all  evidence and reports back to us on this horrific event.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the great State  of Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) for further explanation of the amendment.                                time  1845     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. McClain), who will be giving her first address on the  floor of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), who is the newest Republican member  of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would disagree somewhat with my good friend from Pennsylvania. I  have had the privilege of being in this body for many years, and I have  never seen what we see in sections 2 and 3 of this rule, the suspension  of appropriate language.   I understand the difficulties of dealing with this issue and respect  that. However, at a time when the rhetoric has been over the top, I  think we should set a high example. We have never done this before in  my time here. We didn't do it in previous impeachments.                                time  1900    The need to do it now is lost on me, Mr. Speaker.   Again, I have great confidence in my friend. I have great confidence  in my friends on the Rules Committee.  [[Page H131]]    So, the rule is the rule. This will almost certainly pass. I would  just hope that everybody acts as good as they can. I mean, I hate to  put it that simply, but this is an important issue.   I respect all the Members of this body. I know they have very  different points of view on this. That is to be expected.   Generally, our debates are professional. Generally, that standard is  something we are proud of and something that we aspire to. I hate to  see it ever lowered or any exception provided.   I also have great confidence in the Speaker's Chair, and I know that  they will enforce the appropriate level of civility and decency on the  floor.   But, Mr. Speaker, I just ask my fellow Members to please, please  think about this, because we have taken a very important safeguard off  the rails of debate, so to speak.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan), my very good friend, the distinguished Republican ranking  member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to urge all of my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on this resolution.   The resolution asks this House to substitute its judgment for the  Vice President's in making the grave decision to initiate procedures  under section 4 of the 25th Amendment. Under the Constitution, this is  a role that belongs exclusively to the Vice President and the Cabinet,  not to the House of Representatives. Attempting to usurp this  responsibility is not supported by the Constitution and would be a  historic overreach.   Members should also take assurance from the Vice President's strong  record of sound judgment. Rather than pressuring him into acting, we  should be reassured by the knowledge that he would act on this topic as  he does on all others in performing his duty, in a manner befitting his  constitutional role as Vice President of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question and ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
