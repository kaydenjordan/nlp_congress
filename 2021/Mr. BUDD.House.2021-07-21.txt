 Madam Speaker, I rise today to defend the conscience of  American taxpayers. Since 1973, both sides of the aisle have agreed  that taxpayers should not be forced to fund the taking of an unborn  child's life through abortion. This consensus was enshrined in the Hyde  amendment. The Hyde amendment has saved the lives of almost 2.5 million  children, including over 65,000 in my home State of North Carolina.   Madam Speaker, unfortunately, President Biden and Congressional  Democrats have decided to abandon the Hyde amendment in this year's  budget. This is a grave mistake that will cost the lives of more  innocent children, and therefore, it must be reversed.   Madam Speaker, let's show that this House stands with life, believes  in science, and opposes the evil of abortion.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
