 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 8373. Every woman's  potential journey to motherhood is different, and I support their  access to contraception.   However, this legislation has a lot of problems. Democrats just  introduced it on Friday and debated it for the first time on Monday in  the Committee on Rules. And since then, they have had to introduce  multiple amendments to address their own failures to draft good policy.   This is not how we build trust in solutions to bring forward in the  people's House. If Democrats came to me and asked to work together on a  bill, I would have been happy to roll up my sleeves and work with them.   For years, Republicans on both sides of the Capitol have led on  solutions to allow for great access to safe and effective  contraception, including making it available over the counter. Right  now, Congresswoman Ashley Hinson and Congresswoman Stephanie Bice are  leading on these bills.   Unfortunately, today, rather than work with us, Democrats again, are  spreading fear and misinformation to score political points. And they  are doing it with a very poorly drafted bill that opens the door  further to extreme abortion on demand and their agenda.   H.R. 8373 is a Trojan horse for more abortions. It should be called  the payouts for Planned Parenthood act. It would send more taxpayer  dollars to Planned Parenthood, freeing up more funds for them to  provide abortions and end vulnerable lives.   This bill endangers the health and safety of women. It allows Planned  Parenthood and abortion providers to prescribe both on- and off-label  drugs to be used for abortions without any restrictions. Additionally-- and again, despite many drafts--Democrats included a definition of  contraception that is not limited to FDA-approved products.   The term ``contraception'' is defined as an action taken to prevent  pregnancy, including the use of contraceptives or fertility awareness- based methods and sterilization procedures.   This means that the bill creates an individual right to engage in  contraception which can include the use of FDA-approved products, but  also any other action taken to prevent pregnancy, including non- approved products.   H.R. 8373 will also continue President Biden's war on religious  liberty and conscience protections. It would force health providers to  violate their religion and sincerely held beliefs to provide  contraception and perform sterilizations, including on minors.   It would also force organizations, like the Little Sisters of the  Poor to violate their religion and provide contraception. For all the  fearmongering Democrats are spreading about other Supreme Court  precedents being threatened, where is the respect for the Little  Sisters of the Poor and their victory for their constitutionally  guaranteed religious freedom?   The unfortunate reality today is that this bill goes too far and  defies the most basic safeguards meant to protect women and children.  Women deserve the truth, not more fear and misinformation that forces  an extreme agenda on the American people.    Again, Republicans have led to make birth control available over the  counter. In 2019, the Federal Government, under a Republican President,  spent $1.8 billion for family planning. We have solutions to build on  this work to support women.   Unfortunately, Democrats are conflating the issues of abortion and  contraception to promote unrestricted abortion for all 9 months of  pregnancy.   Contraception is fundamentally different than abortion; a distinction  recognized by the pro-life community, doctors, medical professionals,  the science, and in Justice Alito's Dobbs opinion.   Abortion intentionally ends a human life. Contraception is to prevent  conception.   There is a clear distinction, and to suggest otherwise is more  fearmongering and scare tactics that are a disservice to women  everywhere.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to H.R. 8373, and I urge my  colleagues across the aisle to work with us. We welcome the  opportunity. Rather than rushing another poorly drafted bill--an  extreme bill--through the people's House, we can come together to  support every woman's path to a better life and every woman's journey  to motherhood.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cammack).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman  from Florida an additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), a member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), who is a leader on the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks).    Madam Speaker, to clarify, the bill  defines both contraceptive and contraception. Contraceptive is FDA  approved; contraception is not limited to FDA-approved licensed  products.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Bucshon). Dr. Larry Bucshon is a leader on the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I would like to clarify,  this legislation never went through the Energy and Commerce Committee.  The only debate was in the Rules Committee.   And I also stand here proud that, in 2020, on the 100th anniversary  of women gaining the right to vote, led by pro-life Republican women  who fought for decades, we have a record number of women serving in the  House of Representatives, a record number of Republican women.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van  Duyne), a Member from the class of 2020.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), a leader on the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/4\ minutes to  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), a champion for life.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, again, so proud that it  was pro-life Republican women like Susan B. Anthony who led the right  to vote over 100 years ago. Just to correct the record, both Speaker  Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer suggested that there was a legislative  hearing. I don't remember any legislative action. I would ask the  chairman, was there any legislative action on this bill?    I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Reclaiming my time, Congresswoman Diana  DeGette, my colleague on the committee, said that we had a hearing. It  was an Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Dobbs. I want to quote  because what the Democrat witness said confirms the Democrats' abortion  on demand until birth act. The Democrat witness said: People find out  they need abortions through their pregnancies, yes, at any time for any  reason. The issue at hand is the Democrats' extreme agenda, abortion on  demand up until birth.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma  (Mrs. Bice), a proud member of the class of 2020 with record Republican  women.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my  time to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Hinson), another dynamic leader  from the freshman class of 2020.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This will be a 5-minute vote.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 228,  nays 195, answered ``present'' 2, not voting 6, as follows:                               [Roll No. 385]                                 YEAS--228       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Auchincloss      Axne      Barragan      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bourdeaux      Bowman      Boyle, Brendan F.
