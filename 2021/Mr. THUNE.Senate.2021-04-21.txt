 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to  complete my remarks before the vote.    Mr. President, it is another day and another manufactured  crisis. Yesterday, I came down to the floor to talk about the supposed  crisis of confidence in the Supreme Court that requires us to  immediately add four additional Democrat-chosen Justices.   Today, I want to talk about another manufactured crisis, and that is  the supposed election crisis that requires us to pass H.R. 1, a  Democrat piece of legislation designed to increase Democrats' chances  of maintaining their current tenuous hold on power.   H.R. 1 is not new legislation. Democrats introduced a nearly  identical version of this bill in the last Congress as well. Back then,  we were told that we needed this bill to address profound electoral  problems in our democracy--in other words, Democrats didn't like the  results of the 2016 elections.   Then, of course, last year, we had an election with record voter  turnout--the highest voter turnout since 1900--an election that gave  Democrats the Presidency and paper-thin majorities in Congress, and the  story changed. Now we are told that we need to pass H.R. 1 and  federalize elections because legislatures around the country are  passing ``voter suppression'' laws.   The State of Georgia recently passed an election reform measure--a  law that keeps Georgia squarely in the mainstream when it comes to  State election laws.   The Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives noted yesterday  in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that while Georgia  has made its no-excuse absentee voting more secure with this law,  States like Delaware and New York--among many others--don't even allow  no-excuse voting.   Delaware, of course, is the home State of the President of the United  States. New York is the home State of the Democratic leader. I haven't  noticed the President or the Democratic leader criticizing their home  States for voter suppression. Nevertheless, Democrats decided that the  Georgia measure would serve as a useful rallying cry for H.R. 1, so  they spread a web of misinformation and outright lies, attempting to  get people worked up by portraying Georgia's fairly ordinary election  reform laws as a radical attempt to suppress voters and to suppress  votes.   President Biden irresponsibly described the law as ``Jim Crow on  steroids,'' as if the Georgia Legislature had decided to reinstate the  evil of segregation. The President has been repeatedly rebuked by none  other than the Washington Post for repeating a completely false claim  about the Georgia law. In fact, the Washington Post gave the President  four Pinocchios--a rating that the Post reserves for ``whoppers''--for  his false claim that the law is designed to keep working Americans from  voting. In fact, as the Post's Fact Checker piece makes clear, there is  reason to think the law might actually--wait for it, Mr. President-- expand access to early voting.   A fair-minded piece in the New York Times, hardly a newspaper that  carries water for Republicans, concluded that the voting provisions of  the Georgia law are ``unlikely to significantly affect turnout or  Democratic chances.'' But that hasn't stopped Democrats from using  Georgia's law as the poster child for supposed voter suppression and  the pressing reason to pass H.R. 1.   Let's talk about the substance of H.R. 1. To start with, this  legislation would transfer control over elections from States to the  Federal Government despite the fact that the Constitution gives primary  control over elections to the States. Under this law, States' ability  to develop election systems that address the needs and challenges  facing their States would be substantially limited.   Of course, Democrats would like us to believe that this Federal power  grab is urgently needed since, they argue, States are contemplating  voter suppression laws, but as I pointed out, the last election, with  its record turnout--the largest turnout since 1900--did not exactly  suggest that States are incapable of setting their own election rules.   Ironically, H.R. 1, which purports to be an election integrity bill,  would actually undermine election integrity. The bill takes aim at  State voter ID laws--a longtime obsession, I might add, of the  Democrats. I have always been at a loss to understand Democrats'  passionate opposition to requiring people to provide identification  before voting.  [[Page S2094]]    Democrats, of course, present voter ID laws as an attempt to suppress  votes by forcing people to go through a challenging process of  obtaining a government ID. I have to ask if Democrats also think laws  requiring ID to drive are somehow discriminatory. We constantly require  photo identification in our society to drive, to board planes, to enter  many government buildings, to pick up tickets to Major League baseball  games. These requirements are pretty universally accepted. It is  difficult to understand how requiring identification to vote is so  outrageous. The American people don't seem to think so. Polls show that  a majority of Americans support voter ID laws.   In addition to effectively eliminating State voter ID requirements,  H.R. 1 also requires that States allow ballot harvesting, the  controversial practice of allowing political operatives to collect and  submit ballots. Needless to say, ballot harvesting opens up a lot of  questions about voter fraud and election integrity, but the Democrats'  bill would require it.   As I mentioned, Democrats introduced an almost identical version of  H.R. 1 in the last Congress, and--get this--the ACLU opposed it. The  ACLU opposed it. That is right. The American Civil Liberties Union  opposed it. Why? Because the bill would ``unconstitutionally burden  speech and associational rights.'' Unconstitutionally burden speech and  associational rights. H.R. 1 would impose a vast new array of  restrictions on political speech and issue advocacy, and it would  impose disclosure requirements for organizations that would open up  donors to retaliation and intimidation.   I could fill up several speeches with a discussion of all the bad  provisions in this bill. H.R. 1 would turn the FEC, the Federal  Election Commission, into a partisan body. It would require taxpayer  funding of political campaigns. Taxpayer dollars would go to fund  bumper stickers and political ads. It would allow the IRS to deny tax- exempt status to organizations whose positions it doesn't like and on  and on.   Then there is the fact that on a purely practical level, this bill  would be a disaster. A recent Daily Beast article highlighted the  onerous and impossible-to-meet requirements the bill imposes on  conducting elections. To quote the Daily Beast, another media outlet  not exactly known for its favoritism toward conservative Republicans,  the bill ``was written with apparently no consultation with election  administrators, and it shows . . . it comes packed with deadlines and  requirements election administrators cannot possibly meet without  throwing their systems into chaos.''   The article goes on to say:         The sections of the bill relating to voting systems . . .       show remarkably little understanding of the problems the       authors apply alarmingly prescriptive solutions to. Many of       the changes the bill demands of election administrators are       literally impossible to implement.    That, again, is from the Daily Beast.   Like the Democrats' Supreme Court power grab, H.R. 1 is a solution in  search of a problem. Protecting the right to vote and preserving the  integrity of our election systems are essential. While we are fortunate  that our electoral system by and large seems to be operating well,  there are certainly measures that we can take up to further enhance  election integrity. H.R. 1 is not one of those measures. This  legislation is an unacceptable Federal takeover of elections that would  undermine election integrity and substantially curtail First Amendment  rights. Every single Member of Congress should be opposing it.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1274         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
