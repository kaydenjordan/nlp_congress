 Madam Speaker, by direction of the  Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 979 and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 979         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 963) to       amend title 9 of the United States Code with respect to       arbitration. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary now       printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       117-34 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended,       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any amendment thereto, to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their       respective designees; (2) the further amendment printed in       the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution, if offered by the Member designated in the       report, which shall be in order without intervention of any       point of order, shall be considered as read, shall be       separately debatable for the time specified in the report       equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an       opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for division       of the question; and (3) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2116) to       prohibit discrimination based on an individual's texture or       style of hair. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. In lieu of the amendment in the nature       of a substitute recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary       now printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       117-36 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended,       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or       their respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate  only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee met on  and reported a rule, House Resolution 979, providing for consideration  of H.R. 963, the FAIR Act, under a structured rule. It provides 1 hour  of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  member of the Committee on the Judiciary. It makes in order one  amendment and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 2116, the CROWN Act,  under a closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on the  Judiciary and provides one motion to recommit.   Madam Speaker, the bills we discuss today have to do with fundamental  American values.   The first bill under this rule, the FAIR Act, simply restores the  right of individuals to have their day in court.  [[Page H3755]]  It prevents the use of forced arbitration clauses in consumer and  employment contracts.   Most likely, all of us have signed a contract with a forced  arbitration clause, and many may not even know it. How many Americans  have read their cell phone contract? How many have read their credit  card contract?   Too many consumer contracts are written to protect the pockets of  corporations, leaving consumers at the mercy of a system created by,  paid by, and focused on minimizing liabilities of corporate companies.   These documents are dozens of pages long, and most contain clauses  that require arbitration in case of a legal dispute and prevent the  consumer from going to court as an alternative. There is no negotiation  or choice.   Ask yourselves, if you saw something that you objected to in a  contract for your cell phone, what option do you have to change it? The  answer is no choice at all.   That is why this is called forced arbitration, and these requirements  game the system in favor of one party, large corporations. If there is  a dispute, corporations get to pick the location of arbitration, and in  many cases, it is out of State; pick the arbitrator; and pay for them.  Yes, the impartial arbitrator, who depends on corporate contractors, is  paid for by the corporation. And corporations get to shield the results  from the public. Imagine that.   The FAIR Act stops this harmful and abusive behavior. It bans forced  arbitration clauses in employment, civil rights, and consumer disputes.   Congress just passed legislation that changed this process for  disputes involving sexual harassment. However, there are tens of  millions of Americans who are still affected by forced arbitration in  other contexts, and this legislation provides those same protections to  them as well.   Ensuring fairness under the law is at the center of the second bill  being considered under this rule, the CROWN Act. This bill would ensure  that discrimination based on race is not masked as discrimination about  hairstyles.   This is legislation that we passed by a voice vote last Congress with  no objection from the other side. But this year, Republicans decided  that something had changed--not with the legislation, but with their  Conference--since they objected to the consideration of this bill under  suspension.   The CROWN Act simply clarifies what studies have shown, that  oftentimes women, particularly Black women, are discriminated against  based on their natural hair.   Courts have rejected previous guidance finding that discrimination on  the basis of hairstyle or hair texture is a violation of the Civil  Rights Act. So, this legislation simply makes these protections clear,  that you cannot discriminate on the basis of a person's hair texture or  hairstyle if that style or texture is commonly associated with a  particular race or national origin.   I believe that both of these bills will help to make our legal system  more fair for every single one of us. I urge passage of the rule and  these bills.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am going to share three stories from hardworking  Americans.   Connie Nagrampa, a California resident, started working as a  franchisee for a marketing company. The company cheated her out of her  investments, her life investments. When she tried to seek  accountability, they forced her into arbitration.   The company, conveniently enough for them, chose to move the  arbitration process across the country to the city of Boston. A  California resident was expected to fly herself and pay for all of her  expenses to Boston to seek justice. It was too expensive, obviously,  for somebody who has just lost her life savings. She lost the  arbitration as a result, and the arbitrator said she had to pay more  money to the company. Connie spent years attempting to overturn that  unjust cause.   Now let me tell you about a brave American Navy reservist, Lieutenant  Commander Kevin Ziober, whose employer fired him the same day he was  deployed to Afghanistan. This is blatantly illegal under Federal law.  But because the employer had forced all of their employees to sign a  forced arbitration clause, he was unable to make his claim in Federal  court and get his job back.   That is what they are defending.   Let me tell you about another brave military servicemember, Charles  Beard, whose rights under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, SCRA,  were violated by his bank.   SCRA is a bipartisan law which provides financial and legal  protections to servicemembers and their families when they are on  Active Duty. This is especially important given how vulnerable Active  Duty servicemembers can be to predatory lending schemes, identity  theft, or other unfair financial practices when they are deployed or on  Active Duty.  [[Page H3756]]    Mr. Beard is a former sergeant in the Army National Guard, now 100  percent VA disabled. When he was on tour in Iraq, his wife at the time  and their five children relied on one vehicle. One day the bank decided  to repossess that vehicle. It was no longer convenient to keep that  loan open for somebody risking their life for us, our country.   This, too, was a violation of the Federal law SCRA because he was  deployed. When he tried to hold the bank publicly accountable in court,  he was forced into arbitration because of a forced arbitration clause  buried in the fine print.   These are just three stories of hardworking Americans. These are the  stories of real people that we need to stand up for and protect.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Today, we are supposed to be debating two very important bills to  help Americans continue to thrive in this great country, but instead my  colleagues across the aisle want to debate  [[Page H3757]]  about something that they know is incorrect.   There are over 9,000 approved drilling permits the oil industry is  not using. And the truth is that changes in domestic energy policy  often take years to impact global energy markets. They know that.   But instead, what is happening here is oil companies are using  Putin's war as an excuse to jack up prices at the pump even more, and  then they argue for looser regulations, cheaper drilling, and more  pollution.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a March 4, 2022, opinion  article from The Guardian written by House Natural Resources Committee  Chairman Raul Grijalva entitled ``Oil and Gas Lobbyists are Using  Ukraine to Push for a Drilling Free-for-All in the U.S.''                     [From the Guardian, Mar. 4, 2022]    Oil and Gas Lobbyists Are Using Ukraine To Push for a Drilling Free-                            for-All in the US                           (By Raul M. Grijalva)         Last week, we all watched in horror as Vladimir Putin       launched a deadly, catastrophic attack on Ukraine, violating       international treaties across the board. Most of us swiftly       condemned his actions and pledged support for the Ukrainian       people whose country, homes and lives are under attack.        But the fossil-fuel industry had a different take. They saw       an opportunity--and a shameless one at that--to turn violence       and bloodshed into an oil and gas propaganda-generating       scheme. Within hours, industry-led talking points were oozing       into press releases, social media and opinion pieces, telling       us the key to ending this crisis is to immediately hand US       public lands and waters over to fossil-fuel companies and       quickly loosen the regulatory strings.        Our top priority must be ending Putin's hostilities, but as       chair of the US House committee on natural resources, I feel       duty-bound to set the record straight. We can't let the       fossil-fuel industry scare us into a domestic drilling free-      for-all that is neither economically warranted nor       environmentally sound.        Despite industry's claims to the contrary, President Biden       has not hobbled US oil and gas development. In fact, much to       my deep disappointment and protest, this administration       actually approved more US drilling permits per month in 2021       than President Trump did during each of the first three years       of his presidency. Before the pandemic, oil and gas       production from public lands and waters reached an all-time       high, and the current administration has done little to       change that trajectory over the last 13 months.        Fossil-fuel companies and their backers in Congress also       profess that more drilling on public lands and waters would       lower gas prices for Americans. But if that's true, why       hasn't record oil extraction from both federal and non-      federal lands over the last decade done anything to       consistently lower, or at least stabilize, prices at the       pump?        The fact is that crude oil is a volatile global commodity.       Worldwide supply, demand, and unpredictable events--like       wars--influence the price of gas, not the current       administration's decision to approve a few new leases or       permits.        Even if we take industry's claims at face value, nothing is       keeping fossil-fuel companies from more drilling on public       lands right now. The oil industry already controls at least       26m acres of public land and is sitting on more than 9,000       approved drilling permits they're not using.        They have a similarly gratuitous surplus offshore, where       nearly 75% of their active federal oil and gas leases,       covering over 8m acres, have yet to produce a single drop.       Any new leases issued today wouldn't produce anything of       value for years, or even decades in some cases.        If industry did start to ramp up production from federal       leases, the overall increase to the total US supply would       likely be marginal. In 2020, public lands and waters only       accounted for 22% and 11% of oil and gas production,       respectively. The vast majority of oil and gas resources are       beneath state and private lands--not public lands or federal       waters.        With the facts laid bare, we see the fossil-fuel industry's       crocodile tears for what they are--the same old demands for       cheaper leases and looser regulations they've been peddling       for decades. These pleas have nothing to do with countering       Putin's invasion or stabilizing gas prices, and everything to       do with making oil and gas development as easy and profitable       as possible.        The US is the world's top oil and gas producer. Doubling       down on fossil fuels is a false solution that only       perpetuates the problems that got us here in the first place.        And quite frankly, we can't afford to maintain the status       quo. In its newest report the Intergovernmental Panel on       Climate Change (IPCC) issued its most dire warning yet on the       rapidly accelerating climate crisis. If we fail to enact       major mitigation efforts, like curbing fossil-fuel       development, both quickly and substantially, we will ``miss a       brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a       livable and sustainable future for all''.        Fortunately, there is a path forward that simultaneously       cuts the lifeline to fossil-fuel despots like Putin,       stabilizes energy prices here at home, and creates a safer,       more sustainable planet. We must wean ourselves off our oil       and gas dependence and make transformational investments in       cleaner renewable energy technologies, like those in the       Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Build Back Better Act and       the Competes Act, and we must do it now.        The fossil-fuel industry has had hold of the microphone for       far too long. It's time we let the facts speak for       themselves.    Madam Speaker, if my colleagues were so  concerned about oil prices or the welfare and security of humanity in  the crisis that is happening in Ukraine, maybe they should have stepped  up and inquired about the five meetings that the previous  administration held in secret without staff, only a translator, with  Vladimir Putin.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the rule allows for  consideration of these two bills, which will ensure that we are  providing better protections for consumers and employees.   The FAIR Act stops large corporations from gaming the system in their  favor, and allows consumers the opportunity to have their day in court.   And the CROWN Act ensures that we do not allow discrimination in any  way, shape, or form. These are commonsense bills that help the American  people.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 979         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 6858) to strengthen United States energy security,       encourage domestic production of crude oil, petroleum       products, and natural gas, and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 4. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6858.     Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on  the rule and the previous question. I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
