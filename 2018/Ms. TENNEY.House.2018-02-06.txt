 Mr. Speaker, last week I received a letter from Frank  Suits, Jr. Frank is the president and CEO of Suit-Kote Corporation, a  family-owned, multigenerational paving company located in the 22nd  District, in Cortland, New York. He wrote to share the impact that the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have on Suit-Kote's nearly 800 families.   As a direct result of the lower income tax brackets included in the  tax cuts legislation, Suit-Kote employees receive an automatic 2  percent increase in their take-home pay in 2018. This increase means  about $1,400, on average, in the paychecks of each hardworking family.   Suit-Kote's 401(k) plan has also increased by 11.5 percent and totals  more than $56 million. This means that each individual employee saw an  average increase of more than $6,400 in their 401(k) savings plan.   In direct response to the new tax law, Suit-Kote Corporation has  announced plans to match the Federal tax cut and provide its employees  with a 2 percent retroactive pay increase. They also plan to accelerate  its 401(k) contribution for 2018 by 4 months to provide employees  additional funds in their retirement accounts.   The benefits are not crumbs. These are actual results involving real  people.   Small businesses like Suit-Kote are proof that delivering desperately  needed tax cuts are the most effective way to improve the lives of New  Yorkers, not Albany's oppressive tax-and-spend, cronyist policies.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 40 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, February 7, 2018, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
