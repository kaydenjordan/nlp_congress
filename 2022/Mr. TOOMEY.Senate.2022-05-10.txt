 Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of  Professor Lisa Cook to serve as a Governor of the Federal Reserve  Board.   Two weeks ago, Senate Democrats tried to cancel the vote that was  scheduled on Professor Cook's nomination.   In his floor remarks, the chairman of the Banking Committee stated  that Senate Republicans have been ``AWOL in the fight against inflation  for months.'' The irony of that, of course, is that it was Democrats  who wanted to cancel the vote. Republicans were ready to vote and not  just on Professor Cook, mind you. We wanted to vote on the other Fed  nominees as well. I objected to canceling the vote because we were  ready to vote, and we wanted to vote, so the vote took place.   Professor Cook's nomination failed that day on a procedural vote by a  margin 47 to 51. Then, immediately after that, I asked consent to vote  on the two remaining Fed nominees who have been processed in the  committee but haven't been voted on. Those would be Chairman Jerome  Powell, who has been nominated to be Chairman again, and Professor  Philip Jefferson, who both could have been confirmed to the Fed that  day, as they could have been confirmed months ago.   But the Democrats objected to us having a vote a couple of weeks ago.  It is really pretty amazing. Let me just be clear for the record. The  Democrats hold the majority. The Democrats control the schedule on the  Senate floor. And our Democratic colleagues have tied up for months the  nominations of multiple nominees, including two--two--Fed nominees who  have either unanimous or very nearly unanimous support. That is Jerome  Powell and Philip Jefferson.   So if confirming Fed nominees is so important to our Democratic  colleagues in the fight against inflation, it makes you wonder about  this strategy of canceling votes and not holding votes when Republicans  have been trying to confirm the nominees.   But I have a theory as to why this is, and I think it is because our  Democratic colleagues know that Professor Cook is simply unqualified to  serve as a Governor of the Federal Reserve Board. They don't want to  leave her stranded as the final Fed nominee after all the other  nominees get confirmed, so they are holding the nominations of Chairman  Powell and Professor Jefferson hostage in order to push through their  preferred candidate, their top priority.   I want to address this specific point that the chairman has made in  the past because he has made this several times. He has suggested that  somehow Republicans oppose Professor Cook's nomination because she is a  Black woman. Let me just be as clear as I can. That is a very offensive  charge to make. It is actually outrageous. It is also blatantly and  demonstrably false.   In this Congress alone--a little over 1 year--Banking Republicans  have unanimously supported eight Black nominees, six of whom were  women: Cecilia Rouse, the first Black woman to serve as Chair of the  CEA; Nuria Fernandez; Alexia Latortue; Adrianne Todman; Alanna McCargo;  Ventris Gibson, the first Black woman to serve as Director of the U.S.  Mint. Republican Banking Committee members voted unanimously in favor  of confirming each of those six Black women, but we still hear this  absurd and outrageous charge.   Philip Jefferson--if our Democratic colleagues ever allow us to have  a vote on him--will be the fourth Black man to serve as a Fed Governor.  He was voted out of the committee 24 to 0.   Let me just be very clear. Banking Committee Republicans didn't  support these nominees because of the color of their skin; that is not  the criteria by which we evaluate candidates. We supported them because  each of them was qualified for the roles to which they were nominated.  Frankly, that ought to be the criteria for evaluating any nominee, if  you ask me, including Professor Cook.    So let me address some of the arguments you are likely to hear  regarding Professor Cook's qualifications.  [[Page S2405]]    First of all, my Democratic colleagues like to point to Professor  Cook's extensive educational attainments as evidence of her  qualifications. She was a Marshall Scholar and a Truman Scholar, she  was. She attended Spelman College, Oxford, and obtained a Ph.D. in  economics from UC Berkeley.   There is no question, these are impressive credentials, but they do  not, by themselves, qualify her--or anyone else for that matter--to  serve as the governor of the Fed, especially at a time when we need a  Fed that is able and willing to tackle 40-year-high inflation that is  devastating American families every single day.   Now, our Democratic colleagues have claimed that Professor Cook is  ``a leading economist'' with years of experience in ``monetary policy,  banking, and financial crises.'' But those claims are simply untrue.   First of all, 75 percent of Professor Cook's assignment at Michigan  State, including her tenure, is in the international relations  department; it is not even in economics. Second, her experience in  monetary policy is literally nonexistent. Not a single one of her  publications concerns monetary economics.   When asked to highlight for the banking committee her top works on  monetary policy, she provided one, a book chapter on Nigerian bank  reforms published 11 years ago. According to the White House, her main  qualification on monetary policy is her service as a member of the  Chicago Fed's Board of Directors.   She joined the Chicago Fed's Board 2 weeks before President Biden  nominated her to serve as a Fed governor.   Third, her experience handling financial crisis has basically been  limited to writing a cursory overview of the Eurozone crisis during a  brief stint working in the Obama White House and working in Africa over  20 years ago.   Now, you don't need to be a trained economist to serve on the Fed  Board, necessarily; but if you are going to serve on the Fed Board, you  do need to have some views on monetary policy. You would think that  would be especially the case for someone who is an economist. Given  Professor Cook's glaring lack of experience in monetary policy, it  perhaps is not surprising that Professor Cook has been unable to  articulate any opinion at all on how the Fed should tackle inflation.   Throughout the nomination process, she repeatedly refused to endorse  the Fed decision to pull back its ultra-easy money policy. She also  refused to suggest any alternative policy. And only on the actual day,  while at her hearing, did she finally begrudgingly say that she agreed  with the ``Fed's path right now as we are speaking.''   Professor Cook's answers to very basic questions about what the Fed  should do to tame inflation--to paraphrase the late Justice Scalia-- amount to nothing more than logical applesauce. Professor Cook has  continued to insist she would need to be confirmed to the Fed Board  before she can have a view on inflation, because in her words: ``We  don't have access to all the data that the Fed has.'' And she also  said: ``We don't have access to the deliberations at the time they are  being made.''   Now, these things are just bewildering for someone who has been  nominated to address the most pressing inflationary threat in nearly  two generations. And let's be clear, the Fed has no secret data as  Professor Cook seems to believe.   In fact, monetary policy, including the recent 41 percent increase in  the money supply is extremely transparent. Anyone who wants to know has  all the data available to him or herself.   Just about every economist in the country right now has an opinion  about inflation. Every other nominee to the Federal Reserve has an  opinion about inflation, including what to do about it.   And since we know very little about her views on inflation, my grave  concern is that Professor Cook will serve as an inflation dove on the  Fed at a time when American families continue to be ravaged by these  price increases.   But you don't have to take it from me, Bloomberg Economics expressed  concern with Professor Cook's wishy-washy answers also, and they wrote:         Asked if she would endorse the current rates trajectory,       she did not provide a straight answer but said she would look       at data once the decision point arrives.    Another quote from their analysis:         When asked how she would get inflation under control, she       answered: By eliminating the risk of financial crisis.    The American people deserve better than this. They deserve a serious  nominee who understands monetary economics, has a firm grasp on how to  combat inflation and restore stable prices, and will serve without a  political agenda.    So if Lisa Cook doesn't have any expertise in monetary policy, then  why would Democrats want her on the Fed Board? Well, that brings me to  my second point: Professor Cook's history of extreme leftwing political  advocacy and hostility to opposing viewpoints, which I think make her  unfit to serve on the Fed.   It is exceptionally important to keep politics out of monetary  policy, but unfortunately, we have seen the encroachment of politics at  the historically independent Federal Reserve.   There are people on the left, including in the Biden administration,  who openly advocate that the Fed use its supervisory powers to resolve  complex political issues, like what to do about global warming and  social justice, even education policy.   These are all very important issues, but they are wholly unrelated to  the Fed's limited statutory mandates and expertise. Professor Cook's  record indicates that she is likely to inject further political bias  into the Fed Board at a time when we need the Fed to be focused on  fighting inflation.   In her statements or tweets, retweets, Professor Cook has supported  race-based reparations, promoted conspiracies about Georgia voter laws,  and sought to cancel those who disagree with her, with her views. She  specifically and publicly called for the firing of an economist and  colleague who dared to tweet that he was opposed to the idea of  defunding the Chicago police.   The fact is the Fed is already suffering from a credibility problem  because of its involvement in politics and its departure from its  statutorily proscribed role and its failure to keep inflation under  control. I am concerned that Professor Cook will further politicize an  institution that really needs to get back to being apolitical.   I urge my colleagues to vote against the nomination of Lisa Cook.
