 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on Saturday, the Senate Judiciary  Committee received the completed questionnaire from Brett Kavanaugh,  President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court.   As legal minds on both sides of the aisle pore over these preliminary  documents, a common thread has already emerged: Brett Kavanaugh seems  to have an imperial conception of the American Presidency. He has  written that a sitting President shouldn't be subject to civil or  criminal investigations while in office.   In at least three separate instances, Brett Kavanaugh has shown a  willingness to openly question precedent relating to Presidential power  and Presidential accountability.   First, in his opinion in Seven-Sky v. Holder, Kavanaugh wrote that  the President does not have to enforce the laws if he ``deems'' a  statute unconstitutional, regardless of whether a court has already  held it constitutional.   What the heck do we have a Supreme Court for? If the President can  deem a law unconstitutional even after the courts have ruled it is and  then not obey it--wow. That goes very far. I fear to think what this  President, in particular, who doesn't seem to have much respect for the  rule of law or people who disagree with him, will do if that becomes  the law.   Second, when Brett Kavanaugh was asked which case he would choose if  he could overturn precedent in any one case, he said the decision in  Morrison v. Olson. That is the case that upheld the constitutionality  of the independent counsel law.   Many of us did not agree with the independent counsel law, but it is  telling that the first and only case Brett Kavanaugh cited when asked  ``What case would you overrule, would you overturn stare decisis on?''  was a case about executive accountability.   Third and most recently, on Saturday, we learned that Brett Kavanaugh  even believes that the 8-to-0 decision in United States v. Nixon may  have been wrongly decided. This new revelation adds to the body of  evidence that Kavanaugh believes sitting Presidents should be free from  civil and criminal investigations while in office--a view, of course,  that could have significant ramifications for the future of the  Presidency and our democracy.   Let me ask this Senate and the American people a very important  question: If Kavanaugh would have let Nixon off the hook, what is he  willing to do for President Trump? Alarm bells should be going off for  anyone who believes in checks and balances.   It is a fundamental principle of our democracy that no one is above  the law, including the President. Our Presidents are not Kings. But  Brett Kavanaugh's jurisprudence does not bode well for the future  rulings on the accountability of the President, including those that  may arise from Special Counsel Mueller's investigation.   Kavanaugh's views of an imperial Presidency would be alarming under  any President, but it is especially alarming under President Trump, who  almost daily tests the bounds of our Constitution, the separation of  powers,  [[Page S5118]]  and the rule of law. It almost seems that anyone who criticizes him is  beyond the pale, is fake, is dishonest.   As the revelation about the Nixon case shows, there is still much we  don't know about Judge Kavanaugh. The Senate and the American people  deserve to know where Judge Kavanaugh stands on a host of issues. After  all, the Supreme Court is a lifetime appointment with enormous power-- the power to overrule the elected bodies of government.   Given that the hearing process for the Supreme Court has tended to be  more of a public relations exercise for nominees rather than a  legitimate examination of judicial philosophy, Judge Kavanaugh's papers  might be the best and only way to judge what kind of a Justice he might  be. My Republican friends understood this when it came to Justice  Kagan, who had served in key positions in prior administrations, much  like Judge Kavanaugh. They were then in the minority, as we are now,  when Judge Kagan was nominated, but our Republican colleagues demanded  the entire paper history of then-Solicitor General Kagan before moving  forward with her nomination, and Democrats agreed.   In a joint letter to the director of the Clinton Library, the  chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee at the time-- Senator Leahy, the chairman, and Senator Jeff Sessions, now Attorney  General, but then the ranking Republican on the committee--wrote that  they expected ``all records containing documents written by, edited by,  prepared in whole or part by, under the supervision of, or at the  direction of Elena Kagan, as well as documents referencing Elena Kagan  by name, initials, or title, and documents received by or sent to Elena  Kagan.''   A Democratic chairman and Republican Senator Sessions, the ranking  member, asked for every single document of Elena Kagan's record. Why  should such a standard apply to Justice Kagan but not to Judge  Kavanaugh?   I have taken the liberty of editing the letter sent by Senators  Sessions and Leahy. It didn't take much work to make it directly  applicable today. It is the same letter, same request, simply crossing  out every time it mentions Kagan and putting in the name ``Kavanaugh.''  There was no change. It is the same standard.   I have already heard from my Republican colleagues, including  Chairman Grassley, that there is no reason to review Judge Kavanaugh's  full record before proceeding with his nomination.   I have had enough of the two-facedness, the total hypocrisy on  judges, where somehow our Republican colleagues say it is good one way  when we have a Democratic President and the opposite should take effect  when we have a Republican President. That is what they are doing with  the records here first of Judge Kagan and now Judge Kavanaugh.   Well, I say to my Republican colleagues, what is good for Justice  Kagan--let's call it the Kagan standard--is good enough for Judge  Kavanaugh--paraphrasing, of course, what is good for the goose is good  for the gander.   The Senate's duty to advise and consent does not mean move as hastily  as possible. For the benefit of this body, for the sake of consistency,  and for the honor of this Chamber, I hope my Republican friends join  Democrats in asking for and waiting for all the documents related to  Judge Kavanaugh. The American people have a right to know what is  there, and the Senate must have enough time to review the body of work  before making an unalterable decision on a lifetime appointment to the  Nation's highest Court.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on Russia, a week ago today, President  Trump met with President Putin in Helsinki, and with the world  watching, failed to show an ounce of strength in defense of American  interests.   What followed was an embarrassing week of insincere walk backs and  mixed messages, culminating on Friday in a bizarre invitation for  President Putin to visit the White House this fall--something the  President's own Director of National Intelligence, Mr. Coats, was not  made aware of. It is not hyperbolic to say that last week may have been  one of the worst weeks in American foreign policy in recent memory.   In the face of these stunning events, what have my Republican  colleagues done to rein in the President? I am sad to report, virtually  nothing. In the full week since the Helsinki summit, Republicans failed  to take meaningful action to hold the President accountable for his  foreign policy blunders in Finland. Republicans have offered words of  rebuke, statements, disappointed tweets, but they have not backed up  any of those words with the force of action.   I have seen my colleagues shrug their shoulders as if there weren't  anything the U.S. Senate could do to check this President, even though  they feel in their hearts, I know, that he needs checking. I mentioned  several ways the Senate could grapple with and push back a bit on what  President Trump has done: bring in his national security team and  translator to testify before Congress, particularly so we can tell what  happened in that 2 hours when Putin and Trump were alone; pass  legislation to protect the special counsel and legislation to harden  our election infrastructure because we risk Russia's interference  again; implement sanctions against Russia; demand that Russia hand over  the 12 Russians indicted for election interference and more.   If my Republican friends were serious about doing something to  redirect our posture toward Russia, we should have seen some movement  by now on one or more of these things, but we are stuck in the mud.  Even though there is bipartisan condemnation for the President's  behavior last week, the Senate has remained virtually silent on the  matter because Republicans here are unwilling, maybe afraid, to  confront the President, even though they know what he did was so wrong.   At the end of last week, the Republican majority blocked a bipartisan  resolution--a modest one from Senators Flake and Coons, one a  Republican, one a Democrat--that sought to hold Russia accountable. It  didn't have many teeth, but still the Republicans objected.   Are my Republican friends ever willing to push back against this  President, not just in words but in deeds, or are they too afraid of  the political consequences? Are they willing to put country over party  at this crucial time? It seems not, at least so far.   I know many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle were  deeply disturbed by the President's inexplicable behavior in Helsinki.  I say to them, America needs you now. We need you to stand up, step up  to the plate, and do something about it.   Frankly, if we don't do something real, President Trump--I know him-- will conclude he doesn't need to change his behavior, and, as a result,  Republicans will be complicit in enabling the President to continue  down the disastrous course he has set.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
