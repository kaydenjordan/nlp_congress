 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today a group led by Chairman Grassley of  the Senate Judiciary Committee formally introduced a bill to address  the DACA issue--the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals issue--that  we have heard so much about, as well as border security. I think it is  a good starting point, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of the  legislation, which is called the Secure and Succeed Act.   Perhaps the most important thing about this bill is that it actually  has a good chance of becoming law. That is because the President  supports it. It encompasses the four pillars the President has laid out  for us in any solution to the DACA challenge.   The Secure and Succeed Act provides legal status and a pathway to  citizenship for an estimated 1.8 million people who meet the specific  criteria of DACA. This is a far larger number than the number of  individuals covered by President Obama's Executive order. The fact is,  this President has not only said to the 690,000 DACA recipients ``You  are going to have a better, brighter future and a pathway to American  citizenship''; this President has also offered all of the young people  eligible but who might not have previously signed up that same  opportunity. What an extraordinarily generous offer.   This bill also provides for a real plan to strengthen border  security, utilizing the three things that Border Patrol has always told  me are essential: more boots on the ground, better technology, and,  yes, some infrastructure in hard-to-control locations, along with  enhanced ports of entry.   I know there has been some confusion about that. The President likes  to talk about the wall. It is true that back in roughly 2006 or 2007,  Congress called for something called the Secure Fence Act, which got  the support of then-Senator Obama, then-Senator Hillary Clinton, and,  of course, current Senator Chuck Schumer. They supported the Secure  Fence Act, as did an overwhelming majority of Senators from both  parties.   When the President has talked about the wall, he has made pretty  clear what he is really talking about is a barrier similar to what was  supported on a bipartisan basis. He said that the Border Patrol is  going to have to be able to see through it. Indeed, as he has conceded,  in many places it doesn't make any sense at all to have a physical  barrier. That is why technology and boots on the ground are so  important.   This legislation also reallocates visas from the diversity lottery  system in a way that is fair and continues the existing, family-based  categories until the current backlog is cleared, which would take,  probably, about 10 years. I am proud to cosponsor this commonsense  solution. But I know other colleagues have been working hard on their  ideas, which I look forward to reviewing as the debate continues.   One group I haven't heard from much, though, is our Democratic  colleagues, who literally shut down the government to force this debate  to occur on their terms and at a time they chose. We are still trying  to figure out--OK, you won, in a sense. I think the American people  lost when you shut down the government, but you made your point. You  wanted a time certain and you wanted a fair process by which to present  your ideas, and we have been waiting--here it is Wednesday, with the  clock ticking, still waiting--for that Democratic proposal. What is  their plan? What is their proposal? Do they even have one? And if they  do, why are they leaving the rest of us, as well as the Nation, in the  dark?   As the majority leader said yesterday, we need to stop trying to  score political points and start making law. The way to get this done  is to take a proposal like the President's and get started; people can  offer amendments to that. Whatever gets 60 votes in the Senate passes  the Senate, and then it is up to the House to pass it, and then it is  up to the President to decide whether to sign it. He has pretty much  given us the outline of what he would find acceptable. Again, insofar  as it grants a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million people, that is  extraordinary in and of itself.   The majority leader made a commitment to hold this debate and to hold  it this week. He has lived up to his promise, and now we can't let it  all go to waste. As each minute and each hour clicks off the clock, it  looks as if it is more and more likely to happen--that all of this will  go to waste.   The country is watching. The DACA recipients in my home State--all  124,000 of them--are watching and worrying, understandably anxious  about what their status is going to be when this program ends on March  5.   One of those DACA recipients is Julio Ramos, a biology teacher who is  getting his master's degree in biomedical informatics. He is from  Brownsville, TX, right along the U.S.-Mexico border, and he is a DACA  recipient. After his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, he  decided he wanted to be a doctor. He has even been accepted to Texas  medical schools, but he wasn't sure whether he would be allowed to  attend. He is waiting and watching, worried about his future.   Then there is Miriam Santamaria from Houston, TX. She graduated from  high school in Houston with honors. She paid her way through community  college, and she works as a manager at a construction company and owns  her own photography business. She sounds like quite an entrepreneur to  me. Miriam said: ``I am not looking for any kind of recognition or  sympathy, [I'm just] looking to make a difference and inspire others.''  She is also looking to live in peace in the only country that she has  ever known and calls home. She came to the United States when she was 4  years old.   Finally, there is a man whom I will just call by the first name of  Daniel. He, too, lives in Texas. He graduated from the University of  North Texas with a degree in advertising and contributes productively  to society. Daniel came from Mexico at the age of 2, and he said: ``All  the choices I make, I made as an American, because that's what I am.''   We need to listen to these stories as we consider this legislation  and as people are perhaps tempted into the political grandstanding and  gamesmanship that, unfortunately, sometimes overwhelms our best  intentions. These are real human lives hanging in the balance. They are  important, and they teach us about the real people behind the policy.   But their stories are not the only ones we need to listen to. We need  to listen to the stories of the men and women who have been waiting  patiently for years to come here in a legal way through visas and green  cards, waiting patiently to join their families here in the United  States, doing it the old-fashioned, legal way. They have had to wait,  some for years, some for decades.   We should listen to the stories of the border communities, which I am  proud to represent in Texas, from men and women, many of whom are of  Hispanic origin, who have suffered property damage from illegal  immigration.   Illegal immigration is a pretty ugly business when you consider that  it is in the hands of drug cartels and transnational criminal  organizations. Recently, one of the military leaders who is responsible  for Southern Command, which is Central America south, said that these  transnational criminal organizations or cartels are ``commodity  agnostic.'' That is the phrase he used. He said that they don't care  whether it is people, drugs, or other contraband. What they are in it  for is the money, and they are willing to do  [[Page S940]]  anything for the money. Unfortunately, victims of human trafficking  know exactly what I am talking about.   Despite these hardships, businesses in many of the communities, like  those along the border, are thriving. But we need to do everything we  can to make sure that continues to be the case.   Sympathy for DACA recipients is right and good because, in America,  we do not punish children for the mistakes of their parents, and we are  not going to punish these young people who are now adults and have  become part of our communities. But Americans who live along the border  in my State realize that illegal immigration has caused real, tangible  harm in terms of public safety, property damage, and their way of life.   When I talk to people like Manny Padilla, the Border Patrol's sector  chief for the Rio Grande Valley, it is hard not to realize just how  much is required and how many more resources we need to maintain  situational awareness and operational control along the border.   I will say this: The Federal Government has failed over the years to  live up to its responsibility to maintain the security of our border,  so taxpayers in my State have to step up and fill the gap left by the  failure of leadership of the Federal Government. But we have an  opportunity to fix that in this legislation, following the parameters  the President has laid out for us. That is why, during this week's  debate, ensuring additional resources for border security is an  essential piece of the puzzle. That includes areas other than between  our ports of entry. Mexico is one of our largest trading partners. We  have legitimate trade and commerce that flows back and forth across the  border with Mexico and supports 5 million American jobs. Unfortunately,  the cartels have figured out how to exploit that as well. So, because  of antiquated infrastructure and technology at our ports of entry, many  of them are vulnerable through the importation of poison--literally,  drugs like methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, and the like--that has  taken the lives of so many Americans. We need to do more and better  when it comes to maintaining those ports of entry--upgrading the  infrastructure, improving the technology--so we can interdict more of  that.   Again, the border is as varied as anyplace in the world, with areas  that are flat and open, areas that have mountains and rolling hills,  rivers, obviously. Technology, as we have come to see, has transformed  our way of life, and technology can increasingly be the answer to  supplement the boots on the ground and the infrastructure that the  Border Patrol thinks are necessary.   There is a big difference between detecting illegal immigration in  rural areas and urban ones. In urban areas, the Border Patrol tells us  that you might have just a few seconds before someone can cross the  border and enter into the United States. In large, open areas, there is  more of a lag time, so perhaps a fence or some infrastructure is not as  important; technology might be more important, along with the Border  Patrol agents themselves.   My basic point is that border security is complex. For those who  think it is as easy as one, two, three, I encourage you to do as some  of my colleagues have done; that is, travel to the border--we will host  you--to see firsthand why it is crucial that we strengthen our  personnel, technology, and infrastructure. That has to be one of our  priorities, and I am grateful to the President for making this one of  his requirements as well.   We have an opportunity to address not only the anxiety and plight of  DACA recipients but also to make our country safer and more secure; to  reform our legal immigration system in a way that will help us  accelerate the reunification of families out of the backlog of people  waiting patiently and legally outside of the country to come into the  country through legal immigration; and to address the President's  concern about the roll of the dice in the diversity lottery that makes  little sense, given our need for people with job-based skills, graduate  degrees, and other merit-based criteria that would make them valuable  to the United States, in addition to winning the lottery.   I hope we will take advantage of this opportunity this week. Time is  wasting. It is Wednesday, and we don't have any time to waste at all.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 11 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
