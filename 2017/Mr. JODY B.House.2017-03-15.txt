 HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I take great pleasure that  we may come to the floor today to celebrate and recognize the  remarkable legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. King is characterized by  modeling his life after Jesus Christ in order to live a life dedicated  to the service of others, whether that be preaching the Gospel to his  congregation at Ebenezer Baptist Church, or to the pursuit of justice  and equality.   Mr. Speaker, my home state of Georgia has the great honor of  preserving King's legacy at the Martin Luther King, Jr. National  Historic Site. And today we have the opportunity under the leadership  of my friend and fellow Georgian, John Lewis, to pass H.R. 267, the  Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park Act, to re-designate  the site as a National Historic Park.   I strongly believe that this site meets and exceeds the requirements  for re-designation as a National Historic Park and fully support my  friend in his effort. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Congressman Lewis  for leading this legislation. As a cosponsor of this bill, a member of  the Committee on Natural Resources, and as a fellow Georgian, I offer  my strongest support and encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of  H.R. 267.
