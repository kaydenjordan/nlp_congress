 Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Reach  Every Mother and Child Act of 2023, known as the Reach Act. This  bipartisan legislation would strengthen the United States' efforts to  end preventable deaths of mothers, newborns, and young children in  developing countries by 2030. I want to thank Senator Coons for his  partnership on this important bill, and I also appreciate the  cosponsorship of Senator Durbin and Senator Wicker.   Senator Coons and I have led efforts to ensure robust funding for the  U.S. Agency for International Development's maternal and child health  programming. These programs have been the backbone of the United  States'' commitment to helping to end preventable child and maternal  deaths globally.   Due in part to American leadership and generosity, many lives have  already been saved. While progress has been made in reducing maternal  mortality rates, recent data suggest that these improvements are  slowing. Far too many mothers, newborns, and young children under the  age 5 continue to succumb to disease and malnutrition that could easily  be prevented.   Nearly 300,000 women die annually from causes related to pregnancy  and childbirth, with 99 percent of maternal deaths occurring in  developing nations. In addition, a significant proportion of the deaths  of children under the age of 5 occur in the first 28 days after birth,  with newborns accounting for nearly 50 percent of all under 5 deaths.  In 2021, 5 million children under the age of 5 died from mainly  preventable and treatable diseases.   The Reach Act aims to help these mothers and children with simple,  proven, costeffective interventions that we know will help them  survive. A concentrated effort could end preventable maternal and child  deaths worldwide by the year 2030, but continued U.S. leadership and  support from the international community are critical to achieve this  goal.   To advance this cause, our bill would require the implementation of a  strategy focused on bringing to scale the highest impact, evidence- based interventions, with a focus on country and  [[Page S1607]]  community ownership. These interventions would be specific to each  country's needs and include support for the most vulnerable  populations. We do not have to guess what interventions will work--the  reality is that thousands of children die each day of conditions we  know how to treat.   These lifesaving interventions include clean birthing practices,  vaccines, nutritional supplements, handwashing with soap, and other  basic needs that remain elusive for far too many women and children in  developing countries. This must change.   Our bill would require the establishment of a Maternal and Child  Survival Coordinator at 1USAID who would focus on implementing the 5- year strategy and verifying that the most effective interventions are  being scaled up in key countries. The Coordinator would identify and  promote the most effective interventions to end preventable maternal  and child deaths globally, which would improve the efficiency of the  programs operating across several Agencies.   To promote transparency and greater accountability, our bill would  also require detailed public reporting on progress toward implementing  the strategy.   The Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations  recently heard testimony from USAID Administrator Samantha Power.  During that hearing, asked Administrator Power about the Reach Act and  emphasized the critical reforms needed to increase the success and  impact of USAID's maternal and child survival programs.   Administrator Power testified to sharing the goals that motivate this  important legislation.   She agreed about the importance of resourcing key U.S. investments,  scaling them up, and getting them to mothers and children living in  remote areas.   Other bipartisan initiatives, such as the successful President's  Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which was started by  President George W. Bush, demonstrate that results-driven interventions  can turn the tide for global health challenges. Applying lessons  learned from past initiatives, our bill would provide the focus and  tools necessary to accelerate progress toward ending preventable  maternal and child deaths.   I urge my colleagues to join Senator Coons, Senator Durbin, Senator  Wicker, and me in supporting this legislation that will save the lives  of mothers and children around the world.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Reach  Every Mother and Child Act of 2023, known as the Reach Act.
