 Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this conference report. The most  important thing I can say about it is that it is good for the troops  and it is good for national security. And when it comes to a Defense  authorization bill, that is all that really matters. This is a good  bill, and it deserves the support of everyone in the House.   And a lot of credit--much of the credit--for navigating a very  difficult political process goes to Chairman Smith for getting us to  this point. I am also grateful to Chairman Inhofe and Senator Reed  during these final negotiations over the last 5 months as we have  worked our way through a host of issues.   But it is also all of the conferees and members of the Armed Services  Committee and, especially, the staff who have had to help us work our  way through these things, essentially, all year. And it is a credit to  all of them that we are in this place.   Madam Speaker, this bill does a lot, as Chairman Smith just said, for  the men and women who serve and their families.   There is a lot of focus on people here: For example, 3.1 percent pay  raise; a number of provisions related to childcare for the military;  increase in professional license fees for spouses; military housing  reform, including a requirement for a tenant Bill of Rights; reforms to  the movement of household goods; additional steps to combat sexual  assault and harassment; a number of provisions related to military  healthcare, to improve the quality of care that they get; compensation  for medical malpractice at military treatment facilities; repeal of the  widow's tax, which is something that Congressman   Joe Wilson, among  others, has been pushing for for a number of years.  [[Page H10083]]    Those are just some of the things related to our military folks that  are in this bill, and, essentially, I can't think of another  significant issue military families have brought up to me over the past  year or two or three that does not have at least some provision in this  bill.   And, in addition, for the civilians at DOD and the rest of the  government, it has paid parental leave so that we can be in a better  position to compete with big employers around the country.   A lot for our people.   In addition, it does a lot to help rebuild and repair the damage that  is done by sequestration to our military. It helps us prepare for our  adversaries: very importantly, to authorize in title 10 a space force,  as this House has voted for twice, including 2 years ago. Yet, now,  with this bill, it takes effect.   As well as further reforms to the Pentagon, not just to get more  value out of our money, but to get top technology into the hands of the  war fighter faster.   There is a lot of good in here, and it deserves Member support.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), who is the distinguished author of  legislation with 383 cosponsors to repeal the widow's tax that is now a  part of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Rogers), the coauthor, along with Mr. Cooper of the  Space Force provision.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Waltz).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers at this  time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.  [[Page H10089]]         Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, Majority Leader Hoyer made two points on which I want  to emphatically agree.   Number one, he said that we are blessed in this Nation to have the  benefit of dedicated staff working on important legislation such as is  before us today, and their patience has been tried more than in most  years to bring this bill to this point with what I expect will be  strong bipartisan support. A tremendous amount of credit goes to them  as well as, as I said before, to Chairman Smith, Chairman Inhofe, and  Senator Reed.   The second point the majority leader made is this is a compromise,  and he is exactly right. I can give you a list of things in the bill  that I wish were not in the bill, and I also have a list of things that  I wish were in the bill that I tried to get into the bill. So I have  some strong opinions about things I would do differently. And yet it is  not about me; it is about what this process can produce.                                time  1700    There is no question that what we have today on the floor is very  different from the bill that the House passed on July 12. It is a very  different bill. Also, the House-passed bill was very different than the  Senate bill, which they passed something like 86-8. So bringing those  two together has been a challenge, but it is done.   I will confess, Madam Speaker, that I feel better that at least some  Members came to the floor to oppose it because I was beginning to worry  that this conference report was not as good or as important as I  thought it was. But I do feel better that at least some Members with  whom I do not normally agree have come to oppose it. I am somewhat  relieved on that point.   I am also relieved that the President has said emphatically that he  will sign this bill, that he strongly supports the pay raise, the Space  Force, the paid parental leave, and other provisions that are in this  package.   I believe, Madam Speaker, the first job of the Federal Government is  to defend the country. We need to do the things that are in this bill  first before we look at the other things that all of us would like to  see done. I agree with the point that as we do this first job of the  Federal Government, we as a body and certainly the Armed Services  Committee need to carefully oversee this large amount of funding. That  is absolutely part of our responsibility.   I resent, by the way, any implication that we have not been doing our  best to oversee that funding over the years because under both parties  I believe that is exactly what we have been doing. The challenge is we  face more risk in the world than we have ever faced before in our  history with Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, terrorism, and the list  goes on, new technologies moving faster than ever.   Just cutting back a little bit on funding does not ensure that the  country will be protected. As a matter of fact, this amount of money  does not ensure that the country will be protected. But it is what we  do need to keep working to do.   By the way, with support of both parties, what we have been trying to  do is see that the taxpayers get more value for the money we spend and  also see that, when we send a warfighter out on a mission, he or she is  equipped with the best equipment, the best support, the best training  that this country can provide because it is wrong to send them out  there on that mission without providing the best that this country can  provide.   Madam Speaker, this is the last point I want to make. This bill is  not about us, as important as we think we are sometimes. It is not  about our preferences. It is about them. It is about men and women who  risk their lives to defend us and our freedom. It is about their  families who sacrifice in order that that service may take place.   Going back to where I started, there is so much in this bill that is  good for the men and women who serve and their families. To me, that is  the thing to be most proud of in this bill because it is about them and  what they do for us. That is the reason I ask all Members to support  this conference report.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
