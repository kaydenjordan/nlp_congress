 Mr. Chairman, the American people need to observe what is  happening on this floor. My colleague from Arizona is simply saying  that in the $886 billion we are sending across the river to the  Pentagon, we at least don't want that to fund U.S. troops, boots on the  ground, in Ukraine, and there seems to be no guardrail that some in  this body would not accept so as to stop our country from inadvertently  stumbling into world war III.   Mr. Chair, I have amendments coming to stop security assistance, but  this is the humblest of amendments seemingly to comport with what this  body in a bipartisan way has expressed.   We do not want American servicemembers dying in Ukraine. That risks  escalation and that risks accident. It always starts with just a few  security advisers. That is how we got entangled in the Syrian civil  war. We ought to be disentangling ourselves from Ukraine and embracing  the good amendment from my colleague from Arizona.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this Congress has authorized $115 billion to  Ukraine. My amendment would ensure that this Defense appropriations  bill sends no more.   Madam Chair, $115 billion is an astonishing amount of money,  especially when you consider that our Nation sits atop a $33 trillion  debt and we are facing $2 trillion in annual deficits. It is not as if  the $115 billion has brought this conflict any closer to an end. In  fact, the massacres and the killings and the death continue.   The next statement is so obvious I can't believe I have to say it out  loud.   It does not make the United States of America stronger to borrow  money from China to give it to Ukraine.   I hear a lot of the war hawks in this Congress stand up and say,  well, we have to send a message to China by fighting for however long  it takes at whatever cost in Ukraine. The message we are sending to  China is that they are engaged in a leverage buyout of Russia and  increasingly of our own country.   We have problems here in America with our own borders. Americans are  watching as foreign flags are being erected in the middle of the Rio  Grande River while our Nation is being invaded by tens of thousands of  people every month. Yet, we go spend all this money on the border of  another country.   I do not fear broken Russian tanks rolling through Europe. I fear  Russia's nuclear weapons and the risk that we could be sleepwalking  into a nuclear conflict that could end life as we know it on the  planet, all for what? To live out some neoconservative dream in  Ukraine? Give me a break.   Right now, a lot of this funding that we have sent for Ukraine has  been inflationary. Fuel and food, these are the markets that have been  affected globally because of this crisis and because of the money we  are spending to extend the conflict.   At the beginning of this Congress, Speaker McCarthy said there is not  going to be a blank check to Ukraine, but when we bring witnesses  before us to ask them whether or not we are complying with our own laws  regarding end-use monitoring of materiel, they cannot say we are even  following our own laws.   Enough is enough. I am putting my countrymen first. I don't think we  should send another nickel to Ukraine.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, indeed, this is a respectful policy dispute  that we have over this matter, and I am grateful that we are taking up  the Defense appropriations bill as a single subject bill to work  through these things, and let the votes fall where they may, but it  seems the full sum of the argument against my amendment is: Putin bad,  which I concede.   As a matter of fact, Vladimir Putin has sanctioned me personally, so  I don't have to be sold on that argument. He is a bad guy.   The question is whether after $115 billion, it is the $300 million in  this bill that is going to really kick the door in. There has been no  argument that that is the case, because of course that would not  comport with logic and reason. When my colleagues say we cannot abandon  the EU, that is like fingernails on a chalkboard to my fellow Americans  who often feel like they are the ones who have been abandoned as we  send $115 billion to Ukraine and ignore what is going on on our own  border.   Madam Chair, we also ignore what is going on with a lot of our first  responders.   In our country, there are police and firemen who do not know if their  pension fund will be strong enough to support their benefits throughout  their life. We do very little on that front, but we have underwritten  the full pension of every civil servant and government employee in  Ukraine.   Abandon them? I just don't think we should bankroll them, and that is  why I would encourage the adoption of my amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, the argument my colleague made is, well, we  have always sent this $300 million. That may be true, but we used to  send that $300 million when we weren't sending $100 billion in  supplementals on top of that, so I don't think that argument really  holds water.   When my colleague says: Well, we can do both. We can secure Ukraine's  border and we can secure our border; my argument would be: Can we at  least secure our own border first? How about that? How about  prioritizing our own people first before we start going and engaging in  misadventures throughout Europe.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1200     Madam Chair, the United States of America is not the  world's piggy bank, and we are not the world's policeman.   I applaud all of the enthusiasm in Ukraine. I am rooting for them,  but enthusiasm in this country is waning to continue to support all of  that effort abroad.   We want to secure our border. We want to see enthusiasm with our  Border Patrol. We do not support continued inflationary, escalatory,  dangerous spending in this war on Ukraine.   Madam Chair, I appreciate the House's indulgence for considering my  amendment. I would encourage its adoption, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this is an amendment to prohibit the transfer  of cluster munitions pursuant to this legislation.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Jacobs),  a member of the Armed Services Committee, someone who has led this  Congress to try to stop the transfer of cluster munitions.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I would observe that we cannot have a goal of  creating parity with the Ukrainian military and the Russian military.  If that is the case, why not send nuclear weapons?   These cluster bombs are indiscriminate. They have killed tens of  thousands of people. You just heard my colleague say that when this is  all done we will be right back here on the floor appropriating money to  demine the cluster munitions that we are now sending, which seems  ludicrous to me.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.  McCollum), the distinguished ranking member, for her thoughts on the  matter.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the bipartisan support for this  amendment. I thank Mr. Massie of Kentucky and Mr. McGovern of  Massachusetts on the Rules Committee for having made this amendment in  order.   I look forward to us working together to ensure that we have humane  policies when it comes to our munitions.   Just to respond to the argument that there is somehow a Taiwan nexus  here, I have studied the war games and the plans around Taiwan pretty  extensively, and I have seen no scenario in which we believe that the  appropriate utilization of munitions in Taiwan is going to require  cluster munitions. It is largely going to be torpedoes, sea mining.   We are still demining the cluster munitions in Laos. We can make a  wiser choice now and one certainly that doesn't put any of our allies  in jeopardy.   Madam Chair, I encourage adoption of this bipartisan amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
