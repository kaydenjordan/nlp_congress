 Madam Speaker, Michigan lost an incredible human being  yesterday.   Zahra Abbas was brilliant, compassionate, and full of love for  community.   Zahra lived with epilepsy, which she learned to control with the use  of cannabis. This inspired her mission to educate and advocate for the  access of healthcare and the use of alternative approaches.   Zahra founded and became the chair of the Cannabis Caucus of the  Michigan Democratic Party. She was also a DNC delegate.   Zahra spoke passionately about issues that she believed in at rallies  and community meetings and meetings with other political leaders across  Michigan and the Nation. She gained so much incredible respect from our  community.   My team and I are devastated and heartbroken. We extend our deepest  condolences to the Abbas family. Allah Yerhama.                            ____________________
