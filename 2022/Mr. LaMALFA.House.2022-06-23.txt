 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with deep, deep regret and  sadness over the loss of a local legend, Cotton Rosser, who was 93  years old.   Known as a top rodeo man all over the north State and even all over  the country, he is known for winning so many awards and accolades in  his job as a rodeo man.   He used to open for the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas at least  10 years in a row. He had the Flying U Company, a rodeo company that  traveled all over the Western States, bringing his show.   He was always, always improving the show, making it into something  spectacular. He would bring ideas from ice skating and others to make  the show even more spectacular. He was innovative in that.   He was recognized in 2019 as a Legend of ProRodeo, 1995 ProRodeo Hall  of Fame inductee, 1985 PRCA Stock Contractor of the Year, over 60 years  doing shows, and over 70 years in rodeo.   He was truly a good man, a nice man, and his family is his legacy,  the good people they are, that he leaves behind.   The legacy with the Red Bluff Round-Up and taking stock up there and  Colusa Western Days, I have participated in all these things as an  observer, the Marysville Stampede. It has just been such a rich part of  northern California and the West and, indeed, the whole country.   I will leave you with a quote from him. You know, he was 93, so in  recent years, having had to retire somewhat, he said, ``I am just the  PR man now. I never imagined my rodeo career would be like this. I am  the richest guy in the world with memories and friends. I loved every  minute of the rodeo business, and I would do it all over again.'' Such  a great memory, indeed.   A good friend of mine; hard to deal with. We are very proud of Cotton  Rosser in northern California.                   Security for our Supreme Court Justices    Mr. Speaker, any day now, the Supreme Court is expected to make an  official announcement on their decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson case.   Ever since the draft opinion was leaked, radical leftists have tried  to intimidate, threaten, and harass the conservative Justices on the  Court.   There have been multiple attacks against pro-life and pregnancy  centers across the whole country. A deranged individual was caught  plotting to assassinate Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his family at their  home.   He was caught carrying a handgun, two clips of ammunition, a tactical  knife, pepper spray, a crowbar, a nail punch, duct tape, a hammer, and  a screwdriver outside their home.   The White House refused to condemn this heinous crime. The pro- abortion group, Ruth Sent Us, publicly threatened Justice Amy Coney  Barrett's children, as well. They tweeted the exact location of the  children's school and church, along with the schedules of when they  would be there. These radicals are jeopardizing the lives of our  Justices' families.   It took a month for congressional Democrats and Senate Leader Schumer  to bring the Supreme Court Police Parity Act to the floor for a vote.  This bill offers security to family members of the Supreme Court  Justices, which is more critical than ever.   While unnecessarily delaying the bill, Speaker Pelosi even had the  audacity to claim, ``Nobody is in danger over the weekend because of  our not having a bill.'' There was an assassination plot. Of course,  people were, in fact, in danger.   Despite the slew of threats, I pray that the Court does the right  thing for our Nation's unborn and upholds our Constitution.   Overturning Roe does not ban abortion but rightly returns the  abortion debate back to Congress and to the State legislatures. In our  Republic, those elected by the people should be the ones to create laws  and balance tradeoffs, not judges.   In the nearly 50 years since Roe became the law of the land, over 63  million unborn children have been killed due to judicial activism.   Life begins at the moment of conception, and an overwhelming number  of Americans believe in protecting babies still in the womb. In order  to preserve our judicial system, we cannot allow these intimidation  tactics to win the day. The Court must be allowed to do its job  unfettered while not actively legislating from the bench.                            ____________________
