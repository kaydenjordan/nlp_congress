 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 50th wedding  anniversary of my good friends Woody and Lynda Freeman of Jonesboro,  Arkansas, two people who are true examples of commitment to the  covenant of marriage.   Woody and Lynda met and started dating in the small town of Newport,  Arkansas, when they were in the eighth grade. In high school, Woody was  captain of the football team and Lynda was homecoming queen. Woody  taught Lynda how to drive and could always make her laugh--and still  does.   They eventually married in 1968 during their senior year at the  University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. Not long after they were  married, Woody, an Army second lieutenant, was deployed to Vietnam,  where he was a courier for the CIA. He sent Lynda gifts and films he  took of Vietnam and called whenever he could, and whenever he was on  R&R in Hawaii, Lynda flew to see him.   Following Woody's return from Vietnam, the family faced hard times.  It was because of their vow to each other before God that they were  able to make it through their lean years, when Lynda pawned her wedding  ring as Woody worked tirelessly, both doing what was needed to raise  their children.   As with their marriage, they have diligently worked to make their  business and family prosper. With never-yielding prayer, they have  succeeded.   During their 50 years of marriage, they have experienced the joy and  perseverance of unconditional love and faith in one another. For their  commitment to each other, to their family, and to God, I invite my  colleagues in Congress to join me in honoring their life together.                            ____________________
