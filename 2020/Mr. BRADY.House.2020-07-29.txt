 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing the Ways  and Means family, as he termed it, together for this important evening.   These past few days, our country has taken time to reflect on the  life and the legacy of John Robert Lewis, from the Edmund Pettus Bridge  to Auburn Avenue. Through streets of the South to the rotunda of the  United States Capitol, our Nation has come together to celebrate the  life of a man who rose to the occasion to fight for the rights of all  human beings.   A Congressman for the great State of Georgia and an esteemed member  of the Ways and Means Committee, John Lewis was a blessing to our  institution. It was an honor of a lifetime to sit next to such giants  as he, Congressman Sam Johnson, and others who made their way through  the Ways and Means Committee in the Longworth House Office Building.   I was lucky to not just sit near John in the committee room, but I  realized early this session, as I went to look at my old office in the  Cannon House Office Building, that John Lewis was serving there, too.  That day I had a big smile on my face as I greeted John, and we  reminisced a bit about sharing our offices.   Madam Speaker, you couldn't help but smile if you ever crossed paths  with him. He was one of the better angels of our nature. He was one of  our thousand points of light.   The man who walked in the wind to bring equality to America now is  walking in the heavens with his creator. We are a better nation and a  better people because of him, and this institution and all of our  country will miss him dearly.   To know John, as every member of this committee will tell you, is a  blessing. His life, his career, and his legislative achievements will  be studied by future students for generations.   It was an honor to have worked on such important issues with him,  including the first reforms of the IRS in over two decades and in  making improvements to Medicare for our Nation's seniors.   It is common knowledge in D.C., and certainly in the Ways and Means  Committee, that our room happens to be one of the coldest rooms in the  Capitol. But that was not the case when John walked in. His presence  alone brought that room warmth, calmness, and reassurance that, if we  work together, we all can make a difference.    When I look down the dais in the weeks ahead, I will be sad to miss  our friend, but I will always be proud to have had the privilege of  working with such a remarkable man. Each day he walked in these Halls,  we all witnessed, firsthand, his remarkable integrity, his intelligence  toward the complex policy issues we debate, and his willingness to work  across the aisle if it means Americans will have greater dignity,  opportunity, and equal rights.   I will tell you, Madam Speaker, if you were poor, if you were born on  the wrong side of the tracks, or if you felt powerless, John Lewis was  your man. John Lewis would fight for you.   God loved this remarkable servant, and I know John is walking hand in  [[Page H3969]]  hand with God and his beloved Lillian today.   Tomorrow, I will be honored to join Chairman Neal to attend his  funeral in Atlanta with many of our House colleagues.   John, it will be a celebration of your life, a chance for us to honor  you and reflect on all the joy, passion, and love you brought to this  Congress, to our lives, and to this country.   May you rest in peace, my friend, and may God continue to shower you  with faith, hope, and love each day.   I thank Chairman Neal for having me as part of this dedication today.                                time  2000
