 Madam Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak  against robocall telemarketing and spoofing.   Our constituents, whether Republican, Democratic, or independent, are  tired of being harassed by telemarketers and spoofers. People deserve  to have their privacy and to be left alone. However, robocall scams are  at an all-time high.   That is why I have introduced H.R. 1575, to crack down on abusive,  annoying, and illegal robocalls.   Data shows that, in 2017, the FCC reported more than 4.5 million  robocall complaints, an increase of more than 1 million from the  previous year. More than 300,000 complaints were registered in the  State of New Jersey alone.   This act helps protect consumers by ensuring that robocallers and  scammers are prosecuted to the full extent of the law. That is why I  ask for support of H.R. 1575.                            ____________________
