 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, this Special Order is for the Congressional  Progressive Caucus, and I am so proud to be a vice chair of that caucus  and to lead the Special Order hour with my colleague, the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).   We do this once a week, and we try to take up topics that we think  are of great interest across the country to our constituency. So I am  very proud to have the Congressional Progressive Caucus leading the way  on so many issues that are important, from education to transportation,  infrastructure to, of course, today's topic, which is the tax plan that  was released yesterday by President Trump.   The tax plan that was released yesterday--and I have to start by  saying I am not sure this is actually the plan. I am not sure that a  one-page document constitutes a plan. This is not even a two-sided  document. It is a one-sided document. This is what we are reacting to.  And it is similar to the tax plan that candidate Trump spoke about  during the campaign.   So we will do our best with what has been put forward as a plan, but  this plan, in our estimation, when you look at what it contains, really  amounts to nothing more than a one-page document full of handouts to  the rich.   The Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, yesterday said, during  a press conference, that one thing that this President has done very  well--this is a quote: ``One thing this President has done very well is  listen.''   Mr. Speaker, I have to disagree with that. Two weekends ago, there  were 190,000 Americans in red States and blue States across the country  who were on the streets asking for the President to release his tax  returns in the same way that every other President of the United States  has done in modern history. Unfortunately, this President has not  listened. As a candidate, he said he would release his tax returns. As  a President, he has refused to do so.  [[Page H2931]]    He didn't listen when women and their allies took to the streets in  the biggest march in American history to demand that he respect women,  protect Planned Parenthood, and support equal rights for women.   And this President certainly didn't listen to the millions of  Americans who were outspoken in their opposition to the Republican  healthcare plan that essentially took $1 trillion off of the backs of  working people and folks who need health care across this country and  transferred it to the wealthiest in our country.   The reality is this President, unfortunately, has not been listening  to the American people. If you look at that healthcare plan, just as an  example, only 17 percent of the American public actually supported  TrumpCare. This President has not been listening, to now put forward  another plan on health care that again suggests that we should actually  take away essential health benefits from people, take away the  opportunity for people to have preexisting conditions covered, and,  once again, leaving an additional 24 million Americans stripped of  their health care.                                time  1630    So in this tax press conference yesterday, it became very clear that  the administration doesn't have really an idea of exactly what the plan  is going to look like, except for the fact that it will be good for  business.   Secretary Mnuchin said:   ``Under the Trump plan, we will have a massive tax cut for  businesses. . . .''   Despite all of President Trump's broken promises, we have to believe  that this may actually be true. Let's not forget that the Secretary of  the Treasury was a C-level executive at Goldman Sachs and his loyalties  have been with Big Business.   The tax plan, as we have been given it on this one-page document, is  a gift-wrapped tax cut to the highest earners and corporations. The  claim is that it was written to create jobs and spur economic growth  and help low- and middle-income families, but what it really does is  drastically reduce tax rates for Big Business to just 15 percent. That  tax break isn't just for cooperations; it is also for pass-through  firms.   Let's be clear about what pass-through firms are. Pass-through firms  are entities that wealthy people and companies use in order to funnel  money and have lower tax rates. Among these companies is The Trump  Organization.   This is why, in asking for the President's tax returns, this is not  just an ask that doesn't have any meaning. It is not a partisan ask. We  have 190,000 Americans in the streets in red States and blue States  asking. When we know what is in the President's tax returns, then we  have the ability to make sure that we understand, as the American  people, whether any plan he proposes is in the interest of the American  people or whether it is in his own financial interest.   According to the Center for American Progress, 70 percent of  partnership and S corporation income goes to the top 1 percent of U.S.  households by income. So when you propose a tax cut for these pass- through entities, we are talking about a tax cut for the people in the  top 1 percent of this country. We are not talking about a tax cut that  benefits middle class, working families.   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities provided a specific  example where a lawyer making $1 million a year could funnel their  income through that pass-through and could actually save $180,000 a  year. There is no doubt that this President would himself benefit from  this tax plan, although we can't say exactly how much, because we  haven't seen the tax returns and we don't know exactly which financial  interests he has and how much he would benefit.   However, his own lawyers reported that nearly all of his 500 or so  businesses are--don't be surprised--pass-throughs. If we accept this  assertion from his lawyers that his assets are worth more than $10  billion, then this tax plan or tax ploy, depending on how you want to  see it, would actually save the President of the United States millions  of dollars, but it would not benefit millions of working families  across this country who actually need to see our tax system reform so  that it is more fair.   When asked how these tax cuts were paid for, Secretary Mnuchin said  they would be so effective at bolstering the economy that it would pay  for itself. Now, we have seen trickle-down economics before in this  country, and it is a nonsensical idea that this tax plan would bolster  the economy. We have seen the disastrous effects of trickle-down  economics specifically on low-income and middle-income families.   The Tax Foundation estimates that reducing the business rate for  companies and pass-throughs to 15 percent would actually reduce revenue  in this country by $3.5 trillion over 10 years. They also found that,  at the very best, the plan would only spur enough growth to pay for  less than half the cost of the tax cuts. Low-and middle-income  Americans would ultimately pay the price, not Big Business.   Now, this is similar to what we saw in the healthcare plan. In the  healthcare plan, if you remember, what we saw was a proposal to cut  $880 billion from Medicaid and take that money and essentially give a  trillion dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest. So if you were in the  top 4 percent of income earners in this country, you would have gotten  a tax cut of about $200,000 a year. But if you were in that age that we  like to call seniors, between 50 and 64, you would have an age tax and  you would have to pay up to $15,000 more on your premiums. So that is  why some of my colleagues across the aisle actually called that  healthcare plan a downpayment on a tax plan. It was supposed to be the  beginning of a tax reform plan that, again, moved more money to the  wealthiest in our country.   We are seeing a State-level microcosm of this playing out right now  in the State of Kansas where the State passed massive tax cuts,  including exempting pass-throughs from State taxes.   The result?   More than 333,000 residents changed their income to funnel through  pass-throughs in the first year alone.   What happened in Kansas when this was pushed through?   State revenue went down by an additional almost 2 percent, costing  $206 million in 2013 and $472 million the following year.   Today, the State faces a $1.1 billion shortfall, and residents are  paying the price in lost programming and services. But the promise that  was made at the time that this plan was pushed through in Kansas--the  same kind of plan that is being proposed today at the Federal level-- the promise that was made was that it would kick-start the economy.  Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, that hasn't happened either.  Economic growth in Kansas is happening at just half the national  average.   Because here is the thing: tax cuts don't just pay for themselves,  and there are plenty of experts on both sides of the aisle that will  attest to that. A sheet of paper is not a plan, and everyone knows it.   When reporters pressed Secretary Mnuchin and the National Economic  Council Director Gary Cohn for details, they failed to provide anything  of substance. A reporter asked Cohn three times what the tax cut would  look like for a family of four making $60,000 per year.    I have a lot of those families, Mr. Speaker, in my district. I  believe we have those families in red States and blue States, working  people across this country who believe that America should be and must  be a land of opportunity for people who work hard. Maybe they are not  the richest people in the world. Maybe they are not the richest top 1  percent in this country. But they work hard, they earn a good living,  and they deserve to have fairness in our tax plan.   Now, when Mr. Cohn was asked three times by this reporter what the  tax cut would look like for a family of four making $60,000 a year, he  replied it is ``gonna mean a tax cut'' three times in a row. Instead of  getting answers, though, and when he was pressed, reporters were told  over and over again that they would get more information later and that  the administration is in ``robust talks.''   Well, I am a Member of the House, and supposedly those robust talks  are happening with the House and the Senate. We all represent the  people of the United States. We want to all be a part  [[Page H2932]]  of the conversation, and we demand to know specifically, as we look at  this plan, how this President, his family, and his Cabinet will benefit  from the tax plan. That is only fair, Mr. Speaker, that we understand  exactly how this tax plan would benefit the person who is proposing the  tax plan.   Is this tax plan for the American people to see relief, or is it for  the President and his best friends to see relief?   The reality is that this is about an issue of trust. The American  people deserve to know whether they can trust this President and this  administration to act on their behalf. So far, unfortunately, this  administration has continued to throw the middle class under the bus,  whether it is threatening to cut funding for Meals on Wheels, which is  part of the budget proposal in cutting the CDBG programs, or whether it  is in proposing a healthcare plan that cuts vital health care from  millions of Americans. So we are intent to stay extremely vigilant.   I see that we have a couple of colleagues from the Progressive  Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), a colleague on the Judiciary Committee, a strong champion  for working people in Texas and across our country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for  eloquently articulating so many of the issues that are in front of us  right now, including, once again: What exactly is this administration  doing for people across this country, both those who voted for him and  those who didn't, but middle class Americans who are trying to make  sure that this country stays a land of opportunity?   Mr. Speaker, so the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin), my  distinguished vice chair and co-chair of this Special Order hour, may  control the remainder of this hour, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
