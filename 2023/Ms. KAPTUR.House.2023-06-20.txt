 Mr. Speaker, promoting economic growth and creating good- paying jobs for America's workers is at the forefront of my work every  day here in Congress. Let me highlight the impressive continued record  job growth under the Biden administration through legislation passed  mainly by Democrats here in the House and the other body.   In the most recent May jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor  Statistics, 339,000 new jobs were added nationally. The U.S. economy  has gained more than 13 million jobs under President Biden, the fastest  job growth in American history.   Let me repeat that: The fastest job growth in American history.   As you can see on this chart, President Biden's economic growth plan  has added an average of 470,000 jobs to the economy every month since  he took office. What a stark contrast with the job losses under the  previous administration. These Biden job increases are historic and  unprecedented. Unemployment remains near historic lows at just 3.7  percent.   Mr. Speaker, let this record speak for itself. House Democrats and  President Biden leave no family behind.                            ____________________
