 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is a basic constitutional responsibility of Congress to fund the  Federal Government and Republican majorities in the House and the  Senate are just turning the process into an embarrassing spectacle,  running from one crisis directly into the next.   It has been clear for 9 months that a bipartisan budget agreement  would be needed to enact appropriations law, yet it has taken five  continuing resolutions, two lapses in funding, countless hours of  effort to take even this first step toward full-year funding bills,  more than 4 months into the fiscal year.   I am pleased with many aspects of the budget agreement. Increasing  statutory spending caps would allow the Appropriations Committee to  write responsible, bipartisan spending bills that will invest in this  Nation's families, communities, and national security.   I am also pleased the legislation would provide funding for families  and communities in Texas, Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and the  U.S. Virgin Islands to rebuild their lives following natural disasters.   Unfortunately, this legislation cannot be considered in a vacuum. The  Speaker of the House's refusal to commit to considering bipartisan  legislation to protect teenagers and young adults from deportation is  unjustifiable and maddening.   DREAMers are sons, daughters, parents. They are students and  teachers. They serve with distinction in our Armed Forces. They pay  taxes and contribute to their communities.   President Trump and the Republican majority hold the lives and  futures of these children and young adults in their hands, yet their  only concern seems to be how much they can extract and exchange for  doing what a decent human being should do simply because it is right.   I cannot vote in good conscience to provide Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, the very funding that could be used to deport the  DREAMers. I cannot vote to continue the appropriations process while an  unthinkably tragic fate hangs over the head of 1.6 million young  people.   I do hope that in the weeks ahead a bipartisan bill for DREAMers can  pass the Senate and enough pressure can be brought to bear on House  Republicans to act. History will condemn these Republican majorities if  they fail to do what is right.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, the Speaker of the House is supposed to be the Speaker  of this entire House. And the entire will of this House on the  Democratic side and Republican side is to pass a DACA bill but we are  running out of time.   Instead of following the bipartisan consensus of the majority in this  House, this Speaker is yielding to the will of the majority party's  anti-immigration fringe unilaterally, and that fringe is led by this  President. If we continue to bend to this fringe, this body, this shiny  beacon on a hill, this hopefulness in this country will go dark.   The Senate was able to pass the bipartisan agreement due to the hard  promise of Leader McConnell and the good work of our Democratic  leadership as well to allow--simply allow--the body to vote on a DACA  bill. We, however, have no such commitment on this side.   22,000 dreamers in the State of New Jersey: they are doctors, they  are lawyers, they are connected to their churches, they are parents,  they are teachers, they are business owners. I spent time in a church  where a Christian, tithe-paying immigrant was taken from his family and  put in detention. He was not a threat to anyone.   My constituents did not send me here to deport young people who are  American and know no other country.   I ask you, I beg you, I implore you: Do your job. Save these  DREAMers, and until we do, I urge a ``no'' on this vote.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Aguilar), a member of the Committee on  Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.                                time  0500     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   A fifth CR--a fifth CR--while one party controls all levers of  government, shows the Republicans' inability to govern.   Even more upsetting is their refusal to put a bipartisan DREAMer bill  on the House floor. While there are provisions in the Senate amendment  that Democrats support, we implore our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle to do what is right and to permit a vote on a bipartisan  DREAMer bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
