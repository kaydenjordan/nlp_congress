 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mrs. Lowey from  New York, for yielding. And here we are, again, and again, and again-- in fact, that is the ninth continuing resolution that the Republicans  have punted in this Congress rather than getting the job done.   This President claims to be a great dealmaker, but what kind of a  deal does he even want? He keeps switching the goal posts again and  again. It reminds me of a child who flips over a Monopoly board when he  realizes he is about to lose.   The President's nonsense is compounded by the dysfunction, sadly, of  the House Republicans. They are about to vote on funding a bill that  has no chance of becoming law, zero chance of becoming law. All of this  because they want to waste money on a border wall that Mexico was  supposed to pay for and won't work anyway because it is 13th century  technology.   Imagine billions of dollars being able to pay some of the student  loan debt around this country, or help our teachers earn better  salaries, or pave the roads and bridges around this country that need  repair, or invest in good clean-air energy jobs. Take your pick, Mr.  President, but $5.7 billion for a wall that won't even work? No thanks.    The American people expect so much more of us in this Congress.  Sadly, the Republican leadership and this President are attempting  eleventh-hour shenanigans to get a wall that voters across this  country, clearly, definitely rejected when they sent a new majority to  Congress. And, frankly, they can't get here fast enough.   The American people deserve better. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no.''
