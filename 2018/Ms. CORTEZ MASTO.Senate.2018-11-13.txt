 Mr. President, I come forward today to  recognize the mayor of the city of Sparks, Geno Martini, who, after  years of dedicated service, announced his retirement this year.   Mayor Martini was born on January 19, 1946, in Reno. Three days  later, he returned to his family's home in Sparks and has never left  the city since. Every day during his childhood, he would walk to school  down an old dirt road and even played Little League baseball where  Sparks City Hall now stands. He was student body president and  graduated from Sparks High School and the University of Nevada, going  on to work in the banking industry for three decades.   Both Mayor Martini and Sparks have come a long way since his  childhood days. That old dusty road he walked down is now Prater Way,  one of the main routes connecting Sparks' established neighborhoods  with new shopping, entertainment, and business opportunities on the  east side of the city. Downtown Sparks is benefitting from private  investment and revitalization that is also helping address the region's  housing shortage. The success of these projects and the benefits they  bring to the city of Sparks are due in no small part to the hard work  and leadership of Mayor Martini.   In 1998, Martini left the banking industry to serve on the Sparks  City Council until 2005. He was then elected mayor serving full terms  in 2006, 2010, and 2014, making him the longest serving mayor of Sparks  in the city's history. He has gone above and beyond his mayoral duties  and served on the Truckee Meadows Water Authority Board of Directors,  the Nevada League of Cities and Municipalities, the Board of Directors  Regional Planning Governing Board, the Western Regional Water  Commission, and the City of Sparks Legislative Team.   Mayor Martini's commitment to the city of Sparks extended to all of  its residents. He performed community service in underserved  communities and passed out Thanksgiving turkeys to those in need. At  the same time, he helped bring opportunity to northern Nevada by paving  the way for new businesses and development around the Sparks Marina,  Legends Mall, and Victorian Avenue. Mayor Martini has guided the city  of Sparks through both tumultuous economic times and the area's highest  growth periods. During his tenure, Sparks has seen an additional 1  million square feet of retail space open for business.   It is no wonder that Mayor Martini has been repeatedly recognized for  his leadership, receiving the 2017 Citizen of the Year Award from the  Reno Gazette Journal, the 2016 Public Official of the Year from the  Nevada League of Cities and Municipalities, the Citizen of the Year  Award and Lifetime Achievement Award from the Sparks Chamber, and was  inducted into the Junior Achievement Business Hall of Fame, as well as  numerous other accolades that recognize his commitment to serving the  people of Sparks.   In 2012, Mayor Martini was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.  Despite these challenging circumstances, he has never wavered in his  commitment to public service and the people of Sparks. He won  reelection in 2014 and steadfastly served out his entire term,  cementing his legacy as a genuine public servant committed to pragmatic  governance and hard work.   Today, I celebrate the many contributions of Mayor Martini to the  city of Sparks and to the northern Nevada community. His service is as  an example to all of us who wish to know, serve, and better our  communities.                            ____________________
