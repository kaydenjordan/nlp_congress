 Mr. Speaker, block-granting Medicaid will increase out-of- pocket costs, limit patient care, and take away health coverage for  millions of Americans across this country.   Block-granting Medicaid is just another way of cutting Medicaid. To  reduce costs, States will cut eligibility, cut payments to doctors and  hospitals that care for the poor, and cut coverage for seniors and  medicines.   These cuts will raise out-of-pocket costs for Americans, result in  fewer hospitals and providers for Medicaid recipients, and increase  barriers to care for low-income, rural, and vulnerable patients.                                time  1515    It will harm people in underserved areas with physician shortages,  like Desert Hot Springs, Eastern Coachella Valley, and Hemet in my  district, people in rural areas, low-income seniors, children, people  with disabilities, our neighbors and families.   Put simply, Medicaid block grants hurt the very people Medicaid is  here to help. That is why I urge this body to vote for H. Res. 826 and  make a strong statement to protect healthcare for millions of  Americans.    As labor goes, so goes America.   When workers' rights are diminished, our middle class struggles.   This economy has made millions and billions for millionaires and  billionaires, but middle-class families feel left behind. Their wages  fail to keep pace with inflation, and workers struggle for better  conditions.   That is why I urge the House to vote for H.R. 2474, the Protecting  the Right to Organize Act, to strengthen and protect workers' right to  organize so they can negotiate higher wages, fight for better benefits,  and protect themselves from abuse.   It was labor that first stood up for workers' rights; it was labor  that built America's middle class; and it is labor that continues to  fight to bring fairness to our economy and improve the lives of  hardworking middle-class families.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support workers across the Nation  by voting ``yes'' on the PRO Act today.
