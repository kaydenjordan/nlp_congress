 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bipartisan  Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.   This groundbreaking legislation is vital to rural communities like  mine, where my constituents are actually struggling every day to make  ends meet. This bill allows greater access to capital for consumers and  small businesses that will unleash more opportunities for Main Street  to flourish, finally. However, in order for Main Street to truly  produce, we must ensure our community financial institutions are  healthy, safe, and not overburdened to the point of closure.   In my district in New York, small banks and credit unions are the  lifeline for consumers who seek access to capital. Whether it is a  family buying their first home or a young adult purchasing a new car,  consumers in New York rely heavily on our Nation's community financial  institutions.   I am grateful to have two pieces of bipartisan legislation that  promote relationship banking and regulatory relief that are included in  this bill package today. Two of my bipartisan bills included in this  package are the Small Bank Exam Cycle Improvement Act and the Community  Institution Mortgage Relief Act which offer small, local communities  and financial institutions a little much-needed assistance to help  better serve their communities.   I am proud of the hard work my colleagues have done to craft this  important, bipartisan legislation, and I am very thankful to Chairman  Hensarling for making sure that this bill becomes a reality for  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, S. 2155 will help families in my district achieve  financial independence, and I urge all of my colleagues to support  this, including my cosponsors, Mr. Sherman and Mr. Crist, who I hope  will be joining us in support of this bill.
