 Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Georgia for  those comments, and I would like to associate myself with all of them.  We should have saved it for the concluding speech, I think.   I rise today to also honor a man who has spent the last 46 years  faithfully serving the State of Mississippi in Congress.   Thad, you are the longest currently serving Member of Congress, and  we are going to miss your experience and your leadership. You have left  a mark on Congress that won't soon be forgotten. You have served with  great distinction and made a difference in the Senate. Your time in  Washington began when the people of Mississippi voted to send you to  the House of Representatives, and you represented their interests in  that Chamber from 1972 to 1978. Then you ran for and won the noble  Senate seat.   Thad and I have found ourselves on two sides of the U.S. coin. He  chairs the Appropriations Committee; I chair the Budget Committee. Even  though he does the detail of spending the money and I work to set the  parameters, I have always respected him and enjoyed working with him.   Former Senators have spoken highly of Senator Cochran. In fact, in  2007, while congratulating Thad on his 10,000th vote, our good friend,  the late Senator Ted Kennedy, said:         Thad and I don't always agree on policy matters--and more       often than not we find ourselves on opposite sides of the       issues--but those disagreements never diminished my respect       for his thoughtfulness and nor do they diminish the       friendship I feel toward him.    I think that is a pretty common refrain for somebody who is quiet and  effective and perseveres through everything.   Thad is known to hold strong opinions, but that has never stopped him  from developing a close working relationship with Members of both  parties. Throughout his career, he has used his experience and mastery  of the issues to persuade his colleagues, but he has done so privately  rather than bashing in the media. This determined, yet respectful,  approach to negotiations and his passion to find solutions to the  problems and concerns of the people of Wyoming and America have led to  his nickname, the ``quiet persuader.'' He has been a great mentor to  me. Thad has had a remarkable career, and his leadership will be dearly  missed. He has inspired future leaders from his State, and in that way  and so many others he has made a difference.    Diana joins me in sending our best wishes to you, to your wife Kay,  and to the rest of your family, and our appreciation for your  willingness to serve Mississippi and the Nation so faithfully and so  long.   There are countless sayings about how politics isn't for anyone but  the brave and the resilient. I think your experience, especially this  past year, has shown that there is no challenge too large for you to  overcome, and clearly you specialize in making the world a better  place--and that is a win-win for us all, especially our children and  our grandchildren.   I am sad to see you leave the Senate at the end of this month, but I  wish you a well-deserved retirement and other adventures.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, on February 9, 2018, the President signed  the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 into law, H.R. 1892, P.L. 115-123.  This bill passed the Senate by a vote of 71 to 28 and the House of  Representatives by a vote of 240 to 186. Section 30101 of H.R. 1892  increased the statutory discretionary spending limits for Fiscal Year  2018. More specifically, it increased the Fiscal Year 2018  discretionary spending limit for the revised security category to $629  billion in new budget authority and the revised nonsecurity category to  $579 billion in new budget authority. Section 4108 of the Fiscal Year  2018 congressional budget resolution provides me with the authority to  adjust enforceable levels and allocations for such changes in the  statutory limits. I am therefore adjusting the allocation to the  Committee on Appropriations and the budgetary aggregates to reflect the  new spending limits imposed by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.   In addition to the changes triggered by P.L. 115-123, section 251 of  the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA,  establishes statutory limits on discretionary spending and allows for  various adjustments to those limits, while sections 302 and 314(a) of  the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget  Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates,  and levels consistent with those adjustments. The Senate is considering  the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1625, the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. This measure provides full-year  appropriations for Federal Government agencies and contains spending  that qualifies for cap adjustments under current statute.   This measure includes $78,097 million in budget authority that is  designated as being for overseas contingency operations/Global War on  Terrorism pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA. Of that  amount, $66,079 million is for spending in the security category and  $12,018 million is for nonsecurity spending. CBO estimates that this  budget authority will result in $43,344 million in outlays in, Fiscal  Year 2018.   This measure also includes $7,366 million in nonsecurity  discretionary budget authority designated for disaster relief pursuant  to section 251(b)(2)(D) of BBEDCA. This designation makes the spending  associated with this provision and its associated outlays of $368  million eligible for an adjustment.   This legislation provides $1,896 million in nonsecurity discretionary  budget authority for program integrity efforts. This funding is  designated pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(B) and section 251(b)(2)(C) of  BBEDCA. CBO estimates that this budget authority will result in $1,576  million in outlays this fiscal year.   Finally, this legislation repurposes existing emergency funding  increasing outlays by $1 million. This action is designated as an  emergency pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA.   As a result of the aforementioned designations, I am revising the  budget authority and outlay allocations to the Committee on  Appropriations by increasing revised security budget authority by  $146,022 million, revised nonsecurity budget authority by $84,531  million, and outlays by $108,997 million in Fiscal Year 2018. Further,  I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for Fiscal Year 2018 by  $230,553 million in budget authority and $108,997 million in outlays.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES  (Pursuant to Section 4108 of H. Con.
