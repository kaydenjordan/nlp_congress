 Madam President, today is the birthday of Karen  Ferguson, a tireless advocate for retirement security, who sadly passed  away in December. She started a movement for improved worker's rights  and better pensions. Forty-six years ago today, she founded the Pension  Rights Center in aid of that effort. As recently as this past March,  Karen's impact can be seen in the passage of the Butch Lewis Act, which  helps protect the benefits of workers and retirees in multiemployers  plans. We are deeply grateful for Karen's work and can honor her legacy  by continuing to fight so that everyone can retire with dignity and  security.                            ____________________
