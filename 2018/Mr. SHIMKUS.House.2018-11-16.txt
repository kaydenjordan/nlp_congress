 Mr. Speaker, representing a rural district in which many  small towns rely on just one pharmacy to access lifesaving drugs has  made me a believer in the value of community pharmacists. I also  believe in free markets and competition, but a healthy market requires  transparency and a level playing field.   Unfortunately, based upon my recent visits to community pharmacists  in towns like Golconda, Rosiclare, and Carmi, pharmacy benefit  managers, PBMs, are threatening the solvency of these community  institutions by using complicated formularies that often result in  local pharmacies being reimbursed less per prescription than their  higher volume, big box peers, and direct and indirect remuneration, or  DIR, fees, which create uncertainty and can impose a serious cash flow  squeeze that too many times forces independent pharmacists to close  their doors or sell their businesses.   Drug prices are a big issue. We can help bring down costs by reducing  barriers to drug development and delivery while increasing competition  through transparency that allows everyone to compete on a level playing  field.                            ____________________
