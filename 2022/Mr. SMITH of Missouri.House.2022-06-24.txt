 Madam Speaker, as a strong advocate and  fighter for the Second Amendment, I cannot support the Senate's gun  control bill.   The legislation is simply another attempt to blame law-abiding gun  owners instead of holding accountable the disturbed criminals who are  carrying out despicable acts of violence.   The gun control bill would strengthen red flag laws, which take away  individuals' due process rights, while allowing law enforcement to  remove guns from individuals at the request of an expansive list of  acquaintances.   In America, a person is innocent until proven guilty. But liberal  Democrats, they don't see it quite that way. The presumption of  innocence--the foundation of our criminal justice system--apparently  does not apply to law-abiding gun owners in the world of the Democrats'  vision.   I will fight tooth and nail to protect families from Washington  Democrats' relentless attacks on our freedom and way of life.                            ____________________
