 Mr. Speaker, this bill is critically important to our  families across the country.   I am proud that this bill includes a provision that I have introduced  the past two sessions of Congress, the Consumer Protection for Medical  Debt Collection Act.   Nearly 20 percent of adults have one or more medical debt collections  listed on their credit reports. That means one in five of our neighbors  across the country may be denied housing, transportation, or other  necessities because of a sudden health crisis or visit to the emergency  room. That hits particularly hard in communities like mine, where  residents already face so many challenges with access to credit.   Treating medical debt the same as other debt is just not right. It  leads to irreparable harm to residents who simply just needed health  and medical care.   Medical debt is the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in our  country, and the pandemic has only made the medical debt crisis worse;  2.5 million people saw medical debt enter collections since the  pandemic began, totaling $2.2 billion in medical debt.   H.R. 2547 will provide protections and safeguards to our neighbors  who, through no fault of their own, got sick and could not afford  medical care due to the broken healthcare system.   This bill would prevent the collection of medical debt for 2 years  from the date of medical billing and prohibits credit agencies from  reporting all medical collections for a year.   Medical bills and reimbursements are often vague and confusing, so  this gives our neighbors time to figure out what they actually do owe.   Finally, this bill would ban medical debt from a medically necessary  procedure from ever appearing on your credit report.   No one chooses to get sick. Undergoing a medically necessary  procedure should never haunt someone financially. It has no place on  our credit reports.   I thank Chairwoman Waters for her leadership on this vital  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I believe I am actually the second, but I am  the only Palestinian-American Member of Congress now, and my mere  existence has disrupted the status quo. This is so personal for me. I  am a reminder to colleagues that Palestinians do, indeed, exist, that  we are human, that we are allowed to dream. We are mothers, daughters,  granddaughters, we are justice seekers and are unapologetic about our  fight against oppressions of all forms.   Colleagues, Palestinians aren't going anywhere, no matter how much  money you send to Israel's apartheid government.   If we are to make good on our promises to support equal human rights  for all, it is our duty to end the apartheid system that, for decades,  has subjected Palestinians to inhumane treatment and racism.   Reducing Palestinians to live in utter fear and terror of losing a  child, being indefinitely detained or killed because of who they are,  and the unequal rights and protections they have, under Israeli law, it  must end.   One of Israel's most prominent human rights organizations, B'Tselem,  has declared Israel an apartheid state. Human Rights Watch recently  recognized it, too. This is what Palestinians living under Israel's  oppression have been telling us for decades.                                time  1815    I have been told by some of my colleagues who dispute the truth about  segregation, racism, and violence in Israel toward Palestinians that I  need to know the history.   What they mean, unintentionally or not, is that Palestinians do not  have the right to tell the truth about what happened to them during the  founding of Israel. They, in effect, erase the truth about the ethnic  cleansing of Palestinians in Israel that some refer to as the Nakba, or  catastrophe.   As Palestinians talk about our history, know that many of my Black  neighbors and indigenous communities may not know what we mean by  Nakba, but they do understand what it means to be killed, expelled from  your homeland, made homeless, and stripped of your human rights.   My ancestors and current family in Palestine deserve the world to  hear their history without obstruction. They have a right to be able to  explain to the world that they are still suffering, still being  dispossessed, still being killed as the world watches and does nothing.   As Peter Beinart, an American of Jewish faith, writes: ``When you  tell a people to forget its past, you are not proposing peace. You are  proposing extinction.''   The Palestinian story is that of being made a refugee on the lands  you called home.   We cannot have an honest conversation about U.S. military support for  the Israeli Government today without acknowledging that, for  Palestinians, the catastrophe of displacement and dehumanization in  their homeland has been ongoing since 1948.   To read the statements from President Biden, Secretary Blinken,  General Austin, and leaders of both parties, you would hardly know  Palestinians existed at all.   There has been no recognition of the attack on Palestinian families  being ripped from their homes in East Jerusalem right now or home  demolitions; no mention of children being detained or murdered; no  recognition of a sustained campaign of harassment and terror by Israeli  police against worshipers kneeling down and praying and celebrating  their holiest days in one of their holiest places; no mention of Al- Aqsa being surrounded by violence, tear gas, and smoke while people  pray.   Can my colleagues imagine if it was their place of worship filled  with tear gas? Could you pray as stun grenades were tossed into your  holiest place?   Above all, there has been absolutely no recognition of Palestinian  humanity. If our own State Department can't even bring itself to  acknowledge that the killing of Palestinian children is wrong, well, I  will say it for the millions of Americans who stand with me against the  killing of innocent children no matter their ethnicity or faith.   I weep for all the lives lost under the unbearable status quo, every  single one, no matter their faith or their background. We all deserve  freedom, liberty, peace, and justice, and it should never be denied  because of our faith or ethnic background.   No child, Palestinian or Israeli or whoever they are, should ever  have to worry that death will rain from the sky.   How many of my colleagues are willing to say the same, to stand for  Palestinian human rights as they do for Israelis?   There is a crushing dehumanization to how we talk about this terrible  violence.   The New York Post reported the Palestinian death toll as Israeli  casualties.   ABC says that Israelis are ``killed'' while Palestinians simply  ``die,'' as if by magic, as if they were never human to begin with.   Help me understand the math. How many Palestinians have to die for  their lives to matter?   Life under apartheid strips Palestinians of their human dignity.   How would you feel if you had to go through dehumanizing checkpoints  two blocks from your own home to go to the doctor or travel across your  own land? How would you feel if you had to do it while pregnant, in the  scorching heat, as soldiers with guns controlled your freedom?   How would you feel if you lived in Gaza, where your power and water  might be out for days or weeks at a time, where you were cut off from  the outside world by an inhumane military blockade?   Meanwhile, Palestinians' rights to nonviolent resistance have been  curtailed and even criminalized.   Our party leaders have spoken forcefully against BDS, calling its  proponents anti-Semitic, despite the same tactics being critical to  ending South African apartheid mere decades ago.   What we are telling Palestinians fighting apartheid is the same thing  being told to my Black neighbors and Americans throughout America who  are fighting against police brutality here: There is no form of  acceptable resistance to state violence.   As long as the message from Washington is that our military's support  for Israel is unconditional, Netanyahu's extremist, rightwing  government will continue to expand settlements, continue to demolish  homes, and continue to make the prospects for peace impossible.   Mr. Speaker, 330 of my own colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, 75  percent of the body here, signed a letter pledging that Israel shall  never be made to comply with basic human rights laws that other  countries that receive our military aid must observe.   When I see the images and videos of destruction and death in  Palestine, all I hear are the children screaming from pure fear and  terror.   I want to read something a mother named Eman in Gaza wrote 2 days  ago. She said: ``Tonight, I put the kids to sleep in our bedroom. So  that when we die, we die together and no one would live to mourn the  loss of one another.''   That statement broke me a little more because my country's policies  and funding will deny this mother's right to see her children live  without fear and to grow old without painful trauma and violence.   We must condition aid to Israel on compliance with international  human rights and an end to apartheid. We must, with no hesitation,  demand that our country recognize that the unconditional support of  Israel has enabled the erasure of Palestinian life and the denial of  the rights of millions of refugees, and it emboldens the apartheid  policies that Human Rights Watch has detailed so thoroughly in their  recent report.    I stand before you not only as a Congresswoman for the beautiful 13  District Strong but also as a proud daughter of Palestinian immigrants  and the  [[Page H2305]]  granddaughter of a loving Palestinian grandmother living in the  occupied Palestine.   You take that and combine it with the fact that I was raised in one  of the most beautiful, Blackest cities in America, a city where  movements for civil rights and social justice are birthed, the city of  Detroit.   So, I can't stand here silent when injustice exists and where the  truth is obscured. If there is one thing Detroit instilled in this  Palestinian girl from Southwest, it is you always speak truth to power  even if your voice shakes.   The freedom of Palestinians is connected to the fight against  oppression all over the world.   Lastly, to my Sity in Palestine, `` `aqaf huna bsbbik.'' I stand here  because of you.
