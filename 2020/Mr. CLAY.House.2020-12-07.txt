 Mr. Speaker, I wanted to share with the House that I am  really reserving the time for Mr. Butterfield from North Carolina, but  I will begin. I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Butterfield, for  leading this Special Order hour this evening.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation was founded on principles of liberty and  justice for some, but not for all. In fact, it took 89 years after the  Declaration of Independence and a brutal Civil War to finally end most  forms of slavery.   The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified on December  6, 1865, ending slavery but preserving involuntary servitude for some  incarcerated persons.   After a raging debate, former slaveholders in the Southern States  held enough influence to preserve the practice and were able to include  a loophole in the 13th Amendment to continue to allow slavery as  punishment for a crime.   Over the next 155 years, that punishment clause was used as a club to  overincarcerate African Americans and other minorities for profit and  in complete violation of their human dignity.   Black Americans were immediately targeted and arrested by law  enforcement for minor infractions, and the practice of forced prison  labor began and still persists to this day.   That is why I, joined by Senator Jeff Merkley from Oregon, introduced  legislation to amend the Constitution to clarify that neither slavery  nor involuntary servitude may be used as punishment for a crime.   I am pleased that many of my colleagues, including Congressman Cedric  Richmond, incoming Assistant Speaker Congresswoman Katherine Clark, and  many of my colleagues in the CBC and broader Tri-Caucus, have also  taken a leadership role on this issue in legislation.   Confronting and rooting out the systemic racism that is still rampant  in many facets of American life requires us to examine the painful  truth in order to fix it. It is an indisputable historical fact that  many local and State law enforcement practices in this country grew out  of the legacy of racism and slavery.   As millions of Americans are demanding criminal justice reform and a  change in the training and culture of policing, passage of this  constitutional amendment would send a clear signal: Bigotry and profits  will no longer be used to deny any person their dignity.   Our criminal justice system and laws cannot be fully respected until  we end this injustice that allows disproportionate numbers of Black and  Brown people to be imprisoned and enslaved.   As I retire from Congress next month, I urge my colleagues to make  passage of this legislation an urgent national priority. America cannot  heal and move forward until we have real equality for all instead of  just for some.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
