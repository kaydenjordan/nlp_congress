 Mr. President, over the past 24 hours we have learned of  a high-level meeting between Director Pompeo--Mike Pompeo, the  President's nominee to become Secretary of State--and Kim Jong Un, the  leader--the tyrant leader--of North Korea, who has threatened to use  nuclear weapons not only against our allies but against the United  States and has a growing capability in his efforts to do just that.   We have also seen incredible partisan obstruction threatened on his  nomination. The absurd levels of partisanship in this Chamber are a  stain on our institution. We see it at every level of nominations, from  ambassadorships to commissions to boards. Now we see it at the level of  the Secretary of State, a position that will be instrumental in  denuclearizing the North Korean regime.   Director Pompeo had his confirmation hearing last week before the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We now know that his testimony at  this committee hearing took place after he had visited Kim Jong Un, and  in this committee hearing, he made it very clear that our goal remains  the complete and verifiable irreversible denuclearization. That is the  stated goal, confirmed by Director Pompeo: the complete and verifiable  irreversible denuclearization of North Korea. Yet we now have people  threatening to stop this nomination at a critical time when we face a  nuclear threat that is the greatest this country has seen since the  Cuban Missile Crisis.   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would decide to deny  this country its top State Department diplomat.   Let me describe what some of our colleagues have said who have  claimed now that they are going to vote against Mike Pompeo for  Secretary of State but who, just a few months back, voted to confirm  Mike Pompeo. One of my colleagues who is voting against Director Pompeo  for Secretary of State has admitted that Director Pompeo has been a  ``solid manager'' of the CIA, saying:         I voted for him to head the CIA and don't wish I had that       vote back. I think he has a background in intel and has been       a solid manager there.   [[Page S2249]]     Another colleague, who tried to criticize Director Pompeo's diversity  policies at the CIA, was met with this response from Director Pompeo,  who explained at the hearing that those types of complaints decreased  under his leadership. Mike Pompeo stated: ``The number of--we call them  `no fear complaints'--the statutory requirement decreased from 2016 to  2017 by 40 percent.''   Director Pompeo further explained: ``I'm proud of the record . . .  the work that my team has done on this.''   So concerns about diversity policies was refuted at the committee  hearing.   Another Senator seems worried that Mike Pompeo is conducting  diplomacy and said: ``Pompeo is the wrong person to be engaging in  diplomacy.''   The nominee to be Secretary of State is the wrong person to be  conducting diplomacy? Perhaps we need somebody working at the  Department of Transportation. Maybe that is the person they want to  conduct diplomacy. Building interstates--maybe that is who they think  should be conducting diplomacy. I would rather have somebody who has  been nominated to be Secretary of State to be conducting diplomacy-- somebody who has an outstanding background in the military, somebody  who stood in Europe during the height of the Cold War, standing on the  iron wall.   This is a time when we ought to be doing everything we can to confirm  a Secretary of State--somebody who has had meetings already with Kim  Jong Un, who has an understanding of what has to happen to achieve what  Kim Jong Un has said--denuclearization--to achieve what is the goal of  this country, the stated goal that is already enshrined in law:  complete and verifiable irreversible denuclearization.   To simply oppose his nomination for partisan purposes is wrong. We  have seen it time and again. What we have is a simple partisan effort  to derail the top diplomat, who is already engaged in top-level  negotiations about denuclearization with the most significant threat  this country has seen since the Cuban Missile Crisis. This country  deserves better. Certainly this institution can do better.   We have somebody in Mike Pompeo with a solid background, an  understanding of diplomacy and, clearly, the intelligence background  through his time at the CIA, and now he would be denied this  opportunity simply because of his political affiliation.   This country deserves better.   I urge my colleagues to stop this absurd obstruction and confirm Mike  Pompeo, and let's get to work achieving what could be lasting peace on  the Korean Peninsula. That time is now, and I urge my colleagues to  take the opportunity for peace.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
