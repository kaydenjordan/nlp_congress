 Madam President, the Senate gavels back in for another  busy week of an exceedingly busy work period. There is a lot we must  continue working on to lower costs for the American people; strengthen  healthcare and prescription drug costs, make sure they are low; confirm  highly qualified nominees; protect our fundamental rights; and fortify  U.S. national security interests. None of this is easy, but we are  moving ahead.   In a few hours, the Senate will take another important step towards  finally passing our bipartisan chips and innovation bill by voting to  invoke cloture.  [[Page S3620]]  After more than a year of hard work on fixing U.S. chip supplies and  boosting American scientific innovation, we are on the brink of closing  the book and passing these critical investments into law.   If cloture is invoked, Members should plan to vote on final passage  as early as tomorrow evening or Wednesday.   When signed into law, the impacts of this bipartisan chips and  innovation bill will last years, if not decades. It will mean an  increase in American jobs, increased manufacturing here at home, relief  for our supply chains, and lower costs for the American people.   Of course, we will also preserve America's security interests. One of  the most important struggles of this century will be the fight for  global semiconductor supply. Sadly, America is lagging behind. A recent  article from the Wall Street Journal revealed that the Chinese  Communist Party is planning 31 major semiconductor fabs planned over  the next few years in a bid to become the world's leader in new chip  factories. American chip producers are working hard to match this  output, but they are waiting for Congress to finish work on this bill.  Tens of billions of dollars and countless good-paying jobs are at  stake. For that reason, I am glad we are close to pushing this bill  over the goal line.   Of course, there is a lot more to celebrate about this bill. The  bipartisan science provisions--many of which I authored in partnership  with Senator Young under the Endless Frontier Act more than 2 years  ago--will unleash a new wave of American scientific innovation that  will last and create millions of good-paying jobs for decades to come.   We will invest tens of billions to strengthen the National Science  Foundation and plant seeds to cultivate the tech hubs of tomorrow in  regions of the country that have tremendous potential but have long  been overlooked. When we invest in science jobs, that will keep America  No. 1.   For decades, the United States was consistently the world leader in  innovation and scientific research because we made the investments  necessary to stay on top, and the result was millions and millions of  good-paying jobs that made us the strongest economy on Earth, the envy  of the world. In the last decade, unfortunately, we have slipped from  our place on the mountaintop. This bill will help us recapture that  goal and that dream.   The 21st century will be won or lost on the battleground of  technological innovation. This is perhaps the most competitive era in  human history. Will American workers, will American tech, will American  ingenuity shape the world over the next hundred years in the same way  that we have shaped it in the last hundred?   I believe we can. I believe we must. When we pass this bill, I  believe we will. Let's move forward today.                                  Healthcare    Madam President, now on healthcare reforms and reconciliation: Senate  Democrats continue our work to advance legislation that will lower  costs and improve the lives of tens of millions of American families.   Last week, Democrats and Republicans held our bipartisan prescription  drugs Byrd bath meetings with the Parliamentarian. As a reminder, this  important preliminary step will clear the way for passing our reforms  through the reconciliation process. I want to thank Chairs Wyden,  Sanders, and Murray and the tireless work of their Finance, Budget, and  HELP Committee staffs for working around the clock on this important  effort.   If you want to fight inflation, then you should support passing this  much needed proposal on lowering prescription drug costs. Here is why:  For the first time ever, we will empower Medicare to negotiate the  price of many expensive and vital prescription drugs, directly lowering  what patients and taxpayers pay for these drugs. We will cap Americans'  out-of-pocket drug expenses to $2,000 a year. Medicare will offer free  vaccines and additional support for the low-income elderly. And,  crucially, we will ensure that millions don't see their healthcare  premiums skyrocket in the coming months.   Let me say it again because it is key, and I say it to our Republican  colleagues across the aisle. If you want to help Americans better  afford their healthcare and medications, then you should support  passing this bill.   United States citizens pay more, on average, for prescription drugs  than any other people on Earth, all for the exact same medicines that  other countries use. The Democratic plan will finally help change that.   Too many in this country find themselves in the confounding indignity  of having to choose between getting their prescription drugs filled or  putting food on the table for their families. The Democrats' plan will  finally help change that.   And even as working Americans struggle to afford high-quality  healthcare and medications, the Nation's largest pharmaceutical  companies face little accountability for jacking up prices on  consumers. Again, the Democrats' plan will help change that.   For months, we have heard Republicans complain and complain about the  need to lower costs for the American people. Well, Democrats will  present the Senate with a proposal that will do precisely that in a  very big way. What will they choose on the other side of the aisle?  Will they work with us to lower the costs for prescription medications?  Will they shore up our healthcare system and prevent devastating price  hikes? Will they finally join us holding Big Pharma accountable?   This isn't complicated. Senators can vote to lower costs, or they can  vote for higher costs. The American people will be watching.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, today, the Senate had planned to move  [[Page S3627]]  forward to end the debate on the bipartisan chips and innovation bill.  Unfortunately, a number of severe thunderstorms on the East Coast have  disrupted the travel plans of a significant number of Senators. To give  Members a chance to get back into town safely, I am going to delay  tonight's vote on the bipartisan chips and innovation bill until  tomorrow morning. I remain hopeful that we can remain on track to  finish this legislation ASAP.                               PACT Act of 2022    Madam President, in the meantime, I will now file cloture on another  bill that will dramatically improve the lives of millions of American  veterans, the PACT Act, which, when signed into law, will be one of the  biggest expansions of veterans' healthcare benefits in decades.   As my colleagues already know, because of a technical error, the  House of Representatives was unable to take up our version of this bill  that we passed in the spring. The House has now fixed their error and  has returned the PACT Act back to the Senate. By filing cloture, we  should be able to pass this bipartisan piece of legislation before the  week is done.   Our nation's veterans have waited long enough to get the benefits  they need to treat complications from toxic exposure in the line of  duty. So we have every reason in the world to get this bill done with  the same bipartisan support as the first time around.   Again, I want to thank particularly Senators Tester and Moran, who  led the way to pass this bill earlier this year, thank all of our  colleagues and our veterans and veterans service organizations for  helping push this bill through Congress.                    Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 4346    Madam President, now I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding  rule XXII, the cloture vote with respect to H.R. 4346 occur at a time  to be determined by the majority leader, following consultation with  the Republican leader.    For the information of the Senate, we expect the cloture  vote with respect to the CHIPS and science legislation to occur around  11 o'clock a.m. tomorrow, Tuesday, July 26.                                Cloture Motion     Now, Madam President, I have a cloture motion to the  motion to concur at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, July 25, be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 3359 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Tuesday, July 26; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the House message  to accompany S. 3373; further, that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m.  to 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings.    The cloture vote in relation to CHIPS and Science is  expected at 11 a.m., for the information of Members. Please be here.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:46 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, July 26, 2022, at 10 a.m.
