 Mr. Speaker, this week, we celebrate National School  Choice Week. Every child and family is unique in their own way, and  when it comes to learning, it is no different. National School Choice  Week shines a bright spotlight on effective educational options for  children.   At the heart of our American values is the belief that we can all  pursue happiness through hard work and dedication on the path to  achieve the American Dream. This path starts at a young age, and school  choice empowers parents and families to choose the best educational  environment for their child, ensuring that the American Dream can  become a reality.   In the town of Dublin in my district, school choice starts in  elementary school where students are encouraged to find their passions  early on and are provided with the tools to succeed. And it has worked.  Dublin City Schools have a 90 percent graduation rate, with Dublin High  School reaching almost 97 percent.   As a proud school choice supporter and member of the House Education  and Labor Committee, I look forward to continuing my work highlighting  the effect of school choice in Georgia and throughout the Nation.                            ____________________     ``To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for  carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers  vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or  in any Department or Officer thereof.
