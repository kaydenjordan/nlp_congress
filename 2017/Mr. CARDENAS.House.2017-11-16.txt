 Mr. Speaker, just a few minutes ago, on the floor of  the House of Representatives, we saw a vote on what has been called the  middle class tax cut. Unfortunately, I am here to remind all of us, Mr.  Speaker, that it really is a tax scam.   When we have looked into the many communities across America and seen  families like the hardworking families in the district that I represent  in California, the average family or household that files a tax return  every April 15 makes an average income of about $69,000.   That family, according to what was just passed on this floor, is  going to be leaving behind over $1,000 more than they normally would  have when they do their taxes. That hurts. That family is a hardworking  family. That family cannot afford to miss out on $1,000 of their hard- earned money.   I heard people say earlier that that is not going to happen. That is  just not true.                            ____________________
