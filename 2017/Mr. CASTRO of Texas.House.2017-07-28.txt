 Madam Speaker, I will spare you that.   Madam Speaker, I voice my support for H.R. 3180, the Intelligence  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.   The men and women of America's intelligence community, the best in  the world, protect our country every day. They serve beyond the front  lines of conflict to collect and analyze intelligence on our  adversaries.   In addition to being highly effective, America's intelligence  community adapts as the threats our country faces shift on a daily  basis. Their effectiveness is amplified when they are in close  [[Page H6555]]  cooperation and coordination with policymakers.   I want to thank my fellow members on the committee, especially  Ranking Member Schiff and Chairman Nunes, for working with me to add  language into this bill requiring the intelligence community to brief  Congress on our intelligence capabilities in the South China Sea.   Over $5 trillion in ship-borne commerce flows through the region each  year, including the vast majority of sea-borne energy imports by close  U.S. partners such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.   The security of the United States and those of these partners is  closely linked to the ability of the United States to guarantee the  freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.   Our ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea threaten the  principles of a rules-based order and the security of the United States  and our allies.   The language in the IAA allows Congress to more effectively  understand the needs of the intelligence community. It allows for a  two-way conversation so that Congress can act to provide the  intelligence community the tools and authorities it needs to inform  policymakers.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my  condolences to the loved ones and families of the 10 victims who died  in the tragic human smuggling incident that took place in my hometown  of San Antonio, Texas, over the weekend. Many before them have sought  to come to our country by land and sea, and have perished.   These were not Americans, but they are children of God. This was,  above all else, politics aside, a human tragedy.   Please join me in a moment of silence to remember the victims and the  countless others like them who have lost their lives in pursuit of the  American Dream.                            ____________________
