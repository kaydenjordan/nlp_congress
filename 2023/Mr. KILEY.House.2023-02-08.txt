 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Zach Didier, a  beloved member of our community in Rocklin who tragically passed away  from fentanyl shortly after Christmas Day a little over 2 years ago, in  2020.   I would also like to take a moment to introduce the American people  to Zach's parents, Laura Didier and Chris Didier, who are with us today  in the gallery. I was honored to have Laura and Chris as my guests for  last night's State of the Union. They have worked tirelessly to honor  Zach's life through raising awareness of the fentanyl crisis and have  undoubtedly saved many lives.   This is Zach. He was 17 years old, a senior at Whitney High School.  He was an Eagle Scout, soccer player, star of the high school musical,  and straight-A student. He had just applied to college, and his parents  had to go through the gut-wrenching experience of watching acceptance  envelopes arrive from California's leading universities.   I would like to offer a moment of silence to honor the memory and  life of Zach Didier.   Mr. Speaker, Zach had no history of drug use. He was the type of  young man that parents hope their child would become. I know how proud  of him Chris and Laura are.   His story shows that the poison of fentanyl is a risk to everyone. No  community is safe from it. No family can be unaware of the danger.   Fentanyl has become the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18  to 45, more than car accidents, more than suicides, more than anything.   Over 73,000 Americans died from fentanyl this past year. That amounts  to 200 deaths a day, about 1 every 7 minutes.   Though lethality of fentanyl is unlike any other drug, it is about  100 times more potent than morphine. Two milligrams, or the amount that  fits on the tip of a pencil, is a deadly dose. It is now very commonly  added to street pills, such that 98 percent of pills on the street are  fake, and by some estimates, 60 percent have the potential to be  lethal.   Many of the victims are teenagers, young people, people with no prior  drug use. There are many causes connected to this, of course: mental  health, teenagers who are just stressed with the stresses of school,  and certainly the isolation during the whole COVID era.   They often purchase these fake pills on social media over the  internet. The dealers sometimes drive and deliver them straight to the  victims' homes.   What can we do? Well, the first and most important thing, perhaps, is  to continue to raise awareness. Many Americans aren't aware of the  severity of this crisis until it is too late.   Chris and Laura Didier have done 45 school assemblies this year  alone, reaching tens of thousands of students and families, and have  saved many lives, I know, in the process. Every school across the  country needs to have a strategy for making students and families aware  of the dangers.   Secondly, we need to do much more to prevent fentanyl from flowing  into this country. We know that the southern border is a primary  source. In 2022 alone, the DEA seized 379 million lethal doses of  fentanyl. That is enough to kill every single American. Securing the  border would diminish the availability of fentanyl and make it more  difficult to traffic into the United States.   Finally, we need to hold dealers accountable. We need appropriate  criminal laws to punish those who peddle life-ending pills to  unsuspecting victims. We need to have consequences that are  commensurate with the gravity, the evil, of this offense to deter those  who would prey on innocent Americans. This requires State and Federal  governments to revisit their drug laws in many cases. It also requires  prosecutors to make full use of the tools at their disposal.    I applaud Placer County District Attorney Morgan Gire, from my  district, who has provided a roadmap by charging fentanyl dealers with  murder because that is what it is.   The good news is we are seeing growing momentum for addressing this  crisis with the seriousness that it deserves and requires. I am  grateful that President Biden devoted a portion of his State of the  Union Address to addressing it.   I am grateful that Chris and Laura Didier were here last night to see  that because they have played such a large role in working with many  other families who have lost loved ones and are raising public  consciousness.   Mr. Speaker, now is the time that we need to follow words with  action. I look forward to working with the President and everyone in  this Congress, on a bipartisan basis, to help our country turn the  corner on this crisis.                            ____________________
