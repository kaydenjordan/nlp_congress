 Mr. Speaker, I will tell you it is an honor to come  to the floor and talk about one of these protected rights: life.   When we talk about our founding documents and life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness, it is life that we are protecting.   I find it unfortunate that we have some who would say this is a  radical talking point. I would offer that the right to life is a  fundamental right, not a talking point.   Now, what brings us to this point in time?   We all remember the stories of Kermit Gosnell, the abortionist, the  house of horrors, and what happened there, where individuals--moms-- lost their lives, where one of the workers in that clinic estimated  that there had been as many as 100 babies through the years that had  survived an abortion and had been killed.   What we are seeking to do is expand these protections. Today, what we  are doing with H.R. 4712 is to build on that legislation from 2002.  This body had passed that legislation to protect infants that were born  alive and had survived abortions.   This bill before us today is going to do four very important things.   First, it requires appropriate care be given to any child who is born  alive following a failed abortion. It requires any health providers  present to administer the same life-preserving care that would be given  to babies born under any other circumstances and to ensure  [[Page H497]]  that the child is transported immediately to a hospital.    Second, the bill establishes criminal penalties that  providers will face if they violate providing that care.   Third, it establishes a civil right of action to enforce the law.   Finally, the bill provides crucial protections that will prevent  mothers of these babies from being subject to criminal prosecution and  penalties.   Mr. Speaker, these are the right steps to protect the most vulnerable  among us. I encourage support for the bill.
