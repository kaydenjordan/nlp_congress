 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this very  Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, few Americans will ever rival the  depth and the breadth of the service to our Nation exhibited by George  Herbert Walker Bush.   Today, I join the Bush family, my colleagues, fellow Texans, and a  grateful Nation in remembering and honoring the life of President  George H.W. Bush.   He was a courageous war hero, a key member of the Committee on Ways  and Means while he was here in Congress, Ambassador, Director of the  CIA, Vice President, and the President of the United States.   That is a remarkable and historical level of service to America, but  I still think his favorite title was that of husband to his beloved  Bar, and I believe his greatest accomplishment was in raising children  and grandchildren who serve their Nation with dedication and  patriotism.   I believe our country and our State can agree that we have lost a man  of honor and character, who leaves a legacy of love and service to his  Nation and family.   So, today, we all want to share with you a little bit about our  relationship with the beloved President Bush.   I consider myself a proud part of the Bush legacy. On the Ways and  Means Committee, I hold the seat that was previously held by President  Bush, then a Member of Congress, and Bill Archer of Houston, later the  chairman of the Ways and Means Committee from Texas. I am truly blessed  to be part of a legacy on this committee that has achieved so much.   As a matter of fact, my interest in major issues from trade to tax  reform to healthcare is due in large part to President Bush. After I  became elected to Congress, I spent a lot of time visiting President  Bush and Secretary James Baker, asking their advice on these issues. In  fact, one of the reasons I have been involved in 12 of the 14 American  free trade agreements and led the Central American Free Trade Agreement  was directly because of my discussions with President Bush and  Secretary Baker.   President Bush was incredibly supportive of me, both in my early  campaigns for Congress and once I started serving. There was always an  open door to talk about issues dealing in tax and trade, healthcare,  welfare, Social Security, and Medicare. I always knew I had someone I  could lean on for sage advice.   Because I used to represent College Station, I had the pleasure of  being in office when President Bush's library was opened at A&M, and I  worked closely with the foundation for the 8 years I represented it.   The library is remarkable, but it goes way beyond the bricks and  mortar. It is a tangible reminder of the impact President Bush had on  College Station and the State of Texas.   The library brought world leaders to College Station, allowed young  men and women from the small towns in Texas to interact with President  Bush as well as United States and world leaders on a one-on-one, close,  personal level. That incredible legacy for those young people will last  for ages to come.   I will finish with this. One of my favorite moments with President  Bush came just after I was named Ways and Means chairman. President  Bush's office reached out and said the President wanted me to come down  to his office in Houston and visit about Ways and Means issues, so, you  can imagine, I was thrilled about it.   So I went to his office, and my staff really urged me to take a pair  of crazy socks to present to President Bush, because he loved them; he  wore them; he  [[Page H9809]]  had a lot of fun with them. I decided, instead, to bring one of three  specially made Ways and Means ties that we had just created.   I brought that to the President, and he seemed thrilled, but it was  Barbara who was most excited. When I presented the tie, she exclaimed:  Thank God. No more socks, please.   I will finish, too, with this. Finally, every Veterans Day and  Memorial Day as I address our events in the Eighth Congressional  District of Texas, I often conclude with my most memorable quote from  President Bush. It is a quote that is emblazoned in the library in  College Station in letters 10 feet tall, where that Brazos Valley sun  can catch it every day and afternoon on the library. The quote is this:  ``Let future generations understand the burden and the blessings of  freedom. Let them say we stood where duty required us to stand.''   That quote embodies President George H.W. Bush, and it is a call to  us as well to stand where duty requires us to stand today in all things  and in the future.   Mr. Speaker, the next Member to speak will be the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Williams), a dear friend of President Bush for more than  three decades, a partner and a colleague, and a huge admirer.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time                            ____________________
