 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my  amendment, which would protect millions of good-paying manufacturing  jobs across the country, including in my home State of Connecticut. My  amendment would restore $15 million to the Advanced Manufacturing  Office in fiscal year 2019.   The Department of Energy's Advanced Manufacturing Office is the only  technology development office in the Federal Government that is  dedicated to enhancing American manufacturing competitiveness.   Unfortunately, the appropriations bill before us here today cuts  funding to the Advanced Manufacturing Office by $45 million from the  FY18 enacted levels. That is a mistake.   One of the vital programs funded through the Advanced Manufacturing  Office is the Industrial Assessment Centers program. Industrial  Assessment Centers are located across the United States and provide  companies with the tools they need to promote energy efficiency.   A couple of years ago, I visited Forum Plastics, a plastic molding  company in Waterbury, Connecticut. Forum Plastics had recently  partnered with our regional Industrial Assessment Center at the  University of Massachusetts to carry out an audit of Forum Plastics'  energy costs and energy efficiency.   That audit showed the small company ways they could save energy,  reduce waste, and see cost savings. In fact, the audit helped Forum  Plastics develop more energy-efficient processes, which resulted in a  cost savings of nearly $25,000 the very next year.   For small and medium-size companies like Forum Plastics, savings like  this are real. They free up budgets to hire more employees, carry out  systems and equipment upgrades, and expand their facilities.   We know that much of America's innovation comes from exactly these  sort of small and medium-size companies that the Advanced Manufacturing  Office is designed to help. These companies are not able to afford  high-priced consultants or systems analysts but benefit greatly from  the analyses that the Industrial Assessment Centers offer.   This helps create jobs in our communities, helps support American  competitiveness, and ensures that taxpayer dollars support smaller  manufacturers that are the backbone of so many of our communities.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate Chairman  Simpson's and Ranking Member Kaptur's support for the Advanced  Manufacturing Office, and I look forward to working with both of them  in the future to increase funding for these important programs for  fiscal year 2019.   Therefore, I will withdraw my amendment to restore $15 million to the  Advanced Manufacturing Office in fiscal year 2019.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I withdraw my amendment.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment  to increase funding to the Office of Fossil Energy's program to support  solid oxide fuel cell research technology for power generation, and I  want to thank my colleague from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) for working on  this amendment with me.   Countries around the world--China, Korea, Germany, and Japan--are  already prioritizing the development of their fuel cell industries. In  order for the United States to remain competitive in this global  economy, we must support the research and development of new and  innovative energy technologies, including fuel cells.   Robust Federal funding of technologies that are not yet commercially  viable, like solid oxide fuel cells, allow the United States to remain  in the forefront of cleaner energy technologies and will help grow jobs  across the country to meet the entire world's demand for cleaner,  cheaper energy.   In my home State of Connecticut, FuelCell Energy, a Danbury- and  Torrington-based company, has become one of the world's leaders in  delivering clean, efficient, and affordable fuel cell solutions.  Researchers at FuelCell are developing new applications for solid oxide  fuel cell technology and are making great advances in the field of  stationary fuel cells.   The Department of Energy program that our amendment increases funding  for supports jobs in Connecticut at FuelCell Energy, FuelCell Energy's  Connecticut vendors, the University of Connecticut, which receives SECA  funding through the FuelCell subcontractors, and at innovative  companies and institutions across this country.   Mr. Chair, this amendment is a win-win for our economy. New  innovation in fuel cell technology promotes cleaner, more sustainable  energy and creates American jobs. I urge my colleagues to support  funding for the Office of Fossil Energy's program to support solid  oxide fuel cell research technology.   I thank the Members for their support, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my  amendment, which would allocate an additional $500,000 to the Office of  Employee Assistance under the Office of the Chief Administrative  Officer of the House of Representatives.   The Office of Employee Assistance provides valuable services for  Members of Congress and their staff. Unfortunately, this office is  grossly understaffed. Currently, there are 6 staff in the Office of  Employee Assistance to serve the 435 Members of Congress and their  staff, a total of over 9,000 House employees.   How could a staff of 6 possibly meet the needs of over 9,000  employees? No company, no State or Federal agency would have an  employee assistance staff of 6 to serve 9,000 employees. Neither should  the House of Representatives.   Managing a team of people and creating a positive workforce culture  is a unique skill and challenging work. Managing people requires many  skills, such as leadership, good communication, interpersonal skills,  humility, and a good sense of humor.                                time  2245    Members of Congress and office supervisors such as chiefs of staff  and legislative directors need additional resources to help them  develop the skills to successfully lead their teams, establish a strong  office culture, and make this House of Representatives a better place  to work.   Members of Congress have diverse backgrounds, levels of education,  and work experience, as well as varying levels of comfort managing  employees. We are elected to be great leaders, but in order to be  effective and to be role models, we must also be great bosses.   New and tenured Members of Congress would greatly benefit from more  knowledge and support when it comes to successfully organizing their  teams, hiring new employees, disciplining and evaluating staff, and  handling employment complaints, including sexual harassment. The Office  of Employee Assistance can and should be empowered to provide this  support to every Member of Congress and all their staff.   Chiefs of staff and legislative directors need the resources  necessary to help them develop their supervisory skills and to succeed  as managers. Chiefs of Staff and legislative directors are key to  creating and maintaining a positive workplace culture and a  professional office setting. The quality of their training shapes the  culture of our offices.   I don't claim to be an expert in this area. In fact, before I became  a Member of Congress, I had very little experience as an employer, much  less as a manager of 20 employees in two separate offices in two  different parts of the country. Like all new Members, I was focused on  doing what I was elected to do: helping the people of my district and  working on issues important to them. I know now that I would have  benefited as a new Member from more training and awareness of resources  to assist me and my senior staff with running an effective and  supportive office.   At a time when this Congress rightly is being called upon to  seriously address longstanding issues of sexual harassment in our  workplace, we have an obligation to provide better resources to our  colleagues and to our staff. Making more funds available to the Office  of Employee Assistance is an important step for us to take in that  effort. Our dedicated staff deserves better.    I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Again, they do heroic work, and they do  important work. There aren't enough of them. I am hopeful for the  support.   I thank the gentleman for his support. I think this is a very  important amendment for us to adopt to demonstrate our commitment to do  better for all of our staff and to be leaders, not followers, in this  effort for a supportive and inclusive workplace.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
