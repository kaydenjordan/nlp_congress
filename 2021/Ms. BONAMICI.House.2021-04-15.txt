 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Paycheck  Fairness Act.   The Equal Pay Act has been the law for more than half a century, but,  in 2021, equal pay for equal work is still not a reality for many  women, especially women of color. This is an injustice to millions of  working families. Closing the wage gap is an economic imperative.   Last month, I was honored to chair the hearing on persistent gender- based wage discrimination. We heard witnesses describe the barriers to  detecting wage discrimination and holding employers accountable. Most  importantly, we heard how the Paycheck Fairness Act can address the  problematic loopholes in the current law, empower workers to better  detect and combat wage discrimination, and create mechanisms for better  pay data transparency.   By advancing the Paycheck Fairness Act, we can restore the original  intent of the Equal Pay Act and finally make equal pay for equal work a  reality. I thank Congresswoman DeLauro for her steadfast leadership. I  urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter in support of the  Paycheck Fairness Act from the American Association of University  Women.                                                           AAUW,                                                     April 14, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than 170,000       members and supporters of the American Association of       University Women (AAUW), I urge you to vote in support of the       Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) and to oppose harmful       amendments when the bill comes to the House floor this week.       Despite federal and state equal pay laws, gender pay gaps       persist. The Paycheck Fairness Act offers a much needed       update to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by providing new tools to       battle these pervasive pay gaps and to challenge       discrimination.        The dual crises of a global pandemic and systemic racism       have laid bare the economic disparities in our country. While       we all struggle to survive, we are relying heavily on the       work performed by essential workers who are       disproportionately Black and brown women. Yet their work has       long been and continues to be undervalued and underpaid. At       the same time, in 2020, American women lost more than 5       million jobs. Women accounted for 100% of the jobs lost last       December--all 140,000 of them--and women of color made up an       overwhelming share of those jobs. This massive job loss       coupled with the consistent undervaluing of women's work       compounds over time and results in significant lost earnings.       As a result, women do not have a financial cushion to help       weather the current economic crisis or the ability to build       wealth, all of which contribute to racial and gender wealth       gaps that create barriers to families' economic prosperity.       We cannot build back our economy without immediately       addressing these realities. And women and their families       cannot afford to wait any longer for change.        To appropriately respond to the crises we are currently       experiencing we must make real, concrete progress in ensuring       all women receive fair pay. While the gap has narrowed since       passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, progress has largely       stalled in recent years. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau       once again revealed that women working full-time, year-round       are typically paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to       men. The pay gaps are even wider for women of color. Black       women and Latinas make, respectively, 63 and 55 cents on the       dollar as compared to non-Hispanic, white men. Action is       required now: at the current rate, the overall pay gap       between men's and women's earnings will not close until 2093       and it will take significantly longer for women of color to       reach parity.        Research indicates that the gender pay gap develops very       early in women's careers. Controlling for factors known to       affect earnings, such as education and training, marital       status, and hours worked, research finds that college-      educated women still earn 7 percent less than men just one       year out of college. Over time, the gap compounds and widens,       impacting women's social security and retirement. Ensuring       that women have equal pay would have a dramatic impact on       families and the economy. According to a report from the       Institute for Women's Policy Research (IWPR), the poverty       rate for all working women would be cut in half, falling from       8.0 percent to 3.8 percent if women were paid the same as       comparable men. The same study indicates that the U.S.       economy would have produced an additional $512.6 billion in       income if women had received equal pay for equal work. This       is why I urge you to pass this important bill.        The Paycheck Fairness Act would update and strengthen the       Equal Pay Act of 1963 to ensure that it provides effective       protection against sex-based pay discrimination in today's       workplace.        The bill takes several important steps, including:        Guaranteeing Non-Retaliation: The bill prohibits       retaliation against workers for discussing or disclosing       wages. Without the non-retaliation provisions of the Paycheck       Fairness Act, many women will continue to be silenced in the       workplace--that is, prohibited from talking about wages with       coworkers without the fear of being fired. This is an issue       that keeps women--like it kept Lilly Ledbetter--from learning       of the pay discrimination against them.        Prohibiting Reliance on Prior Salary History: The bill       prohibits employers from relying on salary history in       determining future pay, so that prior discrimination doesn't       follow workers from job to job.  [[Page H1811]]         Requiring Job-Relatedness: The bill closes loopholes that       allow employers to pay women less than men for the same work       without a business necessity that is related to the job.        Equalizing Remedies: The bill ensures women can receive the       same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that       are currently available to those subjected to discrimination       based on race and ethnicity.        Providing Additional Assistance and Resources: The bill       also provides technical assistance to businesses, requires       wage data collection, and supports salary negotiation skills       training programs to give women the tools to advocate for       higher wages.        The pay gap is persistent and can only be addressed if       women are armed with the tools necessary to challenge       discrimination against them, and employers are provided with       effective incentives and technical assistance to comply with       the law. I urge you to take a critical step towards pay       equity by voting in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act       (H.R. 7) and opposing harmful amendments when the bill comes       to the House floor this week.        Cosponsorship and votes associated with this bill may be       scored in the AAUW Action Fund Congressional Voting Record       for the 117th Congress.            Sincerely,                                                   Kate Nielson,                                   Senior Director of Public Policy,                                         Legal Advocacy & Research.
