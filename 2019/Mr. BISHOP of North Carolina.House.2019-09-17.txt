 Madam Speaker, I am grateful for  Representative Price, Representative Foxx, members of the North  Carolina delegation, and for all Members.   I want to say, just briefly, there is a cute, short blonde in that  gallery up there. Her name is Jo Bishop, and I love her more than  anything in the world. Right next to her is our only son, Jack, who  needs to get back to North Carolina State University and do well in  that test tomorrow.   I thank my family members--my sisters, Mary Ann and Cecelia--and the  large group of our supporters for their support. I am grateful for the  voters of the Ninth District and for all the Members.   Madam Speaker, I know that you and all the Members continue to feel  this every day when you walk on this floor, the majesty of this place,  what it represents and the history made here. It is an overwhelming  experience.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to getting to know all the Members and  working together with you to make commonsense solutions to make the  lives of Americans better.   God bless you all.
