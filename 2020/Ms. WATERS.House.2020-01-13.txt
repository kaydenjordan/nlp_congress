 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4841) to require the prudential banking regulators to  provide annual testimony to Congress on their supervision and  regulation activities, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents under       section 1(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and       Consumer Protection Act is amended by inserting after the       item relating to section 628 the following:  ``Sec. 629. Annual testimony of prudential regulators.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4841, the Prudential  Regulator Oversight Act, which is sponsored by Representative Dean  Phillips of Minnesota, one of our new members of the Financial Services  Committee. Through Representative Phillips' good work, this is a  bipartisan bill.   H.R. 4841 would require the prudential regulators, specifically, the  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,  and the National Credit Union Administration to report semiannually to  and testify annually before Congress on their supervisory and  regulatory activities.   The Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision would continue to  testify semiannually before Congress, though the new annual testimony  mandate would satisfy one of the semiannual requirements.   While the OCC, FDIC, NCUA currently do not have a mandatory testimony  requirement like the Federal Reserve, receiving periodic testimony from  all four agencies would allow for a comprehensive examination of the  state of prudential regulation, supervision, and enforcement with  respect to megabanks and other depository institutions.   These reports and testimony will enhance the committee's efforts to  oversee the regulators' work on a range of issues, including their  efforts to hold megabanks accountable and promote diversity and  inclusion.   I will highlight that Representative Phillips made a few improvements  to the bill to ensure that no confidential supervisory information is  disclosed. The changes would still ensure Congress gets important  aggregate data and general trends on supervisory concerns, like Matters  Requiring Attention and Matters Requiring Immediate Attention, that  apply to the industry or segments of the industry.   It is also worth noting that before Democrats took the House majority  in 2019 and provided vigorous oversight of these prudential regulators,  it had been more than 3 years since either the FDIC or the NCUA  testified before the Financial Services Committee.   Congress must not neglect its oversight duties, so H.R. 4841 will  help ensure that we have robust and regular oversight of our prudential  regulators.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Phillips), a valuable member of the Financial Services  Committee and the sponsor of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.   In closing, it is important that Congress conduct regular oversight  of independent regulatory agencies like the OCC, the FDIC, and NCUA to  ensure they are fulfilling the mission Congress gave them.   Mr. Phillips' bipartisan bill, the Prudential Regulator Oversight  Act, will ensure Congress gets periodic updates on a range of issues,  including prudential regulator efforts to hold megabanks accountable  and promote diversity and inclusion.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support H.R. 4841, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5315) to amend the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,  and Enforcement Act of 1989 to establish a Financial Agent Mentor- Protege Program within the Department of the Treasury, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5315         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Expanding Opportunity for       Minority Depository Institutions Act'' or the ``Expanding       Opportunity for MDIs Act''.       SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF FINANCIAL AGENT MENTOR-PROTEGE                     PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--Section 308 of the Financial Institutions       Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 1463       note) is amended by adding at the end the following new       subsection:        ``(d) Financial Agent Mentor-Protege Program.--        ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall       establish a program to be known as the `Financial Agent       Mentor-Protege Program' (in this subsection referred to as       the `Program') under which a financial agent designated by       the Secretary or a large financial institution may serve as a       mentor, under guidance or regulations prescribed by the       Secretary, to a small financial institution to allow such       small financial institution--        ``(A) to be prepared to perform as a financial agent; or        ``(B) to improve capacity to provide services to the       customers of the small financial institution.        ``(2) Outreach.--The Secretary shall hold outreach events       to promote the participation of financial agents, large       financial institutions, and small financial institutions in       the Program at least once a year.        ``(3) Exclusion.--The Secretary shall issue guidance or       regulations to establish a process under which a financial       agent, large financial institution, or small financial       institution may be excluded from participation in the       Program.        ``(4) Report.--The Office of Minority and Women Inclusion       of the Department of the Treasury shall include in the report       submitted to Congress under section 342(e) of the Dodd-Frank       Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act information       pertaining to the Program, including--        ``(A) the number of financial agents, large financial       institutions, and small financial institutions participating       in such Program; and        ``(B) the number of outreach events described in paragraph       (2) held during the year covered by such report.        ``(5) Definitions.--In this subsection:        ``(A) Financial agent.--The term `financial agent' means       any national banking association designated by the Secretary       of the Treasury to be employed as a financial agent of the       Government.        ``(B) Large financial institution.--The term `large       financial institution' means any entity regulated by the       Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the       Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance       Corporation, or the National Credit Union Administration that       has total consolidated assets greater than or equal to       $50,000,000,000.        ``(C) Small financial institution.--The term `small       financial institution' means--        ``(i) any entity regulated by the Comptroller of the       Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve       System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the       National Credit Union Administration that has total       consolidated assets lesser than or equal to $2,000,000,000;       or        ``(ii) a minority depository institution.''.        (b) Effective Date.--This Act and the amendments made by       this Act shall take effect 90 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 5315, the Expanding Opportunity for  Minority Depository Institutions Act, which is sponsored by  Representative Joyce Beatty of Ohio, who chairs our Diversity and  Inclusion Subcommittee. The bill is cosponsored by Representatives    Gregory Meeks, Al Green, Emanuel Cleaver,   David Scott, and Denny  Heck.   This bill would codify the Department of the Treasury's Mentor- Protege Program, which is designed to encourage large banks to partner  with smaller banks and minority depository institutions in enhancing  their capabilities.   These partnerships can be critical for MDIs, in particular, to have  access to the capital and investments they need to better serve their  communities. The Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial  Institutions, led by Chairman Meeks, held two hearings on the  importance of minority depository institutions in October and November  of 2019.   We learned that MDIs face several challenges, including the ability  to raise capital despite overall strong financial performance and  challenges experienced as a result of serving communities that are  often the first and the hardest hit in economic down cycles. This  decline is contributing to growing banking deserts in minority  communities.   We discussed the decline of MDIs and how alarming the numbers are.  Since the financial crisis, we have seen the numbers of MDI banks  decline from 215 to 148; and today, we only have 18 Black-owned banks  in this country. It is clear regulators have failed to fulfill their  statutory obligations to preserve and promote MDIs and that Congress  must act.   In addition to Representative Beatty's bill, Representative Meeks has  drafted a complementary bill, that is, H.R. 5322, the Ensuring  Diversity in Community Banking Act, that will take additional steps to  help MDIs. We hope this bill will move to the House floor very soon.   We must do what we can to ensure all current MDIs and, hopefully,  future MDIs have access to the investments and partnerships they need  to thrive while serving the communities that need them the most.  Encouraging more partnerships, as H.R. 5315 would provide for, is one  important step we can take to ensure MDIs have the support and,  eventually, the capital they need  [[Page H193]]  to continue their good work of serving their communities.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Diversity and Inclusion and the sponsor of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, we have a crisis with MDIs, and Congress must take  action. H.R. 5315 codifies the Department of the Treasury's mentor- protege program which is designed to encourage large firms to assist  these small financial institutions, including MDIs, in enhancing their  capability. The program has fostered the establishment of long-term  business relationships between large banks and MDIs that can  [[Page H194]]  be critical for MDIs to have access to the kind of capital they need to  better serve their communities.   Madam Speaker, the Financial Services Committee approved the bill by  a vote of 57-0, and the full House should also unanimously support this  important legislation.   I urge Members to support H.R. 5315, I urge my colleagues to join me  in supporting this important piece of legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2398) to amend the United States Housing Act of 1937 and  title 38, United States Code, to expand eligibility for the HUD-VASH  program, to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit annual  reports to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House  of Representatives regarding homeless veterans, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2398         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran Housing       Opportunities and Unemployment Support Extension Act of       2020'' or the ``Veteran HOUSE Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR HUD-VASH.         (a) HUD Provisions.--Section 8(o)(19) of the United States       Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(19)) is amended by       adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(D) Veteran defined.--In this paragraph, the term       `veteran' has the meaning given that term in section 2002(b)       of title 38, United States Code.''.        (b) VHA Case Managers.--Subsection (b) of section 2003 of       title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end       the following: ``In the case of vouchers provided under the       HUD-VASH program under section 8(o)(19) of such Act, for       purposes of the preceding sentence, the term `veteran' shall       have the meaning given such term in section 2002(b) of this       title.''.       SEC. 3. ANNUAL REPORTS.         (a) In General.--Not less frequently than once each year,       the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit to the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives a report on the homelessness services       provided under programs of the Department of Veterans       Affairs, including services under HUD-VASH program under       section 8(o)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42       U.S.C. 1437f(o)(19)).        (b) Included Information.--Each such annual report shall       include, with respect to the year preceding the submittal of       the report, a statement of the number of eligible individuals       who were furnished such homelessness services and the number       of individuals furnished such services under each such       program, disaggregated by the number of men who received such       services and the number of women who received such services,       and such other information as the Secretary considers       appropriate     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2398, the Veteran  Housing Opportunities and Unemployment Support Extension Act. Put  simply, this bill will help more veterans get out of homelessness  without increasing current funding levels.   It is a national embarrassment that we still have an estimated 37,000  veterans who experienced homelessness on any given night in 2019. To  our credit we have a very successful program that is focused on ending  homelessness among veterans. It is called the HUD-VASH program.   The HUD-VASH program is largely credited for the nearly 50 percent  decrease in the homeless veteran population over the past decade.  Unfortunately, many of these vouchers go unutilized year after year due  in part to the fact that veterans are not eligible for the HUD-VASH  program if they received an other than honorable discharge from the  military.   Let's be clear, an other than honorable discharge should not be  confused with a dishonorable discharge. A servicemember can receive an  other than honorable discharge for fairly minor infractions such as  lapses in military good order and discipline.   Moreover, veterans who are repeatedly deployed tend to suffer more  frequently from serious mental health issues. We know that mental  health issues are correlated with higher rates of other than honorable  discharges as well as an increased likelihood of experiencing  homelessness upon leaving the military. H.R. 2398 would correct this  injustice by ensuring that veterans who received an other than  honorable discharge are not excluded from the HUD-VASH program.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues, Mr. Heck and Mr.  Peters, for introducing this critical legislation.   I strongly support this legislation, I urge my colleagues to do the  same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Peters), who is the sponsor of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I again thank Representatives Peters and Heck for  bringing forth this important legislation.   We were reminded only last week of the commitment of those who served  in the United States armed services. We must continue to do all we can  to ensure that those who have served receive the support they need. The  reforms in H.R. 2398 will do exactly that.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4458) to require the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System to issue reports on cybersecurity with respect to the  functions of the Federal Reserve System, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4458         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cybersecurity and Financial       System Resilience Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. CYBERSECURITY AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM RESILIENCE REPORT.         (a) In General.--Not later than the end of the 180-day       period beginning on the date of  [[Page H196]]       enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, each banking       regulator shall submit a report to the Committee on Financial       Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate that       provides a detailed explanation of measures undertaken to       strengthen cybersecurity with respect to the functions of the       regulator, including the supervision and regulation of       financial institutions and, where applicable, third-party       service providers.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4458, the Cybersecurity and  Financial System Resilience Act, which is sponsored by the ranking  member of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. McHenry.   H.R. 4458 would require the prudential regulators, specifically the  Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC, NCUA, to each issue an annual report to  Congress describing measures the respective agency has taken to  strengthen cybersecurity. The report must include steps each agency is  taking to address any cybersecurity concerns identified by the annual  independent evaluations conducted under the Federal Information  Security Modernization Act of 2014. The bill sunsets after 7 years.   A wide range of regulators, including the Financial Stability  Oversight Council, as well as experts and industrial stakeholders, have  recognized cybersecurity is a key risk to our financial system and  broader economy.   As technology continues to rapidly change how financial products and  services are delivered, it is important that regulators are ensuring  financial institutions, including their third-party service providers,  such as cloud service providers, have in place robust cyber policies  and practices to help protect against cybersecurity incidents that  could compromise sensitive consumer data.   In addition, it is equally important that regulators themselves have  their houses in order and that they are protecting their own  information systems from cyberattacks. Indeed, many of our regulatory  agencies already conduct ongoing cyber exercises to assess their  cybersecurity systems. But as the threat of cyberattacks increase,  there is an opportunity for Congress, as well as the public, to better  understand how their personal data is being protected.   Furthermore, these agencies also must have well-qualified  cybersecurity experts on the job to help thwart potential cyberattacks  that may be directed at these Federal agencies or the institutions they  oversee.   I appreciate that the ranking member worked with our side of the  aisle to make important improvements to the bill before the committee  marked it up. These changes include expanding the bill from the Federal  Reserve to apply it to all Federal depository institution regulators,  including the FDIC, OCC, and NCUA.   The bill was also clarified so that the annual reporting includes how  regulators supervise banks and credit unions, as well as their third- party service providers, to mitigate cybersecurity risks.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this important legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, cybersecurity is a major issue facing all aspects of our  economy, including the financial sector. It is an important issue for  both private companies and government agencies.   H.R. 4458 will enhance congressional oversight of our banking  regulators to ensure that they are maintaining strong cyber defenses of  their own systems, as well as the banks and credit unions they  regulate. I urge Members to support this important legislation.   I thank the ranking member for his leadership and for the way that he  reached across the aisle in working with us.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 457) to require that $1 coins issued during 2019 honor  President George H.W. Bush and to direct the Secretary of the Treasury  to issue bullion coins during 2019 in honor of Barbara Bush.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 457         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``President George H.W. Bush       and First Spouse Barbara Bush Coin Act''.       SEC. 2. COINS HONORING PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH AND FIRST                     SPOUSE BARBARA BUSH.         (a) Circulating $1 Coins Honoring President George H.W.       Bush.--Notwithstanding subsections (d), (n)(2)(E), (n)(3),       (n)(4), and (n)(8) of section 5112 of title 31, United States       Code, in addition to the coins to be issued under subsections       (r) and (w) of such section 5112, and in accordance with the       other provisions of subsection (n) of such section 5112, the       Secretary of the Treasury, beginning on January 1, 2020,       shall mint and issue $1 coins that bear--        (1) the image of President George H.W. Bush; and        (2) an inscription of the year ``2020''.        (b) Bullion Coins Honoring First Spouse Barbara Bush.--      Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (5)(C) of section 5112(o)       of title 31, United States Code, and in accordance with the       other provisions of such section 5112(o), the Secretary of       the Treasury, beginning on January 1, 2020, shall mint and       issue bullion coins that bear--        (1) the image of First Spouse Barbara Bush; and        (2) an inscription of the year ``2020''.       SEC. 3. FINANCIAL ASSURANCES.         The Secretary of the Treasury shall take such actions as       may be necessary to ensure that the minting and issuing of       coins under this Act will not result in any net cost to the       United States Government.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 457, the President  George H.W. Bush and First Spouse Barbara Bush Coin Act. This bill  directs the Treasury to issue $1 coins honoring the life and legacy of  President George Herbert Walker Bush as well as a bullion coin  commemorating his wife, former First Lady Barbara Bush.   The dollar coin was one of the first silver coins minted in the  United States. Since the first dollar coins were struck in 1794, the  dollar coin has, on occasion, been minted with the images of various  individuals whose leadership, actions, and deeds have played an  integral role at key moments in our Nation's history. These include  President Dwight D. Eisenhower, suffragist Susan B. Anthony, and, most  recently, Lemhi Shoshone guide and interpreter for the Lewis and Clark  expedition, Sacagawea.   Beginning in 2007, the Mint sought to honor our Nation's Presidents  by issuing $1 coins, featuring their images in the order that they  served. The last President to be honored under this program was  President Ronald Reagan in 2016.   This bill reauthorizes the Treasury to mint a $1 coin in honor of the  late  [[Page H199]]  President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara Bush, under the  Presidential $1 Coin Program.   George Herbert Walker Bush served as the 41st President of the United  States from 1989 to 1993. A career public servant, President Bush  served our country as a U.S. Navy pilot during World War II before  going on to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, as a U.S.  Ambassador to the United Nations, as Director of Central Intelligence,  and as the 43rd Vice President of the United States. As President, Bush  presided over the collapse of the Soviet Union, German reunification,  and the first Gulf war.   In his post-Presidency, Bush is remembered for using his spotlight to  support various charities and for working closely with former  Presidents Carter and Clinton to encourage public service and encourage  aid for victims of natural disasters both at home and abroad.   Barbara Pierce Bush also served as First Lady from 1989 to 1993. A  fierce advocate for literacy, Mrs. Bush was dedicated to eliminating  generational cycles of illiteracy through her involvement in the  Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy and other reading  organizations. As First Lady, she was known as much for her humor and  self-deprecating wit as she was for being a keen adviser and confidant  to President George H.W. Bush.   In addition to their decades-long careers as public servants,  President and Mrs. Bush were the patriarch and matriarch of a family of  public servants, including the 43rd President of the United States,  George W. Bush, and the former Governor of Florida, John Ellis Bush.  Their dedication to patriotism, service, and each other are an  inspiration to us all.   So I thank our Senate colleague Mr. Cornyn for introducing this bill,  as well as Mr. Williams and all members of the Texas delegation,  including our own Representative Sylvia Garcia, a valued new member of  the Financial Services Committee, for their hard work on the bill, and  I urge Members to vote ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia), a valued new member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This bill honors a couple who devoted their lives to public service  and were known for their deep faith and commitment to decency and  civility.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have worked in a bipartisan manner on  this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
