 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an exceptional  member of the Air Force on his retirement from government service: Mr.  Herman Bell. Herman will retire this week as the chief of public  affairs of Tyndall Air Force Base, capping a career of more than 46  years of government service.   Herman enlisted in the Air Force in 1972 and retired as a master  sergeant in 1993. He has served in the 325th Fighter Wing Public  Affairs Office since that time. His keen leadership over the last 25  years at Tyndall and the many years  [[Page H6592]]  before that on Active Duty is a testament to the core values instilled  in all those who serve in our Air Force.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in saying thank you to Herman Bell and to  his family for their years of service and sacrifice, and wish them luck  as they move on to a new chapter in life.                            ____________________
