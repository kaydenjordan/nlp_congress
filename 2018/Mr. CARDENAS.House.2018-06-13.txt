 Mr. Speaker, right now we have a human rights emergency  at our borders. ICE agents are ripping children from their mothers'  arms. These are babies as young as 11 months. They are holding these  children in facilities that are so full that now Trump wants to build  tent cities to house more children.   There are reports of ICE agents telling parents that they are taking  their child to give them a bath, and then the parents don't see their  baby again.   Think about that: No notice. No due process. Just silent, cruel  separation.   This is happening on our American soil. This is the policy of the  Trump administration. ICE has an $8 billion budget, and this is what  our taxpayer dollars are buying: holding babies, cold and alone, in  what are internment camps for little children.   My fellow colleagues, we are not a country that follows a selfish,  coldhearted dictator. We are the United States of America.
