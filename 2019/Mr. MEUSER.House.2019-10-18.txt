 Madam Speaker, let's review some facts surrounding this  unfair, partisan impeachment process.   To begin with, a whistleblower claims to have secondhand information  on the President's call with the Ukrainian President. The White House  released the transcript of the call, making the whistleblower  irrelevant.   The Ukrainian President, the most important witness, emphasized  publicly that there was no quid pro quo and no pressure. Prior to  having any of this information, or maybe they did, the Speaker  announces an impeachment inquiry, and over 200 Democratic Members of  the House agree, evidence be damned.   Since then, we have discovered that the chairman's staff met with the  whistleblower earlier than originally stated, yet stated that they  didn't.   All hearings were held in secrecy, and there has been no due process.   Madam Speaker, a petty thief is provided more legal rights than the  President of the United States. There is no transparency of testimony  to Members of Congress or to the general public, and there has been no  vote for an impeachment inquiry.   It appears these impeachment proceedings are not about whether the  President did right or wrong or broke any laws. It is only about  scoring political points while undermining the will of the electorate.                            ____________________
