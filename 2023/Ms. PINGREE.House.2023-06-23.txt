 Mr. Speaker, satellite images have identified a pile of  discarded clothing in Chili, sent there from Europe, Asia, and America.  It is so large it can be seen from space.   This mountain of textile waste illustrates the environmental toll of  what is called fast fashion. Unfortunately, fast fashion has become  very popular with consumers, but it comes at a high cost to our planet.   Fast fashion relies on cheap manufacturing, frequent consumption, and  short-lived garment use. This constant cycle of production and disposal  is exemplified by these mountains of discarded shirts and skirts.   Textile waste has increased dramatically over the last two decades  and, in the process, has become a massive environmental challenge. In  2018, 17 million tons of textiles were generated in the U.S. and 11.3  million tons were thrown into landfills.   As the rate that clothing is produced and discarded increases, only  15 percent of the clothing in the U.S. is recycled or reused, with the  rest either incinerated or sent to landfills for disposal.   I am formally calling on the GAO to assess what actions the EPA has  taken and can take to combat fast fashion waste.   In Maine, we have a deeply ingrained sense that you can always get a  little more use out of something. I agree. The Federal Government can  and must do more to stop waste and pollution. Fast fashion should be  sustainable fashion.                            ____________________
