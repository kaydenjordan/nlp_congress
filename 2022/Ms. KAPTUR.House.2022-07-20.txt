 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Larson for his tireless  leadership and work to safeguard Social Security for the benefit of  this generation of retirees and those that are to come. He has worked  hard for decades to try to bring this bill to the floor.   I thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Richard Neal, and Congressman John  Larson, chair of the subcommittee, for  [[Page H6904]]  giving us the opportunity to bring to the American people what they  want, and that is a strengthened retirement system under Social  Security.   For nearly a century, America has made a sacred promise: Those who  work and labor throughout their lives will benefit by a retirement from  the fruits of their labor. It is an earned benefit for pension. It is  an insurance program that they pay into, as the gentleman has said.   It is also a survivorship benefit for workers who die who have young  children. It is a disability program for those who are harmed on the  job.                                time  1445    Social Security is an earned benefit. Yeah, it is a promise, but  people earn it. It assures a safe and secure retirement for tens of  millions upon millions of Americans during their golden years, to those  who become disabled, and, of course, their family, their children, in  fact, if something unfortunate happens.   But without the action of Chairman Larson, the Social Security  promise is deeply at risk. Democrats want to strengthen Social  Security. Republicans want to end it and cripple it.   With this legislation, soon to be moving through the House Ways and  Means Committee, one of the most important bills that will ever come  before this Chamber, Democrats will push for a vote on the floor as  soon as possible.   I hear from thousands of northern Ohioans and people across our great  State who want to see a responsible solution to protect and improve  Social Security.   The wealthy must join with the vast majority of Americans in paying  their fair share of social insurance at a percentage that equals what  other people pay to secure Social Security into the future.   By making that happen, the Social Security 2100 Act will increase  benefits for current and new beneficiaries. It will protect retirees  against inflation, which the gentleman has mentioned. It will continue  to serve the disabled and the young children of workers who die at a  far too young age, and it will repeal the windfall elimination  provision that we have been trying to fix for how many decades? I think  at least four.   The Social Security 2100 Act is one of the most important bills  Congress will ever vote on. What a privilege it will be to be able to  cast a ``yes'' vote.   America made a promise to workers and to retirees and families, and  Democrats are committed to making good on that promise. This is a  Democratic program, and we are going to save it as Democrats and  improve it.   Thank you, Chairman Larson.
