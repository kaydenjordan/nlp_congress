 Mr. President, this morning, our Nation's Capital and  much of the Northeast, including almost the whole of my State of New  York, woke up once again under a veil of smog. As we speak, wildfires  of unnatural strength continue blazing in Canada, sending toxic air and  smoke over the border and over American cities. Today, I am sad to say,  New York City, which usually has good air quality, has some of the  lowest air quality in the world thanks to these wildfires, and the  problem is even worse in Upstate New York.   I urge every single American and Canadian impacted by the smog to  take precautions to stay safe and to follow public safety guidelines in  their communities.   These Canadian wildfires are truly unprecedented, and we cannot  ignore that climate change continues to make these disasters worse.  Warmer temperatures and severe droughts mean forests burn faster, burn  hotter, and burn bigger. And the warming is happening at a faster pace  in countries with higher latitudes. None of this--none of this--is a  coincidence.   This smoke and fog over New York and the rest of the Northeast is a  warning from nature that we have a lot of work to do to reverse the  destruction of climate change. Every time we see a wildfire in Canada  or in the West or a monstrous hurricane in the Southeast or a blizzard  in Texas, it is a reminder that time is short to reverse the impacts of  a warming planet.   Democrats are proud of the progress we have made to accelerate  America's transition to clean energy through the Inflation Reduction  Act, but both parties--both parties--have an obligation to do more. The  work to protect our climate is far from over, and we are dangerously  behind.   Again, I am proud of the historic work Democrats did last year to  move us in the right direction, but I implore my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to look up at the smog today and recognize we must-- we must--do more.   At the top of the list is a good transmission bill, which will  greatly enhance our Nation's ability to bring clean energy, like wind  and solar, to large population centers and reduce the carbon that is  thrown into the atmosphere.  [[Page S1988]]         I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motion with  respect to the Ho nomination be withdrawn and the cloture vote on the  Syed nomination occur at 2:30 p.m. today; further, that the Senate  recess following the confirmation vote on the Crane nomination until  2:15 to allow for the weekly caucus meetings.    I yield the floor.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 76, 128, and  216; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without  intervening action or debate; that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  nominations en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions: S. Res. 239, S. Res. 240, and S. Res. 241.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    I know of no further debate on the resolutions en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that the preambles be agreed to  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table, all en bloc.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate  completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m. on  Thursday, June 8; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of  proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that following the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Silfen nomination; further, that at 11:30 a.m.,  notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate vote on confirmation of the Syed  nomination, followed by the cloture vote on the Silfen nomination, and  that if cloture is invoked on the Silfen nomination, all postcloture  time be considered expired at 1:45 p.m.; finally, that if nominations  are confirmed during Thursday's session, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:08 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, June 8, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
