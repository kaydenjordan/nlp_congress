 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues from both sides of the  aisle for supporting this legislation.   More than 120 years ago, the Utah Enabling Act, which enabled my  State--now the greatest State in the country--to be admitted into the  Union, was approved. This granted Utah the right to select acreage to  support various public institutions, including public schools and  universities. Now, 123 years later, much of the acreage made available  for State selection remains outstanding.   The BLM's Pony Express Resource Management Plan governs management  practices for public lands in Utah's Tooele, Utah, and Salt Lake  Counties. It has identified thousands of acres within the plan's area  as available for disposal. The State can presently obtain these lands  via land exchange. However, the resource management plan does not  explicitly state that these lands can be obtained using the unfulfilled  land credits granted by the Utah Enabling Act.                                time  1730    My bill, the Confirming State Land Grants for Education Act, would  simply amend the Pony Express RMP to allow the State of Utah to use  outstanding land grant credits to obtain lands within the limited area  of RMP that already has been identified available for disposal.   This solution would satisfy both the State and Federal Government and  help to keep the promises made to the State of Utah for more than 120  years. More importantly, it would ultimately raise funds for the  benefit of Utah students by allowing Utah's School and Institutional  Trust Lands Administration, SITLA, to manage these lands for the  benefit of students. As Utah finds more ways to fund public schools and  public education, this bill helps provide much-needed resources.   Notably, the passage of H.R. 2582 would not convey any land on its  own. Existing conveyance processes would still apply.   Additionally, my bill does not dictate land use policies once the  land is conveyed. As a former mayor, I respect the State and local  officials and processes, and I certainly have no desire to supersede  them. My bill is merely meant to facilitate the process that enables  conveyance through the use of available selection credits. It was voted  out of committee by unanimous consent, and I urge this body to show  similar support today.
