 Madam President, today, I am introducing legislation that  is the product of at least 18 years of collaborative work by a diverse  group of stakeholders in Virginia, including local recreation groups,  conservationists, timber industry representatives, and sportsmen.   The Shenandoah Mountain Act would designate more than 92,000 acres of  the George Washington National Forest lands in Virginia as the  Shenandoah Mountain National Scenic Area, SMNSA.   Congress designates national scenic areas to protect the natural and  scenic value of lands that are also compatible with recreational uses  such as hiking, fishing, hunting, camping, mountain biking, among  others.   The SMNSA encompasses four wilderness areas: Skidmore Fork, Little  River, Ramsey's Draft, and Lynn Hollow, which in total include 10 peaks  above 4,000 feet and 150 miles of trails to attract campers, hikers,  mountain bikers, fishermen, birders, and equestrians. The legislation  also establishes a 5,779-acre wilderness area at Beech Lick Knob,  located 10 miles to the north.   The SMNSA will protect important water resources, as it covers  headwaters for the Potomac and James Rivers and watersheds that provide  drinking water for Harrisonburg, Staunton, and communities farther  downstream, such as Washington, DC, and Richmond. This area is also a  hotspot for biodiversity. Cold mountain streams in the area are a  stronghold for native brook trout. Today's legislation would  permanently protect these rivers and streams from industrial  development. It would also help safeguard plant and wildlife habitat  for black bears, wild turkeys, more than 250 species of birds, and at- risk species like the Cow Knob and Shenandoah Mountain salamanders.   The Shenandoah Mountain National Scenic Area will provide a boost to  the region's growing tourism industry. In 2021, the tourism economy  directly employed 6,543 people and generated $728.5 million in Augusta,  Rockingham, Bath, and Highland Counties, as well as Harrisonburg,  Staunton, and Waynesboro. In addition to the direct benefits to  tourism, James Madison University scientists estimate that lands within  the SMNSA proposal already generate $13.7 million per year in other  local benefits, including the value of the water supply. Designation of  the SMNSA would further grow these benefits.   The challenges of the past 3 years have underscored that getting out  into nature is critical to our health and well-being. I am proud that  the Shenandoah Mountain Act will expand these opportunities within the  George Washington National Forest for visitors near and far, while also  boosting our local economies, protecting drinking water sources, and  preserving the wildlife that makes this area so special.   The local governments of Staunton, Augusta, Rockingham, and  Harrisonburg, along with over 400 businesses and organizations, have  endorsed the new designation for the vast benefits it will have on the  surrounding communities. I thank my colleague Senator Mark Warner for  joining me in introducing this legislation. I also commend our local  stakeholders for working on this proposal for so many years.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA:   S. 2654. A bill to increase efficiency and conservation in public  water systems, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment  and Public Works.
