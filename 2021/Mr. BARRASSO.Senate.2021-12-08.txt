 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my  Republican colleagues to oppose President Biden's vaccine mandates.   Last December, President-elect Joe Biden told the American people  that he would not issue a vaccine mandate. Just a year ago, as  President-elect, Joe Biden said:         I don't think they should be mandatory.    He said:         I wouldn't demand it to be mandatory.    Last October, as a Presidential candidate, Joe Biden said:         You can't say ``Everyone has to do [it].''    Then, this summer, his Press Secretary said it is ``not a role the  federal government even has the power to make''--``not a role even the  federal government has the power to make.''   In July, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control said:         There will be no nationwide vaccine mandate.    Then, in early September, with this Nation in shock and reeling  because of the disastrous collapse in Afghanistan, suddenly and  unexpectedly and completely opposite of everything this administration  has promised, the Biden administration broke the law, and in doing so,  violated the rights of the American people by calling for this vaccine  mandate.   Joe Biden issued a nationwide mandate, and in doing so, he has taken  a sledgehammer to the American workforce and the American economy.  Because of the President's irresponsible policies, we now have the  worst labor shortage in American history, and we have broken new  records for unfilled jobs. As a result, we also have the worst supply  chain crisis in 40 years. We don't have enough goods on the shelves. We  don't have enough workers to fill the shelves.   The President must have known that many wouldn't comply with his  mandate. He must have known people would be forced out of their jobs as  a result of the mandate. He didn't seem to care. He imposed the mandate  anyway.   Now people are losing their jobs, shelves are empty, and prices  continue to rise. Inflation is the No. 1 concern of the American  people.   Now, I am a doctor. I am vaccinated, so is my entire family. I am  pro-vaccine and anti-mandate. Vaccines work. Nationwide mandates don't  work.   Courts have already ruled that the President's mandates are illegal.  Yesterday, a Federal judge in Georgia blocked the mandate on Federal  contractors. Not only are these mandates illegal, they are ineffective.   Joe Biden's mandates have only hardened people against the vaccine.  They have increased resistance to getting vaccinated because President  Biden has politicized the vaccines, and all the mandates have  accomplished is making people lose their jobs.   In the Joe Biden world, his mantra seems to be, vaccinate or  terminate.   What we ought to be doing, instead, is giving people information. Let  them work with their doctors to make the right decision for them and  their families.   That is what I have been doing for decades in Wyoming as a doctor. We  don't need mandates. We don't need public health officials who can give  Americans reliable information, saying they have to enforce and apply a  mandate. They are there to give the information and then the vaccine if  the person chooses to have it.   The Biden administration spent 10 months flip-flopping on this issue.  President Biden ran from his basement during the campaign saying he was  the answer to COVID. He is not, hasn't been. He has sent one mixed  message after another, and then he has issued a nationwide mandate. It  has been inconsistent, ineffective, and incompetent.   When President Biden issued his mandate, he said, ``We've been  patient [with the unvaccinated] but our patience is running thin.''   Well, I will tell you, Mr. President, the American people have been  patient. It is the patience of the American people now with you,  President Biden, that is wearing thin.   I yield the floor.
