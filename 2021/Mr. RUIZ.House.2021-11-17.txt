 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the Burn Pit  Registry Enhancement Act, which passed the House unanimously yesterday,  and to urge a vote in the Senate.   The Burn Pit Registry Enhancement Act would strengthen the registry  by allowing a registered veteran's data to be updated by their family  with his or her cause of death.   This data is crucial to identify the vast array of illnesses that are  causing young burn pit-exposed veterans to die and will help doctors  recognize early symptoms of life-threatening conditions and save lives.   As a Nation, we have a responsibility to provide our veterans with  the benefits they have earned and deserve. We bear that responsibility  even more heavily when the use of burn pits by our own military is  causing veterans to develop rare pulmonary conditions and cancers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to take up my legislation and uphold  our commitment to taking care of our veterans.                          Alejandro Camacho's Story     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell the story of my  constituent, Alejandro Camacho, of Palm Desert, a veteran who has been  affected by our military's use of toxic burn pits, and to call for  action.   After graduating from La Quinta High School, Alejandro served our  Nation in the U.S. Marine Corps. From March to September 2009, he was  stationed in south Sinjar, Iraq.   At great personal sacrifice to himself, Alejandro served as a member  of the 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, even missing the  birth of his own son, Jacob, while he was stationed overseas.   Every single day in south Sinjar, Alejandro breathed in toxic fumes,  particulate matter, and carcinogens from the batteries, medical waste,  and jet fuel that was burned in large burn pits on his base.   When he returned home, the effects of breathing in those toxic fumes  started taking a toll on his body. In 2019, Alejandro was diagnosed  with embryonal carcinoma, an aggressive form of testicular cancer. He  and his doctor believed his diagnosis to be linked to his exposures to  fumes from burning jet propulsion 8 fuel, a known human carcinogen.   When Alejandro underwent the excruciating chemotherapy process, his  body fell apart. He lost 50 pounds. He lost feeling in his hands and  feet, and he constantly heard ringing in his ears.   Despite being deemed 40 percent disabled, despite his repeated  exposure to jet fuel fumes, and despite the diagnosis, the VA denied  his claim for coverage. Do you know why? Because the VA said there  wasn't ``enough evidence'' to establish a connection between his burn  pit exposure and the cancer he developed.   Mr. Speaker, I am an emergency medicine physician and a public health  expert, and in public health and in medicine, it is practice that if  there is  [[Page H6324]]  a high enough suspicion based on the evidence available of a harm that  causes a severe enough illness, then we need to act on that suspicion.   We can't afford to wait decades, like we did with Agent Orange, for  that perfect study to establish a perfect causality between burn pit  exposure and cancers and pulmonary conditions our veterans are  developing and dying from right now. There is enough evidence to act.   We must act for veterans like Alejandro and help him get the  healthcare and benefits he earned when we sent him to war for our  country. Alejandro is now cancer free, but the fight continues to get  him the benefits he deserves.   We are making real bipartisan progress on this front, with  legislation like the Honoring our PACT Act, which takes an aggressive  and comprehensive approach to the urgent healthcare crisis that  veterans like Alejandro are facing.   This legislation will keep our Nation's promise to our veterans that  we will take care of them after they serve our Nation. It contains my  bill, the Presumptive Benefits for War Fighters Exposed to Burn Pits  and Other Toxins Act. It creates a presumption of service-related  illnesses due to burn pits in order to take care of our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge this body to take up this bill to support  Alejandro and the rest of our heroes in uniform.                            ____________________
