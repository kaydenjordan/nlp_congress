 Mr. Speaker, for my constituents and all  Americans, Trumpcare would result in higher costs, less coverage, a  crushing age tax for persons 50 to 64, a shorter Medicare life span,  and the ransacking of the Medicaid funds that enable seniors to get the  long term care they need. And last night, Republicans added a provision  that would prohibit our veterans who are eligible to receive VA care  from receiving any tax credits to help pay for their care outside the  VA, even if they are not enrolled in the VA.   In my congressional district, the uninsured rate dropped from 31.7 to  17.5 percent due to Obamacare.   Among my constituents who benefited are a young mother from Bell  Gardens, California, and her 15-month-old daughter, Olivia, who was  born with Down Syndrome.   Because of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion in California, Olivia was  able to have her congenital heart defect repaired shortly after birth.  She is now being followed by a cardiologist to ensure her ongoing care  for a healthy heart.   Obamacare's Medicaid expansion also makes it possible for baby Olivia  to receive early intervention and physical therapy services to enhance  and accelerate her development.   Olivia's mom is terrified that if Trumpcare passes, her daughter may  not be able to receive these services, which help her remain healthy  and make it possible for her to reach critical developmental  milestones.   Republicans like to call Obamacare a failed disaster. That is simply  one more example of their ``alternative facts.''   The Republican Trumpcare bill before us is the disaster waiting to  unfold for countless families like Olivia's, and millions of Americans  across our country.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on behalf of the American people.
