 Mr. Speaker, this bill is not just about the past, it is  about the future. Gender-based wage discrimination exists in every  State and in many industries.   In the tech industry, which has a huge presence in my district in  North Carolina's Research Triangle, women typically make thousands of  dollars less than men in the same roles. Unsurprisingly, women in tech  often leave the industry due to unfair compensation, much to that  industry's detriment.   Pay inequity also follows women into retirement. Women have, on  average, only 70 percent of the retirement income men have.   One of the best ways we can help close the wage gap is through salary  negotiation training, which is one of the key provisions of this bill.   I am thankful to groups like Ladies Get Paid and countless others  working to empower women to help them advocate for their work.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill for the sake of future  generations.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this letter from the National  Council of Jewish Women.                               National Council of Jewish Women,                                     Washington, DC, April 14, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our 180,000 members,       advocates, and supporters, National Council of Jewish Women       (NCJW) urges you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7)       without amendments that limit its scope or undermine its       critical protections.        NCJW is a grassroots organization of volunteers and       advocates who turn progressive ideals into action. Inspired       by Jewish values, NCJW strives for social justice by       improving the quality of life for women, children, and       families and by safeguarding individual rights and freedoms.       The Torah compels us tzedek, tzedek tirdof--to pursue       justice. To that end, we advocate for employment laws,       policies, and practices that provide equal pay and benefits       for work of comparable worth and equal opportunities for       advancement.        Nearly 60 years after passage of the landmark Equal Pay       Act, the gender way gap persists. Overall, women earn only 82       cents for every dollar earned by men, and the gap is much       wider for women of color (Black women earn 63 cents,       Indigenous women earn 60 cents, Latinas earn 55 cents, and       some Asian American and Pacific Islander women earn only 52       cents). Earnings lost to these gaps are exacerbating the       financial effects of COVID-19, falling particularly heavily       on women of color and the families who depend on their       income.        The Paycheck Fairness Act, which has been passed three       previous times by the House of Representatives, mostly       recently in the 116th Congress, offers a much needed update       to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by providing new tools to battle       pervasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimination.        We cannot build back an economy that works for everyone       without ensuring that all women can work with equality,       safety, and dignity, starting with pay equity. Passing the       Paycheck Fairness Act would mark a vitally important step       toward ensuring this becomes reality. I ask you to vote YES       on the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) without amendments that       limit its scope or undermine its critical protections.            Sincerely,                                                    Jody Rabhan,                                               Chief Policy Officer,                                  National Council of Jewish Women.    Madam Speaker, I attended a Press Conference on pay equity.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 105.
