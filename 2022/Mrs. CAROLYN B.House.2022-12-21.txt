 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Postal Service on its recent announcement to purchase  a new vehicle fleet, 75 percent of which will be electric vehicles. I  also rise to thank President Biden for his vision that led this country  to that decision.   Yesterday's announcement by the Postal Service would not have been  possible without the steadfast efforts of the Biden-Harris  administration, including the landmark legislation President Biden  signed into law earlier this year, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the  postal reform legislation, which I authored.   I personally thank President Biden for his important leadership on  this issue. His efforts to ensure that our Federal fleets, particularly  the Postal Service fleet, transition to electric vehicles as soon as  possible are a critical step to a cleaner environment and a more  sustainable future for all Americans.   As chair of the Oversight and Reform Committee, electrifying the  Postal Service fleet has been one of my top priorities for the last  several years. I have spoken and written to the Postmaster General  numerous times about the importance of adopting an all-electric fleet,  and the committee has held briefings and hearings several times on this  issue.   The Postal Service operates a fleet of nearly 230,000 cars and  trucks. That is roughly one-third of the entire Federal fleet. It is  the second largest fleet in our Nation and should set the standard for  this Nation.   Unfortunately, this fleet is rapidly aging, with many vehicles  already more than three decades old. The old postal trucks are often  unsafe, have high maintenance costs, and get terrible gas mileage.   We cannot afford to continue polluting our environment with  unnecessary carbon. This is simply unacceptable. We are in the middle  of a climate crisis. The Federal Government should be leading the  charge to reduce carbon emissions and green its fleets.   That is why I am elated the Postal Service has made the decision to  acquire 45,000 electric next-generation delivery vehicles and an  additional 21,000 other electric delivery cars and trucks between now  and 2028.   I applaud the Postal Service for its commitment to purchasing only  electric next-generation delivery vehicles after 2026, which is part of  President Biden's vision for the future. This is a win for the Postal  Service, the climate, and, most importantly, the American people.   This critical investment would not have been possible without the $3  billion President Biden championed and Congress provided in the  Inflation Reduction Act. These funds will help purchase these vehicles  and build the infrastructure necessary to support them.   These purchases will make the Postal Service a global leader in the  adoption of electric vehicles and sets an example for other Federal  agencies and the private sector as they develop their future fleets.  They are also a testament to President Biden's efforts to prioritize  the climate and make the world safer and more secure for future  generations.   I commend the Postal Service for making this decision, and I look  forward to the steps Congress and the administration will continue to  take to protect our planet and to green our planet. This is a great  step forward for a cleaner and better environment.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York.
