 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation to  award a Congressional Gold Medal to the Women's Army Corps 6888th  Central Postal Directory Battalion.   In 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed legislation that  created the Women's Army Corps, and with the help of First Lady Eleanor  Roosevelt and Mary McCloud Bethune, the opportunity to serve in  overseas units was soon extended to African-American women and the Six  Triple Eight unit was born.   The Six Triple Eight began their service in 1945 and were stationed  in areas throughout England and France. Despite the dangerous  conditions, these brave women helped sort and deliver millions of vital  pieces of mail to soldiers on the front lines and helped quickly  eliminate a 6-month backlog at several mail stations.   I am honored to help introduce this legislation to award the Six  Triple Eight with the highest honor in Congress, the Congressional Gold  Medal, for their heroic service to our Nation.   I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Moore, for leading this  effort in the House and my fellow Kansan, Senator Moran, for helping  get this bill across the finish line in the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill that gives  these heroic women the recognition they deserve.
