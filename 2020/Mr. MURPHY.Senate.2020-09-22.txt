 Madam President, the Russian Federation has a  Constitution, and if you read Russia's Constitution, you would know  that Russia is a democracy. Why? Because their Constitution guarantees  the existence of a vibrant, multiparty political system. The Russian  Constitution prohibits the use of extrajudicial force or torture by the  government. Their constitution says: ``Censorship of the media is  prohibited.''   Russia is a democracy if you read their Constitution, but Russia  isn't a democracy, of course. It is a dictatorship. One man rules. No  one has the right to dissent. There is no freedom of the press. All of  that is under the penalty of death.   Now, why is this? Well, it is because democracies aren't made by  their founding document. The document is just a piece of paper-- parchment, in our case--with words written on it, and these words are  just that: They are words. Democracy doesn't work unless its leaders  choose to follow the rules that those words prescribe, but also to  operate in the spirit of the values that undergird those words.   Vladimir Putin will proudly tell you that, technically, Russia  adheres to its Constitution. Now, that is not true, obviously, but what  Putin has done over the years is just slowly erode a democratic system  by using every single inch of discretion allowed to him by that  Constitution to make democracy functionally impossible. He will say  that censorship doesn't exist because there isn't an explicit  censorship law, but we all know that he has used every informal  mechanism available to him to make sure that there is no room--no  room--for the independence of the press.   Something stunning happened here 4 years ago. A Supreme Court vacancy  arose through the death of Justice Scalia. The Constitution says that a  new Supreme Court Justice can't be seated unless he or she gets an  affirmative vote from the Senate, and every single nominee--at least  those who weren't withdrawn by the President--essentially got a vote  from the Senate before 2016 because, you see, the Founding Fathers  didn't actually require the Senate to vote. They didn't because they  assumed that leaders of good faith would, of course, fulfill that  responsibility to hold a vote. They never considered that the Senate  might stretch its discretion under the Constitution so broadly to  refuse to consider a nominee simply because they didn't like the  President who made the nomination.   The Founders didn't actually micromanage democracy. They set these  broad rules, and they trusted that we would all act in good faith  toward each other and with a patriotism toward our Nation in filling in  the details.   But that is not how 2016 went down. Senate Republicans said they were  setting a new precedent: When a nomination is made in the last year of  a President's term, the Senate shouldn't act on it. The Senate, in that  case, Republicans said, should wait for the outcome of the election and  let the President who wins make the selection.   Now, what Senator McConnell and Senator Graham have said is pretty  definitive. It is well covered. But there were lots of Senate  Republicans who are still here who were equally definitive about the  rules they were establishing.   For instance, the senior Senator from Florida said:         I don't think we should be moving forward on a nominee in       the last year of [a President's term]. I would say that even       if it was a Republican president.    That was the rule that Republicans repeated over and over and over  and over and over and over. They are not telling the truth if they try  to spin it differently, and we all know this.   So you may ask: Why does it matter that they weren't telling the  truth? Why does it matter that Republicans didn't honor their word? Why  does it matter that they are willing to bend the rules, no matter the  promises they have made in the past, whenever it suits them in order to  gain political advantage?   Well, it is back to the bet that the Founding Fathers made. They just  didn't anticipate a moment like today, when truth doesn't matter, when  lying is normal, when honor is dead. They left us a bunch of wiggle  room in the Constitution, knowing that we had to treat each other well,  with respect, with a concern for precedent, in order to have a  functional democracy.   Senator Alexander, whom I greatly admire, said in his statement the  other day that nobody should be surprised that Republicans are going to  confirm a Supreme Court nominee before the election, notwithstanding  the fact that the election has already started and that it also wipes  out the precedent that they just claimed was so sacred 4 years ago.   That statement is really revealing. Whether he meant it or not, what  he is saying is that nobody should be surprised by now that Republicans  are just willing to do whatever it takes--even making up complete  fabrications,  [[Page S5772]]  like a new rule against confirming Justices in an election year--in  order to accumulate more power.   That is a really dangerous place for this body to head, because the  Constitution does provide all sorts of room to push that document to  its limits, to dispense with all fairness and honor and fair play, and  to just seek power, no matter the costs.   I know this sounds silly, but it is not. There is nothing in the  Constitution that prohibits the majority party in this body from, for  instance, denying all staff to minority Members. There is nothing  stopping the majority party from banning all minority party Members  from speaking on the floor. And once you don't care about fairness,  once you can just change precedent on a dime just to accumulate power,  then, there is really no end.   I get it that a comparison to Russia seems a little tortured and a  little strained, but, honestly, this is how democracies fall apart-- when power becomes more important than the rule of law, our sense of  fairness, or even loyalty to country; when your word means nothing;  when no one can count on anyone to stay true to what they say; when  there is nihilism, trump's patriotism.   There are new rules in the Senate now. We get that. There are new  rules. Republicans might pretend like they existed before today, but  they didn't. This breaks the glass like nothing else did before it.   Finally, let me ask this: To what end? Why is it so important that  Republicans so nakedly grab for power and reset the very rules of how  the Senate operates--rules that were so important 4 years ago?   It is not coincidental that the case that the Supreme Court is due to  hear days after the election is a case that has to do with something  the Republicans have been trying so desperately and unsuccessfully to  do for 10 years--repeal the Affordable Care Act and end healthcare for  20 million Americans and protections against rate gouging for 130  million with preexisting conditions   It is worth repeating this. I know my colleagues have said it before,  and they will say it after, but if Republicans are successful in  appointing an anti-ACA Justice to the Supreme Court--and President  Trump has made it clear that he is not putting anyone up for the  Supreme Court who isn't willing to strike down the Affordable Care  Act--then we will have a humanitarian catastrophe on our hands in this  country because days after the election, a case is to be heard that  will be heard by that new Justice that asks to invalidate the entirety  of the Affordable Care Act--not in pieces, not over time, but  immediately, the whole thing. That is 25 million people losing access  to healthcare--Medicaid and the State and Federal exchanges--in the  middle of a pandemic.   Think about that. Think about 25 million--the equivalency of  something like 10 to 15 different States--all losing healthcare right  off the bat, when COVID is raging in this country.   As Senator Baldwin said, COVID is a preexisting condition. We are  just learning what it does to your body, but it may ravage it. And,  ultimately, everyone in this country who knows they have COVID or finds  out about it through antibody tests down the line will have their rates  jacked up if the Affordable Care Act goes away.   Spare me the talk of a replacement coming. I have been in this body  long enough to know that there is no replacement coming. Republicans  have been talking about it for 10 years.   The Affordable Care Act will be invalidated by this Court with this  new nominee. Nothing will replace it. Millions of people will lose  their healthcare.   The reason this nomination is being pushed through is, yes, because  Republicans care about power more than anything else but also to make  sure that the Court around the corner from here does what the American  people wouldn't let Congress do.   Remember, Congress could not repeal the Affordable Care Act because  the people wouldn't let Congress do it. But nobody is going to be  fooled about this end-around. By the time this nominee comes before  this body, nobody is going to be mistaken about the consequences for  Americans' healthcare.   I know that a lot of people think Democrats are foolishly naive. How  could we be surprised by this treachery, this about-face of precedent  on election-year confirmations, when Republicans have been changing the  rules of the Senate at light speed for 5 years?   First it was unprecedented denial of a vote for a Supreme Court  nominee in 2016. It never happened before in American history. Then it  was the abolition of the 60-vote requirement for Supreme Court  nominees. Then it was the restriction of debate on judges and political  appointees so that nobody could actually see how wildly unqualified the  people Donald Trump was appointing to office were. Then it was the end  of blue slips so that even more radical nominees could be put on the  bench. It has been just one power grab after another.   So, yes, we probably have seen this coming, and we probably should  have known that a party so committed to ending health insurance for 20  million Americans would do anything to make that happen.   But I was naive. I still had hope. I still believed that honor was  alive in this place. I still thought that when people said things, they  meant it, and they would stick to it. I still thought that we could  save the Senate.   I believe in my heart that Republicans are going to rue the day that  they made nakedly clear that a Senator's word means nothing, where this  place is simply a vehicle to compile as much power as quickly as  possible, no matter the cost.   American democracy is not just the Constitution. It is us. It is the  decisions we make every single day. It is the way we treat each other.  It is the decision as to whether we care about our word mattering. This  month, as it stands tonight, democracy's flicker just got a whole lot  duller.   I yield the floor.
