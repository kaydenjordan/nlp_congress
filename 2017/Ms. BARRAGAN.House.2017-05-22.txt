 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize National  Maritime Day.   Since America's founding, our men and women who serve as mariners  have dedicated themselves to protecting our economy and our interests  at home and abroad. Whether it be through ensuring the delivery of  goods, supporting us during times of peace, or standing up during times  of war, the maritime industry has held strong.   The Port of Los Angeles, which I am proud to represent, has made  countless contributions not only to California but to every other  congressional district.   As a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I work to ensure  the safety and security of the Port of Los Angeles so that it can  continue to serve as America's port. Along with the Port of Long Beach,  the ports employ twice as many men and women as the Hollywood  entertainment industry.   Today, I am proud to honor those men and women who serve and have  served as U.S. merchant mariners. I ask that we continue to support the  maritime industry today, and every day.                            ____________________
