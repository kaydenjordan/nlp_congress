 As critical as the war against Russia is,       Ukraine's struggling democracy has an equally important       challenge: Battling the Soviet legacy of corruption which has       pervaded Ukraine's government.        Corruption makes Ukraine's leaders ever vulnerable to       Russia, and the Ukrainian people understand that. That's why       they launched the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, demanding to       be a part of Europe, demanding the transformation of the       system, demanding to live under the rule of law.        Ukrainians wanted the law to apply equally to all people,       whether the individual in question is the President or any       other citizen. It was a question of fairness, of dignity.        Here again, there is a coincidence of interests. Corrupt       leaders are inherently less trustworthy while an honest and       accountable Ukrainian leadership makes a U.S.-Ukrainian       partnership more reliable and more valuable to the United       States.    Mr. Manager NADLER. On the evening of April 24, 2019, Ambassador  Yovanovitch was hosting an event at the U.S. Embassy, honoring the  memory of an anticorruption fighter who had been killed when acid was  thrown in her face the previous year. At about 10 that night, the  Embassy event was interrupted by a telephone call from Washington.  Ambassador Yovanovitch described this conversation with the head of the  State Department's human resources department.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          She said that there was great concern on       the seventh floor of the State Department. That's where the       leadership at the State Department sits. There was great       concern. They were worried. She just wanted to give me a       heads up about this. And, you know, things seemed to be going       on, and so she just wanted to give me a heads up.    Mr. Manager NADLER. Confused, the Ambassador asked for more  information from Washington. Three hours later they spoke again.  Ambassador Yovanovitch learned that there were concerns about her ``up  the street''; that is, at the White House. The Ambassador was told to  get on the first plane home.   Why was this respected career diplomat abruptly removed from her  post? Why was she, in fact, urged by the State Department to catch the  first plane home, that she was in danger, she shouldn't wait?   At the time, the White House would not say, but today we know the  truth. The truth is that Ambassador Yovanovitch was the victim of a  smear campaign organized by Rudy Giuliani, amplified by President  Trump's allies, and designed to give President Trump the pretext he  needed to recall her without warning. Mr. Giuliani has admitted as much  to the press.   In order to understand Mr. Giuliani's smear campaign against  Ambassador Yovanovitch, you need to know about a few additional  characters who Mr. Giuliani drew into his scheme.   The first of these characters is Viktor Shokin, the disgraced former  prosecutor general of Ukraine, who was fired by the Ukrainian  Government for gross corruption. In 2016, at the urging of the European  Union, the International Monetary Fund, and the U.S. Government, the  Parliament of Ukraine voted to remove Mr. Shokin as prosecutor general  because he was corrupt and refused to prosecute corruption cases. The  United States, the European Union, and the International Monetary Fund  all urged the Ukraine Government to dismiss Mr. Shokin.   The second character is Yuriy Lutsenko, who succeeded Mr. Shokin as  prosecutor general. Mr. Lutsenko also proved reluctant to prosecute  corruption cases, and several witnesses testified that he also had a  reputation for dishonesty and corruption. Ambassador Yovanovitch and  Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent both testified that the U.S.  Embassy in Kyiv eventually stopped working with Mr. Lutsenko  altogether.   Shokin, Lutsenko, and Giuliani--the goals of all three characters  were aligned. Shokin had it out for Vice President Biden because of the  role that the Vice President played in his 2016 firing. The Vice  President, carrying out U.S. policy, urged the Ukrainian Government to  dismiss the corrupt Shokin.   I note that the Vice President--the former Vice President--has been  criticized for urging that he be fired.   Lutsenko found his career trajectory fading and wanted President  Trump's support to boost his political prospects in Ukraine. Giuliani  needed partners in Ukraine willing to announce two sham investigations  meant to boost President Trump's own campaign. All three wanted  Ambassador Yovanovitch out of the way.   So in early 2019, the smear campaign began. Mr. Lutsenko became the  primary vector for false allegations against Ambassador Yovanovitch.  Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent testified that Lutsenko's  allegations against Ambassador Yovanovitch were motivated by revenge.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
