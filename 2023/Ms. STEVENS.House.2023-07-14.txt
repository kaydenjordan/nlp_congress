 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of our  collective experience of seeing in real time the impacts of climate  change unfold. This past month we have seen temperatures rise and air  quality worsen.   The smoke from the recent Canadian wildfires led Michigan to issue  their first-ever statewide air quality advisory. Instead of being  outside enjoying the Great Lakes, my constituents were filling up  emergency rooms in Beaumont of Farmington Hills, struggling to breathe.   These impacts are not just hitting us locally in Michigan. July 3 and  4 saw some of the highest global average temperatures in recorded human  history.   This is why last year I worked so hard with my Democratic colleagues  to pass the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA is the single largest  investment in combating climate change.   We are already starting to see the benefits coming from these Federal  actions. Michigan's clean energy jobs grew by 3.8 percent in 2022  alone.   Mr. Speaker, we can turn this challenge into an opportunity, our 21st  century moon shot: create jobs, renovate, address, and be resilient.                            ____________________
