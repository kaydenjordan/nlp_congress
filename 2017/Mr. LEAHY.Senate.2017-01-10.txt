 Mr. President, the 115th Congress convened just last week.  I had hoped that with all the turmoil in the country that we would  begin the year with a renewed sense of cooperation. But I am sorry to  say, my friends in the Republican Party have chosen a different path.   The very first thing on the agenda is to press forward with a sham  budget. If you ask why we have a sham budget, a fake budget, an  unrealistic budget--we find out that its only purpose is to set up a  process to repeal the Affordable Care Act with a simple majority vote.  Why? Because they know the American people would never allow a repeal  to pass otherwise.  [[Page S192]]    So instead of working to finalize appropriations bills for this  year--already more than 3 months in--or to invest in our Nation's  critical infrastructure, or to truly bolster our Nation's cyber  security, when we see countries such as Russia and other places  attacking our cyber systems, or even to improve the Affordable Care Act  so we can ensure that more people can receive affordable coverage, I am  afraid the Republicans are recklessly rushing forward solely to fulfill  an ill-considered campaign promise.   They are pushing American families over the cliff with the vague  promise: Yeah, we will repeal it, but don't worry because eventually we  will come up with a plan to replace it.   Jump first, plan later is anything but a responsible formula for  someone's health, for sound decisions; and all the more so when the  health insurance of tens of millions of Americans and American families  all over the country--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike-- is at stake.   The majority leader and others have said the repeal of the Affordable  Care Act is only the first step. They say that a full repeal is  necessary to pave the way for a replacement. They say: Let's leave  ObamaCare in the past. Well, when you strip away the rhetoric and get  rid of it, the only alternative they offer the American people is don't  get sick--because if you get sick, you are in trouble.   The American people have a right to know what a vote to repeal the  Affordable Care Act really means. A repeal of this law would not just  take away the rights and care of millions of patients and their  families; it would eliminate insurance coverage for millions more-- especially the aging, the elderly, men and women with preexisting  conditions, and the most vulnerable children.   A repeal of the Affordable Care Act would turn back the clock to a  bad time in this country where once again women would have to pay more  for health insurance than men, where insurance companies could rescind  a health insurance policy simply because someone gets sick, and  coverage could forever be denied to someone born with a disease or  ailment, and that includes children. So you could buy a health  insurance policy so you were covered in case you got sick, but the  insurance companies could then say: Oh, you are sick. Sorry, no more  insurance.   Now, in my State of Vermont, the Affordable Care Act has reduced the  number of Vermonters without insurance by 53 percent. Tens of thousands  have gained coverage under the expansion of Medicaid. And because the  Affordable Care Act closed the prescription drug ``donut hole,'' more  than 10,000 Vermont seniors saved $12 million in prescription drugs in  2015 alone. And this is just in the second smallest State in the Union.  Can you imagine what it is like in larger States?   I have heard stories from many Vermonters about how vital this law is  to them and their families. I have heard from family doctors, like one  in the southwest corner of our State in Bennington, who remembers when  his patients couldn't afford treatment because of lifetime and annual  limits on health care coverage, something that was very common. Or a  woman from Westminster, VT, whose family hit hard times--she moved from  job to job. She couldn't afford continuous health coverage until the  Affordable Care Act offered her a quality plan she could keep. Now, we  are talking about throwing her off.   Other young Vermonters are able to pursue careers in public service  or the arts because they can stay on their parents' health insurance  until age 26. Countless others have underscored that because of  previous health issues, such as diabetes or cancer, health coverage  would otherwise be unaffordable.   It would be a vicious cycle. They had a disease, but they couldn't  afford to do anything about it, and they would go into greater debt.  Now, even though they have a preexisting condition, they have  guarantees and subsidies provided by the Affordable Care Act so they  can have health coverage, instead of health coverage being  unaffordable.   Opponents of the Affordable Care Act have gone to new lengths to  repeat and prolong this political battle. And that is all this is. They  have had 6 years to propose a better alternative. Instead,  congressional Republicans and the President-elect have decided to put  the cart before the horse. They want to dismantle our health care  system, and they don't want to figure out how to fix it. They just want  to figure out how to get rid of it. And, by the way, they say somebody  is going to come up with a bright idea for something better.   The American people rightly expect us to work together and make  progress on the many challenges that we face today. Instead, we are  engaging in dangerous political gamesmanship that will not affect  Members of the Congress, but the millions of families we represent  throughout this country because they will not have health insurance,  and their children will not have health insurance. Just think what this  is eventually going to cost Americans--a lot more than we pay now.   I will not support a return to less protection, less coverage, less  fairness, and higher costs because that is what a repeal means. The  Affordable Care Act extended health insurance to millions of families,  not only in Vermont, but across the country. Those who represent the  American people in Congress should stand ready to get to work for their  constituents. Not to make their constituents sick, but to give them a  program that works.   I will not support an effort to reverse the many reforms and  achievements we have made through the Affordable Care Act and instead  cobble back together a broken system that for too long burdened most  American households with health coverage uncertainty and crippling  costs.   I am not going to go and tell Vermonters: Too bad that you have  cancer. Tough. We just fixed it so you can't have insurance. Too bad  that you have diabetes. We just fixed it so you can't get insurance.  Too bad that your child was born with a physical defect. Too bad. We  just fixed it so you can't get insurance. Or to the person who just  lost a job who doesn't have insurance: Too bad that you are without  health insurance. Better pray you don't get sick because, if you do,  you will lose a lot more than your job.   No, I can't look Vermonters in the eye and say that is what I  support.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, today, the Senate Judiciary Committee  convenes for the first time in the 115th Congress, and we mark an  historic moment in the committee's 200-year history. Last week, Senator  Dianne Feinstein was named the committee's ranking member, the first  time in American history that a woman has served in this capacity. It  is striking that 352 Members have served on the committee, and only six  of those--all Democrats--have been women. Three of those six women are  proudly serving on this important committee today: Senator Feinstein,  Senator Klobuchar, and Senator Hirono, whom we welcome back to the  committee.   Senator Feinstein has long been a leading voice on this committee. I  have enjoyed working with her on countless issues ranging from national  security to immigration reform to Supreme Court nominations. Senator  Feinstein has broken down barriers throughout her career, and her new  role as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee is only the latest  example. As the committee grapples with some of the most pressing  issues facing our country, we will all be counting on Ranking Member  Feinstein's leadership. We should all congratulate her on this historic  moment.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mara  Greenberg, a detailee on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Zachary  Blau, a fellow on the Senate Judiciary Committee, be granted Senate  floor privileges for the duration of the 115th Congress.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
