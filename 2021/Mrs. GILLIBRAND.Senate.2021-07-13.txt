 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to once again call for  every Senator to have the opportunity to consider and cast their vote  for the Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act.   The bill would remove all serious crimes except for military-specific  crimes out of the chain of command and give it to trained military  prosecutors to decide whether or not to move that case to trial. Making  that change would end days of asking commanders, who are not trained  lawyers, to make complex legal decisions in cases where they often know  both the accuser and the accused. That change is necessary. It is  necessary because the current military justice system is simply not  delivering justice, especially not to servicemembers of color.   I am proud that our legislation has recently won the endorsement of  our colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus, who have highlighted  how this reform would address the systemic barriers to justice our  servicemembers of color face. I want to thank the CBC for their strong  support. I share their urgency when it comes to addressing those  systemic injustices.   Right now, Black servicemembers are up to 2.61 times as likely to  face disciplinary action as their fellow White servicemembers, and  Black and Hispanic servicemembers are more likely than White  servicemembers to be tried in general and special courts-martial across  the military services.   The Joint Service Committee on Military Justice began collecting data  on race and courts-martial last June. Even in the brief period of time  they have tracked, the disparities are tragically clear. In the Army,  just 21.4 percent of Active-Duty servicemembers are Black, but Black  servicemembers account for 35.5 percent of the accused in general  courts-martial. In the Air Force, just 14.7 percent of Active-Duty  servicemembers are Black, but they account for 23.1 percent of the  accused. In the Navy, 17.2 percent of Active-Duty servicemembers are  Black, but they account for 34.3 percent of the accused. Those figures  speak to an inherent bias in the system that must be addressed.   Congressman Anthony Brown, who served in the military for 30 years  and worked as an Army judge advocate general and as a clerk for then- Chief Judge Eugene Sullivan at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed  Forces, recently wrote in the Washington Post about the need to pass  this legislation.   He wrote:         Following the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna       Taylor and too many more Black and Brown Americans, there has       been a nationwide call to address the disparities in our       criminal justice system. But these efforts cannot overlook       the criminal justice system that is not on the front pages or       in [the] television news--[that is] the one in [the U.S.]       military. The current military justice system is not serving       our country's higher values of justice, equity and fairness.       It has put servicemembers of color at a disadvantage and left       them subject to a commander-controlled system they do not       trust.        In a survey last year of members of the Air Force and [in       the] Space Force, 3 in 5 Black servicemembers said they would       not receive the same benefit of the doubt as their White       peers if they faced disciplinary action. One-third believed       the military justice system is actively biased against them.        Those fears are corroborated by the facts. . . . Our       military justice system mirrors the discrimination in the       civilian criminal justice system, sometimes rising to a life-      or-death matter. A 2012 study showed that, before its last       use decades ago, nearly two-thirds of servicemembers       sentenced to death were servicemembers of color. These long-      standing disparities and this unjust system demand our       attention and action.    These disparities are longstanding. A task force established by  President Nixon's Secretary of Defense in 1972 identified many of the  same issues and same causal factors we see today. The task force  reported:         In the course of our conversations with black and Spanish-      speaking [servicemembers] throughout the world, we became       convinced that the black or Spanish-speaking enlisted man is       often singled out for punishment by white authority figures       where his white counterpart is not. There is enough evidence       of intentional discrimination by individuals to convince the       Task Force that such selective punishment is in many cases       racially motivated.    I know that some of my colleagues have called for more time to study  this issue. I would point them to a 2020 review from the Air Force  inspector general, which found that for every year between 1999 and  2019, Black airmen were 60 percent more likely to face court-martial  and 74 percent more likely to receive nonjudicial punishment from their  commanders than their White counterparts. That is 20 years of data  telling the same unacceptable story. What more proof do they need?   It has been nearly 50 years since the Nixon administration's task  force brought this issue to light, and we have seen little positive  change. Our servicemembers cannot wait any longer. Congressman Brown is  right--this unjust system demands our attention and action.   As Members of Congress, we have the constitutional duty to provide  oversight and accountability over the Department of Defense. We have  the job of writing and revising and improving the military code of  justice. It is a congressionally created code. Addressing these  disparities is our responsibility and no one else's. This bill will  help us do that. Now is the time to act.   In addition to the Congressional Black Caucus, this bill is supported  by legal experts and servicemembers. It has the support of almost every  veteran group I can find, from the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans group  to the Vietnam veterans group, to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. This is  supported by our servicemembers and our veterans.   It also has the support of a growing number of bipartisan Congress  Members in the House. It also has the support of 66 U.S. Senators--a  filibuster-proof majority. If the vote were called today, it would  pass. This bill should be voted on.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be  determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Republican  leader, the Senate Armed Services Committee be discharged from further  consideration of  [[Page S4862]]  S. 1520 and the Senate propose to its consideration; that there be 2  hours for debate equally divided in the usual form; and that upon the  use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the bill with no  intervening action or debate.
