 Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the majority for including my  amendment in this bloc.   My amendment is straightforward, Mr. Chairman. It recognizes that any  U.S. strategy for Syria must acknowledge and respond to the tremendous  suffering of civilians, including the millions who have been forced  from their homes, who face starvation, cholera, a lack of access to  adequate healthcare and education, not as an afterthought, but as an  active imperative.   The Trump administration has already used the suffering created by  the use of chemical weapons as a reason for expanding U.S. involvement  in Syria and to launch attacks against the Syrian Government. My  amendment would ask the administration for a description of the legal  authority relied upon or needed for the use of U.S. military force in  Syria, information which is even more critical now, given the recent  attacks by U.S. forces against the Syrian Government and reports that  we may continue to send more troops into Syria.    It is foolhardy and unwise for us to think that the suffering being  imposed upon innocent civilians in Syria should not be a consideration  in any U.S. response or strategy outlining how military forces or aid  will be used there. The humanitarian crisis spawned by  [[Page H5844]]  conflict directly impacts our national security efforts. We ignore it  at our own peril.
