 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Women's Health  Protection Act.   For almost my entire life, Roe v. Wade has been the law of the land.  And after continuous attacks on Roe for the past five decades, I, for  the first time fear that it is truly imperiled.   The attacks on women's health in Texas and the court's refusal thus  far to protect our Constitution and women lays out a roadmap really for  States across the Nation. That is why this legislation is critical, so  Congress can stand in the breach and protect women and our  constitutional rights across the Nation.
