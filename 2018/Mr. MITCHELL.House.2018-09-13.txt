 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the America's  Water Infrastructure Act, a critical piece of legislation that  authorizes water infrastructure projects across our Nation.   One particular project is near and dear to my heart, critical to the  State of Michigan and our national economy and security: the Soo Locks.  This lock is the only waterway, the only connection between Lake  Superior and the rest of the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway.   Right now, that one lock accommodates almost all of the shipping of  iron ore and many other goods from Minnesota through the Great Lakes.  If that lock fails, the damage is instantaneous: economic damage--11  million people would lose their jobs within the first 90 days--and  risks our national security.   That is why construction of a second lock is so vital. This upgrade  was authorized over 30 years ago. I guess it shouldn't surprise us that  it has languished a bit. We now have bipartisan support, both sides of  the aisle supporting the need to get this lock, a second large lock,  built. We have recognition by the administration that this lock is  critical for our economy and our national security.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill as the next step in building  the 1,200-foot lock at the Soo Locks so we can ensure that our national  security and our economy is not devastated by the failure of one lock.
