 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment strikes section 311 from the  bill. This section would create a forced arbitration program for  forestry management. This section of the bill, in my view, usurps  judicial oversight. While many agencies conduct quasi-judicial  proceedings, there are still agency actions that are appealable to the  courts.   Judicial oversight and separation of powers is a core principle of  our democracy. The arbitration would be binding, effectively making the  Secretary of Agriculture the final judge and depriving the courts of  their oversight role.   While the bill terms this as discretionary arbitration, the  discretion ultimately lies only with the Secretary of Agriculture. The  public has no discretion over whether to submit to binding arbitration  or not.   The public's right to challenge an action or inaction in court is an  important check on the executive branch. Shielding an agency from  review by independent Federal courts could harm access to justice.   The Secretary of Agriculture can designate any objection for binding  arbitration up to ten times per year in each of the nine Forest Service  regions and each of the 14 State regions.                                time  1630    This allows the Secretary of Agriculture to effectively dismiss about  230 cases every year. According to the Department of Justice, in 2016,  the total amount of civil matters and cases brought against the United  States with an environmental or land cause of action was only 350. This  overly broad power would allow the agency to dismiss some of the most  problematic cases every year.   The process also likely violates the nondelegation doctrine. That  doctrine prohibits the exercise of constitutional authority given to  any branch of government by another branch or nongovernmental private  party.   Under the arbitration program set up by this bill, a private party  objecting to a management proposal and forced into arbitration would be  required to write their own proposal. The appointed arbitrator could  then select that private party proposal as the final plan to be carried  out by the agency. The arbitrator is not permitted to modify the  proposal, and the decision would be binding.   I understand the need to streamline the process, but I think the  forced arbitration really deprives people of their access to the  courts, and that is why, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support  the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I think the point is not that we need to  streamline decisions, or if we have to streamline courts to get rid of  frivolous lawsuits, that would be fine, but the problem is the power  that is being vested in the Secretary of Agriculture where, if the  Secretary of Agriculture shares a view that is not sympathetic to  environmental concerns, they can basically dismiss the lawsuits of  numerous environmental plaintiffs.   I think this is really about the separation of powers. If there is  reform needed in the judiciary, those reforms should be in our courts,  but they shouldn't appropriate the power to the Secretary of  Agriculture who may have his own or her own views and not give a fair  hearing to the environmental groups.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
