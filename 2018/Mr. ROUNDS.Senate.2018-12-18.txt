 Mr. President, today I recognize Maj. Steven Fowler for  all of his hard work on behalf of myself, my staff, and the State of  South Dakota while working in my Washington, DC, office.   Steven entered military service in 2004 and has devoted his career to  the U.S. Air Force. Before his time in my office, Steven served as a  full-time National Guard officer in the National Guard Bureau. He also  received a master's degree in public administration from the JFK School  of Government at Harvard University. Steven's experience and expertise  have been a true asset to my office.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Steven for his service  to our country. I wish Steven, his wife Cara, and their daughters  MaKenna, Alexandra, and Abigail all the best in the years to come. As  he continues his career of service, he bears the esteem of a grateful  State and my utmost gratitude for a job well done.                            ____________________
