 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time  until 5:30 p.m. today, including quorum calls, be equally divided  between the two leaders or their designees.    Madam President, I just listened to the senior Senator  from New York--my friend from the gym and the minority leader--deliver  some summaries of what he said was in the bill before us, and he  implored this body and implored the people watching on C-SPAN to read  the bill, stating they would find that all of these terrible things are  in the bill.   I see the minority leader has to leave the floor now, but, humbly, I  would urge him to come back and show us where any of what he just said  is in this bill. What he said wasn't true.   I rise today for a simple purpose. I want to ask each and every one  of our colleagues whether we are OK with infanticide. This language is  blunt. I recognize that, and it is too blunt for many people in this  body, but, frankly, that is what we are talking about here today.   Infanticide is what the abortion survivors--Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act is actually about.   Are we a country that protects babies who are alive, born outside the  womb after having survived a botched abortion? That is what this is  about.   Are we a country that says it is OK to actively allow that baby to  die, which is the current position of Federal law? That is the question  before us, plain and simple.   Here are the facts. We know that some babies, especially late in  gestation, survive attempted abortions. We know, too, that some of  these babies are left to die--left to die. No further protections exist  today to shield them from this ugly fate, and only some States have  protections on their books. We have seen in our national discourse over  the last month and a half a few States moving in different ways to undo  protections that some of these babies have had at the State level.   The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is trying to right  this obvious wrong. The bill's terms are simple: A child born alive  during a botched abortion would be given the same level of care that  would be provided to any other baby born at that same gestational age.  That is it.   This bill isn't about abortion. I am pro-life--unapologetically pro- life--but this bill is not about anything that limits abortion. This  bill doesn't have anything to do with Roe v. Wade. This bill is about  something else. What this bill does is try to secure basic rights,  equal rights for babies who are born and are outside the womb. That is  what we are talking about.   Over the course of the next hour, as this is debated on the floor,  people are going to say a whole bunch of other things. I would ask them  to please bring the text of the bill to the floor when they do it and  show us whether there is anything about limiting abortion in this bill.   This bill is exclusively about protecting babies who have already  been born and are outside of the womb. Every baby deserves a fighting  chance, whether that 24-week old baby, fighting for air and fighting  for life, having just taken her first breaths, is at an abortion clinic  where she survived a botched abortion or she is in a delivery room at  the local hospital. Both of those babies are equally deserving of care,  protection, and humane treatment, and our laws should treat both of  these human beings as babies because they are babies. They have been  born, and they are outside of the womb.  [[Page S1415]]    This really should not be controversial. In fact, my colleagues  actually talk this way all of the time. This place feels like about  one-third of the people here are currently running for President, so I  would like to quote a few of them over the course of the last couple  months.   We ought to ``build a country where no one is forgotten, and no one  is left behind.'' Amen to that. Amen to that.    ``The people in our society who are most often targeted by predators  are also often the voiceless and the vulnerable.''   That is true.   Another offered a promise to ``fight for other people's kids as hard  as I fight for my own kids.''   Last week, our colleague from Vermont announced his campaign by  saying: ``The mark of a great Nation is . . . how it treats its most  vulnerable people.'' Bernie Sanders was right.   Now is the chance, in this body, to make good on that promise. Now is  the chance to protect one of the most vulnerable populations on the  land imaginable--tiny, defenseless, little babies, just having taken  their first breath--or was that claptrap for the campaign trail or  sound-bites? Or do people mean the stuff they say around here?   Let's put it another way. Today's vote asks whether or not you want  to take the side of people like Virginia's disgraced Governor Ralph  Northam?   Last month, before the news of his hideous yearbook broke, Governor  Northam made clear that a baby born alive during an abortion could and  maybe ought to be killed if that is what the parents and doctors  decided they wanted to do after a debate. That was his position: You  should make the baby ``comfortable,'' and then there could be a  discussion about whether or not you throw that little baby into the  trash can. That is what he actually talked about on the radio for a day  and a half last month.   Governor Northam is disgraceful for a whole host of reasons, but  unlike some other people, he actually told the truth about what he  wants. He wants a society where some people count more than others, and  other people are worth less than others. He wants a society where some  people can be pushed aside if they are inconvenient. In reality, that  is what we are voting on today.   Some of my colleagues want to write into our law a kind of permanent  exception: ``Every human being should be protected from cruel and  inhuman treatment--unless that human being came into the world through  a botched abortion.'' Then, you can decide later if you want to kill  them.   Tonight, what we are going to vote on in the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act is a chance to see whether we are serious when  people around here say they want to protect the innocent, speak up for  the voiceless, and defend the defenseless. Tonight, we are going to  have the opportunity to do exactly that. We can come to the aid of  innocent, voiceless, defenseless little babies who have just taken  their first breaths by protecting him and her from mistreatment and  neglect.   This should be, frankly, the easiest vote we ever cast in this body,  but the prospect of what we are voting on here is threatening to one of  the most powerful interest groups in America. The abortion industry has  taken to attacking this bill wildly over the course of the last 2  weeks, even though, as we made clear repeatedly and as the text of this  bill makes indisputably clear, this bill has nothing to do with  abortion itself. Nothing in this bill changes the slightest letter of  Roe v. Wade. Nothing touches abortion access in this bill.   This bill is about living and breathing babies who are alive outside  the womb. That is all that the text of this bill does, but Planned  Parenthood and NARAL and their allies feel threatened by a bill to  protect alive, out-of-the-womb babies. In other words, unlike this  legislation, Planned Parenthood and others refuse to draw any line  between abortion and infanticide. That is what their lobbying the last  week has shown. That should tell us something about what these groups  are really about. What they are about is a society built on power--the  power of some people to decide whether other people get to live or die.   This bill is a stumbling block to anyone who thinks that some lives  are less valuable than others. This bill is a stumbling block to anyone  who thinks that certain human beings should be disposable. This bill is  a stumbling block to anyone who thinks that we should be able to  quietly rid ourselves of little people who were ``inconvenient'' or  supposedly ``unwanted.''   They are not unwanted. There are lots of people in every single State  in this Union lined up waiting to adopt, including kids who have lots  of hard life circumstances. In every State there are waiting lists of  people who will take so-called unwanted babies.   America is a country built on a different principle. Ours is a  country dedicated to the proposition that all men and women--all boys  and girls--are created equal, even the littlest--even if they happen to  come into the world under the most horrible circumstances, even if they  are crippled or inconvenient, or, apparently, for a moment, unwanted.  Ours is a country that recognizes the fundamental indistinguishable  dignity of every human being, regardless of race, or sex, or creed, or  ability. As a country, we have struggled for 2 centuries--sometimes at  enormous cost--to extend those basic human rights to more and more of  our fellow citizens. Today's vote is simply an opportunity to continue  that work.   Let me say by way of closing that despite oppositions and setbacks  and despite some strange rhetoric about this bill over the course of  the last week, I am hopeful in the long term. Deep down, each of us  knows that every member of our human family ought to be protected and  deserves to be cherished and loved. The love we see every day in the  eyes of moms and dads for their newborn babies is an inescapable  reminder of that fundamental truth. Love is stronger than power.   Thank you, Madam President.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for less  than 1 minute.    Mr. President, over the course of this afternoon, we have  heard a whole bunch of things about what is supposedly in this bill. I  know that a lot of people who are opposed to this bill, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act, sincerely believe the talking points  that they read from their staffs, but, humbly, we have heard speech  after speech after speech about things that have absolutely nothing to  do with what is actually in this bill.   So as you get ready to cast this vote, I urge my colleagues to  picture a baby who has already been born, who is outside the womb, and  who is gasping for air. That is the only thing that today's vote is  actually about. We are talking about babies who have already been born.  Nothing in this bill touches abortion access.   Thank you.                                Cloture Motion
