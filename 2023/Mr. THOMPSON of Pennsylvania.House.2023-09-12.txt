 Madam Speaker, yesterday marked the  22nd anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks. I rise today to  remember the innocent lives that were lost.   At 8:46 a.m., American Flight 11 flew into Tower 1 of the World Trade  Center. Not long after that, Flight 175 roared over lower Manhattan  into Tower 2.   While Americans around the country were grappling with the events  that just transpired, a third plane, Flight 77, crashed into the  Pentagon, the center of our Armed Forces and national defense.   In southwest Pennsylvania, the fourth flight, United 93, originally  headed to San Francisco, was hijacked and made an abrupt turn toward  Washington, D.C. But because of the brave passengers and crew members  who attempted to take back the plane, it crashed into a field in  Shanksville, Pennsylvania.   In the days, weeks, months, and now two decades that followed  September 11, our country joined together to face the very evil which  attempted to take us down.   We will forever be indebted to our servicemen and servicewomen who  join the fight to protect our freedoms, and we must remember the  sacrifices made by our servicemembers and their families every day  since.   While today's world has grown no less dangerous, we as Americans are  resilient. We will continue to fight the evil and terror that exists  today, and we will continue to be a beacon of the freedom to the world.   Let us reflect on the gift of life so tragically lost at the World  Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and a  field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.   Let us honor the memory of every American who perished on that  fateful day. Their legacies will be forever intertwined with the  strength and courage that defined our great country. We will never  forget, not 22 years later, not ever.   Madam Speaker, this message of ``never forget'' was evident on Friday  when I attended the Penn State University's 9/11 memorial service. This  service is held the Friday before September 11, usually before a home  football game, to unite the community ahead of Patriot Day. For the  entire weekend, families, students, and guests in State College saw the  flags and remember the innocent lives taken from us that day.   Students from college Republicans, college Democrats, the student  body government, and members of the Penn State community joined  together to remember the innocent lives lost.   In front of Old Main, the community placed 2,977 flags, each one  representing a soul, a person, a family member that was taken from us.  We also read the names of the 10 Penn State alumni who died in the  attacks.   At the beginning of the memorial, Hunter, a sophomore at the  university, said that while he was born 2 years after the attacks, he  recognizes the importance of taking the time to remember that fateful  day.   This is what we mean when we say, ``never forget.'' Those who lived  through the day will always have the date burned into our minds. It is  the actions of those who were not yet born that show Americans will  truly never forget.   We will also remember that we are and always will be the land of the  free, only because of the home of the brave.   May God continue to watch over our first responders, our men and  women in uniform, and all those who keep us safe.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Earleyville Farm located near Kersey, Pennsylvania, in Elk County as a  Century Farm.   The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture recognizes Pennsylvania  families who have been farming the same land for 100 years through the  Century Farm programs.   In order to qualify, the same family must have owned the farm for at  least 100 consecutive years, a family member must live on the farm on a  permanent basis, and the farm must consist of at least 10 acres of the  original holding or gross more than $1,000 annually from the sale of  farm products.   The Earleyville Farm, owned by the Mattiuz family, has been operating  since June of 1923 when Giovanni Mattiuz, an immigrant from Italy,  purchased the 10.2 acres. He raised his family there, and the farm has  been passed down for four generations.   Today, Ernest, Jr. continues to work on the farm along with his  nephew, Mike Bona. Mike actually would be the great-grandson of  Giovanni.   Thank you to the Mattiuz family for your work to feed American  families.   Congratulations to the Mattiuz family for this remarkable milestone.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague  and fellow chair for his leadership on the Natural Resources Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1450.   The Good Neighbor Authority has been a vital tool to get forest  management and restoration projects off the ground. This program helps  the Forest Service address the wildfire and forest health crises and  serves as a model for highly effective partnerships.   While the 2018 farm bill expanded the Good Neighbor Authority program  eligibility to counties and Tribes, the law did not authorize counties  and Tribes to retain timber revenues from the Good Neighbor Authority  agreement, as States do.   In extending this authority to counties and Tribes, this bill will  expand this important forest management tool to help reduce wildfire  risk and improve forest health at a meaningful scale.   I am proud to report that H.R. 1450 passed unanimously out of the  Committee on Agriculture and followed suit with the unanimous vote in  the Natural Resources Committee.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear this legislation represents a commonsense  fix to a valuable forest management program. I urge my colleagues to  support the Treating Tribes and Counties as Good Neighbors Act and vote  ``yes'' on passage.
