 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a military  servicemember from my district for his historic and heroic actions that  saved over 30 lives.   Earlier this year, Joshua Gaeta of Muscatine and his Coast Guard crew  were successful in a daring search and rescue operation involving 31  fishermen stranded on a ship that caught fire 200 miles off the coast  of Nova Scotia, Canada.   Facing winds of over 50 miles an hour, waves 30-feet high, and  freezing cold temperatures, our Coast Guard, with Gaeta on board,  bravely flew their helicopters to the scene and were able to save all  31 crew members.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Aviation Maintenance Technician First  Class Gaeta and all our servicemembers for all that they do to keep our  country safe.                            ____________________
