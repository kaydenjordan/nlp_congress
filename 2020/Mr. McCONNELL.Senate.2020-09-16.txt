 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Republican Senators, like working  families all across the country had hoped--hoped--the Senate would be  spending this week completing more bipartisan pandemic relief.   We proposed another package with hundreds of billions of dollars to  make schools safer for our kids, to help American workers keep or  regain their jobs, and to invest more in testing treatments and finding  and distributing a vaccine. But alas, Democrats filibustered it all,  apparently intent that working families cannot receive any more relief  until election day.   Across the Capitol, Speaker Pelosi's excuses and Goldilocks games are  even wearing thin on our fellow Democrats. A few weeks ago, more than  100 House Democrats publicly--publicly--asked Speaker Pelosi to stop  blocking action on any coronavirus legislation besides her  multitrillion-dollar, far-left wish list. She ignored them. She  completely ignored them.   Yesterday, a number of House Democrats tried again. They released a  new proposal they had written to some Republicans and pleaded with the  Speaker to allow a vote on it. Again, she shot down any notion  whatsoever of compromise. Now, bear in mind, the Speaker had explained  she will block any compromise for kids, jobs, and healthcare because-- because--passing anything short of multiple trillions of dollars would  make her look like ``a cheap date''--a cheap date.   The money that K-12 schools need, that unemployed workers need, and  that we need for the race toward vaccines, Speaker Pelosi is blocking  all of it because, apparently, to the San Francisco far left, anything  short of multiple trillions of dollars would make her ``a cheap date.''  So, apparently, for the sake of the Speaker's personal ego, working  families continue to suffer with no bipartisan help from Congress.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, since Democrats are stonewalling  pandemic relief, the Senate is using our time to confirm more well- qualified judicial nominees to lifetime positions on the Federal bench.  Renewing the Federal judiciary has been a major success over the last 4  years.  [[Page S5618]]    Since January 2017, President Trump has nominated, and this  Republican Senate has confirmed, 211 article III judges, including 53  circuit judges. That is the second most appellate confirmations of any  President in American history at this point in their term.   This isn't a partisan victory. The President has sent us impressive,  qualified men and women who understand the radical notion that the job  of judge is to actually follow the law--follow the law. It is a victory  for our Constitution itself, but, believe me, this progress has not  come easy.   Throughout the last 4 years, our Senate Democratic colleagues have  visited a historic degree of obstruction upon this President and his  efforts to stand up the administration that the American people  actually elected.   Senate Democrats have forced us to break more filibusters on  nominations since 2017--now listen to this--than had occurred  cumulatively in all of Senate history--all of Senate history--before  President Trump was sworn in. I am going to say that again.   Senate Democrats have forced us to break more filibusters on  nominations since 2017 than had occurred cumulatively in all of Senate  history before President Trump was sworn in. They have attempted to  filibuster more nominations in the last 3 years than the sum total of  all prior Senates--from 1789 through 2016 added together.   What was once a rare roadblock for the most controversial people has  now become a daily norm. Before 2017, before this Senate Democratic  minority got to work, only 5 percent of all nominations to district  courts and circuit courts had been subjected to filibusters. I will say  it again.   Before 2017, before this Senate Democratic minority got to work, only  5 percent of all nominations to district courts and circuit courts had  been subjected to filibusters. Under President Trump, the number has  been 80 percent--80 percent. Our Democratic colleagues even obstruct  nominees they don't even oppose. We have taken more than 100 cloture  votes on district judges, even though district court nominees from any  State with a Democratic Senator could not have even gotten out of  committee without Democratic support.   So, to summarize, here is what we are doing this week. We are  breaking Democratic filibusters on nominations because Democrats are  filibustering coronavirus relief. And let us not forget the cherry on  top. Because self-awareness apparently no longer exists, our Democratic  colleagues have chosen this very moment to argue that they shouldn't  have to play by any of these rules if they ever get power themselves.   President Obama calls the filibuster ``a relic of Jim Crow,'' even as  Senate Democrats use it over and over and over again. Democrats  filibustered police reform and filibustered pandemic relief for working  families. Some years back, the Democratic leader told the newspaper:  ``I am the leader of the filibuster movement [and] I am proud of it.''  That was the Democratic leader.   But now--now--they are saying that if they ever get power, they  intend to tear up the rule book to force radicalism on our country.  They want to break the rules to pass the kinds of radical, far-left  policies that former Vice President Biden has rushed--rushed--to  embrace, from abortion to socialism, to cracking down on the Second  Amendment.   And that is not all. It is not just about bad policies. They want to  go even deeper and hot-wire--hot-wire--our democracy itself. The far  left is salivating over the prospect of killing the filibuster in order  to pack the Supreme Court, pack the Senate with new States, and tilt  the playing field permanently so they can never lose power again.   This is not some rightwing conspiracy theory. These are the signals  they are sending publicly right now. This is what the left is saying  out there. Maybe this hard-left hypocrisy plays well in a few big  coastal cities. Maybe the angry crowds that are pulling down statues of  our Founding Fathers want Senators who will pull down government  institutions as well. Most Americans see things differently.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on another matter entirely, a  few days ago, the country got something that has been in too short  supply in 2020: some really great news--specifically, great news on the  subject of public health.   According to the 2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey, administered by  the FDA and the CDC, the number of American youth using e-cigarettes  has dropped by 1.8 million since just last year--1.8 million in 1 year.  That means, of course, that 1.8 million fewer young Americans are using  e-cigarettes and vaping devices than 1 year ago.   This victory for young Americans' health is no accident. The experts  say a number of factors are at play, but one major contributing factor  unfolded right here in the Senate a little under a year ago.   Last December, the President signed the Tobacco-Free Youth Act into  law. It was a bill I wrote and introduced to stem the tide of what was  a rapidly growing health crisis among our Nation's young people. The  bipartisan bill I wrote with my good friend Tim Kaine from Virginia and  with the help of other colleagues, including Senator Todd Young, raised  the minimum age to purchase tobacco products, including e-cigarettes  and vaping devices, from 18 to 21.   This is based on clear-cut science. Public health experts tell us the  harmful effects of nicotine are most potent on bodies and brains that  are still developing. Nearly 9 out of 10 adult smokers started by the  age of 18. So we knew it was time to take action.   I am proud to have led the legislation that took another leap forward  in getting nicotine addiction away from our Nation's youth, and by the  looks of these data, it has not taken long for our legislation to begin  to pay major dividends.   Nearly 2 million fewer teens in Kentucky, Virginia, Indiana, and  across the country are having their future put in jeopardy by these  products. That is a win, and it has happened largely because the Senate  stepped up.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
