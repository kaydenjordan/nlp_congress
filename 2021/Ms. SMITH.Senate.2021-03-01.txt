 As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 83, submitted earlier  today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution  be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Mr. President, the facts and the evidence were  overwhelming: Former President Donald Trump lied for months to his  supporters, summoned them to Washington, and incited a violent  insurrection against our government and our democracy. I voted to  convict because no reasonable person can listen to all the evidence  presented and believe otherwise.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 10:30 a.m. on  Tuesday, March 2; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of  proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, morning business be closed,  and the Senate proceed to executive session to resume consideration of  the Raimondo nomination; that, at 2:15 p.m., the cloture time be  considered expired and the Senate vote on confirmation of the  nomination; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action; finally, that Senator Cruz be recognized at  12:15 p.m. for up to 30 minutes, and following his remarks, the Senate  recess until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly conference meetings.    For the information of Senators, there will be two  rollcall votes at 2:15 p.m. The first vote will be on confirmation of  the Raimondo nomination to be Secretary of Commerce, followed by a  cloture vote on the Rouse nomination to be Chairman of the Council of  Economic Advisers.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it recess under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:51 p.m., recessed until  Tuesday, March 2, 2021, at 10:30 a.m.                            ____________________
