Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I thank all of our members for their  tireless work on the bills before us today. As we head into National  Small Business Week, the legislation we are passing today showcases the  bipartisan nature of our committee and highlights how Congress supports  the American entrepreneurial spirit.   I rise today in support of H.R. 6445, the Small Business Development  Center Improvement Act of 2022, introduced by Representative Golden  from Maine and the late Representative Hagedorn from Minnesota.   I will take a moment to remember the late Representative Hagedorn and  his work as a member of the Small Business Committee. Before and  throughout his illness, Mr. Hagedorn maintained his steadfast  commitment to small businesses. My thoughts continue to be with Mr.  Hagedorn's family, friends, and staff.   Today's bill is a testament to his dedication to his community and  small firms, and I am glad to honor his memory with this legislation.   H.R. 6445 strengthens SBA's largest resource partner, the Small  Business Development Center, or SBDC, network, by modernizing the  program to meet the needs of today's small businesses and  entrepreneurs.   SBDCs deliver free face-to-face and virtual counseling and training  in all aspects of business management to small business owners and  entrepreneurs across the country. The services include: assisting  entrepreneurs with developing a business plan, accessing capital,  creating a marketing plan, procuring government contracts,  strengthening cybersecurity protections, and entering into  international trade.   Through their network of 62 lead centers, managing nearly 1,000  outreach locations, SBDCs assist small business owners and  entrepreneurs throughout the country.   SBDCs are a remarkable investment of taxpayer dollars with every  Federal dollar spent on the SBDC program generating $1.99 in Federal  revenue, a nearly 100 percent return on investment.   To build on this success, H.R. 6445 increases the authorization level  to $175 million for the next four fiscal years, allowing the program to  grow and reach more of America's 30 million small firms.   The bill also clarifies that SBDCs, and the SBA, may actively market  their services. In the Small Business Committee, we often say that  SBDCs are the best-kept small business secret.   This bill will go a long way to ensuring more small employers and  entrepreneurs are aware that free or low-cost counseling and training  exists to help them on their path to success.   I thank the sponsors for leading this effort to modernize and improve  the SBDC program and its many valuable services. I urge Members to  support this bipartisan piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   There is no question that we need to support the cornerstone of the  SBA's entrepreneurial programs, the Small Business Development Centers.  SBDCs are SBA's premier resource partner with centers in communities  across the country. Their free or low-cost counseling and training have  helped sustain small businesses and entrepreneurs throughout the  pandemic.   H.R. 6445 continues the long tradition of SBDC's work to meet the  ever-evolving needs of America's entrepreneurs as they emerge from the  pandemic. Strengthening the SBDC network will, in turn, provide the  support our small businesses need in order to thrive.   Today's bill is endorsed by America's SBDCs, an association  representing the 63 SBDC networks and their nearly 1,000 centers.   I thank Mr. Golden and remember the late Mr. Hagedorn for their  bipartisan work on this bill.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6441) to amend the Small Business Act to improve the women's  business center program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6441, the Women's  Business Center Improvement Act of 2022. This bill will modernize and  strengthen the Small Business Administration's Women's Business Center  program to better serve America's women entrepreneurs and women-owned  small businesses.   I thank Ms. Davids and Ms. Tenney for their meaningful work to ensure  women entrepreneurs across the country have continued access to vital  counseling and training.   WBCs are a critic component of SBA's Resource Partner ecosystem,  assisting women in communities across the country, particularly those  that are socially and economically disadvantaged.   The WBC program forms more than 130 centers nationwide and offers a  full range of counseling and training services for all stages of  business development. Many of the WBCs provide multilingual services,  maintain evening and weekend hours to accommodate clients who work full  time, and provide childcare.   In fiscal year 2020, with the additional funding provided by the  CARES Act, the WBC program increased their reach by 22 percent and  trained and advised more than 82,000 clients, helping them create  nearly 30,000 small businesses.   As we all know, women were particularly hard-hit by the pandemic.  Women-owned businesses closed at higher rates than their male  counterparts as women disproportionately left the workforce to be the  primary caregivers for their families.   That is why I am pleased to support the Women's Business Centers  Improvement Act of 2022, which increases the program's annual  authorization level and increases the cap on individual center grants.  By doing so, more established centers can expand their reach to greater  numbers of women.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bipartisan bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Kansas (Ms. Davids), the chair of the Subcommittee on Economic Growth,  Tax, and Capital Access.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Women are vital members of the Nation's critical small business  community and the American economy. H.R. 6441 will modernize and  strengthen SBA's WBC program so it can meet the moment and provide the  necessary resources to women, particularly the ones driven out of the  workforce during the pandemic.   Not only have Ms. Davids and Ms. Tenney continued to work to improve  the WBC program, but they have expanded upon our efforts last Congress  by addressing the challenges highlighted during the public health  emergency. I thank them for this effort.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6450) to amend the Small Business Act to reauthorize the  SCORE program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6450         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(2) SCORE association; score program.--The terms ``SCORE       Association'' and ``SCORE program'' have the meaning given       those terms, respectively, under section 8(c)(1) of the Small       Business Act, as added by section 2 of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6450, the SCORE for  Small Business Act of 2022.   America's nearly 30 million small businesses represent more than 99  percent of all businesses. Since its inception, the SBA has undertaken  efforts to connect new entrepreneurs and small business owners with  more experienced businessmen and -women.   SCORE, one component of SBA's resource partner ecosystem, is uniquely  situated to make these connections. SCORE'S expansive network consists  of entrepreneurs, business leaders, and executives who volunteer as  mentors to small businesses and entrepreneurs, both in person and  online.   SCORE volunteers provide personalized advice and pull from their  personal business experience to help the next generation of business  leaders. Providing consultation on topics such as business plan  development, strategic marketing, and financing ideas, SCORE ensures  their clients receive comprehensive counseling and training while  meeting their individualized needs.   In 2020, through SCORE'S network of over 250 chapters and 10,000  volunteers, the program helped create over 45,000 new businesses and  over 74,000 new jobs. In addition, SCORE had a return on Federal  investment of over $67 for every $1 of Federal appropriations.   Increasing funding for SCORE is important to its continued success,  and I am pleased that H.R. 6450 increases its authorization to $13.5  million for 2 fiscal years.   H.R. 6450 not only reauthorizes this essential program but also takes  necessary steps to restore integrity, accounting, and performance to  the program.   The measures in the bill to expand and promote client and volunteer  diversity will ensure SCORE can reach all of America's small business  owners and entrepreneurs, no matter their background or location.   I commend Representatives Young Kim and Angie Craig for working  together to make sure that the SCORE program is strengthened while  maintaining efficient and effective operations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the SCORE program has made good progress improving the  transparency, accountability, and efficacy of their organization.  Today's legislation builds upon that progress so that a critical  program can succeed well into the future.   SCORE is unique among SBA's resource partners in that they connect  clients directly with successful business mentors who have firsthand  experience and knowledge to help them with their unique situations.   H.R. 6450 will expand SCORE's ability to reach more small business  owners and entrepreneurs, particularly those in underserved and rural  communities while maintaining the program improvements SCORE has worked  hard to develop.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their bipartisan support of  the SCORE program. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'', and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4877) to amend the Small Business Act to require the Small  Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman to create a  centralized website for compliance guides, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4877         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``One Stop Shop for Small       Business Compliance Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. CENTRALIZED WEBSITE FOR COMPLIANCE GUIDES.         Section 30 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657) is       amended by adding at the end the following new subsections:        ``(e) Centralized Website.--Not later than 6 months after       the date of the enactment of this subsection, the Ombudsman       shall maintain a publicly available website that includes--        ``(1) hyperlinks to small entity compliance guides       described under section 212(a)(1) of the Small Business       Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996; and        ``(2) with respect to each such small entity compliance       guide, the contact information for an individual who can       offer assistance to small entities with respect to the rules       that are the subject of such guide.        ``(f) Report on Agency Compliance.--The Ombudsman shall       include in the annual report required under subsection       (b)(2)(C) an assessment of agency compliance with the       requirements of section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory       Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 for the year covered by such       annual report.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4877, the One Stop Shop  for Small Business Compliance Act of 2021, which will require SBA's  Office of the National Ombudsman to maintain a centralized website for  regulatory compliance guides.   Federal agencies are required by the Small Business Regulatory  Enforcement Fairness Act to publish small entity compliance guides for  each rule requiring a regulatory flexibility analysis.   These compliance guides are meant to explain Federal rules in easy- to-understand terms for small businesses and help them comply with  Federal regulations that protect our environment, health, and consumer  safety. However, small businesses do not always have the resources to  navigate multiple agencies' websites to find these guides.   H.R. 4877 will ensure the Office of the National Ombudsman maintains  an updated centralized website containing links to each agency's small  business compliance guides and their relevant points of contact.   This simple step will significantly reduce the administrative burden  on entrepreneurs, make compliance easier, and allow them to spend more  time doing what they do best--running their businesses and creating  jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Delgado and Van Duyne for  working in a bipartisan manner to advance this bill to assist small  businesses across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Delgado).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, small employers have  experienced great hardships throughout the pandemic, but today we have  the opportunity to make it easier, not harder, to comply with Federal  regulations.   The ombudsman's centralized website will streamline the compliance  process for small businesses and ensure they have the most accurate and  updated information.   I thank the committee members for their diligence in advancing this  piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'', and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6454) to clarify the primary functions and duties of the  Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6454         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Advocacy       Improvements Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO PRIMARY FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES OF THE                     OFFICE OF ADVOCACY OF THE SMALL BUSINESS                     ADMINISTRATION.         (a) Primary Functions.--Section 202 of Public Law 94-305       (15 U.S.C. 634b) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``and the international       economy'' after ``economy'';        (2) in paragraph (9), by striking ``complete'' and       inserting ``compete''; and        (3) in paragraph (12), by striking ``serviced-disabled''       and inserting ``service-disabled''.        (b) Duties.--Section 203(a) of Public Law 94-305 (15 U.S.C.       634c) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (5), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in paragraph (6), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(7) represent the views and interests of small businesses       before foreign governments and international entities for the       purpose of contributing to regulatory and trade initiatives       which may affect small businesses.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6454, the Small Business  Advocacy Improvements Act of 2022.   Established in 1976, SBA's Office of Advocacy is the independent  voice for small businesses within the Federal Government. The office  oversees the enforcement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and is a  source for statistics and research on matters pertaining to small  businesses. Over the years, the Office of Advocacy's responsibilities  have expanded, and participation in international regulatory  cooperation and trade initiatives that impact small businesses is  becoming increasingly important.   H.R. 6454 makes it clear that the Office of Advocacy has the  authority to examine international economic data and represent small  businesses in international discussions, particularly in trade  negotiations.   I thank the ranking member and Mr. Carter for their bipartisan work  on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, SBA's Office of Advocacy works to ensure that small  business interests are heard at all levels of government because, too  often, their voices are drowned out by larger companies with  sophisticated legal departments and armies of lobbyists.   Now as the world becomes more and more connected, participating in  the global economy is vital to small businesses' success. In order to  do that, they need a strong voice advocating on their behalf. H.R. 6454  will allow the office to advocate on behalf of small businesses in  international discussions, trade negotiations, and examine  international economic data.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.
