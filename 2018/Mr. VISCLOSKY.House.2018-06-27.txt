 Mr. Chair, I simply want to join the chairwoman. She  has correctly pointed out that there is a significant increase in the  bill, but I do support the amendment, as does the chairwoman.   As was pointed out, we do need to act quickly. Most of the 82,000  Americans that remain missing are from World War II, the Korean war,  and Vietnam. With the most recent of those wars ending over 40 years  ago, fewer and fewer immediate families of those missing are still  alive. I do think we should have a sense of urgency.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's amendment, and I appreciate  him yielding.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is correct in his  assertion that his amendment restores the cut made by the committee of  $23.8 million in this program.   Mr. Chairman, I think it is important to point out for my colleagues  that there is a misimpression of our subcommittee that we simply  helter-skelter approve anything that the Department of Defense sends  up, but we try to give discrete decisions to each program and to  rearrange those moneys. There was a cut from the administration's  request, and that money was put into readiness, which is a huge concern  for the Department.   And, historically, on the program that the gentleman references, my  remarks would very much mirror those of the gentlewoman from his last  amendment. Historically, the Air Force, along with the Navy,  overestimates that the cost of the missile just discussed, on average,  the cost has been overestimated by 12 percent.   For the fiscal year 2019 budget submission, the unit cost is 16  percent more than the most recent contract for production. The budget  request for this program has been adjusted for several years now, due  to the overestimates submitted and other factors, such as revisions to  delivery schedules, and a 21-month delay for components.   The committee works with the military services to ensure the program  receives the funding needed to produce this munition, and adjustments  are made. The subcommittee did make an adjustment. I believe it is in  our Nation's interest to leave that $23.8 million in readiness.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I simply close by making the  observation: the gentleman talks about choices. The committee did make  a choice for readiness as opposed to munition, where we have a 21-month  delay in components.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5796]]     Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman for  yielding.   I, too, share her sentiment that we ought to encourage innovation,  but I join her in opposition to the amendment. I am wary of providing  funding for an organization within the department that makes  commitments of almost $1 billion without carefully coordinating some of  these activities within the department, as happened this past year with  a cloud computing contract.   I am also concerned about the fact that the Defense Innovation Unit  has found only a way, basically, to fund innovative activities in  limited areas of the country; that is, the East Coast and the West  Coast, with rarely anything in between.   I also add my concerns that the Defense Innovation Unit relies on  Reserve officers to man their organizations when each of the Reserve  chiefs have advised us that they cannot fill their own ranks.   So I do agree with the gentlewoman and her opposition, and I  appreciate her yielding.                                time  1745     Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  [[Page H5805]]     Mr. Chairman, I yield to my colleague from Illinois  for a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's comments  and acknowledge his expertise as a fellow member of the Nuclear  Security Working Group.   I am grateful that Mr. Foster has raised the important subject of  nuclear smuggling and for his continued commitment to addressing  nuclear security issues. We must be relentless in developing the  technologies that will help us identify and counter nuclear smuggling  before dangerous materials fall into terrorist hands.   The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review acknowledges the importance of  nonproliferation and countering nuclear terrorism. But I do not believe  the document is forward-thinking enough when it comes to developing a  plan to address future threats. We must continue to invest in research  and development of nonproliferation technologies so we will have the  tools that we need to keep our Nation secure in an increasingly complex  nuclear environment.   Again, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's raising it, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                   Amendment No. 25 Offered by Mr. Gallego     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, but I do not plan  to oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I would like to use my time to express a  note of caution to my colleagues. First, I am on record encouraging the  Navy to look into constructing two aircraft carriers simultaneously. I  understand the Navy is in the process of evaluating potential savings  from a two-carrier buy, and I look forward to seeing that report.   Secondly, I support the Navy's fleet. Whatever the correct number may  be in the end, the Navy definitely needs to have more ships to meet its  mission. However, the construction of ships is very expensive. Even  with the potential savings from a two-carrier buy, the expected cost of  those ships would probably exceed $10 billion apiece. We also have a  bulge coming up in the Navy's shipbuilding plan, as construction of the  Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine gets underway.   I am not opposed to increasing the Navy's shipbuilding budget in  future years, but it needs to be done in a manner that is in step with  the industrial base and strategic needs of the whole Department of  Defense.   Unfortunately, this body and the other body did not waive the last 2  years of the Budget Control Act. So I remind my colleagues that it is  terrific talking about building more ships that we don't have the money  for. The fact is, next year, this bill, left uncertain, will have $71  billion less in it, if the restrictions of the Budget Control Act are  not changed.   I also would point out that two of my colleagues, who will very  briefly be offering another amendment, are also cosponsors of an  amendment that we will consider in a few minutes that will cut the  carrier program this year by $49.1 million.   I also would emphasize to my colleagues who think we are not doing  enough that the committee in the bill that is on the floor today has  added $837,330,000 to the shipbuilding program that was recommended by  the administration to be $21,000,871,437. And we have added two  additional warships not requested by the administration.   So to imply somehow that we are weak-kneed and not spending  adequately on building ships in this country is simply not true. I  certainly support the objectives of my colleagues, and that is to look  at an expanding Navy. But we also have to consider where we are from a  budgetary standpoint today and not necessarily vote later to cut the  carrier program in the same year by $49.1 million.   Having said that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. Courtney).    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Chair, may I ask the Chair how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. Courtney).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I would emphasize that I am strongly  opposed to this amendment and join with the chairwoman.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree).    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Diaz-Balart).    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's remarks.   Mr. Chair, I would again emphasize, first of all, that the committee  recognizes the needs of the United States Navy, and in the underlying  legislation we have increased--increased--the administration's request.    Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, we have increased the underlying budget  request by $837 million, and we have added two ships.   The best description for the amendment before us is shortsighted  cannibalism. It eats other important Navy and Air Force programs in  2019 to feed the Virginia-class submarine. In doing so, it creates a  myriad of problems in the out years.   The chairwoman mentioned a number of the programs that were cut in  this proposal. I mentioned one in a previous amendment. I would  emphasize that some of the gross numbers that have been mentioned  include a cut of $10.5 million from weapons procurement from the United  States Navy. It does, I emphasize, cut from carriers $49.1 million. It  takes $20 million from fleet oilers. It takes $26.1 million from our  research and development from the Navy and $262.9 million from the Air  Force.  [[Page H5812]]    This is not new money. This is not free money. We are taking money  from programs that need it in 2019.   Mr. Chair, I would also point out that Mr. Courtney mentioned two  letters that were referenced by the chairwoman. I would also reference  two other letters. The suggestion was made that we hear from the  administration all of the time.                                time  1900    Well, Chairman McCain, in the Senate, on May 30, 2017, heard from  Admiral Richardson relative to the Navy's unfunded priority list for  fiscal year 2018. Admiral Richardson, who is Chief of Naval Operations,  mentioned 38 priority items for the United States Navy. It did not  include this item. It included a request for an additional  $4,796,000,000. It didn't include this item.   Mr. Chairman, I have a letter that was sent to Chairman Frelinghuysen  on February 22 of this year from Admiral Richardson for the Navy's  unfunded priority list for this year, 2019. It includes 25 items. I  have been scanning this with my bifocals, looking for this item of  importance to the United States Navy, and I have not been able to find  it in their request for an additional $1,502,270,000.   The sponsors' claim that this gives the Navy the option to construct  two additional Virginia-class submarines during the next 5-year block  contract, cutting $1 billion for useful programs this year, to give the  Navy an option to do something in 4 years, does not make a bit of sense  to me.   The sponsors say that this amendment sets the Navy up well for a  multiyear procurement agreement, and I might not be able to argue that,  in particular. However, in their quest to set that up, they are, in  fact, damaging the ability of the United States Navy to set up a  multiyear procurement program for the DDG-51 program.   Mr. Chairman, for all of these reasons, I am strongly opposed to this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I simply want to follow the chairman's  remarks, and associate myself with his remarks relative to the staffer  who has been lost.   The chairwoman was kind enough in the general debate to mention the  staff and the Members who have been so instrumental in this work  product, and I would be remiss if I did not conclude by again thanking  the full committee chairman, as well as Mrs. Lowey.   I can't thank Chairwoman Granger enough. This has just been a  pleasant and productive experience, and I appreciate her leadership  very much. I appreciate the work of all of the members of the  subcommittee, as well as all of our staff. That includes our clerks,  Jennifer Miller and Rebecca Leggieri, as well as Walter Hearne, Brooke  Boyer, B.G. Wright, Allison Deters, Collin Lee, Matthew Bower, Jackie  Ripke, Hayden Milberg, Bill Adkins, Sherry Young, Barry Walker,  Jennifer Chartrand, Chris Bigelow, Johnnie Kaberle, Jonathan Fay, Joe  DeVooght, and Christie Cunningham. I can't thank them enough.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
