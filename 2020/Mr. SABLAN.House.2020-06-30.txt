 Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Early  Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education, I want to highlight how  H.R. 2 helps America's schools.   Schools began the coronavirus crisis already in significant need of  repair, but revenue shortfalls caused by the virus are causing local  governments to cut teaching staff. They cannot afford to invest in  facilities. So H.R. 2 includes the Reopen and Rebuild America's Schools  Act, a $100 billion plan of Federal investment from the Education and  Labor Committee.   Funds are front-loaded to address emergency needs to reconfigure  schools to meet CDC guidelines. Our bill also helps the 16 million  students nationwide without online access gain reliable, high-speed  internet for digital instructions. And there is a special $500 million  set aside for insular area schools, which are particularly challenged.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for this time to speak and also  for adding the Marianas to the AMBER Alert system, which I asked for  and is included in H.R. 2.    I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for H.R. 2, and the Reopen and  Rebuild America's Schools Act.
