 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is not working for too many  Americans.   I welcome all efforts to lower costs, to increase choice, and to  protect those with preexisting conditions.   Remember, the very first thing, the very first floor vote we pushed  as Republicans this Congress was to solidify protections for those with  preexisting conditions. It was the first thing we did. We did it right  out of the gate.   While Republicans have stood ready to work on lowering costs and  increasing choices, so far the Democrats, the Democratic majority, have  only tried to double down on the ACA.   On the Energy and Commerce Committee, the only solution we have seen  from Democrats are partisan bills that throw billions of unpaid-for  dollars at a broken system, at a failed experiment.   If my Democratic colleagues were serious about helping patients, they  would work with us on reforms to lower costs and increase choices.                                time  1515    The fact is we could vote on independent legislation that protects  patients with preexisting conditions. The fact is, if my Democratic  colleagues were serious about their concerns over this lawsuit, they  could, legislatively, end this lawsuit once and for all. We could vote  to repeal the individual mandate. That would immediately invalidate the  lawsuit. They could vote to reinstate the individual mandate penalty.  That would also stop the lawsuit in its tracks.   But, instead, we are here to vote on a resolution about politics, not  solutions. It is clear that Democrats would much rather score political  points than to protect the ACA.   They would have surprised me 2 years ago, but now the Democratic  Party seems to have already moved on from the Affordable Care Act.  Instead of truly working on improvements to the ACA, Democrats are  focused on their $32 trillion plan to kick 152 million people off their  insurance for their one-size-fits-all government-run healthcare plan.  [[Page H2966]]    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my Democratic friends to stop the politics  and to work with us to protect those with preexisting conditions, to  lower healthcare costs, and to increase choices for patients.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Richard D. Wesley, who retired from being a Savannah River pilot after  over 40 years of guiding ships to port through the Savannah River.   This expertise cannot be overstated. An incredible asset to our  economy in coastal Georgia, river pilots risk their lives by jumping  onto moving container ships, and then guiding them safely into harbor,  keeping the ship itself, the cargo on board, and the entire area's  economy moving forward.   A graduate of the Maine Maritime Academy in 1976, Mr. Wesley has  piloted over 11,000 ships safely in and out of Savannah River. These  trips included nearly any situation you could imagine; for example,  Coast Guard visits that discovered stowaways, along with previously  undiscovered contraband.   He has also seen the ships change dramatically over his tenure, going  from 460 feet in length to around 1,200 feet in length. But, all of  this accumulated experience over the years enabled him to mentor up- and-coming bar pilots through any situation, and to ensure that they  are also going to have safe careers, which keep the economy of our  State moving.   Thank you for your work, Mr. Wesley, and enjoy your retirement.                            ____________________
