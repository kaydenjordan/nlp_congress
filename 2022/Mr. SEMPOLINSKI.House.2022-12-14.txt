 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of the late Chemung County, New York, legislator Brian J.  Hyland.   Brian was an extraordinary, talented, kind, and interesting man. He  was appointed to the Chemung County Legislature in 2011.   Brian was a dedicated public servant and worked tirelessly to help  his constituents. There was no job too big or too small for Legislator  Hyland.   Brian was also a teacher and mentor at Tioga Tae Kwon Do in Waverly,  New York, where he used more than 60 years in martial arts to teach  hundreds of students how to be the best version of themselves.   He was a businessman, a community leader, and, above all else, a  family man. His wife, Suzanne, was the love of his life. He took  immense pride in his six children, including my legislative director,  Tom Hyland. He cared deeply for his sister and helped all those around  him to succeed.   Brian will be greatly missed by all who knew him.                            ____________________
