 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend, Mr.  Randy Routon, for his nearly 34 years of dedicated service in mental  health as the CEO of LifePath Systems, a mental health provider in  Collin County.   Randy's steadfast leadership helped thousands of families and  individuals throughout our community gain access to life-changing  mental healthcare. Randy's inspiring dedication was also illustrated by  his role on many boards, committees, task forces, and clubs throughout  our community.   I proudly worked with him during my time in the State legislature  toward our shared goal of ensuring everyone in Collin County had a  chance to receive high-quality mental healthcare.   I know Randy looks forward to spending more time with his wife,  Diane, as well their six children and six grandchildren, during his  retirement.   Mr. Speaker, as Randy prepares for his next chapter, I ask my  colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me in thanking  Randy for his selfless and dedicated career of serving those around  him.                            ____________________
