 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an individual  from Muncie, Indiana, who has made her community and State proud.   Lizzi Smith, a Paralympic athlete who competed in the 2016 Paralympic  Games, is now working toward her goal of swimming in the 2020  Paralympic Games in Tokyo.   Lizzi has already accomplished so much in her swimming career. She  helped Muncie Central High School win a sectional in high school. She  won two world medals at the age of 17, and she came away from the 2016  Paralympics with two medals. Just this year, Lizzi set the Pan American  record in the S10 100-meter butterfly.   I thank Lizzi for inspiring us to dream big and for setting a strong  example for young Hoosiers and all Americans. I wish her the best of  luck on the road to Tokyo.   Bring home the gold.                            ____________________
