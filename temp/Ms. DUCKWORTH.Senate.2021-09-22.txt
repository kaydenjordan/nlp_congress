 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the  remarkable life of Officer Christopher  [[Page S6620]]  Neil Oberheim, a 20-year veteran of the Illinois police force who was  fatally shot on May 19, 2021, while serving in the line of duty.  Officer Oberheim started his remarkable career at the Decatur Police  Department before transferring to the Champaign Police Department in  2008.   Throughout his years of protecting and serving, Officer Oberheim  earned two medals of valor and countless letters of commendation for  his courageous acts of selfless bravery. He will be remembered by his  colleagues as a model officer and someone who looked forward to making  memories with his fellow officers at the annual State softball  tournament hosted by the Police Benevolent and Protective Association  of Illinois.   Officer Oberheim was not only a dedicated law enforcement officer,  but also a devoted father and citizen who was loved and respected in  his community. Officer Oberheim invested a great deal of time off duty  to coaching several successful girls' softball teams, and the  Monticello Sages Softball team paid tribute to his legacy as a coach  and mentor: ``Chris Oberheim was the ultimate girl dad and was so proud  of his girls. He has given so much to the program and we are blessed to  have known him.''   Officer Oberheim was tragically killed in the line of duty while  fulfilling his oath to serve and protect the people of the city of  Champaign, and I am grateful for his years of service. He leaves behind  his wife Amber and their 4 daughters Hannah, Avery, Addison, and  Aubree. May his service, sacrifice, and kind spirit serve as an  inspiration to us all.                            ____________________
