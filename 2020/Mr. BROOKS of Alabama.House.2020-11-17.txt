 Mr. Speaker, this is the first in a series of  House floor speeches by me on the recent Presidential election.   Some believe the Supreme Court decides who wins Presidential  elections. That is wrong. While the Supreme Court has a significant  judicial role in the Presidential election process, the United States  Constitution and Federal law make Congress, not the Supreme Court, the  judge of who wins Presidential elections.   Congress must first accept or reject State submissions of electoral  college votes. Thereafter, if no candidate wins an electoral college  vote majority, Congress, not the Supreme Court, votes on and elects the  next President and Vice President of the United States.   The Constitution's 12th Amendment requires States to submit their  electoral college votes to Congress, thereby triggering United States  Code title 3, section 15, which requires that:   First, Congress shall meet January 6 following the election at 1 p.m.  to receive States' electoral college vote submissions.   Second, the Senate President presides over all proceedings.   Third, each State's electoral college submissions shall be opened,  presented, and acted upon in alphabetical order, beginning with the  letter A.   Fourth, the Senate President shall receive and publicly announce each  State's electoral college vote.   Fifth, the Senate President shall call for objections, if any.  Objections must be in writing and clearly and concisely state, without  argument, the objection grounds. Further, each objection must be signed  by at least one Senator and one Congressman or be disallowed.   Sixth, the Senate and House shall then separate, and each body shall  then decide whether to accept or reject electoral college votes that  have been properly objected to.   Finally, if the House and Senate both vote to reject a State's  electoral college vote submission, those electoral college votes shall  not be counted in the election of the President and Vice President.   United States Code title 3, section 17, adds that the Senate and  House votes to accept or reject electoral college votes must occur  immediately after no more than 2 hours of floor debate.   This process has been used in the past to challenge States' electoral  college votes.   For example, in 2005, Democrat Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones  and Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer jointly objected to acceptance of  Ohio's electoral college votes for Republican President George Bush  after Ohio election officials certified that George Bush won Ohio by  almost 120,000 votes.   Similarly, in 2017, numerous Democrat Congressmen objected to all the  electoral college votes for Republican Presidential candidate Donald J.  Trump from the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Texas,  North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.  These objections failed for lack of a Senate cosponsor.   In sum, the United States Constitution and Federal law mandate that,  on January 6, 2021, Congress must decide whether to accept or reject  States' submissions of electoral college votes for President.   If a Congressman and Senator jointly object, then the full House and  full Senate must each vote on whether to accept or reject a State's  electoral college vote submission. That vote by Congress is final,  determinative, and nonreviewable. If a State's electoral college votes  are rejected, then those electoral college votes are excluded from  candidate totals.   My second speech in this series covers what happens if, because of  rejected electoral college votes, neither candidate has the majority of  electoral college votes needed to be elected President of the United  States.                            ____________________
