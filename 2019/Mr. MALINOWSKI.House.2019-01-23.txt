 Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce the  Transportation Funding Fairness Act and to express my hope that, after  we have come to our senses and reopened the government, this year  Congress will come together to fund the bridges, tunnels, railroads,  airports, and roads that we all understand America needs to prosper and  grow.   In the first decade of the 20th century, commuters in New Jersey  towns like Summit, Union, and Westfield could hop on a steam-powered  train, ride right up to a terminal on the dock in Jersey City, change  seamlessly to a ferry, and be in Manhattan within 50 minutes to an  hour, if there wasn't too much fog or ice on the Hudson River.   A hundred years of magical, technological progress later, and we have  managed to shave that trip by maybe a few minutes, if the trains are  running on time that day.   Decades of underinvestment in public infrastructure have taken its  toll on American greatness. Anyone who has traveled the world and has  seen the modern airports and seaports and fast rail networks that our  competitors are building would understand that.   Just in the last 2 months, as we have not even been able to open our  government, the Chinese Government has been busy approving over $125  billion in new rail projects--$125 billion.   No State suffers more from our lack of attention to infrastructure  than New Jersey, where twice as many people use public transportation  than the national average. To get to and from New York, 200,000 of us a  day still depend on just two rail tracks across the Portal Bridge and  through a Hudson River tunnel that our great-grandparents built in 1910  because they thought those 50-minute, turn-of-the-century commute times  were unacceptably long.   When the Portal Bridge opens to let boats pass today, a worker with a  hammer must sometimes lock it back into place while stranded commuters  wait, and that Hudson River tunnel has just a few years of life left.  If we fail to replace it in time, we will be dealing a crippling blow  to the economy of our region and our country.   That is why it is so urgent and important that we get the Gateway  Tunnel project built.   Madam Speaker, in New Jersey, when we say we want to build bridges,  not walls, that is not just a metaphor. We mean it literally. The $5.7  billion that would be wasted to wall off America from Mexico happens to  be almost exactly the Federal share of building a new Hudson River  tunnel that would keep Americans connected to each other and,  ultimately, to the world.   These are the real choices that we face. Is there any doubt what the  voters who sent us here would have us choose: building something that  millions of people living in my State and neighboring States say they  desperately need, or something people living on the border say they do  not need? A symbol of national progress, or a symbol of national fear?  Is there any question at all?   That is one reason why I am introducing this bipartisan bill today,  which is meant to clear one of the artificial obstacles the Department  of Transportation has placed in the path of the Gateway Tunnel.   The Department has argued that when States take advantage of Federal  transportation loans to pay some of their share of projects jointly  funded by the Federal Government, like Gateway, those loans don't count  as part of the State contribution to the project.   It makes no sense. State taxpayers, after all, are 100 percent  obligated to pay back those loans. It is like saying that I am not  actually paying for my house because I have taken out a mortgage.   Our bill makes crystal clear that States can use Federal loans to  cover all or part of their share of these projects.   Speaking of taxpayers, Madam Speaker, I represent a State where we  get only 74 cents back from Washington for every dollar we pay in  taxes. That is the worst ratio in the country. The average American  gets $1.12 back for every dollar he or she pays, courtesy of the  Federal deficit.   What we ask, with strong justification, is that Washington give a bit  more back in the form of investment in the infrastructure that powers  States like New Jersey and, in turn, enables us to power the American  economy.   I hope we will make progress on that this year and that this bill  will make the task a little bit easier                            ____________________
