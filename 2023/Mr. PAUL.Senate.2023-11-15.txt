 Mr. President, to continue spending money at the current  levels will inevitably lead to the bankruptcy of our great Nation. My  amendment, in order to stave off such a terrible fiscal outcome, would  cut approximately 1 percent of our budgetary spending and help to put  us on the path toward fiscal responsibility.   In June of this year, the national debt surpassed $32 trillion. Then,  in September, the national debt surpassed $33 trillion. You heard that  right. It took Congress 90 short days to add $1 trillion in debt.  Unless we change course, the debt will consume us.   America's future as a nation is not threatened from without but from  within. Our mounting debt will ultimately force a day of reckoning. The  Congressional Budget Office predicts that we will add an average of $2  trillion in debt every year for the next decade. Using Congressional  Budget Office projections, the U.S. Government will add over $5 billion  to its debt pile every single day for the next 10 years.   We borrow over $176 million every hour. We borrow $3 million every  minute, and we borrow $50,000 every second. It is only a matter of time  before the world wakes up and refuses to buy our debt.   This reckless level of borrowing and spending is patently  unsustainable. The ever-increasing heights of our debt mean a weak  economy, high inflation, and confiscatory tax rates. In other words,  today's spending threatens tomorrow's prosperity.   According to William McBride of the Tax Foundation, ``outside of the  pandemic years, this year's federal deficit is the highest in U.S.  history.''   McBride continues:         Figures from the Congressional Budget Office for fiscal       year 2023 indicate that the federal deficit grew by about $2       trillion.    McBride also states that ``while tax revenue has increased 28 percent  since the prepandemic year of 2019, spending has increased about 46  percent and the deficit has more than doubled. Annual deficits are  headed toward [even] $3 trillion'' a year if we don't wake up and do  something about it.   McBride concludes:         In sum, the federal budget continues on a perilous course.       . . . Now would be a good time for our political leaders to       present a coherent plan for dealing with the debt problem       before it becomes an urgent crisis.   [[Page S5528]]     That is why I am here on the floor today. Americans are starved for a  voice of fiscal sanity. Americans understand far better than the  Nation's elites that time is running out. Americans will pay dearly for  Congress's inability to say no to every cause, every line item, every  pinstripe lobbyist. We will pay more to Uncle Sam in the form of taxes.  We will pay more for groceries because of high levels of inflation that  will destroy our purchasing power. And we will find a generation of  kids who won't leave their parents' homes because businesses cannot  afford to hire them.   It doesn't have to be this way. America can once again be a rising  nation, and we can take that first step toward a brighter future today.  My amendment will make across-the-board reductions except for defense  and veterans' benefits. Additionally, the amendment would cut $30  billion from the Biden administration's attempt to sic the IRS on  American taxpayers to squeeze even more money out of those who earned  their hard-earned dollars.   All told, my amendment would save taxpayers $60 billion, which is  only about 1 percent of all budgetary spending. It is a small and  modest reduction in spending, but it is a step in the right direction.   This is not the first time I have offered an amendment to save the  taxpayers money. Throughout my time in the Senate, I have, time and  time again, offered balanced budgets and plans that would shave  pennies--mere pennies--from every budgetary program to restore our  fiscal health, and, every time, these proposals are rejected by the  Senate. The result of failing to act then is that, today, we now vote  in the shadow of a mountain of debt.   It is time that we rise up. Rise up and tell your Members of Congress  that enough is enough. It is time to take a stand while the restoration  of American prosperity is still within our grasp. By the time this  continuing resolution expires, the people who ask for your vote next  year will have added another $1 trillion to the debt. It is time to  take a stand.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment and call up amendment No. 1366  and ask that it be reported by number.    Madam President, I yield back my time, and I call for the  yeas and nays.
