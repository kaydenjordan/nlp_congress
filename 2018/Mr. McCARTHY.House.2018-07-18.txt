 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, last week, Democrats introduced a bill to abolish ICE.  That is the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. In doing so, I  think we should first review the agency's record.   As it turns out, ICE agents are on the front lines in the battle  against crime.   In 2016, they arrested nearly 2,000 human traffickers, criminals who  are involved in modern-day slavery. You wanted to abolish that.   Last year, they arrested more than 4,800 gang members, including more  than 800 members of the MS-13, one of the most vicious gangs operating  today. But you wanted to abolish that and put it into our communities.   They intercepted more than 1 ton of fentanyl that was headed for our  communities. Now, we all should know what fentanyl will do, because we  just debated more than 50-some bills on this floor, because 172 people  who are Americans will die today because of an addiction. Fentanyl is  so deadly that just a few grams will kill you. But you wanted to  abolish that, to allow it into our communities.   Still, the Democrats say, not only will they want to introduce it,  people will cosponsor it. But there is a problem, and I actually think  there are two problems with this.   The first problem is that most Americans disagree with you. They  actually support ICE. According to a recent poll, just one in four  Americans thinks we should abolish it.   The second problem is that Democrats don't even agree with their own  bill they introduced. They lack the courage of their so-called  convictions, because when we offered the ability to bring up the bill,  abolish ICE, that they put into the hopper and cosponsored, Democrats  said they would vote ``no.''   They wanted the glory of introducing a bill to the far left of their  own party, but they didn't have the guts to accept the consequences.  That is the kind of leadership that the Democrats have to offer.                                time  1445    Mr. Speaker, I am even more confused listening to the Democratic  leadership. I was here. I was on the floor. I listened, Mr. Speaker, to  the leader on the Democratic side when she said: I recommend voting  ``no,'' or maybe vote ``present,'' or vote however you want.   I am not sure what position she was requesting when she said all  three. And I am not sure exactly what the author wanted to do when he  put his bill across the aisle and asked the other Members of his own  conference to cosponsor it, when he said he would vote ``no,'' when he  had the offer to bring it up on the floor. Does that mean that every  bill Democrats put across they really don't want to support? I am just  not sure.   Now, we are about to vote on a resolution of the opposite. We want to  support the law enforcement officers of  [[Page H6493]]  ICE and will renounce the activist campaign against them.   The danger these officers face is no joke. So for those in the back  who would like to speak, Mr. Speaker, during this, I would ask that  they get quiet for one moment, because six officers of ICE lost their  lives defending those.   The danger to these officers is real, and it is not a joke. Six  officers have died in the line of duty:   Special Agent Brian Beliso;   Special Agent Timothy Ensley;   Special Agent Lorenzo Gomez;   Special Agent Scott McGuire;   Special Agent David Wilhelm; and   Special Agent Jaime Zapata, who was killed by cartel hitmen in  Mexico.   These agents gave their lives in the line of duty. Thousands more of  these agents risk their lives every day on our behalf.   I want you to pause for one moment and I want you to think about  those agents, think about those families, but think about those  thousands of agents who are defending our border. What do they think  about a bill that comes across the desk that says you want to abolish  them? How much support do you want to give them? How much support do  they feel when the leadership, Mr. Speaker, of the Democratic Party  says: Vote ``no,'' vote ``present,'' just vote how you want?   Well, do you know what? When they risk their lives and they stop  another human trafficker of modern-day slavery and they save another  child, I will vote to support them. Or when they stop an amount of  drugs coming across and they save American lives, I will support them.  Or when they stop MS-13 gang members from coming into any of our  communities, I will support them. If only for this reason, agents  deserve our gratitude and support.   Mr. Speaker, I am confused. I understand there is this growing  socialist movement in the Democratic Party, but when does this  socialist new Democratic Party believe we should have no borders? I  guess it is today.   Mr. Speaker, that is not what the Americans have asked for, and that  is not what America supports. But then again, Mr. Speaker, I am not  sure I understand what the other side supports when they offer a bill  and they ask people to cosponsor and then they won't even vote for it.   That is why I am happy to offer Congressman Higgins' resolution and  stand with the women and men of ICE, because I want a safer America.  And for those who gave their life for us, I will stand with them, even  if it means standing up against a new socialist Democratic Party.
