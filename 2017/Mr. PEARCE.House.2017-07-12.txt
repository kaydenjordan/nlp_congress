 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:        Page 131, beginning on line 5, strike ``Such term shall       include water rights for federally recognized Indian       Tribes''.        Page 131, beginning on line 19, strike ``(including any       federally recognized Indian Tribe)''.        Page 134, strike lines 7 through 9 and insert the       following:        (f) Indian Water Rights.--Nothing in this title shall have       any effect on tribal water rights or their adjudication, or       the protection, settlement, or enforcement and/or       administration of such rights by either Indian tribes or the       United States as trustee for Indian tribes.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman  from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico.    Mr. Chairman, water is life. We understand that in the  West maybe more than anywhere else in the world. So any time we are  talking about water, we are talking about life, we are talking about  the ability to have an economy, we are talking about jobs, we are  talking about communities. It affects us deeply in the West.   When the original bill, H.R. 23, was being marked up, my friend, the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres), brought a concern to the  members of the committee, saying that she felt like the underlying bill  did not adequately address Tribal water rights.   Tribes are some of the areas of deepest poverty in the country. As  she brought that up, it struck my attention that we should take a look  at it.   Ultimately, her amendment failed in committee, but the two of us,  with the chairman and the sponsor of the bill, huddled after the  committee meeting and decided that we should move forward with our  concerns. Those concerns are reflected in this amendment today.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Torres), to speak about this issue.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton).   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will suspend.   For what purpose does the gentleman from Colorado seek recognition?    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Mexico has 2 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Huffman).    Mr. Chair, Tribes in New Mexico and across the West  depend on water for agriculture, they depend on it for their families,  they depend on it for spiritual reasons. Without rights, water can be  taken by anyone.   The amendment that Mrs. Torres and I put forward is just trying to  say that rights are personal. They are private property rights, and no  government can take them away. It is a reasonable amendment.   I appreciate the gentleman from Colorado's observations. We will  attempt to see that those observations are dealt with in a meaningful  way. In the meantime, I simply ask Members of the House to join with me  in voting for this amendment to H.R. 23.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce).   The amendment was agreed to.                                time  1830                  Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. DeSaulnier    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, the unfinished  business is the demand for a recorded vote on amendment No. 5 printed  in part C of House Report 115-212 offered by the gentleman from  California (Mr. DeSaulnier) on which further proceedings were postponed  and on which the noes prevailed by voice vote.   The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.   The Clerk redesignated the amendment.                                Recorded Vote    The Acting CHAIR. A recorded vote has been demanded.

Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Carter of Georgia) having assumed the chair, Mr. Simpson, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 23)  to provide drought relief in the State of California, and for other  purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 431, he reported the bill  back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the  Whole.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is  ordered.   Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment  reported from the Committee of the Whole?   If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a  substitute, as amended.   The amendment was agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit
