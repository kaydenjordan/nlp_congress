 Madam Speaker, I stand before you today  to recognize the men and women who have served our country valiantly.   This Saturday, November 11, we will celebrate Veterans Day. I would  take this time to honor the men and women who have served in the Army,  Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Space Force, National Guard, as  well as the Reserves.   I would also recognize the more than 800,000 veterans from my home  State of Pennsylvania.   We owe a sincere debt of gratitude to all those who have served. Your  sacrifice, dedication, and courage are the reasons we are able to live  our lives in safety and freedom today.   Words cannot describe the level of respect and admiration we have for  all of our Nation's heroes. On behalf of a grateful Nation, I thank  them for their service.   God bless the military. God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
