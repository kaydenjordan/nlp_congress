 Madam President, the Senator from New York is my friend,  and we have worked together on a number of occasions, but I must  disagree with a number of things he said today.   First of all, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was a partisan  creation by Democrats during the Obama administration that had  virtually no Republican support. What they did is that they created a  modern-day emperor, somebody immune from congressional oversight and  the appropriations process. Now that Mr. Cordray is leaving, following  the election of a Republican President, they are taking exception to  the fact that this President has the authority under the law to appoint  his successor. Instead, they are insisting that somebody chosen by Mr.  Cordray--this modern-day financial emperor--should be able to make a  choice and foist that on this administration when, clearly, this  administration was elected to office in part in response to the  overreach of the previous Obama administration.   This is a perfect example of how nimble my colleague can be with the  facts. The fact is that he comes here and complains about the fact that  this tax bill we will be taking up is not partisan enough for him, when  Senate Democrats have made it clear that they don't want to do anything  that would give any credit to this administration or the Republican  majority.   Rather than taking the opportunity to find common ground and govern,  they, essentially, have taken up the resistance, leaving the results of  the election last November basically unresolved, in their minds, at  least, even though the American people have clearly moved on and expect  this administration, which was elected to office, along with a  Republican majority in the House and the Senate, to actually govern.   I remember days and times when, after we had elections, we actually  figured out that we needed to govern and weren't focused then on the  next campaign. Apparently, our colleagues across the aisle have simply  forgotten that. That is the bad news. The good news is that it is not  too late for them to change their ways and join us and bring historic  tax reform to the American people.   This week, we will be considering the Senate's version--voted out of  the Senate Finance Committee last Thursday night--of our Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act, which is the first major overall of our Nation's Tax Code in  more than 30 years. It cuts tax rates across the board, reducing the  burden on American job creators and middle-class families alike.   Under our proposal, it has been estimated that folks back in my home  State of Texas will see more than 76,000 new jobs created. After-tax  income for middle-class families should rise by nearly $2,600. Now,  that may be chump change here inside the beltway; our friends across  the aisle may turn their nose up and say: Who would want to do this for  $2,600 additional tax savings. But I can tell you, my 28 million  constituents in Texas don't believe that $2,600 in tax savings for a  family of four is chump change. They think of that as ways to increase  their take-home pay, improve their standard of living, prepare for  retirement, and help their children go to college. That is what that  means to them.   This bill will also reduce the tax burden on small businesses and put  American companies on a level playing field with their foreign  competitors, ultimately growing our economy here at home.   Ironically, we heard some of the same old tired rhetoric in the  Finance Committee, where we were talking about corporate giveaways and  things like that, only to remind our colleagues on the Senate Finance  Committee that they themselves had proposed similar tax cuts for  American businesses so they could get more competitive in an  international global economy. We had to remind them, after they derided  this idea that we would want to be more competitive in the global  economy, that it was Barack Obama, in 2011, who called for Democrats  and Republicans to come together to cut the corporate tax rate because  it was the highest one in the world and it was causing businesses to  invest abroad--indeed, to leave the United States to set up their  headquarters abroad just to avoid the highest tax rate in the civilized  world.   There has been a lot of disinformation and misinformation out there,  which I would like to take the opportunity to correct on a couple of  accounts.   One major reform we have included in the latest version of our tax  reform bill is the repeal of ObamaCare's individual mandate. Make no  mistake, the individual mandate penalty is literally a tax on low- income Americans. It is a tax because Chief Justice Roberts and the  U.S. Supreme Court called it a tax.   Democrats have made two arguments: first, that repealing this mandate  is a tax increase. Only in the parallel universe known as Washington,  DC, would cutting the tax be called a tax increase. Second, they said  the repeal kicks people off their insurance coverage, which is  demonstrably not true.    But let's start with the first argument, that the repeal somehow  represents a tax increase on the poor. It is a pretty strange thing to  say that eliminating a financial obligation simultaneously entails an  additional fiscal burden; in other words, that a tax cut is really a  tax increase. Only here in the parallel universe of Washington, DC,  could that possibly be true. It defies all logic.   What actually happens under our plan is that certain low-income  individuals do get a tax cut. If they voluntarily decide not to buy  ObamaCare coverage, they will receive an additional tax cut because  they will no longer be penalized by their own government for failing to  buy an insurance policy they can't afford. It is worth noting that, in  2015, 80 percent of people paying the ObamaCare individual mandate tax  made less than $50,000 each year. Eighty percent made less than  $50,000.   There were 6.7 million people in 2015 alone that paid this additional  tax mandate because they couldn't afford to purchase the government- mandated coverage. If the mandate is repealed, these folks would have  more money to spend, and they will benefit from income tax rate  reductions in addition. If our colleagues across the aisle would work  with us, these same people would find more affordable coverage that  suited their needs rather than have to buy a one-size-fits-all policy  that prices them out of the market. But that is another story.   The second ridiculous argument is one you may recall the minority  leader saying shortly before Thanksgiving. He made the statement that  we are kicking 13 million people off of their health insurance. But  that is just not true, and it doesn't tell the whole story.   First of all, no one is being kicked off of their health insurance  coverage. Instead, people will no longer be fined by their own  government for not buying government-approved health insurance. That is  based on the correct view that people shouldn't be coerced by their  very own government to buy something they may not want and can't  afford. Like I said, in a more rational world, Democrats and  Republicans would work together to come up with an alternative that  would provide people with more choices at a better price.   Democrats might say: Well, what about premiums? Will they not rise if  the mandate is eliminated and people drop out of the market because of  this problem? This is one of the problems created by the Affordable  Care Act at its very beginning. But the issue of rising premiums is  significant. A recent proposal offered by the senior Senator from  Maine, Ms. Collins, along with Senators Alexander and Murray, would  attempt to stabilize the health insurance marketplace. It would reduce  the risk for insurance companies by providing funds to insurers for  high-risk enrollees. Their bipartisan stabilization proposal would  appropriate money for something called cost-sharing reduction  subsidies, and these payments could provide short-term certainty to  insurers and prevent premiums from rising. In fact, premiums would go  down. It has been scored by  [[Page S7323]]  the Congressional Budget Office as reducing the deficit by $3.8 billion  over the next 10 years. That is why this proposal deserves our serious  consideration, and I hope we will turn to it following our debate and  vote on the Senate's tax reform bill.   Apart from the repeal of the mandate, there are other parts of the  plan I would like to highlight. One involves another popular myth that  certain provisions of our proposal are just disguised corporate  welfare. I alluded a minute ago to the hypocrisy of some of our  Democratic colleagues, claiming that this is corporate welfare or a  giveaway, when they themselves supported a similar provision in  previous proposals. This claim is completely and deliberately  misleading. As the Wall Street Journal pointed out last week, the irony  is that this bill would do more to stop corporate tax gaming than  anything done by the Obama administration during the previous 8 years.   First, if we cut corporate taxes, the incentive for companies to game  the system and move capital, income, and intellectual property abroad  is reduced. The bill institutes a territorial system that also includes  so-called base erosion rules. These are safeguards against abuse that  prevent companies from shifting domestic income through foreign  affiliates to lower tax jurisdictions and then bringing the profits  home without paying taxes.   Our Senate bill would impose an effective 10 percent rate on  intangible property of U.S. multinationals held overseas. That is on a  one-time basis. In return, companies would be able to repatriate their  future income from those places tax-free. In other words, they would be  taxed once rather than twice. This lower rate will help to prevent the  erosion of our corporate tax base and so will other provisions  regarding patents and intellectual property, which will prevent the  flight of intellectual property abroad and will entice foreign  companies to move their patents to the United States, along with the  associated economic activity and jobs. In sum, as I said earlier, this  bill changes incentives, making it less likely that businesses will try  to game the system and move capital to foreign, lower tax  jurisdictions.   We need to look at this proposal as a whole--not just one provision  in isolation--because you can't judge the merit of the plan without  considering it as a whole.   Two days ago, we got a letter from nine world-class experts on tax  policy and economics. They sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steve  Mnuchin. In that letter, they praised the plan's objectives to enhance  the prospects of both increased economic growth and household incomes-- more take-home pay. Not only that, but they said that, based on their  analysis, our plan is likely to achieve those objectives, too. The  signatories include a former Treasury Secretary, as well as a former  Director of the Congressional Budget Office and distinguished  economists from Harvard, Columbia, and Stanford. I think that all agree  with the bottom line, which is that the Senate bill cuts taxes for  every income group and that it will increase economic growth and keep  jobs and American companies here at home, all while making America more  competitive.   Those who argue otherwise, I think, are resigned to the status quo,  which is a stagnant economy characterized by slow growth and wages that  will never rise. That is what we have had for the last 11 years. Under  no circumstances should we stand by idly and permit it to continue.   Historically, the United States has seen growth of the economy hover  around 3 percent since World War II, but right now it is roughly 1.9  percent. What that slow economic growth means is fewer jobs, lower  wages, and less competitiveness for the United States in the global  economy. If we get back to 3 percent growth or higher, we can begin to  solve multiple problems at once. For example, we can do something about  our lackluster defense spending.   It is something the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,  Senator McCain, and others--including people like me and the Presiding  Officer--care an awful lot about. We have simply tried again and again  to cash the peace dividend when there is no peace, when, in the words  of Gen. James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence, he  said: The array of threats is more profound than he has seen in 50  years in the intelligence service of the United States. We can't spend  the amount of money we need to keep America safe to fight our Nation's  wars and to defend our shores at home unless we meet that need. We  can't do it when our economy doesn't grow. Not only will economic  opportunities increase for Americans of all stripes, we will also have  additional revenue to address our national debt.   If we can get our economy growing again, we can actually pay down  that debt, but this debt is not a product of tax cuts and defense  spending, as some would lead you to believe. It is a symptom of our  inability to pass entitlement reform. In other words, we have a  spending problem; we don't have an inadequate taxing problem.   Indeed, during the 8 years of the Obama administration, when the  national debt doubled, I didn't hear one peep out of our colleagues  across the aisle on the national debt. It is refreshing to hear that  they are concerned about that, once again, but we have a partial answer  to that, which is getting the economy growing again so the Treasury  will increase its returns, and we can begin to pay down some of those  deficits and debt.   To regain our standing in the world, we need to get our financial  house in order. The first step is to pass this tax reform package,  which will show our seriousness and determination in jump-starting our  economy as a way to address our fiscal challenges.   I hope our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in  supporting the Senate's version of this bill because America's future  prosperity partially depends on our ability to get this done. What kind  of country do we want? Do we want one that is vibrant and dynamic and  full of energy or do we want one that simply putters along? A lot is on  the line this week as we debate and vote on the Senate's tax reform  bill.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record the letter I referred to from nine prominent economists, which  was published on November 26 in the Wall Street Journal, called: ``How  Tax Reform Will Lift the Economy.''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    How Tax Reform Will Lift the Economy  [Editor's note: The following is a Nov. 25 letter to Treasury Secretary                              Steven Mnuchin]         Dear Mr. Secretary:        The present debate over tax reforms proposed by President       Trump's administration and embodied in bills that have passed       the House of Representatives and the Senate Finance Committee       has raised the basic question of whether the bills are ``pro-      growth'': Would the proposals raise current and future       economic activity and generate federal tax revenue that would       reduce the ``static cost'' of the reforms? This letter       explains why we believe that the answer to these questions is       ``yes.''        Economists generally think of fundamental tax reform as a       set of tax changes that reduces tax distortions on productive       activities (for example, business investment and work) and       broadens the tax base to reduce tax differences among       similarly situated businesses and individuals. Fundamental       tax reform should also advance the objectives of fairness and       simplification.        The quest for such fundamental tax reform has been pursued       by policy makers and economists for decades. Examples include       the Tax Reform Act of 1986, proposals for reducing the double       taxation of corporate equity by the Treasury Department and       the American Law Institute (enacted in part in 2003), the       ``Growth and Investment Plan'' from President George W.       Bush's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, and arguments       from President Obama's administration to lower corporate tax       rates. The proposals emerging from the House, Senate, and       President Trump's administration, fall squarely within this       tradition.      Reducing Corporate Tax Rates, as Proposed, Will Increase Economic                                  Activity         While the overall House and Senate tax plans contain       numerous household and business provisions, we focus on the       corporate tax changes, returning to other provisions before       concluding. A key concept in this context is the ``user cost       of capital,'' which essentially measures the expected cost to       firms of making additional investments in equipment. A       considerable body of economic research concludes that       reductions in the user cost of capital raise output in the       short and long run. Several of the proposals that have       emerged in the current debate are key to lowering the user       cost of capital. For example, expensing, which allows firms       to deduct the full cost of investment at the time it is made,       lowers the user cost of capital relative to depreciation over       time. A lower corporate tax rate also lowers the user cost of  [[Page S7324]]       capital, which not only induces U.S. firms to invest more,       but also makes it more attractive for both U.S. and foreign       multinational corporations to locate investment in the United       States.        There is some uncertainty about just how much additional       investment is induced by reductions in the cost of capital,       but based on an extensive body of scholarly research, many       economists believe that a 10% reduction in the cost of       capital would lead to a 10% increase in the amount of       investment. Simultaneously reducing the corporate tax rate to       20% and moving to immediate expensing of equipment and       intangible investment would reduce the user cost by an       average of 15%, which would increase the demand for capital       by 15%. A conventional approach to economic modeling suggests       that such an increase in the capital stock would raise the       level of GDP in the long run by just over 4%. If achieved       over a decade, the associated increase in the annual rate of       GDP growth would be about 0.4% per year. Because the House       and Senate bills contemplate expensing only for five years,       the increase in capital accumulation would be less, and the       gain in the long-run level of GDP would be just over 3%, or       0.3% per year for a decade.        Is this estimate of the growth effect realistic? According       to one leading model using an alternative framework, the       proposal would increase the U.S. capital stock by between 12%       and 19%, which would raise the level of GDP in the long run       by between 3% and 5%. Yet another model, this one used in the       analysis of the ``Growth and Investment Plan'' in the 2005       President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, found that       a business cash-flow tax with expensing and a corporate tax       rate of 30% would yield a 20.4% increase in the capital stock       in the long run and a 4.8% increase in GDP in the long run.       More conservative estimates from the OECD suggest that       corporate tax changes alone would raise long-run GDP by 2%.       In short, there is a substantial body of research suggesting       that fundamental tax reform of the type being proposed would       have an important effect on long-run GDP. We view long-run       effects of about 3% assuming five years of full expensing,       and 4% assuming permanent full expensing, as reasonable       estimates.        Another advantage of the corporate rate reduction embodied       in the House and Senate Finance bills is that it would lead       both U.S. and foreign firms to invest more in the United       States. In addition, U.S. multinational firms would face a       reduced incentive to shift profits abroad, which would raise       federal revenue, all else equal.        In the foregoing analysis, we assumed a revenue-neutral       corporate tax change. Deficit financing of part of a       reduction in taxes increases federal debt and interest rates,       all else equal. For the House and Senate Finance bills, this       offset is likely to be modest, given that the United States       operates in an international capital market, which means that       the impact of changes in interest rates resulting from       greater investment demand and government borrowing are likely       to be relatively small.    Lowering Individual Tax Rates Also Offers Generally Positive Economic                                  Effects         The House and Senate bills also contemplate a number of       individual tax provisions that can affect economic activity       and incomes. In recognition of the fact that non-corporate       business income is substantial in the United States, both       bills would reduce taxation of non-corporate business income       and increase the amount of capital expensing allowed. While       difficult to quantify, as the bills specify different       effective tax rates, these provisions would increase       investment and GDP above the level associated with the       corporate tax changes discussed above. Also on the individual       side, both the House and Senate bills reduce marginal tax       rates on labor income for most taxpayers, increasing the       reward for work. Increases in labor supply, in turn, increase       taxable income and tax revenues. One should note, however,       that some taxpayers would face increases in effective       marginal tax rates because of base-broadening features of the       bills, such as limits on the federal tax deductibility of       state and local income taxes. On balance, though, we believe       that the individual tax base broadening embodied in the       proposals would enhance economic efficiency by confronting       most households with lower marginal tax rates. In addition,       fairness would be served by reducing differences in the tax       treatment of individuals with similar incomes, and       simplification by reducing the number of individuals who       itemize for federal tax purposes.     Confirming a Pro-Growth Objective Is Important for the Path Forward         You have consistently stressed that the objective of tax       reform should be to enhance prospects for increased economic       growth and household incomes. We agree with this objective,       which is consistent with the traditional norms of public       finance going back to Adam Smith. We believe that the reforms       embodied in the House and Senate Finance bills would achieve       this objective. The increased growth, in turn, would lead to       greater taxable income and federal tax revenues, which would       reduce the static cost of lost federal tax revenue from the       reform.        We hope these analytical points of support for the growth       effects of tax plans being discussed are useful to you and to       the Congress as you complete the important economic task of       fundamental tax reform. We would be happy to discuss our       conclusions with you at your convenience.        Robert J. Barro, Paul M. Warburg Professor of Economics,       Harvard University        Michael J.
