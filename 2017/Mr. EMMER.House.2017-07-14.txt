 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern) for yielding. I appreciate the opportunity to work with him  on this issue.   During my time in Congress, I have been privileged to meet with many  of our Nation's veterans. The men and women in our Armed Forces are  true heroes and truly the best our Nation has to offer. Yet far too  often, they do not get the recognition and credit they deserve. This is  especially true when it comes to our Nation's atomic veterans.   From 1945 to 1962, nearly a quarter of a million of our  servicemembers played a role in the testing of nuclear weapons, earning  them the title, ``atomic veterans.''                                time  0930    Since 1990, our Federal Government has taken different approaches to  try and recognize and thank our atomic veterans, but we have never  given official recognition through an award or medal. Today, that will  change with the support of the men and women in this Chamber.   With the McGovern-Emmer amendment, we have an opportunity to finally  acknowledge the incredible sacrifice these courageous individuals made  more than half a century ago. Our amendment will require the Department  of Defense to issue a service medal to the veterans or surviving  families of those members of our Armed Forces who participated in  aboveground nuclear weapons testing, were part of the U.S. military  occupation forces in or around Hiroshima and Nagasaki before 1946, or  were held as POWs in or near Hiroshima or Nagasaki.   This amendment has been included in the House NDAA bill for the past  2 years and is supported by the National Association of Atomic  Veterans. These veterans left their homes, left their families, and put  their lives on the line to protect the freedoms and liberties we enjoy  each and every day.   I am honored to work with Mr. McGovern and our colleagues here in the  House to ensure these brave soldiers get the recognition they deserve.   Again, I want to thank Congressman McGovern for his efforts on this  issue as well as to thank Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith,  and the entire staff of the House Armed Services Committee for their  work on the underlying bill, and I urge adoption of this amendment.
