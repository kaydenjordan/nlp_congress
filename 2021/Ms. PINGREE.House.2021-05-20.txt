 Madam Speaker, I thank the chair of the full  Appropriations Committee, who has done an incredible job pulling all of  these challenging issues together and putting this funding bill on the  floor today.   The activities of January 6 were terrifying, whether you were sitting  here in this Chamber or whether you were watching from anywhere around  this country or around the world, viewing a violent assault on our  democracy.   Thanks to the work of the Capitol Police and others in law  enforcement, the loss of lives was so much less than they could have  been. But as we all know, very tragically there were losses of life in  our Capitol Police. Our police were brutally beaten, and we could watch  it all happen.   That is why I rise today in support of this emergency security  supplemental appropriations bill. The bill is the product of months of  careful and deliberate analysis of the resource needs to enhance the  security at the Capitol.   I am privileged to be the chair of the Appropriations Committee's  Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. I strongly  support the funding this bill would provide to the National Park  Service. Large-scale special events and demonstrations are a common  occurrence in the District of Columbia, and they often move from the  National Mall to the Capitol complex. U.S. Park Police and Capitol  Police work closely to share information and law enforcement resources  to handle these events.                                time  0945    The funds provided in this bill would be used to backfill the Park  Service's resources that were unexpectedly depleted during the January  6 attack and to prepare the agency for possible future threats.   I believe that it is critical that Congress provide sufficient  resources to meet the security challenges, and I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.
