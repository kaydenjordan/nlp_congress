 Madam President, on January 20 of this year, change is  coming to the White House. But until that day, it appears that  President Obama will desperately cling to the status quo and continue  to do what he has done on far too many occasions: abuse his Executive  powers to put in place unpopular policies without the cooperation of  Congress and then pretend as if everyone somehow supports him.   The most recent case in point involves President Obama's recent  decision to designate as a new national monument some 1.35 million  acres of public land in San Juan County, UT--the poorest county in the  State of Utah, nearly the size of Delaware. This is a small county that  is tucked into the southeast corner of our State. It includes--and the  national monument is named after--the region's distinctive Bears Ears  buttes, which mark the ancestral homeland and sacred site of many  members of the Navajo and Ute Tribes who live in San Juan County, UT.   President Obama announced the Bears Ears National Monument on  December 28, right between Christmas and New Year's Eve, as most  Americans were busy enjoying the holiday season and when he was still  enjoying time with his family in Hawaii. That same day, his  administration released an explanatory document that was officially  christened a ``Fact Sheet.'' It was christened that way by the White  House officials who wrote it. But, in reality, it reads much more like  an elaborate book of fiction.   Of all the falsehoods peddled in this bogus fact sheet, the most  egregious--and, in many ways, the most insulting--is the claim that the  residents in San Juan County, including local members of the Navajo  Nation and members of the Ute Tribe, supported the President's decision  to turn Bears Ears into a national monument.   The document says:         The creation of the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah [.       . .] follow[s] years of robust public input from tribes,       local elected officials, and diverse stakeholders, and draws       from legislation introduced in Congress. In addition to       protecting more land and water than any administration in       history--    And here is the kicker--         President Obama has taken unprecedented steps to elevate       the voices of Native peoples in the management of our       national resources.    ``Unprecedented steps to elevate the voices of Native peoples.''  Nothing could be further from the truth in this situation. Perhaps if  we replace the word ``elevate'' with the word ``exploit,'' that  sentence might apply to the situation in Bears Ears.   Now, there is no denying that many Native American people supported  President Obama's designation of the Bears Ears National Monument. But  the inconvenient truth too often ignored by the Obama administration  and its supporters is that virtually all of this tribal support came  from Native Americans residing outside of Utah, not inside Utah, and  certainly not within San Juan County where this 1.35 million-acre  designation occurred.   In fact, the most prominent Native American group that advocated for  a national monument in Utah is actually an alliance called the Bears  Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, which is made up of several tribes, and  most of its members reside outside of the State of Utah.   Yet, national monument advocates routinely invoke the Inter-Tribal  Coalition as the authoritative mouthpiece of all Native Americans in  the Southwestern United States.   So how did a coalition of Native American tribes from Colorado,  Arizona, and New Mexico rise to such a position of prominence in a  debate over a national monument in a remote corner of Utah? Well, part  of the answer can be found in the cozy relationships between well- funded environmental advocacy groups, powerful outdoor retail  companies, and tribal organizations.   Recent investigative reporting by the Deseret News shows how radical  wealthy environmental organizations, supported by the outdoor  recreational industry, channeled millions of dollars to the Bears Ears  Inter-Tribal Coalition only after they realized that ``hitching [their]  success'' to the Navajo Nation was the only way they could achieve  their longstanding goal of creating a national monument in Southeastern  Utah.   The ability of uber-rich environmentalists to essentially buy a  national monument in Bears Ears explains why the people of San Juan  County--including the Navajo residents, whose lives and livelihoods are  intricately linked to the Bears Ears Utes--stand united in opposition  to a monument designation.   For the people of the Navajo Nation who live in San Juan County,  taking care of their ancestral land--protecting and preserving it for  the next generation--isn't optional, it is a sacred duty. It is part of  their faith. It is part of who they are.   The same is true in many respects in my own faith. As a member of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I share many of these  views. My church teaches that the Earth is a divine creation that  belongs to God. This means that human beings have a spiritual  responsibility--an obligation to God--to be wise stewards over the  Earth, to conserve it for our children and our grandchildren.   The Navajo people of San Juan County have always faithfully fulfilled  their responsibility in the Bears Ears region, and so have the Utes who  reside in the area. Caring for their homelands--and respecting it as  their forefathers did--is the cultural lifeblood of the Native American  people of Southeastern Utah. Take away their access to their land-- restrict their stewardship over the Earth's bounty for the sake of  increasing the access of wealthy urbanites who use the outdoors for  their own purposes--and it won't be long before their culture begins to  fade away.   The people of San Juan County understand this. They have seen their  worst nightmares become reality in other Utah counties as a result of  Presidential national monument designations. That is why on December  29, the day after President Obama announced the Bears Ears monument, a  crowd of Utahns assembled to hold a protest on the steps of the San  Juan County Courthouse.   Braving the frigid weather of that day, they gathered together to  demonstrate that they--the individuals and the families who will be  most directly affected by a Bears Ears national monument--believe that  the President has no business seizing vast stretches of land to be  micromanaged and mismanaged by distant Federal land agencies.   But the protesters weren't just angry. They were resolute, confident  about the future, and determined to keep fighting for their right to  participate in the management of the land in their community--the land  that most directly affects them.   Of course, environmentalists and national monument advocates want the  people of San Juan County to believe that this fight is simply over,  that they have lost, that there is nothing they can do about something  that affects them in a very real, very personal, very intimate way. In  their view, President Obama's proclamation of the Bears Ears National  Monument is permanent. It is irreversible, as if it were carved into  stone. As one White House official recently told the Washington Post:  ``We do not see that the Trump administration has authority to undo  this.''   But they say this only because they are not looking hard enough. The  truth is what can be done through unilateral  [[Page S103]]  Executive action can also be undone the same way. Such is the  impermanence of Executive power in our constitutional republic, where  major policy changes require broad consensus, forged through  legislative compromise, to endure the test of time.   In a recent Wall Street Journal article, two prominent constitutional  scholars, Todd Gaziano and John Yoo, explain this point as it relates  specifically to President Obama's use of the Antiquities Act to  designate the Bears Ears National Monument. The Antiquities Act of  1906, as they explain, does not create an irreversible monument. When a  President uses it, its use is not necessarily indelible.   Gaziano and Yoo write:         After studying the President's legal authority [under the       Antiquities Act], we conclude that he can rescind monument       designations [. . .] the law's text and original purposes       strongly support a president's ability to unilaterally       correct his predecessor's abuses.    In other words, starting on January 20, President-Elect Trump can use  his Executive powers to rescind President Obama's designation of the  Bears Ears National Monument. I have asked the future Trump  administration to do precisely that.   I have also recently cosponsored Senator Murkowski's bill, the  Improved National Monument Designation Process Act, which would require  all future Presidents to obtain congressional and State approval prior  to designating a national monument. I have done these things, and I  will do more, because I believe the preponderance of evidence proves  that President Obama abused his powers--the powers granted to him under  the Antiquities Act--in designating the Bears Ears National Monument.   This isn't just my opinion. It is the opinion of most of my fellow  Utahns, including those patriots who assembled on the county courthouse  steps in the rural town of Monticello on December 29.   These are the people who were ignored by the Obama administration.  These are the people who were cut out of the decisionmaking process  that produced this particular national monument designation. These are  the voices that were stifled by the wealthy, out-of-State, well- connected environmental groups that spent millions of dollars to lock  up our land for their exclusive use.   So it is fitting to let one of them--one of the residents of San Juan  County--have the last word today. I think Suzy Johnson put it best when  she said:         Mr. Obama, you have failed the grassroots natives. A true       leader listens and finds common ground. The fight for our       land is not over. Your name will blow away in the wind.    I yield the floor.
