 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 40th  anniversary of Focus on the Family, a vital American institution  dedicated to preserving one of the country's most foundational pillars:  the family.   While I cannot attend today's celebration in person, I am grateful  that my good friend, Vice President Mike Pence, is in Colorado Springs  to mark this wonderful occasion.   It would be impossible to fully quantify the impact Focus on the  Family has had in our own Nation and across the world. Thousands of  marriages have been revived, children have been lovingly discipled, and  families have been reunited and strengthened.   Perhaps most important are the 382,000 lives saved through Focus on  the Family's Option Ultrasound program, which helps mothers choose life  when faced with unexpected pregnancies.   Those 382,000 lives and, indeed, our entire Nation owe you a debt of  gratitude. So to founder Dr. James Dobson, Jim Daly, and the staff of  Focus on the Family, I say, ``Well, done,'' and offer you my sincere  congratulations.                            ____________________
