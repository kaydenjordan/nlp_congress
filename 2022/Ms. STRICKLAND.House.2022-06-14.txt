 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  service of Sylvia Sass, an extraordinary public servant and community  leader in the State of Washington.   Sylvia was a vital player in the early development of the Sister  Cities International organization. She was even appointed Washington  State coordinator due to her work in helping President Dwight  Eisenhower rebuild international ties, and she was selected as a  delegate to have lunch with him.   In 2017, Sylvia received the Sister Cities International Lifetime  Achievement Award, and to this day she remains an active and honorary  board member of the organization. Sylvia Sass is known as the first  lady of Sister Cities International.   Mr. Speaker, Sylvia exemplifies hard work, perseverance, and selfless  service to others. I am proud to call her my friend, and I offer these  remarks in her honor.                            ____________________
