 Mr. Speaker, like the rest of my colleagues, we go  home on the weekends when we are not voting. When we are not voting  during the week, we are in our districts. It is wonderful to get around  and visit with our bosses.   I was in Bridgewater in Adair County on Monday. It is a lovely town.  They are strong people with a lot of grit and a lot of love and  compassion. But in a way, I wish I hadn't been in Bridgewater that day,  because we were having an opioid roundtable.   The addiction to opioids has really taken a toll on this community,  but the people of Bridgewater are strong. ``Take back Bridgewater'' is  their mantra. Taking back Bridgewater and all of our communities is a  must.   I am so glad to be working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to address this issue in a bipartisan way. It is about the human  condition, the human spirit, caring for one another, and taking care of  those we represent.   God bless my colleagues, the people in Bridgewater, and all the  people in America who have suffered under these addictions. We are  going to come together, and I am glad we can address them.                            ____________________
