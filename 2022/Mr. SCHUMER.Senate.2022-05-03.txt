 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this is a dark and disturbing morning for  America. Last night, a report disclosed that a conservative majority of  the United States Supreme Court is ready to overturn Roe v. Wade and  uproot decades of precedent affirming a woman's right to an abortion.  If this report is accurate, the Supreme Court is poised to inflict the  greatest restriction of rights in the past 50 years--not just on women,  but on all Americans.   Under this decision, our children will have less rights than their  parents. The Republican-appointed Justices' reported votes to overturn  Roe v. Wade will go down as an abomination--one of the worst, most  damaging decisions in modern history.   Several of these conservative Justices, who are in no way accountable  to the American people, have lied to the U.S. Senate, ripped up the  Constitution, and defiled both precedence and the Supreme Court's  reputation, all at the expense of tens of millions of women who could  soon be stripped of their bodily autonomy and the constitutional rights  they have relied on for over half a century.   The party of Lincoln and Eisenhower has now completely devolved into  the Party of Trump.   Every Republican Senator who supported Senator McConnell and voted  for Trump Justices, pretending that this day would never come, will now  have to explain themselves to the American people.   I will have more to say later this morning, but I want to make three  things clear.   First, now that the Court is poised to strike down Roe, it is my  intention for the Senate to hold a vote on legislation to codify the  right to an abortion in law.   Second, a vote on this legislation is not an abstract exercise. This  is as urgent and real as it gets. We will vote to protect a woman's  right to choose, and every American is going to see which side every  Senator stands. Every American is going to see on which side every  Senator stands.   Third, to the American people, I say this: The elections this  November will have consequences because the rights of 100 million women  are now on the ballot.   To help fight this Court's awful decision, I urge every American to  make their voices heard this week and this year.   I urge Americans to call their Members, to write their Members, to  email their Members, to text their Members, and most of all, to cast  their ballots.   Make no mistake, the blame for this decision falls squarely on  Republican Senators and the Senate Republicans  [[Page S2254]]  as a whole, who spent years pushing extremist judges and spent years  confirming far-right Justices to the Supreme Court but who claimed,  somehow, this day would never come.   But this day has come, and we will fight it all the way.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate resume  legislative session, and the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of Calendar No. 360, S.J. Res. 39, with the time until  4:45 p.m. equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or  their designees, and that at 4:45 p.m., the joint resolution be read a  third time, and that the Senate vote on passage of the joint  resolution, with no intervening action or debate. Further, that upon  disposition of the joint resolution, the Senate resume executive  session.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a  [[Page S2270]]  period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein  for up to 10 minutes each.
