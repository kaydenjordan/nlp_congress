 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 221 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 221         Resolved, That the requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII       for a two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee       on Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is       waived with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of March 27, 2017.        Sec. 2.  It shall be in order at any time through the       calendar day of March 26, 2017, for the Speaker to entertain       motions that the House suspend the rules as though under       clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or his designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or her designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1  hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my dear friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met for some 13 hours,  maybe a little bit more, where we were tasked with the opportunity to  bring forth from the Republican Conference the new bill that is to  replace the Affordable Care Act. That discussion involved us taking  testimony from the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Kevin  Brady; the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Greg Walden;  and the chairman of the Budget Committee, Mrs. Black. It also involved  three other ranking members for those committees. They assembled up in  the Rules Committee.   We had a very vigorous and open debate about the bill, about the  effects of the bill, about the things which were occurring within the  Republican majority dealing with the United States Senate and dealing  with the President of the United States. All three are necessary to  agree upon a bill if we are to sign it into law.   There was a vigorous demand from Democrats to know more information,  and I believe I forthrightly attempted to answer those questions. We  did not have all the pieces of the puzzle together. We recognized that  by the evening hour. So by 11 p.m. last night, upon my consultation  with Ranking Member McGovern, I made a decision that we would not stay  up during the evening, we would ask that we would come back today. So  we did not actually complete our work last night.   I am here today because last night the Rules Committee issued a rule  that would be a same-day rule. The issues really don't change. The  facts of the case really don't change. Information is necessary for us  to make an informed decision. That is a change.   I have told the gentleman, Mr. McGovern. I have told the gentlewoman,  the former Speaker, the leader of the Democrat Party, Ms. Pelosi. I  have told Mr. Hoyer in a direct dialogue that we had that I would do my  best to make sure that we answer the questions that would be necessary.  The gentleman, Mr. McGovern, who very ably represents his party,  understood that I did not have all the answers that I needed.   So we are here today with the opportunity to say we are going to do a  same-day rule. We are going to try to pass this rule. We are going to  try to explain what we are doing. We are going to allow my team, our  Republican Conference, to get back together today because they, too,  want to know what is the final deal.   That is what my conference is doing right now. They are in this  building, several hundred Members of Congress, talking, debating,  understanding, listening, compromising, yes, on a way that we can  approach a chance to change what we see as one of the most devastating  pieces of legislation to the economy, to the healthcare system, and,  quite honestly, to the standing of America as the greatest country in  the world. We think we have to make changes.   But today we are here right now to say that we don't have all those  answers. A complete agreement was not available by the time I chose to  end the matter last night in the Rules Committee. So rather than  staying up all night, we are here today. We will be back here today.  This is not the debate about the bill. More information is needed. An  agreement is needed from my party. And when we reach that agreement, I  will then come back.   But make no mistake about it, Mr. Speaker, my party intends to bring  forth an agreed-to bill that we will be able to show to the American  people, and we will own it. We are very capable of saying that we  believe that market forces, we believe that free right of individuals,  we believe that free physicians and opportunities exist and abound, and  we will bring that to the floor, and we will openly debate it.   Much is being said about a Congressional Budget Office report that  has caused much fear. Unrightly? No, I can't say that. But it is  certainly explainable.   Mr. Speaker, I will start right now. The bottom line is that there  are some 30 million people who are uninsured in the United States of  America, 30 million people who did not find a home or chose not to take  a government-provided available system that is called the Affordable  Care Act. Even more people included within that are paying a penalty of  several thousand dollars rather than taking that healthcare system,  that availability. So we believe the right thing to do is not to force  anybody, not to have mandates, not to penalize people, but, rather, to  make available to them opportunities where it is their decision about  what they would do.   The corresponding facts of the case are real simple. The  Congressional Budget Office said: Fine, if you don't force people to do  it, then some 24 million people won't do it within the next 7 years.  [[Page H2354]]    Well, there are 30 million people today that do not have it and not  taking it. So to go from 30 million to 24 million will be a very  interesting task for us to understand.   Mr. Speaker, no freedom is free. But if we engage in telling the  American people that Washington, D.C., knows better than they do, then  that is a false promise--is a false promise that our friends, the  Democrats, tried and actually failed at.   So Republicans, in order to put together their plan--yes, even with  the consequences of a ``CBO report that say there will be 24 million  people who are uninsured,'' that is probably right, because they chose  not to accept what would be an equal opportunity for them to take what  might be called a tax credit that equals some $8,000 for a family of  four, allowing them straight up to purchase their own health care for  their family. But if they choose not to do it, that is their business.   Mr. Speaker, one of my attributes is I come from Dallas, Texas. And  Dallas, Texas, for all the great things that we have about us, we think  that some of the great things come from the way we believe. We deeply  believe we are in some ways a very open city. We have many different  thought processes, many people, but we respect each other and don't try  to tell each other what to do. It creates a flourishing environment  about ourselves where, when we get in trouble, we stick together; when  we see trouble, we ban together. But we tend not to tell each other  what to do in our own lives. That is one thing that I think makes us a  little bit different. We do not count on government to do the things  that we should do for ourselves.    That is part of the freedom model that I buy off on and part of what  we are offering--the Republican Party--today for the American people  rather than mandates, dictates, fines, the IRS and all sorts of other  government organizations that we could throw in a person's way simply  to tell them what to do. We reject that notion. We will, as quickly as  possible, bring about a bill that we can explain, that we will own, and  that we will pass.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sessions), my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, we aren't here to debate the government healthcare  repeal plan. We aren't here to debate that because Republican  leadership and the White House are huddled behind closed doors as we  speak, making deals that will have very real, very serious, very  dangerous consequences for millions of Americans.   Instead, we are here to debate a martial law rule that will allow  Republicans to rush their bill with its brand-new backroom deals to the  floor today without any proper deliberation. As a matter of fact, it  would let them rush any bill to the floor today, or any day through  Monday.   It is a blanket martial law rule that lasts past the weekend--not  specific to their healthcare bill, and not even specific to the topic  of health care.   What other bills could they be contemplating considering?   We saw the Buffalo bribe is already in the manager's amendment, but  this rule lets them bring up any other bill before the public has a  chance to even know what it is. Maybe something on the Russia  investigation, perhaps? I have seen a lot of news on that lately. Or  maybe we will give President Trump's friend Putin a Congressional Gold  Medal. It is the least the Republicans could do after his help with the  election.   But let's talk about what we have learned so far in the press. We  first learned from news reports last night that Republicans were  considering changes to the bill that would kill the essential health  benefits in current law. Now, let me say that again. Essential, as in  ``absolutely necessary; extremely important,'' as defined by the  dictionary.   And, sure enough, we reported out this martial law rule in the dark  of night, which will allow Republicans to bring the new and unimproved  version of the bill--again, now with even more backroom deals--to the  Rules Committee later today, or in the dead of night, and take it  straight to the floor. Apparently, there is no time to even have it sit  for 1 day so that Members can read it, let alone get analysis from the  nonpartisan experts at CBO.   Are they hoping that if they move quickly enough, no one will figure  out what they are up to?   Well, let me lay it out for everybody. Essential health benefits  require insurance plans to cover basic essential benefits, such as  emergency services, maternity care, mental health care and substance  abuse treatment, pediatric services, and prescription drugs.   Now, The New York Times this morning pointed out that this late- breaking Republican proposal could lead to plans that cover  aromatherapy, but not chemotherapy.   I mean, really? Are Republicans seriously contemplating making a  change this massive without hearings? Without a markup? No CBO estimate  of the impact? No chance to read the bill?   I have seen a lot in my years here, but this is truly unbelievable.  You guys take my breath away.                                time  0930    That is not even considering the already dangerous bill we were  supposed to be down here considering right now. Let me just make it  clear what that bill actually is.   First, it is a massive tax cut for millionaires and billionaires,  paid for by taking health insurance away from 24 million people,  period. Anyone who takes 5 minutes to look at any unbiased analysis of  the bill knows that this is true: massive tax cuts for the well-off at  the expense of 24 million people.   Now, let me paint a picture of how big that number is:   Twenty-four million people is basically the entire population of the  country of Australia.   It is more people than live in the States of Kansas, New Mexico,  Nebraska, West Virginia, Idaho, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode  Island, Montana, Delaware, South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska, Vermont,  Wyoming, and the District of Columbia, combined.   You know how I know this bill is a tax giveaway for the wealthy, and  it is not a healthcare bill? Because, according to the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office--and this is truly incredible--it would  actually result in more people uninsured than if the Affordable Care  Act were simply repealed. Let that sink in for a minute.   Second, their bill would cause people to pay more in terms of out-of- pocket expenses, and in return, they will get lower quality health  insurance. That is right. Republicans are asking people to pay more for  less coverage. In particular, lower income and older Americans will see  their costs skyrocket--those people who can least afford to pay more.   Third point, and this is a big one, the bill guts Medicaid and  Medicare. Now, don't take it from me. The AARP said: ``This bill would  weaken Medicare's fiscal sustainability, dramatically increase  healthcare costs for Americans aged 50 to 64, and put at risk the  health care of millions of children and adults with disabilities, and  poor seniors who depend on the Medicaid program for long-term services  and supports and other benefits.'' That is the AARP.   In fact, Americans aged 50 to 64 will pay premiums five times higher  than what others pay for health coverage no matter how healthy they  are. This bill is an age tax, plain and simple, and Republicans are  cutting $880 billion from Medicaid. That is a 25 percent cut in  funding.   All this to give tax cuts to the rich and to corporations. The bill  must look like a cruel joke to the most vulnerable among us.   Representative Mo Brooks, a member of the Republican Conference said  just the other night: ``Quite frankly, I'm persuaded that this  Republican healthcare bill . . . long-term, is a detriment to the  future of the United States of America.''   Finally, even before imposing martial law last night, this process  was horrendous. The Republican majority rushed their bill through the  committee process without any hearings--none, zero--just holding  marathon markups where no Democratic amendments were accepted--none,  not one. They didn't even wait for a CBO score.  [[Page H2355]]    Then, when the score finally came, it showed that the bill would kick  24 million people off their insurance. Did they stop then? No, of  course not.   Yesterday, in the Rules Committee, we rushed ahead with a cobbled- together manager's amendment--I am sorry, four cobbled-together  manager's amendments since the originals had errors and, again, no CBO  score on the updated bill.   Didn't my colleagues learn their lesson from last week?   And even worse, the main manager's amendment, which we received just  36 hours before our meeting, is so full of backroom deals, as I  mentioned, like the Buffalo bribe, a cynical--likely unconstitutional-- agreement with wavering New York Republicans who know the Republican  healthcare plan would devastate New York.   And now they are saying: Don't worry. If you don't like this bill, it  is just step one of three. You will get another chance to vote on  health care during step three. Never mind that they can't give us the  full slate of bills that are part of this mysterious step three.   Or maybe I should just take Republican Senator Cotton's word for it.  He said: ``There is no three-step plan. That is just political talk.  It's just politicians engaging in spin.''   Republican Ted Cruz from my colleague's State of Texas called the  third prong of this three-bucket strategy ``the sucker's bucket.'' The  sucker's bucket--that is your own Member calling you a sucker if you  vote for this.   We heard testimony all day yesterday and well into the night about  how disastrous this bill would be for hardworking Americans. We heard  about how countless major health organizations oppose this plan, from  the American Medical Association to the American Hospital Association,  to the National Rural Health Association, to the AARP, to the American  Society of Addiction Medicine, to the National Alliance on Mental  Illness, and I could go on and on and on and on.   This reverse Robin Hood will steal from the working class and give to  the wealthy. Under the Republican plan, $2.8 billion in tax breaks will  go to the 400 richest families in America each year. My colleagues on  the other side of the aisle seem to be rushing this through in hopes  that no one will figure out that it is a tax break for the rich  masquerading as a healthcare bill.   Now we find ourselves on the floor debating a martial law rule that  will take that reckless process from light speed to warp speed. Let me  just remind my colleagues again that we are talking about people's  lives here. I am pretty sure the middle class Americans, whom  Republicans claim to be helping would be okay with delaying this  reckless bill for a little while to give us a chance to find out what  the impacts will be.   Mr. Speaker, this process is beyond the pale. I am honestly still  stunned that we are even here debating a martial law rule on  legislation of this magnitude when changes to people's basic, essential  health benefits are being contemplated without so much as a single  hearing, let alone a CBO score. And again, we have no real clue what  Republicans will be bringing to the floor later today.    I am just going off what I read in the news since we haven't gotten  any actual updates from the other side of the aisle, but this rule  would allow them to bring anything to the floor today or tomorrow or  Saturday or Sunday or Monday--literally anything.   Will there be a new bill? Who knows.   Will it even be on health care? Beats me.   What mysterious changes are they contemplating that are so broad they  can't even narrow their martial law authority down to the topic of  health care?   Please, please, I would ask my colleagues to slow down. Be  thoughtful. This is not a game. You don't get extra points for being  fast. This healthcare repeal affects millions upon millions upon  millions of Americans.   Don't jam a disastrous bill through the House with patched-up fixes.  Wait for a revised CBO score. Listen to what members of your own  Conference are saying. Or better yet, don't do this at all. Let's go  back to the drawing board.   It is clear Republicans never really had a plan to replace the  Affordable Care Act. Don't pretend you did and then make our most  vulnerable pay the consequences.   This is a sad day. This is a sad day for this institution, but it is  even a sadder day for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the chance for us to be here today means that a lot of  people are going to have a lot of opinions, and I appreciate the  gentleman having an opinion. He knows what we are doing. So do the  American people.   The American people are watching TV, and they are seeing where  Republicans are huddling together and pushing this activity of health  care, debating ideas right, really, before the American people, really,  hundreds of TV shows.   I have been on 15 or 20 myself where I am saying that the Republican  replacement or repeal of ObamaCare is something we are taking our time  to discuss. We are taking our time to make sure our colleagues  understand it. We are taking time to be thoughtful. Otherwise, we would  have just rushed it through.   In fact, we took some 13 hours last night, yesterday, at the Rules  Committee to do exactly that. Ms. Pelosi spent 3 hours before the Rules  Committee, essentially talking about things that--we see things  differently. She thinks she sees things differently than we do, and  that is okay. It gave her a chance to have a debate opportunity. This  is what this is all about. It does not bother me at all.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, we want Members to have a chance to have  their thoughts and ideas on the record, to take their time to be  thoughtful about what we are doing. And it does matter.   Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Collinsville, Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), a gentleman whom I came to  Congress with in the 105th Congress. The gentleman is from the 15th  District of Illinois and served our country as a veteran. He was a West  Point graduate, and he is a really good guy.   (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am delighted that the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Lowey) came down. She, not unlike many of those in her party, are  intensely interested in making sure that the American people are going  to get the opportunity to have something that I have always said is  equal to or better than.   The bottom line is that families on ObamaCare, or the Affordable Care  Act, today--and that includes almost every single Member of Congress,  including myself and my family--did not get what we were told would  happen. Much of the Affordable Care Act was not even decided and  developed until after the bill was put together, and we knew that ahead  of time. They told us it is going to take a couple of years for us to  put this together. Right now, here, today, only about 24 out of 100  physicians across this country even accept ObamaCare.   The Republican plan is not simple, but it is easy to understand, and  that is this: We allow every single person to stay on ObamaCare 2017,  2018, and 2019. That is undeniably in the bill, and they know that.   We are allowing every single American that does not, today, receive  the tax benefit, the benefit that goes back to World War II, an untaxed  benefit by employers--we are allowing every single American family to  be able to receive a tax credit. You cannot use both. You cannot  double-dip into another system. But we are allowing every single one of  those families that, today, was completely excluded or chose not to  take ObamaCare to receive a tax credit.   That tax credit for families is important because, today, they are  paying after-tax dollars if they choose to get health care. And  tomorrow what we will do is allow up to $8,000 for a family of four-- that is $8,000 for a tax credit for a family--effective in November of  a year to be able to, before they purchase their health care in  January, to designate the first $8,000 to the healthcare plan of their  choice. Well, that obviously doesn't fly well either because the  Democrats want to tell people what they have to have.   Most families don't need many things that are covered. Why should  they pay for that? Oh, because the Democratic Party, Washington, D.C.,  says you have to. These are essential items.   No, no, no. A family will be able to make their own decisions and not  pay for what they don't need.   So, Mr. Speaker, there always are at least two sides of the story.  And it is true that what the Republican Party is going to do is allow  people to make their own choice, but to give them the tools necessary.  And if a family decides to do that, then they can; if they decide not  to, they don't have to. Just like what is happening today where people  are required to get health care but 30 million people are uninsured,  figure that one out, Mr. Speaker.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) says the Republican bill is  simple and easy to understand. My question is: Where the hell is it?  Maybe it is under the table. We haven't seen it.   Every time we get the bill, it changes. So maybe they ought to start  with giving us the bill so people know what the bill would do.   Mr. Speaker, I want to point out to my colleagues, this is a new  analysis from the Tax Policy Center and the Urban Institute's Healthy  Policy Center that shows just how dramatically these tax cuts benefit  the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and working class  families. This bill really is a giveaway to the rich. This chart  clearly illustrates that disparity.   The rich would benefit greatly from the tax cuts in the bill, with a  family making more than $200,000 receiving a $5,680 tax cut, and a  family making more than a million dollars a year getting a $51,410  break on their taxes. That is too high to even fit on the chart.  Meanwhile, families making less than $50,000 will be paying the price.   This bill really is a massive giveaway to the well-off and to the  wealthy. This  [[Page H2357]]  is going to hurt the middle class. This is not what the American people  want.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We have at least two different sides up here, and people are entitled  to believe whatever they want to believe. I am entitled to the same  opinion of myself, also.   There are also a set of answers and facts that need to be given,  evidently, and that is, in fact, we do make changes in the bill to  ObamaCare. We do.   Mr. Speaker, the law, the way it was written, we have virtually few  30-year-olds to 45-year-olds that actually pay for ObamaCare, the  people we were told who needed it the most. The reason why is because  it was dictated from Washington how to rate the coverage. In rating  that coverage, it became so illogically expensive for a young person to  pay an astronomical amount for their insurance, and even many times a  higher value for their deductible, to where 30-year-olds, 35-year-olds,  36-year-olds, 37-year-olds chose simply not to take the policy offered.   So what do Republicans do? It is real simple. Here is what  Republicans do: They allow the States the flexibility to determine what  might be called a rating.   And it is true that, now, people will be rated based upon their own  actuarial experience of where they are in life, their age. Mr. Speaker,  it is true that a 25-year-old, 30-year-old, 35-year-old needs less  necessary intricate and expensive health care. And it is actuarially  true that the older that we get--I celebrated my birthday yesterday. I  get it. I am getting older, and I probably am a little more expensive  at the doctor in things that I need, especially into my future.   So what we did is we said where you have that rating system, we will  allow more money through the tax credit system to adjust that so that a  50- to 64-year-old will not be at a disadvantage because those, too,  are the people we want in the healthcare plan.   So we are actually going to add, by making it actuarially sound and  attractive, a whole bunch of younger people; and we are going to  recognize this balance, and we are going to provide more of an  incentive to balance out for those who are older. That makes sense.   It is also reality based, Mr. Speaker. But to say that someone is  going to be paying more without us recognizing that and doing something  about it would not be a fair argument.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1000    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   What a shame the gentleman was not here to vote for the Affordable  Care Act when it took hold several years ago, and he would have known  this is a bad deal.   Mr. Speaker, even the American people cannot be fooled. The American  people saw ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, waste billions of  dollars simply to try and put together a computer system.   Mr. Speaker, the American people understand it was a tax bill. It is  about using the IRS, and they were going to add 17,000 employees,  literally, to beat the brains out of the American people to force them  into having health care from Washington.   Mr. Speaker, no wonder Republicans won the majority several years  ago. No wonder Republicans have saved the American people not only from  the IRS, but from the massive taxes that were embedded within this huge  government takeover of our healthcare system.   The bottom line is that my colleagues have not yet met a tax they  wouldn't be for. They have not yet built and grown these massive  government organizations to the tune that they want to force the  American people to do things. And they are having a difficult time  understanding today why the American people--if given a choice and an  opportunity and an advantage that would be fair for all Americans to  have a tax credit, why that is something that people really want to  see.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Trump may or may not have contemplated every single  part of the healthcare issue, but I will tell you what he did  understand. And that is, draining the swamp from a system that takes  away your freedom, that saps the economic growth and vitality of this  country, and that empowers the Internal Revenue Service is a bad idea.   Mr. Speaker, having to qualify by going through the IRS to look at  your records first to determine whether you qualify for a subsidy  should be an embarrassment, and it was seen that way by the American  people. Mr. Speaker, to guess at how much money and work you would have  during the year, and then if you are wrong, pay up, was a system that  did not work because many physicians across this country and many  hospitals simply do not take ObamaCare. They are acting like it was a  gift from God.   Mr. Speaker, it did not work, and it does not work. The Republican  Party is going to find a way, and we are going to get our act together,  and we are  [[Page H2358]]  going to gleefully go and do the right thing. It is a process, Mr.  Speaker. It is a long process. It actually does take the House, the  Senate, and the President, and we are going to get our job done.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 10  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 3 minutes remaining.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me just say that I feel bad for the  gentleman from Texas for having to defend this lousy rule and this  lousy bill all by himself. We have so many speakers here, we don't have  enough time to accommodate them all.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McNerney).   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, since the ACA was enacted, California's  uninsured rate has dropped by 54 percent. Over 263,000 people have  gained coverage in the three counties in my district. But now my  Republican colleagues want us to pass a replacement bill that will  strip away health care for 24 million Americans.   TrumpCare guts the Medicare program and creates a new, pre-broken  system that rations health care for more than 76 million Americans. In  my district alone, more than 64,000 people will lose coverage because  of the provisions of the Republican replacement bill. It will take  money away from our hospitals and eliminate 4,000 jobs in San Joaquin  County alone. Working and middle class families will be forced to pay  more for less. This will increase healthcare costs and decrease the  quality of coverage available. Americans deserve access to quality  healthcare coverage and health care that they can afford.   I ask my Republican colleagues to withdraw this terrible bill and  work across the aisle, for once, to improve the ACA that benefits all  Americans. I strongly oppose this bill and urge my colleagues to vote  ``no.''    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, this merciless  bill, ironically called a healthcare bill, would be disastrous for this  country's health, and especially harmful to the people in my home State  of New York.   It will not expand access to health care, as promised. It will,  instead, rip away healthcare insurance from 24 million people,  including 2.7 million in New York City, people who already have health  care. And it will not make premiums more affordable, as promised. It  will, instead, raise premiums across this Nation. Premiums in New York  would go up an estimated $1,000 next year alone.   It cuts all Federal funding for a year for Planned Parenthood  clinics, which serve women in need across this country. And to make an  already bad bill even worse, this bill cuts nearly $5 billion in  funding for New York's hospitals that serve some of our most vulnerable  people.   Voting for this bill is voting to cause sure and certain harm to  millions of Americans. I urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Seven years ago, Mr. Speaker, this town was abuzz with this new  healthcare plan, the Affordable Care Act, that was signed by the  President of the United States. We were promised an enormous  opportunity to make health care better.   Mr. Speaker, fortunately, the American people had a chance to make a  decision, and the American people--after watching and seeing not only  people incapable of putting databases together, incapable of  understanding marketplaces, and incapable of understanding the limits  of the American people's real need to understand and to have a better  healthcare system--gave up on ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. They  gave up on it because, after 7 long years, they understood it simply  didn't equal what they were sold.   The Republican Party is selling what we believe in, and this is the  beginning of that sell. It is a beginning of an understanding for most  Members of this body and the American people to understand you can keep  your own doctor and you can keep your own healthcare plan, but you,  too, can make your own decisions. You can become a consumer.   Oh, my gosh, somebody from Washington isn't going to tell us exactly  what to do? Let's scare everybody; let's make them think that the  American people can't make their own decisions without the IRS or  Washington telling them what to do.   I understand there are some frustrations. I get that. I can be  frustrated; I am not. It is true last week I held a townhall meeting in  Dallas, Texas. It is true a bunch of people yelled and screamed at me.  They simply wanted to know: Yes or no, yes or no.   Mr. Speaker, policy is not like that in our country. The Republican  Party does owe people thoughts, ideas, and plans. We will have the  bill, and when we do it, we will own it, and we will be proud of it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on  this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
