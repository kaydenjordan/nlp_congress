 Mr. Speaker, it is raining in California, finally.   I know that song from the 1970s would say otherwise, but we are  seeing some relief from the drought. It is partially man-made,  partially government-made, by letting all of our water run to the ocean  instead of to farms and to people. That said, our fire season is also  over for a while in most of the State.   Let me just remind you: This map here is just a portion of northern  California. This half of this fire area is about 1 million acres from  last year called the Dixie fire. Many other fires in just the last 4  years represent about 2 million acres, just in one section of one  State.   This calls out the need--even though it is the off-season, and we  have forgotten about the fire now because it is raining--to have forest  management that is actually effective.   We need the U.S. Forest Service to take this issue head-on instead of  more talk, more mealymouth, more plans, treating maybe 1 million acres  a year,  [[Page H8783]]  2 million acres per year, when the Forest Service has under its charge  200 million acres.   We need to bring in the private sector and everybody we can to get  ahead on forest thinning and forest management so we don't keep burning  our communities down and causing all the air pollution, water quality  issues, loss of wildlife. Meanwhile, we are the second-leading importer  of lumber in the world.   What are we doing here? It is time for action.                            ____________________
