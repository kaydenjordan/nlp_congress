 Madam Speaker, every person, regardless of sex, must  be treated equally under the law. H.J. Res. 17 reaffirms this core  American value. It makes clear that the arbitrary deadline in the equal  rights amendment may not stand in the way of achieving full equality  for women.   With women losing their jobs at disproportionately high rates, the  COVID-19 pandemic has only further revealed the need for this  amendment.   In 2020, American women lost more than 5 million jobs. A vote for  this resolution is a vote for equal access to healthcare. It is a vote  for equal pay for the same work. It is a vote for equal opportunity and  basic human rights in all other aspects of life for women in this  country.   Congress must act now to remove this arbitrary deadline. There must  be no time limit on guaranteeing equal rights under the law.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 17.                                time  1115     Madam Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated,  once again, the vital importance of the Violence Against Women Act.   With the Nation under stay-at-home orders, many women were unable to  escape their abusers or find help in their communities.   Thanks to VAWA, organizations like the Rhode Island Coalition Against  Domestic Violence were able to meet women where they are, despite these  obstacles.   In 2020, VAWA grants helped the Rhode Island Coalition Against  Domestic Violence assist over 9,000 survivors of domestic violence and  answer over 17,000 helpline calls, nearly a 12 percent increase from  2019.   During the pandemic, through VAWA programs, Rhode Islanders have  found transitional housing, received counseling services, and obtained  assistance with seeking restraining orders.   Violence Against Women Act grants and programs can really be the  difference between life or death.   Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1620, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization  Act of 2021.
