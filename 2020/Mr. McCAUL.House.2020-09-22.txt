 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to start this debate with a simple truth that  we cannot afford to forget: Truly free trade cannot involve slave  labor.   Today, the Chinese Community Party is using the forced labor of the  Uyghurs and other minorities to help bankroll its cultural genocide  against those very same groups. The repression taking place right now  in Xinjiang is breathtaking in its scope and in its brutality.   It involves the detention of 1 to 3 million people in concentration  camps, Madam Speaker. It involves surveillance and attempted  brainwashing on a massive scale. It involves breaking up families and  taking children from their parents. It involves forced sterilization  and, Madam Speaker, forced abortions.   This should be a terrifying warning to the world, to China's  neighbors, and to the American people that the Chinese Communist Party  is fundamentally focused on expanding its power, its control, and its  authoritarian style of government. It views things that it does not  control, like religion, cultural identity, and the yearning of all  people for freedom, as threats that must be destroyed.   Because we have drawn the CCP into our most essential supply chains,  it can hold our national security hostage while it uses U.S. consumers  to subsidize its atrocities.   As many as one in five cotton garments globally could be tainted with  Uyghur slave labor. In July, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized  a 13-ton shipment of human hair--Madam Speaker, human hair--that  originated in Xinjiang's forced labor system. We haven't heard about  human hair since the Nazis and the concentration camps of the war that  my father fought in, World War II.   It is brazen, and it is sickening. We must refuse to be complicit,  financially or otherwise, in the CCP's crimes against the Muslim  Uyghur.   For that reason, I support this bill before us today.   I must also point out the abuses in this province are not only one  small part of the grave and growing threat that the Chinese Communist  Party poses to the interests, the values, and the security of the  United States. That threat is global and has military, economic, public  health, and philosophical aspects.   I know that many on the other side of the aisle share my concerns. I,  unfortunately, regret that, during this Congress, the majority has not  given the CCP threat even one-tenth of the time they have put into  their partisan efforts to bring down this President.   We were told that the China Task Force was going to be bipartisan,  Madam Speaker, and at the last minute, the majority pulled out. For the  past 4 months, I have served as chairman of the China Task Force. This  task force, again, was supposed to be bipartisan because I believe this  is not a Republican or Democrat issue.   Confronting the generational threat that the CCP poses should be a  bipartisan issue. It is an American issue against the greatest national  security threat to the United States of America.   I believe this failure of perspective needs to change. In our work on  the China Task Force, we have met with 125 people from both sides of  the aisle to gain better insight into our relationship and our foreign  policy, as we speak here from the Foreign Affairs Committee, how we  need to treat the Chinese Communist Party from a foreign policy  standpoint.   This, again, is an American issue, not Republican or Democrat. This  report coming out October 1 will include 400 recommendations, including  100 pieces of legislation that have bipartisan support like the bill  before us today.   So, Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  legislation. Then, once we get past this election, Madam Speaker, let  us come together on both sides and analyze objectively our foreign  policy with the Chinese Communist Party and address the bipartisan  bills that will be recommended by the task force to address the Chinese  Communist Party's malign activities throughout the world.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), the chairman, for his steadfast support for human  rights across the world. The gentleman and the next speaker have been  on this issue, really, as visionary leaders, I would say, the two  strongest in the House of Representatives representing both sides of  the aisle, and I thank him for that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Human Rights, who has been working on these issues along with Chairman  McGovern for decades.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.    Madam Speaker, let me thank Speaker Pelosi. She actually  came to our committee markup of this bill. It is very rare for a  Speaker of the House to show up to a committee markup, and yet this  issue is so important to her that she honored us with her presence in  that markup. This is where we come together in the Congress, and I want  to thank you for your support, Madam Speaker.   And I thank Mr. Smith, who has been dealing for decades with this.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jacobs).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jacobs).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, in recent years, the world has stood by idly as the  Chinese Communist Party rounded up more than a million--probably a lot  more than that--ethnic minorities into concentration camps where they  are tortured, brainwashed, and forced into labor. This is all part of a  deliberate program by the CCP to wipe out their ethnic identity, their  religion, their culture, anything that might compete with the Communist  Party for their loyalties and affection.   We have a moral duty today to speak out against these horrifying  crimes against humanity and against the Uyghurs and, as the Speaker  mentioned, against the Tibetans and Christians as well, who are  persecuted in the Chinese Communist regime.   But we have an even greater duty to avoid funding this genocide by  paying for slave labor in Xinjiang. There can no longer be business as  usual with China.   Madam Speaker, the world is watching. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, as this painful year has hammered home: viruses and  pandemics know no borders. The bipartisan Global Health Security Act  reaffirms our commitment to promoting global health security as a core  issue of national security.   This bill--and I want to thank my friend, Gerry Connolly and   Steve  Chabot, who, I am not sure if he will be able to speak or not--but I  want to thank them for bringing this bill forward.   This bill directs the President to establish an interagency review  council that will support our executive branch agencies and ensure  coordination between their efforts. It also requires the designation of  a lead official as the United States coordinator for Global Health  Security, who will be responsible for coordinating the U.S. response to  global health crises across agencies.   As our country continues to fight COVID-19 and this pandemic, we must  make sure our preparations to fight future threats to the health and  security of Americans are as efficient and effective as they can be.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the sponsors of the bill, Mr. Connolly  and Mr. Chabot, for their leadership in supporting and introducing this  bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I reiterate the vision of both Mr. Connolly and Mr.  Chabot for introducing this bill, and the discussions I believe, as the  gentleman stated from Virginia, took place 2 years ago, well before the  COVID-19 pandemic.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Chabot), who introduced the bill and is the coauthor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), an esteemed member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, the vice chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and  also a cosponsor of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The thing I really enjoy about the Foreign Affairs Committee, as I  know the Speaker would agree with me, is that it is bipartisan. I would  say that the majority of bills passed out of our committee--in fact, I  would say no  [[Page H4671]]  other committee has passed more bipartisan bills than the House  Committee on Foreign Affairs, as it should be.   I thank my good friend Joaquin Castro from Texas.   Of course, Madam Speaker, you are from Texas. We seem to have a  trifecta here today from Texas.   But I will say Chairman Engel has been a great partner to me, working  together as a chairman and ranking member should on a national security  committee. We should put the interests of the Nation above partisan  politics, and that has been our charge and our duty.   I am, quite frankly, proud to say that is how we have conducted  ourselves in this Congress. It is very gratifying, Madam Speaker, to  close out this session of Congress, before this very tumultuous  election cycle and very divisive time in our politics and our American  history, but for me to be able to close this out in a very bipartisan  way, that, I think, is what most Americans out there want from their  leaders in the Congress.   I thank the gentleman from Texas and the Speaker from Texas for your  bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Castro and Representative  Fitzpatrick for their leading efforts on the Global Child Thrive Act,  which we are considering here today.   Although children have not faced as many direct health effects from  COVID-19, the follow-on effects of the pandemic endanger the welfare of  countless vulnerable children around the world. Over the summer, the  U.N. estimated that an additional 10,000 children are dying every month  due to hunger caused by COVID-19.   This pandemic is also reversing hard-fought gains we have made in  combating other diseases, increasing access to education, and reducing  extreme poverty.   This legislation supports efforts to integrate early childhood  development into existing interventions on nutrition, education,  maternal health, and water, sanitation, and hygiene.   It also expands the role of the Special Advisor for Assistance to  Orphans and Vulnerable Children in coordinating U.S. assistance and  improving interagency cooperation.   This bill, in short, Madam Speaker, protects the most vulnerable in  our society, our children, from hunger and disease, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), the coauthor of the bill. An esteemed  member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the gentleman, again,  working with my good friend, Congressman Castro, has brought this  measure forward today.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, Brian Fitzpatrick, for his  work in the FBI. I thought it was very compelling, the testimony about  putting children's lives as the highest priority as he served as a very  distinguished special agent in the Bureau and now serves in this  Congress. I think Georgetown University ranked him as the most  bipartisan Member of this body, of the House. I take pride in being on  the top of the list, but Mr. Fitzpatrick's service in this House has  been to issues of importance to Americans.   Most Americans don't want us bickering. Most Americans want us  working across the aisle to get good things done for the people of this  country. The gentleman has demonstrated that every day I have witnessed  him in office in this Congress and since he has served in office.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Castro for his leadership.   Finally, Madam Speaker, being a Catholic myself, I do want to thank  Catholic Relief Services and the development community for their work  on this bill, working so hard to get to this point where we are now on  the floor of the House of Representatives in the United States Congress  getting ready to pass such an important bill that will save so many  children's lives.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the trafficking of people, whether for sexual  exploitation or forced labor, is an affront to human dignity. It is, as  the gentleman from Texas said, a modern-day form of slavery that  oppresses nearly 25 million people around the world, including  [[Page H4676]]  right here in the United States and in my home State of Texas.   A few years ago, a mother from Katy, Texas, in my district, reached  out to me with one request: ``Please help me bring my daughter home, my  daughter, Courtney.''   Courtney was a junior in high school. She was on the swim team and  attended church regularly. She was groomed, unfortunately, by  traffickers. She was groomed at her high school.   Many parents think, ``This can't happen to my child,'' and not in  suburbia in Houston, but just ask Courtney's family that question.   The traffickers embedded themselves in the high school. They operated  through Courtney's classmates. Like leeches, they latched onto  Courtney's vulnerabilities, and they used them against her. It was then  that she was swept up into this nightmare and used like property.   We may expect things like this out of foreign countries, but not in  our backyards.   Thankfully, after several months of work with law enforcement,  Courtney returned home to her family. I was there when she came home.  She had battle scars. She had lost so much weight. She had just about  died. It was quite a reunion with a mother and father and their  daughter who had been gone for almost 2 years.   She now dedicates her time to raising awareness and educating others  on the signs of human trafficking. Her work earned her a spot on the  U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking. I cannot be more proud of  her work and her inspiration to me and her contributions to the  council.   It is because of survivors like Courtney and the countless others  that Chairman Engel and I introduced the LIFT Act to continue our  committee's 20-year commitment to combating human trafficking.                                time  1330    The LIFT Act will help our law enforcement officers and diplomatic  officials communicate better so we can then root out more human  traffickers and bring them to justice.   I was surprised to find out that when someone applies for a visa at  an embassy or a consulate and they are denied on human trafficking  grounds, that that information is not currently given to our law  enforcement officers, to the FBI.   The LIFT Act also gives a voice to survivors of human trafficking so  that brave people like Courtney will remain a central part of the  policy discussion.   By reauthorizing the survivor-led U.S. Advisory Council on Human  Trafficking through 2025, which is what this bill does, we are  empowering survivors and sharpening our tools to counter traffickers.   I am very grateful for the support this bill has received from the  Alliance to End Slavery and Trafficking, and the U.S. Conference of  Catholic Bishops.   Madam Speaker, the evil of slavery was abolished in this country many  years ago. We are still living up to the principles of our Founding  Fathers that all men are created equal. We are still bringing this  country to racial and social justice. It is still something we strive  for. We must end this form of human slavery today, and this bill is a  start.   We have a lot more work to do but the numbers are very perplexing. In  fact, the numbers are very disturbing, the numbers of young children,  both little girls and boys, who are swept up into this awful system.   I have worked most of my life as a Federal prosecutor on these issues  and now in Congress. I put the worst of the worst behind bars for these  crimes where they deserve to spend a very long time in our prison  system. They are the lowest of the low.   So with this bill today, we renew and strengthen our commitment to  stand with the exploited and the children against their oppressors.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in 2002, I formed the Internet Crimes Against Children  unit in the attorney general's office in the State of Texas to stop  internet trafficking and stop the exploitation of children online.   Since that day, we have put thousands behind bars. This is a  worldwide scourge. It happens on an international level.   But what is, again, most disturbing, is it is happening now in our  backyards. It is happening in suburbia America.   A case like Courtney's is so compelling because you never thought it  would be possible in a town like Katy, Texas, but it happens, and it is  happening all over this Nation. The numbers from the FBI are revealing  and it is an industry. It is a sick industry that is run by  businessmen; that is run by lawyers, an industry that exploits our  children.   I have talked to many veterans with PTSD, but I can't imagine the  post-traumatic stress of a victim of human trafficking who has been  violated over and over and over again, offending the deepest ounce of  human dignity where there is no dignity left, where they had to put  their mind in such a place--almost like Stockholm syndrome--where they  can survive the horrors that they are living in day in and day out.   Madam Speaker, this has to stop. This bill will help, but this  Congress and the next Congress, we really need to ramp up our efforts  to take this issue square on, to put these monsters out of their  business and say they are closed forever, and to put them behind bars  for a very, very long time.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank many in my district who have  worked hard on this issue: Houston 20's Jenn Hohman, and Austin 20's  Lisa Knapp. These women are warriors for the cause against human  trafficking. I also want to thank the Harris County human trafficking  task force for their great work on this effort. They are truly one of  the models for the Nation.    When the officials from Homeland Security came down from the Blue  Campaign, they told me this is one of the most effective operations we  have seen in the United States, and it is a model for the Nation.  [[Page H4677]]    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this meaningful,  necessary legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
