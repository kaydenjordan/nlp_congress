 Mr. Speaker, now I have to say to my friends on the  other side: You sold out cheap--as we say in New Jersey--all to give a  tax cut to insurance companies and the most well off. The Upton  amendment is, of course, an admission.   After 7 years, you came up with this?   You have got to be kidding me. This is worse than a Fellini movie. At  least he didn't take 7 years to distinguish between fantasy and  reality.   For a New Jerseyan with asthma, this will mean a $4,340 premium  surcharge; for autism, $5,510. The list goes on and on--60, $70,000 if  you have cancer.   But less discussed is their attempt to rid the essential health  benefits which removes yet another ACA protection for everyone. So now  the Republicans have hit for the cycle.   You hit for the cycle. You jeopardized the health care of nearly  every single American--those on Medicare, those on Medicaid, those in  the ACA exchanges, and now 150 million people with employer coverage.  You sold out. It is a shame. I like most of you, but you are on the  wrong path.   It took you 7 years for this?   I will never yield. I will never yield.
