 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor this evening to manage the  time that we have on the Republican side to celebrate and remember the  life of our tremendous colleague, Mr. John Lewis.   Mr. Speaker, I was very moved, having the opportunity to watch my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle discuss and describe the  impact that Congressman Lewis had on their lives, on all of our lives,  and on this Chamber. I am struck by the fact that as we gather tonight  in this Chamber, we rise not as representatives of two different  political parties, but we rise as elected representatives of this great  Nation, a Nation that is mourning the loss of a great American, and as  honored colleagues of a man, John Lewis, who dedicated his life to  service and to the fight for justice and freedom.   John Lewis taught us: ``Nothing can stop the power of a committed and  determined people to make a difference in our society. Why? Because  human beings are the most dynamic link to the divine on this planet.''   John Lewis understood that one man or woman can make a difference-- indeed, that it is only the determined and principled action of  committed men and women that brings change.   He knew the blessings of this Nation, and he knew what it took to  secure those blessings for all Americans. He knew that the fight was  unfinished.   Mr. Speaker, the day that I was sworn into this body for the first  time, I was standing just outside these doors in the Speaker's lobby. I  had just arrived with my dad, who joined me on the floor that day. By  chance, as we were coming in, we met John Lewis standing in the lobby.  The three of us had the chance before the ceremony to spend some time  together.   The two of them didn't agree on much, but they did agree on certain  critical things. They agreed on the exceptional nature of this country,  on the magnificence of this, the people's House, and on the  incalculable blessings of freedom.   I am blessed by the memory of that day, and I am blessed that at that  moment when I was about to be sworn into this House, I was able to  spend time with those two men.   Writing of his experiences fighting for civil rights, John Lewis said  this: ``Freedom is not a state; it is an act. It is not some enchanted  garden perched high on a distant plateau where we can finally sit down  and rest. Freedom is the continuous action we all must take, and each  generation must do its  [[Page H3678]]  part to create an even more fair, more just society.''   Great men and women like John Lewis in every generation have known  this, that we all have an obligation to defend our freedom, to fight  for it, to do our part to be worthy of the sacrifices of those who have  gone before.   One of the greatest gifts we can give to young people today is to  teach them that lesson, to teach them our history, to convey to them  the duty, the obligation, and the incredible blessing of being an  American and of working to make sure that we pass this Nation to our  children and our grandchildren more perfect than it is today.   Our colleague, Congressman John Lewis, dedicated his life to that  ideal. His memory will be a blessing and an example to us all, our  colleagues, his colleagues, here in the House, to his family, to his  constituents, and to his fellow Americans.   God bless John Lewis, and God bless the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
