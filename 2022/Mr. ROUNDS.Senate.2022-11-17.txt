 Mr. President, I rise to discuss bipartisan legislation  that I have introduced with Senator Lujan which would grant a Federal  charter to the National American Indian Veterans, Incorporated, known  as NAIV.   The NAIV was chartered in 2004, with headquarters located on the  Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Reservation in South Dakota. The NAIV was  originally established as the result of a request by former Senators  Akaka, Inouye, and Nighthorse Campbell during a Senate Veterans'  Affairs Committee in 2004.   At that time, no Native American veterans organization had ever  received a congressional charter. Sadly, that remains the case today,  nearly 20 years later. But that omission would be fixed by this  legislation.   The NAIV is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that operates  solely for charitable, literary, educational, scientific, patriotic,  and civil improvement purposes. It provides a voice to  [[Page S6761]]  Native American veterans whose unique needs are not always represented  adequately by other organizations.   Native Americans are the highest serving race per capita in the U.S.  Armed Forces, often serving at a rate five times over the national  average, and have served with distinction in every U.S. conflict over  the last 200 years. They also have some of the highest concentration of  women servicemembers. According to a 2020 VA statistics report, there  are over 140,000 Native American veterans across the Nation today.  Discussions with Tribal leaders would indicate that this number is most  likely an undercount and the true number likely approaches 200,000.   The NAIV serves the interests and needs of Native veterans in all 50  States. It conducts activities in collaboration with its national  leadership and its 14 regional offices. Tribes rotate to host regional  and State NAIV meetings. This is all done in a decentralized manner,  respecting the independence and sovereignty of all Tribal nations.   NAIV often has been the only national Native American veterans  organization invited to testify before Congress on issues facing Native  veterans nationwide. NAIV works to make sure that our Native American  veterans receive the benefits, compensation, and resources that they  have earned. Among its activities, NAIV provided critical support for  construction of an American Indian Veterans Memorial at the Riverside  National Cemetery in California.   In addition, COVID-19 had a significant impact on Tribal  reservations, and the NAIV secured over 5 million masks, thousands of  gallons of hand sanitizer, and personal protective equipment to respond  to the pandemic. It distributed these critical resources to over 375  Tribes in 30 States at no cost to our veterans or their Tribes.   NAIV also serves on the Disaster Response and Recovery Working Group  of the FCC Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee and has been a  tireless advocate of providing broadband access to Tribal communities  throughout the Nation.   Last week, we celebrated Veterans Day, an opportunity to honor our  veterans for their service. Also, last week, we finally saw the  dedication of the National Native American Veterans Memorial on the  National Mall here in DC. While the Native American Veterans Memorial  actually opened in 2020, due to COVID, the dedication did not occur  until this year.   I believe we have the opportunity today to address another overdue  recognition of our Native American veterans by finally approving the  Federal charter for the National American Indian Veterans,  Incorporated, to recognize all the work the organization does on behalf  of our Native American veterans.   Mr. President, notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further  consideration of S. 1725 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; further, that the bill be considered read a third time  and passed, and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I wanted to say how pleased I am to  finally see this bill pass the U.S. Senate. I want to underscore,  again, the situation of recognizing the important work done by the NAIV  to benefit our Native American veterans.   I particularly want to recognize the work done by Mr. Don Loudner of  Mitchell, SD, who has led the NAIV since its inception in 2004. Don has  served as an Army officer and is a combat veteran of the Korean war. He  served with my father in the National Guard in South Dakota, as well.  He also served in the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Census Bureau  and has spent decades supporting our Native American veterans. I want  to thank  [[Page S6763]]  him for his 70 years of service to our Nation.    I would also like to thank Senator Hirono for the open  communication that we have received in coordinating and successfully  passing these pieces of legislation.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  legislative fellows in my office be granted the privileges of the floor  for the remainder of the Congress: Robert Watson Fagan and Benjamin  Shafer.
