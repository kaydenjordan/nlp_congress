 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 50th  anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission.   In his famous 1961 speech at Rice University in Houston, Texas,  President John F. Kennedy challenged the Nation to put a man on the  Moon by the end of the decade. President Kennedy spoke these now famous  words: ``We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do other  things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.''   President Kennedy understood the importance of American leadership in  space. He added: ``Whether it will become a force for good or ill  depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of  preeminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of  peace or a new, terrifying theater of war.''   Military professionals will tell you that whoever occupies the high  ground in a conflict has the upper hand. Folks, there is no higher  ground than space. America must remain the leader in space. It is just  that simple.    In 1969, the crew of Apollo 11 fulfilled that very mission to put a  man on the Moon. Today, we honor not only the astronauts Neil  Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, but all of the great NASA  men and women who worked tirelessly to make the Apollo 11 mission a  success.   We have learned about the hidden figures of the Apollo program, those  behind the scenes. Here are some more.   At the height of the Apollo program, according to one estimate, 1 in  50 Americans were working on some aspect of the program. This included  some 400,000-plus full-time employees.   The astronauts knew their lives depended on these people, most of  whom they never knew nor would they ever meet, that were performing  difficult tasks on a very demanding schedule.   Over 530 million people around the globe watched the telecast of  Armstrong's first steps from 250,000 miles away. Not only did Apollo 11  show the world what America can achieve, but it displayed a beautifully  unique ability of human space exploration, its capacity to stimulate,  to inspire, and to cause people to reach deep inside to find the very  best they had to offer.                                time  1100    American greatness is a compilation of these things. On that day, we  spread our message of American greatness around the globe.   Fifty years ago, the politics of a volatile world order compelled us  to the challenge of space competition. The world has changed, and in  today's uncertainty, one thing remains certain: the importance of  American preeminence in space.   Now, we turn our focus to a new challenge. We will send Americans  back to the Moon's surface by 2024, only this time, to stay. It has  been a long time since man walked on the Moon. In 2024, we will make  history once again when the first woman walks on the Moon.   With our great NASA's lead, the private and public sectors are coming  together to accomplish this great and very difficult task. Through  their partnerships, American excellence is leveraged across the board.  We are building sustainable, reusable systems that will not only take  us to the Moon but leapfrog us to Mars.   Our great NASA is bringing Democrats and Republicans together in what  I call American togetherism.   Thank God for NASA.                            ____________________
