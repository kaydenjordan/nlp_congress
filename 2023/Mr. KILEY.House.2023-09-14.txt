 Mr. Speaker, a local business in my district, Snooks  Candies and Chocolate Factory, is celebrating their 60-year anniversary  on Friday. Founded by John Snook in 1963, John and his wife, Jeannine,  started their business at the Arden Fair Food Circus.   The family opened up a store in Tahoe City in 1981 and later moved to  historic Folsom in 1985, where the store remains today. Each one of  John and Jeannine's 6 kids and some of their 11 grandchildren and 13  great-grandchildren have spent time working in Snooks. To witness the  bond of family in the business community and the successful operation  of a thriving small business is truly inspiring.   After retiring and entrusting the store to his son, Jim, and Jim's  wife, Renee, in 1999, John continued to be a consistent presence in the  store, talking to customers and helping with work when needed.   Sadly, John Snook passed away earlier this year, but his legacy as a  husband, father, and successful businessman continues to live on.   Over the span of six decades, Snooks Candies has faced many  challenges, from nationwide recessions to the recent COVID-19 pandemic.  However, these challenges have only reinforced the status of Snooks  Candies as a true pillar in Folsom and the surrounding communities.   I applaud the commitment to their business and to producing iconic  candies and treats for all to enjoy. Therefore, on behalf of the United  States House of Representatives, I am proud to join Folsom and our  surrounding communities in congratulating Snooks Candies and Chocolate  Factory for reaching this momentous milestone.                         Folsom Community Service Day     Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the 10-year anniversary of  Folsom Community Service Day, an event which will be held this year on  Saturday, September 16.   Organized by the city of Folsom and partner organizations, Community  Service Day mobilizes hundreds of volunteers to complete projects  across the city to improve public resources and benefit the community.   In its tenure, the Folsom Community Service Day event has made a  considerable and positive impact on the area. Since its inception, over  19,000 volunteers have participated. More than 900 projects have been  completed, and 500 of them have been performed to serve senior  citizens. There have been 537,000 pounds of food donated by the Twin  Lakes Food Bank, and thousands of care packages to Active Duty military  members have been sent. In addition, thousands of donated items have  been collected for local nonprofits.   Their efforts have truly made a remarkable and lasting impact. To  witness the hard work of this community over the span of a decade to  deliver necessary change, improve neighborhoods, and help those in need  is truly inspiring.   Therefore, on behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I  am proud to recognize the city of Folsom and countless volunteers and  partner organizations for providing 10 years of invaluable service and  contributions to their communities.                               Success Academy     Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Education and the Workforce  Committee hosted a roundtable with Eva Moskowitz, the founder of  Success Academy Charter Schools, which was first opened in 2006 and now  has 47 schools.   The network of schools is known for setting high expectations of  academic excellence and achieving exemplary results. Black and Hispanic  students, which make up most of Success Academy's students, achieve  proficiency rates double to triple what their New York City district  peers do.   As AEI senior fellow Robert Pondiscio put it:         If Success Academy were a stand-alone school district, it       would be by far the highest performing one in the State of       New York, including places like Scarsdale, and Jericho on       Long Island with multimillion dollar homes.    This is an example of why charter schools have been such an important  innovation in American education and are a vital part of the landscape  for school choice and why they are widely supported by the public.                                time  1045    In 2022, the Harris Poll found in a national survey that 81 percent  of parents support expanding the number of slots at existing public  charter schools in their area and 78 percent want more public charter  schools in their area.   In California's Third District, we have many tremendous schools, both  district schools and charter schools. Some of the popular charters  include John Adams Academy, Placer County Pathways Charter, Newcastle  Elementary Charter, Vantage Point Charter, and Plumas Charter.   As a former high school teacher and a member of the Education and  Workforce Committee, I am truly inspired by schools like Success  Academy and will work to support charter schools and to scale up  successful models throughout our public education system.                          Suspend the State Gas Tax     Mr. Speaker, today, I am calling on the California  Legislature to  [[Page H4306]]  suspend the State gas tax, as other States--including just recently  Georgia--have done to provide consumers with relief from soaring  prices. The legislature can provide a modest measure of relief by  passing Assembly Bill 53 by Assemblyman Vince Fong, which would  immediately suspend the State's gas tax and lower prices by 58 cents  per gallon. The bill would also assure that no funding is lost for road  projects throughout the State.   At a time when Californians continue to struggle with the effects of  inflation, this relief would make life a little easier for millions of  people. It is a commonsense proposal that merits bipartisan support,  and I urge the legislature to act on it immediately.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today I am urging support for the Preserving  Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act, which will prevent California from  banning gas-powered vehicles.   I am as strong a supporter as anyone of clean energy, and I could not  be more excited about the future of clean energy that awaits us, but  the way to move rapidly towards that future is through innovation. It  is not through regulation. No State has gone further down the road of  overreaching, overbearing, inattentive regulation to the needs of its  citizens than California has.    This particular measure that California is now attempting is more  radical than any that came before it. Specifically, the California Air  Resources Board approved a plan in August and is now asking the  Environmental Protection Agency to approve a waiver under the Clean Air  Act to implement its new rules that set yearly rising zero-emission  vehicle rules starting in 2026 and would end the sale of vehicles only  powered by gasoline by 2035.   This is no trivial matter. The majority of vehicles on the road today  in the United States, 95 percent, run on internal combustion engines.   What is the consequence of this going to be?   First and foremost, there is the cost. The price of an electric  vehicle is $17,000 higher than a gas-powered car. This is going to make  life even harder for people in California where we already have the  highest energy prices, the highest gas prices, the highest cost of  living, the highest poverty rate, and far too many people having to  leave our State because it is simply too hard to get by.   Make our State more affordable. This bill will save Californians from  this burden and help many of my constituents.                                time  1515
