 Madam Speaker, I recently introduced the Newborn  Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act, which will continue the  important work of the original bill and expand its critical programs to  improve infant health across the United States. Every year, thousands  of babies are born with genetic, metabolic, hormonal, and functional  conditions that severely affect their development.   Fifty years ago, these rare disorders in infants would have gone  undetected until symptoms appeared, often too late to provide them with  the essential treatment needed to prevent lifelong disability or even  death. Today, we can give newborn babies a simple blood test that can  identify such life-threatening genetic illnesses before symptoms  appear.   In 2008, Congress passed my original bill, which was a major step  toward establishing newborn screening guidelines across the United  States. Until that time, only 10 States and the District of Columbia  required newborn screening for a complete panel of recommended  disorders, and there was no Federal repository of information on these  diseases. Today, 49 States and the District of Columbia screen for at  least 31 of the 35 currently recommended core conditions.   Each year, with newborn screening, healthcare professionals identify  approximately 12,000 babies who test positive for one of these rare  conditions. This invaluable early detection allows for timely treatment  to prevent long-term damage and severe health complications, which  gives babies the opportunity to live relatively normal and healthy  lives.   For thousands of mothers and families, this early and simple  intervention can also reduce the emotional stress of trying to identify  their baby's correct diagnosis.   Investments in newborn screening can also save up to $1 million over  a child's lifetime. This is a significant savings for American families  and our financially burdened healthcare system.   While it is true that since the original passage of the Newborn  Screening Saves Lives Act, significant advancements have been made in  early detection and treatment, serious gaps in newborn screening  remain. The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act  will build on the current newborn screening infrastructure and  strengthen early detection of preventable disease.    To ensure the quality of laboratories involved in newborn screening,  the bill reauthorizes the Centers for Disease Control grants, and it  continues HRSA grants to empower parents and health professionals with  education and resources to improve newborn screening.   The bill also renews the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable  Disorders in Newborns and Children, which maintains and updates the  recommended uniform screening panel that States adopt and implement.   The bill funds research to identify new screening technologies and  treatments, and a new provision in the bill commissions the National  Academy of Medicine to issue recommendations to modernize newborn  screening systems into the 21st century.   The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act will continue  to ensure that parents and health providers are knowledgeable about the  value of newborn screening, and it will help ensure that infants across  the United States receive comprehensive and consistent testing.   A coalition of public health groups, including the March of Dimes,  the Association of Public Health Laboratories, the American College of  Medical Genetics, and the National Organization for Rare Disorders,  support the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act. Their  leadership has been critical to advance newborn screening across the  United States.   Madam Speaker, newborn screening is one of the most important public  health interventions of the 20th century. It is critical that, in the  21st century, we continue and strengthen the programs and research of  the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act.   I urge my colleagues to sponsor the Newborn Screening Saves Lives  Reauthorization Act to enhance the lives of hundreds of infants and  families each year in the United States.                            ____________________
