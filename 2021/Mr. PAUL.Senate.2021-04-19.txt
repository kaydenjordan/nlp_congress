 Madam President, Kentucky has a rich cultural  history and is the birthplace of musical artists from every genre and  era. Proudly showcasing this heritage is the Kentucky Music Hall of  Fame & Museum in Mount Vernon, KY.   John Lee Lair, who served as a sergeant in the U.S. Army during WWII,  returned to the States and joined WLS radio in Chicago, where he turned  his lifelong love of music into a career. He founded the Renfro Valley  Barn Dance, which was broadcast by several powerful AM stations and  eventually moved to its final home in Renfro Valley, KY.   Today we honor one of John Lair's three daughters, Ann Lair  Henderson, who developed the plan to house the hall of fame and museum  in the family's vintage horse stable. Following an act of the Kentucky  General Assembly in 2002, this special tribute to Kentucky's storied  musicians was born.   The iconic building, which is listed on the National Register of  Historic Places, is filled with memorabilia and tributes to over 60  artists as diverse as Rosemary Clooney, Ricky Skaggs, Lionel Hampton,  Boots Randolph, and Mary Travers. Nearly 20 years since its founding,  Ann Lair Henderson, who recently celebrated her 98th birthday, is still  a vital part of the organization that helps recognize the enormous  contribution of Kentucky's incredible musical talents. We are grateful  for Ann's passion for preserving history and for promoting some of the  Commonwealth's finest treasures. She is a treasure in her own right to  her local community and a great reminder for us all to keep pursuing  those things about which we are truly passionate through every season  of life.                            ____________________
