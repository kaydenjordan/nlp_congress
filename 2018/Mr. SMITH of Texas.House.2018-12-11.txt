 Mr. Speaker, I believe it is important to make  very clear with this legislation that CMS should not waive any Medicaid  state plan requirements that would limit the freedom to choose  qualified Medicaid providers who can provide medical services to  children with chronic conditions. Nothing in this bill modifies section  1902(a)(23) of the Social Security Act--related to freedom of choice  requirements. Children and their families or guardians retain the right  to elect care from a provider or supplier who is qualified and eligible  to receive Medicaid payment for the services. It is the intent of this  legislation to permit and guarantee the family, in consultation with  their physician, in all instances, to be permitted to select the best  provider/supplier who can meet the patient's needs. While I support  this legislation to provide care coordination for these children, the  ultimate choice of the who will provide direct medical services must  remain with the family.
