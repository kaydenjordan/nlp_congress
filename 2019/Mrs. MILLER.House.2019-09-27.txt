 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to the  resolution on the floor.   Yesterday, we had one of the most important hearings in this  Congress, where we learned about innovations in energy efficiency and  carbon capture. These real solutions will allow us to provide  affordable, clean, and reliable energy to continue to give America and  the world the security and prosperity that we enjoy.   It took us 9 months to have that hearing. Unfortunately, not every  hearing we have provides solutions.    For the past 9 months, instead of prioritizing our Nation's  infrastructure, solving the opioid epidemic, or ending the crisis--yes,  crisis--on our southern border, my colleagues across the aisle have  spent countless hours exploiting important committee meetings,  searching for something, anything, that would impugn our duly-elected  President.   We need to stop wasting time on these political games. The President  has already vetoed this ridiculous resolution, and he has promised to  veto it again.   We must secure our southern border. The President has taken action,  while this House has tried to undermine his efforts at every step.   We must put aside our political differences to save the thousands of  lives we lose every year to fentanyl and the opioid epidemic and to  save the lives of the young boys and girls who are being trafficked  across the border against their will.   I was sent to Congress to create jobs, fix our infrastructure, and  innovate the energy industry, not to bicker over  [[Page H8064]]  partisan squabbles. I strongly oppose this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
