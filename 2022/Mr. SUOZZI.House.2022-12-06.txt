 Mr. Speaker, I am joined in the gallery today by six  former hostages and the families of 11 former hostages who are here to  represent the 52 former hostages who were taken by Iranian student  militants when they stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on November 4,  1979.   I rise today in support of my bipartisan, bicameral legislation that  would award the Congressional Gold Medal to the 52 hostages of the Iran  hostage crisis who were released after 444 days of captivity over 40  years ago.   As it currently stands, almost 300 Members of this Chamber have  pledged their support for this legislation--a showing of true  bipartisanship in an oftentimes divided Chamber.   Despite mock firing squads, beatings, solitary confinement, lack of  food, and psychological torture, these American hostages maintained  their strength, resilience, and loyalty to their country. I was 17  years old in 1979, and I remember well--as many Americans do and many  in this Chamber do--that the Iran hostage crisis was a painful time in  our history. But that pain cannot stop us from recognizing the true  pain and sacrifice by these special Americans.   On behalf of the entire Congress, I give special thanks to Brock  Pierce, the chairman of Commission 52, and Ezra Friedlander, the  project manager, for helping gather support for this bill. It is a true  public service.   Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of this bill as soon as it is  passed in the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, let's give a round of applause to these folks who have  joined us here today.                            ____________________
