 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 2023 Georgia  High School Association 4A State Champions, the Johnson Knights Boys  Soccer Team.   Last week, the Knights became back-to-back State champions, defeating  the Westminster Wildcats, boasting a final score of 4-2.   Combined with their 5A championship titles from last year and 2018,  this latest victory marks the Knights' third title in the last five  completed seasons.   Fueled by adrenaline, filled with talent, and led by Coach Frank  Zamora, these gifted young men continue to dominate the competition and  make the 9th District proud.   Congratulations, Johnson High School Boys Soccer Team, on an exciting  win and becoming back-to-back Georgia State champions.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, 3 weeks ago, this body passed my commonsense  resolution, H.J. Res. 42, to repeal the D.C. City Council's severely  misguided anti-police law. We did so with bipartisan support, sending a  clear message that the people's House remains resolute in our  commitment to both back the men and women in blue of the Metropolitan  Police Department and to restore public safety in our Nation's Capital  City.   We are only 131 days into 2023, and Washington, D.C., has recorded 77  homicides, 62 incidents of sexual abuse, nearly 500 cases of assault  with a dangerous weapon, more than 900 robberies, over 2,400 incidents  of motor vehicle theft, and almost 4,200 reported thefts.   Clearly, there is a catastrophic crime crisis here in Washington,  D.C., yet D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson insists that there is  ``not a crime crisis in Washington, D.C.''   Meanwhile, it appears that the D.C. Attorney General is more  concerned with the safety risks of gas stoves than the safety of  citizens, and Mayor Bowser remains missing in action as criminals  terrorize the city.   In an unconvincing attempt to showcase leadership, she held a public  safety summit this week to discuss the issue of crime. However, the  Mayor knows what must be done. She simply refuses to do it.   This isn't complicated. D.C.'s local government must prosecute  criminals and support Metropolitan Police Department officers.   Due to D.C.'s failed local leadership, it is now up to Congress to  save our Nation's Capital from itself. We have both the authority and  the responsibility to do so, but we must act swiftly.   Residents, small businesses, visitors, and the heroic officers of the  Metropolitan Police Department are counting on us to act. Failure to do  so will only embolden the dangerous, violent, and deranged criminals  taking over Washington's streets.   So as I did this morning at the National Law Enforcement Officers  Memorial, I call on the Senate to pass H.J. Res. 42 and to put people  over politics by joining our effort to improve public safety in our  Nation's Capital City. I urge President Biden to follow suit, just as  he did in our fight to nullify the Council's soft-on-crime Revised  Criminal Code Act.   We must use our authority outlined in Article I, section 8, clause 17  of the United States Constitution to not only protect Americans in  Washington but to protect MPD officers risking their lives to defend  law and order in D.C.   Mr. Speaker, the clock is ticking, and we don't have a minute to  waste.   The Senate needs to get this done and pass H.J. Res. 42 for the  American people.                Defending Americans' Second Amendment Freedoms     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the defense of Americans'  Second Amendment freedoms.   In January, the ATF finalized its unconstitutional rule pertaining to  firearms with stabilizing braces. Under the ATF's new rule, any pistol- braced firearm would be considered an unregistered short-barreled  rifle, subjecting these firearms to draconian regulations under the  National Firearms Act of 1934.   The ATF informed law-abiding gun owners possessing pistols housing  these braces that they will have only 120 days to register these  firearms or risk harsh NFA violations, including hefty fines of up to  $250,000 and up to 10 years in jail. This 120-day amnesty window ends  later this month on May 31.   Now, keep in mind, this rule doesn't just violate Americans' Second  Amendment liberties. It also subverts Congress' sole legislative  authority because Congress makes laws, not unelected anti-gun  bureaucrats at the ATF.   Yet, with the snap of ATF Director Dettelbach's finger--and  nonexistent authority--millions of law-abiding gun owners, including  many disabled veterans, will become criminals, felons, overnight if  they refuse to register, turn in, destroy, or dismantle their pistol- braced firearms.   For months I have promised gun owners that I would relentlessly fight  the ATF's unconstitutional pistol brace rule on their behalf, and I  meant it.   Later this month, this body will pass my Congressional Review Act  joint resolution, H.J. Res. 44, to prevent the Biden administration's  tyrannical measure from taking effect.   We are not giving 1 inch in our constitutional right to keep and bear  arms--not 1 inch, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
