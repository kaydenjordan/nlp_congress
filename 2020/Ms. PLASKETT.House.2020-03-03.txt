 Mr. Speaker, in 2017, due to natural disaster and lack  of electricity, 200 dialysis patients were forced to evacuate the  Virgin Islands.   Some never returned; some are still hoping to; and some who did may  once again have to leave. Patients on St. Croix are still receiving  treatment in a mobile unit that faces an uncertain future.   FEMA has slow-walked the release of funding and guidelines that will  allow our hospital to build a permanent and comfortable facility on the  island for lifesaving dialysis treatment.   The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, CMS, has refused to  recertify the temporary mobile unit, instead giving the unit month-to- month extensions, citing that, by now, there should have been a more  permanent structure.   Stuck between FEMA's slow-walk and CMS' decision are people, people  who need stability and empathy. If these Americans are forced to make  the hard decision as to whether to leave home again, these Federal  agencies would have failed them.   At least 15 of the dialysis patients who were forced to leave the  first time are no longer with us. They passed away before they were  able to come home.   This National Kidney Month, let's work to ensure that this doesn't  happen again.                            ____________________
