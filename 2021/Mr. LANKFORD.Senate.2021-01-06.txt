 Mr. President, in America, we settle our differences in  elections. What happens if you don't trust the election count or you  are concerned that so many courts denied or dismissed cases within  hours after they were given thousands of pages of evidence?   The reason we have a Congress to settle our Nation's divisions and  the rules of the Senate make sure that every opinion in the Nation is  heard is so issues like this can be addressed.   The constitutional crisis in our country right now is that millions  of Americans are being told to sit down and shut up. Their opinions  matter.   During the electoral challenge on January 6, 2005, Senator Ted  Kennedy stood on this floor and said this. He said:         I commend the many thousands of citizens in Massachusetts       and other States who insisted that treating today's electoral       vote count in Congress as a meaningless ritual would be an       insult to our democracy unless we register our own protest       against the obviously-flawed voting process that took place       in so many States. We are hopeful that this major issue that       goes to the heart of our democracy is now firmly implanted on       the agenda for effective action by . . . Congress.    I agree. The U.S. Constitution does not allow me to assign different  electors to a State, nor should it. The U.S. Constitution does not give  the option to the Vice President of the United States to just  unilaterally decide which States are in and out, and it should not.  Each State decides its electors through its people.   A small group of Senators, including myself, have demanded that we  not ignore the questions that millions of people are asking in our  Nation, so we have proposed a constitutional solution. Pause the count.  Get more facts to the States before January the 20th. We proposed a 15- member commission, just like what was done after the failed election of  1876. We are encouraging people to spend 10 days going through all the  issues so States can have one  [[Page S18]]  last opportunity to address any challenges. Then the States, as the  Constitution directs, would make the final decision on their electors.   I have some colleagues who have said that a 10-day commission is not  enough time, so they have counterproposed just ignoring the lingering  questions.   We need to do something.   (Mr. GRASSLEY assumed the Chair.)    My challenge today is not about the good people of  Arizona.                            ____________________     Mr. Vice President, you said things more eloquently  than how we say it in Oklahoma. In Oklahoma, we say something like: Why  in God's name would someone think attacking law enforcement and  occupying the United States Capitol is the best way to show that you  are right? Why would you do that?   Rioters and thugs don't run the Capitol. We are the United States of  America. We disagree on a lot of things, and we have a lot of spirited  debate in this room, but we talk it out, and we honor each other, even  in our disagreements. That person, that person, and that person is not  my enemy. That is my fellow American. And while we disagree on things,  and disagree strongly at times, we do not encourage what happened  today--ever.   Now, I want to join my fellow Senators in saying thank you to the  Capitol Hill Police, the law enforcement, the National Guard, the  Secret Service who stood in harm's way. While we were here debating,  they were pushing back. And I was literally interrupted midsentence  speaking here because we were all unaware of what was happening right  outside this room because of their faithfulness and because of what  they have done. I want to thank them.   Ronald Reagan once said: Peace is not the absence of conflict. It is  the ability to handle conflict by peaceful means.   The peaceful people in my State of Oklahoma want their questions  answered, but they don't want this, what happened today. They want to  do the right thing, and they also want to do it the right way. They  want to honor the constitutional process, but they also want to have  debate about election security because they want to make sure it is  right, which is why it is an important issue that still needs to be  resolved.   Transparency in government just doesn't seem like a bad idea.  Obviously, the Commission that we have asked for is not going to happen  at this point, and I understand that. And we are headed tonight toward  the certification of Joe Biden to be the President of the United  States, and we will work together in this body to be able to set a  peaceful example in the days ahead.   I yield the floor.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Democratic leader.
