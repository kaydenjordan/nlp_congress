 Madam President, I was absent due to a family  health matter requiring my attention when the Senate voted on vote No.  226 on confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 865, James Ray Knepp II,  of Ohio, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District  of Ohio. On vote No. 226, had I been present, I would have voted  yea.                            ____________________
