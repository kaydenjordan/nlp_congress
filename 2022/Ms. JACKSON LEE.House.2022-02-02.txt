 Mr. Speaker, sadly I rise to indicate that domestic  terrorism is on the rise in America. We have all faced the tragedies of  terroristic acts by our fellow Americans, chiefly, of course, the  January 6 insurrection, which it is so striking to me that people want  to dumb down the language used. It was insurrection by terrorists who  happened to be Americans.   We focused on 9/11. The very action of terrorism was associated  internationally. I was in this place, in this Capitol on 9/11, in a  meeting on 9/11. As we fled this building, clearly looking, as I went  to the right to escape what we thought was an imminent attack on this  building by foreign terrorists, I could see the building, the black  smoke of the plane that had just hit the Pentagon. It is real, and  January 6 is real as well.   So it is important that we as Members of Congress address this for  the Nation. One, it was real in Colleyville for my fellow Texans as  they were attacked in their synagogue, their place of worship. How  horrific anti-Semitism is. I stand against it, as I stand against the  horrors of representing what critical race theory is, which it is not  in any way an attempt to create racist divide. It is a college  phenomenon. It is a higher-grad phenomenon. It is not teaching our  elementary school children about George Washington Carver  [[Page H344]]  or the history of African Americans or slavery or the importance of  passing H.R. 40, the commission to study slavery and develop  reparations, not anything that is going to not stand on its own about  the wonderment of our history and acknowledging the original sin.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak of the dastardly behavior of the  numbers of historically Black colleges in this month who have now  received bomb threats. This is not something to take lightly. It is not  something to ignore. It is not something that we, as Members of  Congress, parents, who can understand the frightening prospect of  parents who send their children to school, just as it was certainly  frightening to have two officers in the Virginia college shot dead.   We don't know what the facts are in that, but certainly that is an  extreme action--to shoot dead. One of the witnesses said that when the  officer was down, this perpetrator shot them dead blank, again. How  outrageous. What could it be? I speculate we don't know what it is.   As we are in the midst of a hearing with Homeland Security, I call  upon Homeland Security and those reinforced entities dealing with  social media. I also think the FBI should specifically focus on  domestic terrorism with a more enhanced and reinforced section of  agents that are dealing both with social media but, also, dealing more  vigorously with an action that seems to be a collective action.   So I want to put into the Record, tragically, the following colleges:  Rust College, Tougaloo College, Jackson State, Alcorn State,  Mississippi Valley State, Fort Valley State, Spelman, Morgan State,  Coppin State, Harris-Stowe State University, Kentucky State, Xavier  University, Philander Smith College, Edward Waters University, Howard  University, the University of the District of Columbia.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this article from the Washington  Post.                         [From the Washington Post]      Fear, Anxiety Follow Third Wave of Bomb Threats Targeting HBCUs                   (By Lauren Lumpkin and Susan Svrluga)         For the third time in just a month, Howard University       warned its campus on Tuesday of a bomb threat. Each time, a       law enforcement search found no sign of the threatened       explosives.        But as students spilled out of academic buildings and       headed to their next classes, or lined up for burritos at a       nearby Chipotle, the campus was still on edge.        ``Most of us are feeling anxiety,'' said Troix McClendon, a       19-year-old freshman. ``There's not really a lot of       information.''        The bomb threats at Howard are part of a wave to hit       historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) this       year. On Jan. 4, at least eight HBCUs were threatened. On       Monday, at least six were.        Tuesday's threats, most coming early in the morning on the       first day of Black History Month, broadened and deepened the       sense of unease: At least 16 universities closed or swept       their campuses. In all, more than two dozen have faced       similar threats this year.        No bombs were found, and law enforcement agencies did not       identify possible motives. But the threats weigh heavily on       many, particularly given the emotional attachment and deep       loyalty many students, faculty, staff and alumni feel for the       campuses--a haven, a calling, a family.        ``February 1st, it's a moment when we usually celebrate the       innovation and the resilience of our people, and now to be       faced with an issue of this kind at our HBCUs nationwide, we       want our community to know that we're standing together,''       said Tashni-Ann Dubroy, Howard's executive vice president and       chief operating officer.        The university in the District has increased the police       presence on campus, reminded students of the safety resources       on campus and offered support, Dubroy said.        The FBI has said it is working with law enforcement       partners to address potential threats, according to the       agency, and it asked the public to report anything suspicious       to law enforcement immediately.        The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives       also is aware of bomb threats received by some HBCUs, Carolyn       Gwathmey, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in a written       statement. ``We take all potential threats seriously and we       regularly work with our law enforcement partners to determine       the threat credibility.''        She said it could not comment on the specific details at       this time because it is a fluid situation with ongoing       investigations.        The threats in the past month have touched some of the       country's most iconic schools, such as Howard and Spelman       College, as well as regional institutions all across the       country, triggering cancellations, lockdowns and fear.        On Tuesday, the schools targeted included: Rust College,       Tougaloo College, Jackson State University and Alcorn State       University in Mississippi, as well as Mississippi Valley       State University; Fort Valley State University and Spelman       College in Georgia; Morgan State University and Coppin State       University in Maryland; Harris-Stowe State University in       Missouri; Kentucky State University; Xavier University of       Louisiana; Philander Smith College in Arkansas; Edward Waters       University in Florida; Howard University and the University       of the District of Columbia.        ``We stand in solidarity with our historically Black       institutions,'' Jay A. Perman, chancellor of the University       System of Maryland--which includes Coppin State and Bowie       State, another school targeted by a threat this week--said       Tuesday in a written statement.        He added: ``Knowing that their strength is our strength,       and that their power--on display like never before--will not       be diminished by cowardly acts meant to menace and harm and       intimidate. If the intent of these threats was to restrict       access to our historically Black institutions--to restrict       access to higher education itself--it will fail. If it was       meant to sow division, it will fail. If it was meant to       terrorize students and communities of color, it will fail.''        At the University of the District of Columbia on Tuesday,       officials cleared a threat placed about 3:20 a.m. and opened       the campus.        Xavier University of Louisiana evacuated the area of the       threat and issued a shelter-in-place order for students       living on campus, according to Patrice Bell, the school's       vice president and chief of staff, until it was cleared to       reopen by law-enforcement officials.        Tougaloo College, one of several HBCUs threatened Tuesday       in Mississippi, received a call about 4:20 a.m. that brought       FBI and other law enforcement to sweep campuses. Even after       the threat was found to be unsubstantiated, the campus       remained in virtual mode for students, faculty and staff on       Tuesday, with college officials pledging to remain vigilant.       Mississippi Valley State University locked down after a       threat was received through its guardhouse.        Philander Smith College, in Arkansas, lifted its lockdown       and resumed classes and operations at noon Tuesday. Kentucky       State University issued an all-clear Tuesday and planned to       resume normal operations and classes Wednesday.        Morgan State University was also targeted. Leaders received       the threat around 4:50 a.m. and issued a shelter-in-place       order. Classes went virtual and employees were told to work       from home.        ``My main concern is my students' mental health. As college       students, we already have so much mentally to deal with,''       said Jamera Forbes, a senior at Morgan State and student body       president. ``We've tried to push through and overcome so much       with covid over the years, and we're just trying to get back       to a norm.''        At Howard, freshman Jalen McKinney, 18, said the threats       are making him worried, but some on campus seem less       concerned.        ``People are kind of brushing it off because it didn't       happen,'' McKinney said. D.C. and university police performed       a sweep after the threat was made about 2:55 a.m. ``But at       the same time, it could happen.''        An expert in campus security was reassuring about the       potential danger.        ``I've always subscribed to the theory that bombers bomb       and threateners threaten,'' said Robert Mueck, director of       public safety at St. John's College and a member of the       International Association of Campus Law Enforcement       Administrators' Domestic Preparedness Committee. Calling in a       bomb threat is ``more of a nuisance crime,'' he said, ``like       back in high school, kids pulling a fire alarm to get out of       an exam.''        Of course, he said, officials cannot ignore it--they must       ensure there is no explosive.        But Mueck cautioned against overreactions by college       officials, because the warnings, building closures and       lockdowns are disruptive and alarming.        These particular threats are troubling, though, he said,       because they appear to be targeting HBCUs, and might be       motivated by bias. The menace is there: ``It's almost like       reaching out and saying, 'We can get you,''' he said.        While law enforcement have not identified suspects or named       their motives, the recent threats evoked the long history of       intimidation and violence against Black schools, said Greg E.       Carr, chair of Howard's Afro-American studies department and       associate professor of Africana studies.        ``There is this deep-seated racial insecurity that has       historically come from segments of White populations that       feel that somehow the self-improvement of Black folks will       cost them something, either in prestige or social position,''       Carr said. ``Whether any of these threats would manifest into       anything tangible or not, it's just the idea that `Ya'll are       a little too big for your britches.' ''        As officials continue to monitor the situation, students       and faculty are hoping to get back to business.        ``Our response has been, historically, to simply redouble       our efforts,'' Carr said. ``The intimidation never works.''     Mr. Speaker, my real point is that we need to get  serious about domestic terrorism. The lives lost through domestic  terrorism is compelling and increasing. Until we get serious about the  actions of the Oath Keepers and the boogaloo boys  [[Page H345]]  and the Nazi wearers and proponents, in light of the First Amendment,  which as a member of the Committee on the Judiciary I highly respect,  we are losing lives. Our children are in jeopardy. Misrepresentation is  occurring about innocent discussion about race and history. Let us put  that kind of attack aside. Let us find a way to deal with domestic  terrorism to save lives in America.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that I will draw upon my colleagues. I will be  introducing legislation, as I have done, on dealing with this idea of  bomb threats to universities in this instance, bomb threats to  historically Black colleges last week and coming into this week. God  knows what will be next. I pray for their safety, as I do all students  and all Americans. We must stand against domestic terrorism.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, this is reminiscent of more than a  decade and a half ago, but it means that it is long overdue for us to  now start anew with the America COMPETES Act, H.R. 4521.   Let me, first of all, say that in the passage of legislation, isn't  it exciting that we have a bipartisan infrastructure bill that will  match very nicely along with the America COMPETES Act and, as well, we  will pass the Build Back Better Act, that has a sizeable proportion of  broadband and many other aspects dealing with climate.   So I rise today to support H.R. 4521 for a number of reasons, but I  will put in the forefront the idea that it will promote around the  world America's values of justice and competitiveness, equality and,  yes, human rights. And all the nations that pretend to be competitive,  but yet do not have the aspect of compassion and laws that the United  States has will be in the back seat, and we will be in the front seat.   Let me, first of all, say that we are bringing relief to all the  folks that are trying to get their automobiles; $45 billion in the  American fund for chips that will incentivize private sector  investments and continued American leadership in semiconductor  fabrication, and will address simply the supply chain disruption, and  ensure that more semiconductors are produced here at home.   There are also jobs for my inner-city young people, my rural young  people.   I was at TRRX in the city of Houston, and we were looking at--a truck  driver talked to me and said, I stopped driving trucks. I had health  issues, and I am now dealing with technology training that they are  giving in at-risk communities.   Strengthening the supply chain with $45 billion to improve the  Nation's supply chain and national security by preventing the shortages  of critical goods and ensuring that more of these goods are made right.   And advancing what is very important to me, having served on the  Science Committee, NASA is in my backyard, the Johnson Space Center,  and I am excited about what we have been able to do over the decades.  But  [[Page H354]]  now we will be able to focus on scientific research, technology and  innovation and excellence. That creates jobs.   Madam Speaker, I rise with enthusiasm to support H.R. 4521. Let's  compete. Let's show our values. Let's train, and let's make money. Make  it in America.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the House and the Committee on  Homeland Security, and as Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, and Homeland Security, I rise in strong support of the Rule  governing debate of Rules Committee Print 117-31 and H.R. 4521, the  America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing Pre-Eminence in  Technology and Economic Strength or ``America COMPETES Act of 2022,''  as well as the underlying legislation.   I also support the Rule as it pertains to H.R. 3485--Global Respect  Act H.R. 4445--Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual  Harassment Act of 2021, both of which I strongly support on the merits.   Madam Speaker, the America COMPETES Act of 2022 is a bold legislative  package that makes transformational new investments in research,  innovation and American manufacturing that will ensure that America can  outcompete any nation in the world, now and for decades to come.   The package will accelerate production of critical semiconductor  chips, strengthen the supply chain to make more goods in America,  turbocharge our research capacity to lead the technologies of the  future, and advance our global competitiveness, while supporting strong  labor standards and human rights, among other key provisions.   The America COMPETES Act of 2022 is a bold, comprehensive package to  strengthen America's competitiveness, which includes the ``Creating the  CHIPS for America Fund,'' providing $52 billion to incentivize private- sector investments and continue American leadership in semiconductor  fabrication, helping address supply chain disruptions and ensure that  more semiconductors are produced here at home.   The legislation strengthening the supply chain and American  manufacturing by authorizing $45 billion to improve our nation's supply  chains and strengthen our economy and national security by preventing  shortages of critical goods and ensuring that more of these goods are  made right here in the United States.   The America COMPETES Act of 2022 advances American scientific  research, technology, and innovation excellence by making major new  solutions-driven investments in every aspect of innovation and  scientific research, making the kind of investments that will lead to  breakthrough discoveries.   I am particularly pleased that the America COMPETES Act will help  maintain and secure America's global competitiveness and leadership  through economic development diplomacy, human rights, and partnering  with allies by including numerous provisions to strengthen and promote  America's leadership around the globe, including in such areas as  investing in partnerships and alliances, investing in standing up for  America's values, expanding our investments in diplomacy, and promoting  human rights.   Madam Speaker, the United States has long been a beacon of excellence  in science and technology in the world.   I have worked hard on the COMPETES Act over time to make sure that  this legislation includes provisions that stimulates government  reinvestment in the private sector; and reimagination of the Federal  government's approach to innovation that ignites and excites new ideas  that ensure that the United States remains the leader in innovation  globally.   The need to reinvest in and reimagine our approach to science and  innovation has become a national imperative so I am very pleased that  the legislation before us retains provisions I sponsored that were  included when the America COMPETES Act was previously passed.   One of those provisions, which is incorporated in RCP 117-31  addresses the STEM education gap for K-12 students by creating State  and regional workshops to train K-12 teachers in project-based science  and technology learning, allowing them to provide instruction in  initiating robotics and other STEM competition team development  programs.   Another provision included in the legislation requires the National  Science Foundation (NSF) to report on the economic and ethnic breakdown  of ``Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics'' (STEM) industry  internship program recipients.   Facilitating links between institutes of higher education and the  private sector is vital to ensuring that education enables a skilled  and relevant workforce.   Such links are especially important for minorities and under-served  communities because these students often lack alternative avenues to  connect their education with an industry.   Internship experience is an increasingly vital component of a  successful resume, yet the unpaid nature of internships is cost- prohibitive for many people.   Mandating that the National Science Foundation report on the economic  and ethnic breakdown of STEM program recipients will help ensure that  minorities and economically-disadvantaged students have adequate access  to internships that bridge STEM academia and industry.   I am hopeful this data will provide evidence of robust participation  by minority and economically-disadvantaged students; however, if such  students are not fully participating, these reporting requirements will  provide Congress with the data it needs to facilitate broader  participation.   Now is the time to recommit to boldly and strategically investing in  our nation's future--to promote America's economic strength, the well- being of our communities, our national security and our leadership in  the world. This transformative legislation will ensure that America can  out-compete any nation, for decades to come.   Madam Speaker, I also support the provisions of the rule governing  debate of H.R. 4445, the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault  and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021, bipartisan and bicameral legislation  that empowers survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment by  giving them a choice to go to court instead of being forced into  arbitration.   This legislation would amend the Federal Arbitration Act for disputes  involving sexual assault and sexual harassment in order to stop  employers and businesses from forcing employees and customers out of  the court system and into arbitration.   It would ensure that predispute arbitration clauses and waivers of  the right to bring joint actions in cases of sexual assault or sexual  harassment would not be valid or enforceable for cases that are filed  under Federal, Tribal, or State law.   Under current law, many employment and other contracts require  binding arbitration for a wide range of matters before a dispute  arises, which denies survivors the ability to decide whether to pursue  their claim with the procedural protections provided by courts, and  silences victims of abuse by forcing them into a confidential dispute  forum without the right to appeal.   More than 60 million Americans are subject to mandatory arbitration  clauses in the workplace, often without realizing it until they come  forward to bring a claim against their employer.   The Report of the Co-Chairs of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission's Select Task Force on the Study of Harassment in the  Workplace notes that between 50-75 percent of women have faced some  form of unwanted or unwelcome sexual harassment in the workplace.   Additionally, contracts for services may include mandatory  arbitration clauses in the fine print that shield companies and  businesses from being held publicly accountable for the harm caused.   I support this necessary legislation because it advances efforts to  prevent and address sexual harassment and sexual assault, strengthen  rights, protect victims, and promote access to justice.   Finally, I strongly support H.R. 3485 the Global Respect Act, which  would mandate the listing of, and visa restrictions on foreign persons  responsible for or complicit in human rights violations against  lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+)  persons.   In the face of rising violence targeting LGBTQI+ persons around the  world, the Administration recognizes that LGBTQI+ persons face serious  and unique threats to their safety due to their sexual orientation,  gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.   While many countries have made tremendous strides in embracing  equality for LGBTQI+ community members, other countries remain stagnant  or, worse, are undertaking steps to further marginalize or harm LGBTQI+  community members.   That is why I support H.R. 3485, a bi-partisan bill, which requires  the Administration to provide Congress with a list of foreign  individuals found responsible for human rights violations against  LGBTQI+ persons abroad, and equally important, mandates that  individuals included on this list are ineligible for visas to, or entry  into, the United States.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this legislation and urge all  Members to join me in voting for the rule governing debate of RCP 117- 31, the America COMPETES Act of 2022, H.R. 4445, the Ending Forced  Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021, and  H.R. 3485, the Global Respect Act.    Madam Speaker, first of all, I think it is important  to say how great it is to have an opportunity to create jobs and  promote human rights at the same time, while respecting our fellow  Americans, Asian Pacific Americans.   I think it is important that we make that statement, that as we  promote this very important legislation, Asian Pacific Islanders and  others will also have the respect of this Nation because we do believe  in human rights.   But I want to pause for a moment to be able to thank my friend, my  colleague, the Honorable Eddie Bernice Johnson, for sticking to her  higher values, her commitment to science for more than two decades,  going on three decades.   As I watched her on the Science Committee, first as a member myself,  and then as she proceeded to take the leadership reins, look where we  are today, with an outstanding America COMPETES Act that builds on  previous legislation, brings together 11 jurisdictional committees, and  comes out on the side of creating jobs. We owe her a great debt of  gratitude, and I am grateful to call her a Member of the United  [[Page H825]]  States Congress, but I am even more grateful to call her a fellow  Texan.    This legislation will answer the questions of those who are  complaining about the supply chain because $45 billion will improve our  Nation's supply chain and strengthen our economy and national security  by preventing shortages of critical goods.   There is an outcry of inflation. There is an outcry of empty shelves,  but I will tell you that the immediate signing of this bill will turn  the corner for all Americans. I am grateful that we will be advancing  the American scientific research technology and innovation.   Just the other day I was at the Ion Center sponsored by Rice, and  looking at a number of technology companies in my 18th Congressional  District. I was glad to talk to a former truck driver who was there in  a program that dealt with training at-risk persons or persons who were  changing careers. He was saying he could not do trucking anymore, but  how glad he was to do this.   I am also very glad that legislation that I had is in this bill  regarding STEM and also K-12 students by creating State and regional  workshops to create jobs. This is a bill that will continue to create  jobs and working with the National Science Foundation to ensure the  diversity in STEM.   I will continue to work on these issues and create jobs. The COMPETES  Act creates jobs.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the House and the Committee on  Homeland Security, and as Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, and Homeland Security, I rise in strong support of Rules  Committee Print 117-31 and H.R. 4521, the America Creating  Opportunities for Manufacturing Pre-Eminence in Technology and Economic  Strength or ``America COMPETES) Act of 2022,'' as well as the  underlying legislation.   I particularly wish to thank my colleague from Texas, Congresswoman  Eddie Bernice Johnson, the Chair of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee, for her extraordinary leadership and the progress and  success made possible by her steadfast commitment to fairness and  equality.   For 15 terms the constituents of her congressional district have been  ably represented by one of this body's great legislators, who will be  missed deeply when she leaves this body at the end of the current  Congress.   Madam Speaker, the America COMPETES Act of 2022 is a bold legislative  package that makes transformational new investments in research,  innovation and American manufacturing that will ensure that America can  outcompete any nation in the world, now and for decades to come.

Madam Speaker, I strongly support this legislation and urge all  Members to join me in voting for the rule governing debate of RCP 117- 31, the America COMPETES Act of 2022.
