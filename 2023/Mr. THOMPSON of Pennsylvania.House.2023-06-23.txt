 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District 2023 Congressional Art  Competition winner, Alma Swartzentruber.   The annual art competition, organized by the Congressional Institute,  showcases the artwork of high school students from across every  congressional district in the country. Alma is a recent graduate from  the Keystone High School in Clarion County. Her winning artwork is  titled, ``Great Horned Owl.'' She created this piece with charcoal and  graphite.   Alma's work was selected by an independent panel of judges from 73  entries, with a record number of participants in the 15th District's  Congressional Art Competition.   I would also like to congratulate Alma's teacher, Ms. Janet Hockman,  and her parents for the role that they played in Alma's success.   All of the winning pieces will be displayed for the year in the  Cannon tunnel, where they will be viewed by Members of Congress, staff,  and many visitors to the Capitol each and every day.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Alma on her great work. I am proud to  have her artwork representing the 15th District.  [[Page H3129]]                                ____________________
