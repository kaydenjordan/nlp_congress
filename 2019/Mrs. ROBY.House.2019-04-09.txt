 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for  leading this very important conversation here tonight, and I thank all  my colleagues from our neighboring States and across this country for  keeping this issue in the forefront of the American people's minds.   Over the last several months, Americans in many corners of this  country have experienced a devastating loss of life, property, and  livelihood because of wildfires, flooding, and severe storms. I am here  tonight to express my strong support for the many Alabamians, both in  the Second District and in neighboring Lee County, who have been badly  impacted by severe weather.   Last October, areas of the Wiregrass region in Alabama's Second  Congressional District were ravaged when Hurricane Michael made  landfall. Barbour, Dale, Henry, Geneva, and Houston Counties were the  most severely impacted.   Throughout the Southeast, people lost their loved ones and their  homes, and our farmers were dealt a devastating blow during the middle  of harvest.                                time  1730    This unprecedented disaster resulted in a tremendous economic setback  for our agriculture community and our State. Last month, our neighbors  in Lee County faced extreme devastation when tornadoes touched down.  Many were killed, and many homes were lost and destroyed.   Madam Speaker, we are here tonight because these people need help.  Here in Congress, it is our responsibility to make disaster recovery  funds available now. I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to stop playing political games with disaster funding. By politicizing  this humanitarian issue, we are playing politics with people's lives.   We must immediately advance commonsense, nonpartisan disaster  assistance for the people who have been hit hardest and are struggling  to recover. I am hopeful that alongside my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle that a solution will be reached soon. Many Alabamians--many  Americans--are depending on it.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for leading this  discussion.
