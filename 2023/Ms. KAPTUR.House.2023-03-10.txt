 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the recently named  Best Coastal Small Town in America, Sandusky, Ohio. Now, Sandusky is  the home of Cedar Point, America's Roller Coast. We invite you to come.  This town is the pride of Ohio's Ninth Congressional District, and this  recognition is a true accomplishment.   Clubhouse No. 3 SportSocial, a local sports bar, erupted into cheers  last Friday when dozens of residents at a watch party heard the results  come in. Their enthusiasm is emblematic of small towns across America  where people will gather as a community to celebrate achievements, both  big and small. While this is a big accomplishment for a small Ohio  town, it truly represents the best of America.   Sandusky derives its name from the Seneca Native American Tribe and  translates into ``cold water,'' but the residents of this town are some  of the warmest, kindest people you will ever meet.   I encourage people from across America to visit Sandusky, come to  enjoy our hospitality, and enjoy the astounding beauty of Lake Erie's  freshwater south coast and the warmest coast in the entire freshwater  Great Lakes.                            ____________________
