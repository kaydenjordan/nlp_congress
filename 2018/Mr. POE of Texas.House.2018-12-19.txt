 Mr. Speaker, Megan Rondini was a student at the  University of Alabama. She originally was from Austin, Texas, but chose  the University of Alabama as her school of choice. Megan went to school  there.   While she was a student, she came in contact with a former student  whose nickname was ``Sweet T.'' He took her to his residence, which was  literally a plantation home, and sexually assaulted her. Megan then  jumped out of the second-story window of his residence and went to the  hospital. That is where her nightmare continued.   While Megan was at the hospital, the people in charge there didn't  know how to deal with a sexual assault victim, and the sexual assault  exam was botched.   She left the hospital and went to the sheriff's department. They  started interviewing her and found out that the alleged perpetrator was  from an important family in the area. All of a sudden, they backed off,  according to her. They didn't prosecute Sweet T. In fact, they read  Megan a Miranda warning.   Megan went to the University of Alabama and sought a counselor. The  counselor found out who the alleged perpetrator was and said: ``I can't  help you. This is a conflict of interest. I know this person.''   The University of Alabama didn't provide her another counselor.   Megan then went into a depression. She left the University of Alabama  and transferred to SMU in Dallas, Texas. Shortly after she transferred  to SMU, Megan Rondini took her own life. You see, Mr. Speaker, she got  the death penalty for being a victim of crime. Nothing ever happened to  the alleged perpetrator.   There are a lot of problems and issues that came up with the way  Megan was treated at the hospital and how she was treated at the  sheriff's department and by the university. There was no sexual assault  forensic examiner or sexual assault forensic nurse at the hospital to  take care of her.   And who are these people?   These are wonderful people who are trained to deal with sexual  assault victims. The hospital didn't have one of those for her. It  turns out there are many hospitals in the country that  [[Page H10274]]  don't have these individuals to help sexual assault victims. They are  trained to deal with victims exclusively.   I have talked and met with Megan's parents, Cindi and Mike, who still  live in Austin, and we have talked and met with a lot of Members of  Congress on what we can do about this. We have filed H.R. 7292, a  bipartisan bill. Issues regarding victims of crime are bipartisan.   The Megan Rondini and Leah Griffin Sexual Assault Victims Protection  Act provides for a task force and a multitude of other things so we can  get this problem solved and have hospitals get it together so we treat  sexual assault victims the way they should be treated.   I am not going to go into all the details, but it is great, and  bipartisan. It is cosponsored by Congresswoman Jayapal. We have many  Members on both sides working on this issue to bring it to the House  floor under suspension of the rules or unanimous consent to get this  legislation passed.                                time  1215    It is my understanding, as of high noon today, that this legislation  is not going to come to the floor of this Congress. It is my hope and  desire that it comes next year when I am not here but other people take  up the mantle to protect people like Megan Rondini and Leah Griffin.   Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of lobbyists in Washington, D.C. I  understand there are 5,000 lobbying groups. That is 10 for every Member  of Congress up here, advocating on all kinds of things.   Victims of crimes do not have high-dollar lobbyists. We are their  voice. We are their only voice, Mr. Speaker. We ought to start acting  like it and bring legislation to the floor on a bipartisan basis and  not find excuses not to do it, because we are it. People like Megan  Rondini are protected by the same Constitution that protects defendants  of crime.   It is important that we help those people and their families make  sure that they don't continue to be victims of crime after the crime is  committed. The system should not continue to make them victims of  crime, whether it is the hospital, whether it is the sheriff's  department or the university.   I do want to say, Mr. Speaker, the University of Alabama has made  some changes. Texas A&M has made changes due to the 12th Woman group  and a group of victims at Texas A&M that are talking to Members of  Congress, too.   I hope that Congress will see this legislation as a priority and pass  it, because it is the right thing to do, even if we have to wait until  next year.   And that is just the way it is, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________
