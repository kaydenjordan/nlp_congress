 Madam President, I rise today to congratulate Gen. John  E. Hyten on his retirement from the U.S. Air Force. I also want to  extend my congratulations to his wife, Laura, and note the remarkable  bond they share. Their partnership in life has enabled his success in  uniform, and his achievements are truly theirs.   Across four decades of service, General Hyten has risen through the  ranks to become one of the most respected voices in our military, and  many in this Chamber rely on his deep knowledge and expertise. This is  especially true on matters relating to space and nuclear deterrence.   I got to know General Hyten when he became a Nebraska constituent  following his appointment to be the commander of U.S. Strategic Command  in 2016. This was actually General Hyten's second tour of duty at  Offutt Air Force Base, having previously commanded the 6th Space  Operations Squadron there in the late nineties.   During his 3 years as the commander of STRATCOM, I was privileged to  work closely with him, not just as the senior Senator from Nebraska,  but also the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee's Strategic  Forces subcommittee, which directly oversees STRATCOM's mission areas.   During this span, we witnessed a marked shift in the strategic  landscape, with worrying trends with respect to adversary behavior in  space and investment in nuclear arms greatly accelerating. This  elevated the importance of STRATCOM's mission and meant that, as its  commander, General Hyten was on the front line of some of the most  daunting security challenges facing our Nation.   During his tenure, he played a key role in the Department of  Defense's response to these evolving threats. As space transformed into  a warfighting domain, his candid advice was invaluable in Congress  reorganization of the Department of Defense's space enterprise,  including the creation of the Space Force and elevation of Space  Command to a full-fledged unified combatant command.   He was also an extremely effective advocate for our Nation's nuclear  forces, which continue to be the bedrock of our national security. As a  vocal champion of nuclear modernization, he helped make the case for  renewing the triad and broadening the modernization conversation to  increase focus on nuclear command, control and communications--or NC3-- systems, as well as National Nuclear Security Administration's nuclear  complex.   He played an important part in drafting the 2018 Nuclear Posture  Review, which marked the first time since the end of the Cold War that  an NPR occurred against a backdrop of growing nuclear threats and  therefore had to confront the uncomfortable reality that Russia and  China had not followed our lead in reducing nuclear stockpiles.   He explained the problem with his customary candor: ``When we started  de-emphasizing nuclear weapons, what did the rest of the world do? The  rest of the world did exactly the opposite. So if we de-emphasize  nuclear weapons, we're putting the country at jeopardy and we can never  allow that to happen.''   Those sage words are still true today and should continue to guide  U.S. nuclear policy. They also reflect another of General Hyten's  characteristics that I value greatly: his unwavering focus on the  threats facing our Nation. A tireless advocate for a return of threat- based planning, he always endeavored to base his approach on the  changing threat picture and to educate those around him about the  activities of our adversaries.   When he was nominated to be the next Vice Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, I felt very strongly that he was the right leader,  with the right expertise, at the right time. I knew he would bring all  of the qualities that distinguished him as a STRATCOM commander to bear  in his new role, and he did not disappoint.   As Vice Chairman, he continued to discharge his responsibilities with  great professionalism and dedication, and his confirmation to the  position also meant that the Nation could benefit from his leadership  for 2 more years.   Sadly, that time is at an end. And while the 40 years of exemplary  service Gen. John Hyten has rendered make this retirement well-earned,  I hope he will continue to share his wisdom and counsel. I wish General  Hyten and his wife, Laura, a wonderful retirement together and all the  best in their future.                            ____________________
