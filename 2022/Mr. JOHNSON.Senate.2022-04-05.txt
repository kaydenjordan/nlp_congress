 Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley.   What Senator Grassley and I have showed over the course of six  speeches are the actual bank records of financial transactions tying  President Biden's son Hunter and his brother James to businesses that  are essentially arms of the communist Chinese regime. But the Biden  business ventures include activities in many more countries than just  China.   In our September and November 2020 reports, we showed a vast web of  Biden family foreign financial entanglements that were largely ignored  by the media and falsely labeled ``Russian disinformation'' by our  Democratic colleagues. As outrageous as the suppression of our reports  and the false attacks were, perhaps the most egregious behavior came  from 51 former intelligence Agency officials who lent their names and  reputations to an effort designed to convince the American public that  Hunter Biden's laptop had ``all the classic earmarks of a Russian  information operation.''   Without any evidence backing their assertion, they engaged in their  own information operation by signing a public letter right before the  election. Their letter was actual disinformation, coming from what are  supposed to be trusted former members of our U.S. intelligence  Agencies. They should all be ashamed and held accountable for spreading  this disinformation. By signing that disinformation letter, they  reinforced false claims that the records on the laptop were not  legitimate.   By casting doubt on evidence of the Bidens' corrupt practices, these  former intelligence officials interfered in the 2020 election to a far  greater extent than Russia could have ever hoped to achieve. Their  willing accomplices in the press amplified this disinformation letter  and, by doing so, were equally guilty of egregious election  interference.   In August 2020, I wrote a public letter detailing the history,  purpose, and goals of my oversight and investigations. In that letter,  I laid out the timeline of Joe and Hunter Biden's involvement in  Ukraine. The timeline is very revealing.   It starts in February 2014. That was the month of the Revolution of  Dignity in Ukraine. Two months later, on April 16, 2014, then-Vice  President Biden met with his son's business partner Devon Archer, now a  convicted felon, at the White House.   I just want to pause and just let that sink in a little bit. Devon  Archer is now a convicted felon. He got a meeting in the White House  with the Vice President of the United States. That is kind of a big  deal.   The press didn't ask many questions. Five days after that meeting in  the White House, April 21, Joe Biden visited Ukraine, and the media  described him as the ``public face of the administration's handling of  Ukraine.'' The next day, on April 22, Devon Archer joined the board of  Burisma. What a coincidence.   On April 28, 6 days later, British officials seized $23 million from  the London bank accounts of Burisma's owner Mykola Zlochevsky. Let that  sink in a little bit. Six days after Devon Archer joined the board of  Burisma, a day after Vice President Biden visited Ukraine, which was 5  days after he met with Devon Archer in the White House, British  officials seized $23 million from the corrupt owner of Burisma.   On May 13, 2014, 3 weeks later, Hunter Biden joined the board of  Burisma. What a coincidence.   Because of the findings in our reports and the excellent  investigative journalism on the part of John Solomon, we also know that  Hunter was involved with Yelena Baturina, the corrupt and now- sanctioned wife of the former mayor of Moscow, during the exact same  period of time.   On February 14, 2014, Baturina wired $3.5 million to Rosemont Seneca  Thornton, an investment firm cofounded by Hunter Biden.   Between April 4 and April 5, 2014--again, the same month that Joe  Biden met with Devon Archer in the White House and Devon became a  member of the board of Burisma--Hunter Biden and Devon Archer sent  emails about meeting with Baturina, potentially relating to a business  deal in Chelsea, NY.   On April 13, 2014, 9 days before Devon Archer joined the board of  Burisma, Hunter Biden and Devon Archer discussed a potential deal  involving Baturina. Archer wrote that Baturina ``confirmed green light  to fund deposit.'' Archer continued:         Just spent two hours on the phone with Kiev. I am confident       at this point this is a good if not life changing deal if the       Ukraine doesn't collapse in the meantime.    It is quite interesting to see how much significant activity  involving the Bidens and corrupt actors in Russia and Ukraine occurred  within a 6-week period, only 2 months after the Ukrainian Revolution of  Dignity. It sure looks like they intended to cash in on the turmoil in  Ukraine.   In my August 2020 letter, I listed a number of questions about then- Vice President Biden's interaction with Hunter Biden's business partner  and other family members' foreign financial dealings. In making this  letter public, my hope was that the press, the very uninquisitive  press, would begin to ask then-Presidential candidate Joe Biden these  important and legitimate questions.    It should come as no surprise that the corporate media was completely  uninterested and failed to conduct any investigative journalism. Nearly  2 years after I wrote this public letter, the mainstream media has  still not  [[Page S1971]]  adequately pressed President Biden for answers to these very legitimate  questions; for example, No. 1: Why did Joe Biden meet with Devon Archer  at the White House on April 16, 2014? What did they discuss? Did they  discuss anything related to Ukraine, Hunter Biden, or Burisma?   No. 2, was Joe Biden aware that Devon Archer joined the board of  Burisma 6 days after that meeting, 1 day after he visited Ukraine?   No. 3, does Joe Biden believe Burisma and its owner are corrupt?   No. 4, when did Joe Biden first become aware that Hunter Biden also  joined the board of Burisma?   No. 5, when did Joe Biden first become aware of how much money Hunter  Biden was being compensated by Burisma? Senator Grassley and my report  showed it was close to $4 million.   No. 6, what does Joe Biden know about Hunter or James Biden's  dealings with China?   No. 7, what does Joe Biden know about financial benefits his brother  and sister-in-law have obtained because of their relationships to him?   Investigative reporter John Solomon has added a few more questions to  my list, including: No. 1, what, if anything, did Joe Biden know about  his son's dealings with Russian oligarch Yelena Baturina?   No. 2, a 2017 series of memos referred to a Chinese business deal  that involved Hunter Biden and included a 10-percent equity for the  ``big guy.'' What did Joe Biden know about this specific deal, and who  was the ``big guy''?   No. 3, emails on Hunter Biden's laptop, now in the possession of the  FBI, refer to shared accounts or bills between Joe Biden and Hunter.  Did Hunter ever give Joe Biden any money, gift, or financial benefit  from Hunter's business dealings?   After a long-overdue analysis, the New York Times and the Washington  Post have finally admitted that records from Hunter's laptop are  authentic, which means--although they will never admit this--that  Senator Grassley and I were right, and they were wrong.   It is interesting to read how limited and muted their mea culpas are.  My guess is that they learned a lot from their coverage of Nixon's  Watergate scandal coverup. They learned that when you have been caught  in a coverup--and that is what has happened here--you try to limit the  damage by telling a little bit of the truth. In the intelligence world,  this strategy is called a ``limited hangout.'' The Watergate  coconspirators called it a ``modified limited hangout.''   Regardless of what you call it, what the New York Times and the  Washington Post are doing is not telling the whole truth. I doubt they  ever will. But just in case they decide to pursue the truth with a  little bit more rigor, they can use the above list of relevant  questions as a good starting point for what they should be asking  President Biden.   For our part, Senator Grassley and I will continue to ask tough  questions, review more information and records, and transparently  provide that information to the American public. We intend to pursue  and uncover the truth.   I will now turn the floor back over to Senator Grassley for his  closing remarks.
