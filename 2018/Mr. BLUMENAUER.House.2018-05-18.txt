 Mr. Chairman, I have been involved for 20 years to  try and stop the barbaric practice of animal fighting, dogfighting,  cockfighting, and slowly but surely, we have made the point under  Federal law. It is a felony crime: to sponsor; exhibit an animal in a  fighting venue; to buy, sell, deliver, possess, train animals; or to  bring a minor to an animal fight.   But this has been long and slow and painful. And I violently disagree  with the notion that we should have one set of rules. It is already a  felony in Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. We shouldn't have  one set of rules for some territories, and for the rest of the States.  At core, this is a barbaric, inhumane practice. The animals are drugged  to make them more ferocious.   In cockfighting, they are equipped with metal spurs to slash each  other--fighting to the death. I am sorry, this Congress has rejected  the notion that this is culturally specific. Animal cruelty has no  place in any territory, in any State, in any venue, by any race or  ethnic group or cultural tradition. We have gone past that. We heard  those arguments in some States when we were fighting to achieve these  protections.   I strongly urge that we continue this 20-year fight to protect  animals and protect people from being involved with this horrific  activity, and close what is, in fact, a loophole. We should have no  separate rules for States, territories, or anywhere under our  jurisdiction.                                time  1015    The Roskam-Blumenauer amendment will fix this and finish a journey  that we started 20 years ago. But sadly, because some people think it  is acceptable, we are still going to have to fight this battle in the  illegal sector as well.
