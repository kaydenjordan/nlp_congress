 Madam Speaker, crime is soaring under President Biden  and the Democrats' soft-on-crime policies nationally and in my home  State of California.   More police officers were killed in the line of duty in 2021 than in  any year since 1995. Last year, over a dozen U.S. cities set new  homicide records. Shootings of police officers have increased 63  percent compared to this time in 2020.   Instead of addressing these deadly statistics, some Democrats in blue  cities want to defund and demonize our police.   Instead of focusing on dangerous individuals with illegal weapons who  commit these deadly crimes, President Biden has chosen to attack law- abiding Americans exercising their Second Amendment rights. He wants  the ATF to ban privately made firearms, so-called ghost guns, which are  predominantly a hobbyist option and require more time, tooling, and  dedication to craftsmanship than most criminals are willing to invest.   Instead of throwing the books at criminals, they are coming after  private citizens, even going so far as to call parents at school board  meetings terrorists.   Now, they want to introduce legislation that would target law  enforcement and servicemembers as potential domestic terrorists. This  is deeply offensive to our men and women in uniform and also goes  against evidence that terrorist incidents are far more likely to be  committed against military and law enforcement than by military and law  enforcement.   This is wrongheaded, and we must stop this.                            ____________________
