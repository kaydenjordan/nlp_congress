 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 5262, the Medicare Orthotics and Prosthetics Patient-Centered  Care Act, a bill I am happy to cosponsor with my colleague,  Representative   Mike Thompson of California.   After being seriously injured, the last thing any individual should  be worried about is further hardships like financial stress or fraud. I  have seen these challenges firsthand, having served many years as a  therapist and a licensed nursing home administrator.   I am proud to cosponsor this bipartisan bill to help mitigate these  burdens in the O&P sector and ensure these individuals have access to  quality, affordable orthotics and prosthetics.   The Orthotics and Prosthetics Patient-Centered Care Act aims to:   Ensure truly off-the-shelf orthotics are eligible for competitive  bidding;   Prohibit the practice of drop shipping prostheses and custom orthoses  to Medicare beneficiaries;   Create requirements that better distinguish orthotists and  prosthetists from suppliers; and   Standardize the definition of orthotics and prosthetics.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5262 to ensure quality orthotic  and prosthetic care for Medicare patients and better protect these  individuals from fraud.                            ____________________
