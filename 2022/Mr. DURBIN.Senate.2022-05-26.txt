 Mr. President, this morning we are going to consider H.R.  350, which is legislation which I introduced some time ago. I want to  describe it because it has been inaccurately described before and let  Members know what they are voting on.   First, what does it relate to? Domestic terrorism. Is that a Federal  crime? You bet it is, and this particular bill makes reference to that  crime. Hate crimes? It refers to that too. Is that a real crime? It is  a Federal crime, and we refer to it specifically.   So what new crimes are created in this bill? None. Not one. What we  are doing is asking the Federal Agencies that have the responsibility  of national security to give us timely reports on the incidence of  domestic terrorism, and we say to them there are categories which the  FBI has already established of domestic terrorism. And those  categories--I would like to spell out a couple of them to you so it is  pretty clear what we are going after here: racially and ethnically  motivated violent extremism; anti-government, anti-authority violent  extremism; animal rights and environmental violent extremism; abortion- related violent extremism and others.   So those are already categories of domestic terrorism that the FBI  reports on. What we are saying is, give us those reports in a timely  fashion so we can see the incidence of these forms of extremism and the  commission of crimes.   But there is one correction that we are making that is very  important. During the Trump administration, they eliminated reference  in this list of categories of domestic terrorism of White supremacist  activity. The reason why it is important for us to include that is that  we have the sworn testimony of the Director of the Federal Bureau of  Investigation that this is a category of crime and terrorism in  America that is ``metastasizing''--his word, metastasizing. So we  believe it is important that we be given information about the  incidence of violent extremism, domestic terrorism, that relates to  this type of activity, this White supremacy.    I will tell you, it is not an imagined crime. We see the reality of  it way too often. We just saw it 2 weeks ago in Buffalo, NY. That  shooter put his so-called manifesto on the internet and declared, among  other things, his support for the ``great replacement theory.''   The ``great replacement theory'' is a thinly veiled White supremacist  theory that tries to suggest that immigrants to America are somehow  only arriving at the expense of those already here, particularly White  Americans. That sort of theory has been out there since the days of the  Ku Klux Klan, maybe even before it. But it is White supremacy. It  inspired this man to do terrible things in Buffalo and kill innocent  people at that grocery store.   So we are asking the FBI to give us this information. We will draw  conclusions as we will, but that is basically it. No new crime is  created nor is any new authority being created in the process. I think  that is a critical element.   But there is one other thing that is part of this exercise this  morning in voting for H.R. 350. The majority leader, Senator Schumer,  after the events in Uvalde, TX, declared that we are going to try to  reach out, on a bipartisan basis, to come up with legislation to deal  with gun safety and safety in schools. His first effort to do this is  this bill.   What we are voting on is a motion to proceed to the bill. He has  invited colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, to come forward and to offer  their amendments in the field of gun safety and school safety. That is  why this motion to proceed is more than just the bill I described. It  is an opportunity for amendments on the floor.   This morning, I had an interview with CNN, and they talked about the  fact that we are leaving for a week for Memorial Day to honor our  veterans and be home and then return. Why aren't we staying and  working? Well, here is the chance for us to make it clear that we are  going to work on what happened in these terrible tragedies in Uvalde,  TX, and Buffalo, NY, and so many others.   So I am appealing to my colleagues on the Republican side of the  aisle, if you have any ideas, and I hope you do, for gun safety, school  safety, and to make this a safer nation, this is the vehicle to do it.  A ``yes'' vote on the motion to proceed to H.R. 350 is your opportunity  to open a process where we can consider amendments.   Senator Schumer was very explicit. He invited Democrats as well as  Republicans to come forward with their best ideas on a bipartisan  basis. And isn't that what the people of the country are actually  asking for, more than anything; that we roll up our sleeves and face  this challenge which has taken so many innocent lives?   In the newspaper yesterday, in the New York Times, they did a feature  on those wonderful little kids and the teachers who lost their lives in  Uvalde, TX. It is heartbreaking to see those kids, those beautiful  little children, and to realize that they are no longer with us and  that their families are grieving in a way they never imagined they  would.   Isn't it up to us to do something about it rather than just give  press releases? Isn't it up to us as legislators to legislate and try  to find solutions? This opportunity, the motion to proceed, opens the  door to that possibility.   We can return the week after Memorial Day recess and start in earnest  considering amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans which deal  with this issue. We owe the American people that. We are elected to  this job to legislate, not just to give speeches but to change the laws  in this country to make it safer. This is our chance to do it. I urge  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, vote for H.R. 350. This is an  important bill in and of itself, but equally important is the fact that  it opens a process Americans are longing to hear that we take  seriously. I urge my colleagues to support the motion to proceed on  H.R. 350.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley) and  the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley),  and the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Maryland  (Mr. Van Hollen) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, this coming Monday is Memorial Day, the  day we set aside to honor the more than 1.1 million Americans who have  given their lives in military service to our Nation.   It is a solemn day of remembrance and has a special resonance in my  state. One of America's first Memorial Day ceremonies occurred in  Illinois. It was April 1866--barely a year after the end of America's  terrible Civil War.   Three returning veterans from that great conflict were waiting for  services to begin at a church in Carbondale when they saw a young woman  with two infants approach a small, unmarked grave in the church  cemetery, place flowers on the grave, and kneel in prayer. The  veterans, deeply moved, collected wildflowers and placed them at all of  the veterans' graves in the churchyard. They then arranged to host a  parade of veterans to honor the war dead resting in the town's  cemetery.   More than 200 veterans showed up for that parade--one of America's  first Memorial Day parades. Among the marchers was General John Logan,  a Civil War hero and proud son of Illinois. The following year, General  Logan was appointed the commander in chief of the Grand Army of the  Republic. One of his first acts as commander in chief was to call for a  national day of remembrance to honor the soldiers who sacrificed their  lives so that America could receive a ``new birth of freedom.''   In the Army's General Order No. 11--the ``Memorial Day Order''-- General Logan wrote of his hope that the day of remembrance would be  ``kept up from year to year, [as long as] a survivor of the war remains  to honor the memory of his departed comrades.''   On this Memorial Day, more than a century and a half later, we  remember all of the American patriots who have fallen in battles--from  Antietam, to the Argonne Forest, to Afghanistan. General Logan called  their deaths ``the cost of a free and undivided republic.''   In these fractious times, when our Nation sometimes feels, again,  like a house divided, may we remember the price those fallen heroes  paid to preserve our Union. And may we also remember the duty we each  bear to preserve the priceless gift for which they gave their lives-- this Nation, free and undivided.   On a related note, I want to take a moment to wish a belated happy  birthday to an American hero who returned from war. Sgt. Victor Butler  is that last surviving Tuskegee Airman in his home State of Rhode  Island and one of the last of that legendary Band of Brothers in our  Nation. Last Saturday, May 21, Mr. Butler celebrated his 100th  birthday.   When he was a young man, he and the other members of the Tuskegee  Airmen helped to save the world from the tyranny of fascism--and he  helped to loosen the grip of racism on America. In the weeks before his  100th birthday, Mr. Butler told family and friends all he wanted for  his centennial celebration was a card. He didn't want folks to make a  fuss or go to any great expense.   One of his nieces posted his wish on social media--and word spread.  He thought he might receive a few cards. At last count, Mr. Butler had  received more than 40,000 cards and video greetings from people in  every State in the Union and as far away as Japan, South Korea, and  Germany.   Last Saturday, on his birthday, his hometown held a parade in his  honor. And he received a signed football and a jersey with the number  ``100'' on the back, hand-delivered by the owner of his favorite  football team, the New England Patriots--a well-deserved tribute to a  real-life hero.   Like the tradition of Memorial Day, the Tuskegee Airmen have a  special connection to my State. The first airfield where they trained-- before Tuskegee--was Chanute Field in Rantoul, IL, near Champaign. The  spot where that airfield stood is marked proudly today with signs that  read ``Birthplace of the Tuskegee Airmen.'' And in 2016, Illinois  renamed a stretch of Interstate 57 on the South Side of Chicago as the  Tuskegee Airmen Memorial Trail. It is a fitting tribute, given how many  Tuskegee Airman had roots in the Chicago area.   African-Americans have fought and died for America's freedom since  Crispus Attucks became the first American to fall in our War for  Independence.   As the first African-American aviators ever to serve in the U.S. Army  Air Corps, the Tuskegee Airman occupy a special chapter in our Nation's  history. They fought in World War II, at a time when the U.S. Armed  Forces were still segregated, and our Nation was still riven with  racially discriminatory laws and attitudes. Their original mission was  to serve as escort pilots for other American flyers, to protect them  from enemy fire. The Tuskegee Airmen also flew bombing missions  themselves.   Officially, they were known as the 99th Pursuit Squadron and the  332nd Fighter Group. But the pilots whose flights they protected gave  them a nickname. They called them the Red Tails, or the Red-Tailed  Angels, due to the distinctive color on their aircraft  [[Page S2741]]  wings. Their leader was the legendary Captain Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.,  who would go on to become the first African-American brigadier general  in the U.S. Air Force. His father, Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., was the  first Black brigadier general in the U.S. Army.   There were a total of 932 Tuskegee Airmen pilots, and another 10,000  Tuskegee Airmen--and women--who served as mechanics, radio operators,  and other essential support positions. They conducted more than 700  bomber escort missions--and they never lost a single lost a single  aircraft--not one. They were the only fighter group in World War II  with a perfect record of protecting bombers.   White U.S. military pilots were permitted to fly no more than 52  missions during World War II. Some Tuskegee Airman flew as many as 100  missions. Sixty-six Tuskegee Airmen died in combat. Thirty-three were  held as prisoners of war.   In March 2007, the Tuskegee Airmen as a group were awarded the  Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor Congress can bestow. The  ceremony was held in the Rotunda of the Capitol. I will never forget  the sight of 300 Tuskegee Airman dressed in red sports jackets,  saluting the American flag in that hallowed space. Some were in  wheelchairs. But when the National Anthem played, they all rose to  their feet and stood straight and proud.   Just before the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony, I had the  privilege of hosting several Tuskegee Airmen with Illinois roots in my  office. Then-Senator Obama stopped by to pay his respects. It was a  historic and humbling moment.   I met Lt. Colonel George Sherman, who grew up in Moline and joined  the Army Air Corps in 1944 at the age of 18. He had to take the  physical twice; he was rejected the first time because of his buck  teeth, but he didn't give up. He ended up serving 22 years in the Air  Force.   First Lieutenant Shelby Westbook was born in Arkansas and lost both  of his parents when he was just 12. He flew 60 missions over 12  countries in Europe. After the war, he wanted to attend engineering  school. The first school he applied to rejected him because it didn't  accept Black students. He moved to Chicago, earned a degree, and worked  as an electrical engineer for decades.   First Lieutenant Robert Martin famously claimed to have flown ``63  and a half missions.'' On his 64th combat mission, he was shot down  over Yugoslavia. He was hidden by antifascist partisans until he could  return to his unit. After the war, he worked as an electrical engineer  for the city of Chicago for nearly 40 years.   Flight Officer John Lyle--``Captain Jack'' to his friends--grew up on  Chicago's South Side. He flew 26 combat missions. After the war, he  earned a college degree but couldn't find work in his field so, for a  time, he washed windows of downtown skyscrapers. Eventually, he owned  his own insurance agency, a fish and chicken restaurant, and a tree- trimming service.   Lt. Bev Dunjill flew more than 100 combat missions between World War  II and the Korean war. He later worked for the Illinois Department of  Human Rights.   All of those heroes are gone now. But their valor and impact are not  forgotten. The Tuskegee Airmen and the all-Black Montfort Point Marines  were among nearly 1 million Black Americans who served in World War II.  Most saw the war as a battle on two fronts--one against fascism  overseas and the other against racially discriminatory laws and  attitudes in America.   Their goal, they said, was ``the Double V,'' victory for democracy  overseas and at home. The change at home did not come easily, but it  did come. Three years after World War II ended, President Truman  ordered an end to segregation in the U.S. Armed Forces. And the service  and sacrifice of the Tuskegee Airmen and other Black veterans and  leaders helped set the stage for the civil rights movement of the  1950s, 60s, and 70s.   Today, as the last surviving Tuskegee Airman near their 100th  birthdays and we lose hundreds of World War II veterans each day, we  are painfully aware that the democracy and unity they paid such a high  price for is under threat, both overseas and at home. The peace of  Europe and democracy itself is under fire from Russia in Ukraine. And  our sense of security and national unity seems to be fraying at home.  Violence--especially gun violence--threatens us all, even our children.   Our progress against division and discrimination often feels shaky.  We are pitted against each other by those who believe that conflict and  anger is good for their political interests or their profit sheets. But  it doesn't have to be this way.   As we prepare to remember and honor those who gave their lives for  our freedom, let us resolve to do our part, in our time, to keep our  Nation free and undivided.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following letter in the Record.
