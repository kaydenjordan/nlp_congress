 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman for  yielding and for her tremendous leadership.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3239, the  Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in Customs and Border Protection  Custody Act.   I thank Dr. Raul Ruiz for bringing his medical expertise to this body  and introducing this bill to bring some humane treatment to families  and children seeking refuge in the United States.   This critical bill creates basic standards for humanitarian care of  all detainees within CBP facilities. By establishing health screenings,  emergency medical care, appropriate access to water, nutrition, and  shelter, these critical standards are a step in the right direction.   Last year, when I traveled to Brownsville and McAllen, Texas, I saw  the horrors of the Trump administration's family detention jails. I saw  children sleeping on concrete floors. It is cruel and inhumane. And I,  quite frankly, wrote a letter to the United Nations asking the  secretary general to send observers to report on the conditions and  treatment of these children and adults.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record my letter.                                       House of Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, June 19, 2018.      His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres,      Secretary General United Nations Headquarters,      New York, NY.        Dear Secretary-General Guterres: I write today to request       your urgent assistance in the ongoing crisis our country is       facing at our Southern Border with Mexico.        As the Democratic Congressional Representative to the       United Nations (UN), I am formally requesting UN observers       travel to the United States to report on the conditions of       detention facilities and treatment of children, based on       relevant international law and human rights principles.        I am appalled by the reports and images from detention       facilities in Texas and other states along the border, where       more than 2,300 children have been separated from their       parents by border patrol agents.        This weekend, I will be traveling to the border myself, to       witness first-hand the conditions adults and children are       facing while in detention.        I urge you to send experts from relevant UN agencies to       observe conditions in both Department of Homeland Security       (OHS) and Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) facilities       both at the border and throughout the more than 17 states       around the country that are now housing children who have       been separated from their families.        As a mother, a grandmother, and as a psychiatric social       worker, I am most concerned for the physical and mental well       being of children separated from their parents at their most       vulnerable time. The American  [[Page H7339]]       Academy of Pediatrics has warned that this practice of family       separation can cause irreparable harm to lifelong development       by disrupting a child's brain architecture.''        You recently said in a statement, ``As a matter of       principle, the Secretary-General believes that refugees and       migrants should always be treated with respect and dignity,       and in accordance with existing international law.'' And you       added, ``children must not be traumatized by being separated       from their parents. Family unity must be preserved.''        I sincerely hope that you will consider this urgent       humanitarian request in a timely manner.            Sincerely,                                                       Barbara Lee,                                                Member of Congress.     Mr. Chairman, it is really our responsibility  to protect the health and safety of individuals in CBP custody and,  yes, we have failed.   By passing this bill today, we are putting critical protocol and  protections in place for individuals and making sure that their well- being and health are a priority. We can no longer allow individuals to  suffer, be abused, or die under CBP. Our values demand that we take  this action. It is past time for us to protect adults and children  fleeing violence, seeking a safe haven in America.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this vital bill.  And I thank Dr. Ruiz for giving us a chance to do the right thing.
