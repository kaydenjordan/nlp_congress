 Mr. President, today is February 16, 2017. President  Trump was sworn in on January 20, 2017.   For the past several weeks now, we have come to the floor and talked  about the slow pace at which the Senate has considered and voted on the  President's nominees for his Cabinet. Well, there is good reason for  that because one of our roles is to consider and vote on advisers  selected by the President, regardless of political party, and to help  this new administration lead the country.   President Obama, to his credit, after the election, sat down with  President-Elect Trump and said he was committed to a peaceful  transition of power from his administration to the Trump  administration. But, apparently, some of our colleagues didn't get the  memo. We continue to slog along at the slowest pace since George  Washington to vote on nominees to the President's Cabinet.   The reason it has gone on so slowly is clear by now. It is because  our friends across the aisle are still upset and have not yet  reconciled themselves with the results of the election on November 8.  They just kind of can't get over it. Yes, they are being encouraged by  the radical elements of their party who don't want us to fulfill our  responsibilities, who don't want a new President to have the Cabinet  that he needs in order to govern the country. Yes, there are some who  want to halt our work in this Chamber and perpetuate dysfunction. They  don't want us to focus on legislating because they want to keep us tied  up in the confirmation process.   I will just interject right here, as I have said before, that we know  these nominees will be confirmed because, thanks to the nuclear option  under Senator Reid, the previous Democratic leader, all it takes is 51  votes to confirm a nominee to a Cabinet post. But the fact is, the  country needs a functioning Senate. We need a functioning executive  branch.   So I hope our colleagues across the aisle will understand soon that  if they want to be effective--if they want to actually move the needle  and help those who have entrusted them with the future of this  country--then we need to turn from gridlock to action.   Last Congress, even under President Obama in the White House, we did  not let partisan dysfunction keep us from working together. There is a  difference between elections and governing. But, for some reason, too  many people want to keep relitigating the election and not allow us to  actually govern.   Of course, during the Obama administration, Republicans had many  points of departure from the Obama administration, and we used the  tools available to us to provide the oversight and ask the critical  questions that the American people demanded. But our friends across the  aisle are now being tempted to shut down the government, to run away  from policy debates, and point fingers. Why? Because it is always  easier to throw stones than it is to actually accomplish something-- roll up your sleeves, focus on the task, and turn to legislating.   Yes, it may be easier just to criticize and to obstruct, but it is  not the right thing for the American people. Our colleagues across the  aisle know that, but, as I said earlier, they are being unduly  influenced by some of the radical elements in their political base who  will not let them do it or who say that if you do cooperate on a  bipartisan basis and actually do your job, then we are going to recruit  people to run against you in a primary.   Well, that is part of the risk we all take. We didn't come here to  appease a portion of our political base and neglect our most basic  duties as Members of the U.S. Senate. Again, I would point to last  Congress and the work we did together on a bipartisan basis, I might  add, as evidence of what you can accomplish when you try to do that.   The 114th Congress, after the 2014 election, saw a new majority, a  new Republican leadership, and we did our best to help restore order to  this Chamber and get it working again after years of dysfunction. Under  the previous regime, Members of both the majority and minority parties  were actually prevented from coming to the floor and offering  legislative ideas in the form of amendments and getting votes on them,  but that backfired when some of our colleagues who were running for  reelection in 2014 realized that they had very little to show the  voters by way of accomplishment--even those in the majority party, the  Democratic Party, at that time. So one would have thought that there  would be some lessons learned there.   In the last Congress--in the 114th Congress that began 2 years ago-- we voted on legislative ideas from both sides of the aisle with more  than 250 rollcall votes. That represented a sea change from the  previous administration and the way Senator Reid ran things.   We were able to get the Senate functioning as the Founders intended,  and that led to big results for the American people. We took care of  big, intractable problems that had trouble getting anywhere during the  previous Congresses. For example, we passed a transportation bill--the  highway bill--to help Americans deal with safety on the roadway, to  deal with concerns about pollution due to congestion and people in  gridlock, and we helped our economy in the process. That was a big,  important bill. That was the first time we had been able to pass a  long-term highway bill in about 30 different, separate attempts where  we had patched the funding mechanism for 6 months or a year, which made  it nearly impossible for our highway departments across the country to  actually plan. It actually ended up being more expensive and less  effective than it would be with a multiyear highway bill, which we  [[Page S1254]]  passed. So that was a big bipartisan accomplishment.   We also made great progress in reforming our public education system  by passing, again, on a bipartisan basis, the Every Student Succeeds  Act, which went a long way to devolving power from here in Washington,  DC, back to the States, back to local school districts, back to parents  and teachers--something that, fortunately, we were able to agree upon  on a bipartisan basis. That change was applauded by my constituents  back home, and, I believe, people around the country.   We also made great headway in making our country safer and our  government more just by taking up and passing legislation to support  victims of abuse and violence and to craft laws to better equip our law  enforcement to handle growing threats.   For example, we passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act 99  to 0. Some people say that nothing ever gets done in Washington; well,  99 to 0--it is hard to beat that, except by maybe 100 to 0, but we will  take it.   That law was signed into law by President Obama 2 years ago, and it  is helping victims of human trafficking get the healing and recovery  they need, while also providing help to law enforcement to help root  out the people who patronize modern day slavery, which is what human  trafficking amounts to.   We also, on a bipartisan basis, reauthorized the Justice for All Act  to strengthen victims' rights in court and increase access to  restitution and services that can help them recover. It helps reduce  the national backlog in untested rape kits, forensic evidence collected  after a sexual assault that is necessary to identify the assailant  through the use of DNA testing. That was really important, after we  heard the horror stories of as many as 400,000 untested rape kits in  laboratories or evidence lockers--evidence which was critical to  identifying the assailant; many times they were serial assailants. In  other words, they didn't just attack one time, they attacked multiple  times over the years--and to get them off the streets. That type of  evidence is also very important in exonerating the innocent because if  we can exclude someone from one of these terrible assaults, that means  a person who is innocent of the crime will be free.    We also passed a bill called the POLICE Act, signed into law last  summer, so our first responders and law enforcement officers can learn  the latest techniques to deal with violence so they are ready to face  the unimaginable or previously unimaginable threats in our communities.   I could go on and on, but I will just mention a few more. We passed  bipartisan legislation to combat opioid abuse and heroin addiction, the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. We passed laws to make our  government more transparent so it is more accountable to the public and  to voters. We helped capitalize on our God-given natural resources by  lifting the crude oil export ban, for example--something important not  only to domestic producers and job creation here but also to our  friends and allies around the world who frequently depend on a single  source for their energy. Unfortunately, people like Vladimir Putin in  Russia have discovered you can use that sole source of energy as a  weapon by threatening to cut it off.   The reason I mention some of these accomplishments is to make the  point that nothing happens in Congress, nothing happens in the Federal  Government, unless it is bipartisan.   It is one thing to fight hard in an election and try to win the  election so you can gain the privilege of actually being in the  majority or having the White House, but after the election is over, our  responsibilities shift to governing. Right now, our friends across the  aisle are continuing to obstruct and drag their feet and make it  impossible for the President to get the Cabinet he needs in order to  get the government up and running.   We need to return to the pattern we established in the last Congress,  to work together, to build consensus, to help make America stronger,  our citizens safer, and our laws a better service to all the people. I  would plead with our colleagues across the aisle to stop the  dysfunction, stop wanting to relitigate the outcome of the election.  You can't. It is over. We know what the outcome was. They need to move  on, and we need to move on--not just for the political parties we are  members of, not just for the benefit of those elected here in  Washington but for the benefit of 320-some-odd million people whom we  have the responsibility of representing. Instead of foot-dragging,  obstruction, and dysfunction, let us fight, as we always have, for  those people we represent and work together to find common ground where  we can to put forward legislation that serves them well.   I hope our colleagues across the aisle would remember those lessons  they learned in the 2014 election; that dysfunction is bad politics. It  does not help their political cause. I understand the temptation of  wanting to yield to the most radical elements in a political party, but  we are elected to the Senate for 6-year terms to be that cooling  saucer, to try to have debate and deliberation, to try to work out the  hard problems. That is our responsibility, and just to blindly obstruct  when you know you can't change the outcome--particularly when it comes  to the President getting the Cabinet he has chosen and he deserves-- makes no sense whatsoever.
