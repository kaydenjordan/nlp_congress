 Mr. President, the opioid crisis is hurting  communities across our country. Its challenges are complex and its  causes are many.   As I said last week, no single bill or program is going to solve this  crisis on its own. Only a sustained, committed effort can do that. That  has been my view over the many years that I have been involved in this  issue, from the first time I invited the White House drug czar down to  Eastern Kentucky to see the challenges posed by prescription drug abuse  firsthand to my work on other initiatives, such as helping pass a law  to help address the tragedy of babies born addicted to drugs.   It is also what I believed as the Republican-led Senate worked hard  to pass important legislation such as Jessie's Law, the 21st Century  Cures Act, and the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act in the last  Congress.   I believe President Trump took the same view as he announced another  important step last week by declaring a public health emergency for  opioids. I would like to, once again, thank the President for his  commitment to confronting this crisis.   We all know there is much further to go, and as we move forward,  Republicans and Democrats, the House and the Senate, the States and the  White House, we should remain committed to working together on policies  and programs that actually deliver results.   About an hour ago, the Government Accountability Office released a  report I requested about the Federal Government's response to opioid  use disorders. The Government's chief watchdog recommends that as the  Department of Health and Human Services expands access to medication- assisted treatment, it should also develop clear measures to gauge  performance. This GAO study will help to ensure that dollars are spent  wisely to fight the crisis of opioid abuse taking lives in communities  all across our country. The announcement of GAO's conclusions will help  us as we continue to build a comprehensive approach to combating heroin  and prescription drug abuse. It is another step in the right direction.   As government officials review this morning's report and as agencies  develop new plans to fulfill its objectives, I will continue to work  with partners in Washington and Kentucky to address this important  crisis. The goal, of course, is that one day we can finally put the  pain of opioid abuse behind us once and for all.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday the Senate advanced the  nomination of Professor Amy Barrett, President Trump's impressive  nominee to be a judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. She is  the first of four strong nominees to our Nation's circuit courts that  the Senate will confirm this week.   Professor Barrett's experience as a distinguished law professor at  the University of Notre Dame shows her qualifications to serve our  Nation on the Federal bench. She is going to be an asset to our  judiciary.   Of course, some on the left have tried to invent any reason to  prevent this President's nominees from advancing. For an outstanding  nominee such as Professor Barrett, their task was not easy. They can't  attack her credentials, which are truly impressive; they can't attack  her belief in the rule of law--Professor Barrett's writings and her  testimony clearly show a nominee who will uphold our Constitution and  our Nation's laws as they are written--as they are written--not as she  wishes they were.   Unbelievably, some on the political left, including some of our  Democratic colleagues, are actually criticizing Professor Barrett for a  law review article she cowrote back in law school by saying it says the  opposite of what it actually says.   They claim Professor Barrett wrote that a judge should put her  personal beliefs ahead of the rule of law, when, in fact, she said a  judge should not do  [[Page S6886]]  that--exactly the opposite. She wrote that if a judge's personal views  were to impede that judge's ability to impartially apply the law, then  the judge should recuse herself from the case.   As the coauthor of that article and current president of Catholic  University recently put it, ``The case against Prof. Barrett is so  flimsy, that you have to wonder whether there isn't some other,  unspoken, cause for their objection.''   It does make you wonder.   To those using this matter as cover to oppose Professor Barrett  because of her personally held religious beliefs, let me remind you,  there are no religious tests--none--for public office in this country.  That is not how we do things here. Our government and our Nation are  made better through the service of qualified people of faith. That will  surely be true of Professor Amy Barrett.   I look forward to voting to confirm this accomplished law professor  and devoted mother of seven later today, and I would urge our  colleagues to join me.   Once we do, the Senate will advance another of President Trump's  well-qualified circuit court nominees, Michigan Supreme Court Justice  Joan Larsen, to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth  Circuit.   Justice Larsen is the second of three accomplished women whom the  Senate will consider this week for appointment to our circuit courts. I  assume that all three of these impressive women will receive strong  support from our Democratic colleagues who never seem to miss an  opportunity to talk about the war on women.   Here is what nominees such as Larsen and Barrett and the others we  will consider this week represent for our Federal judiciary: equal  justice under the law for all and a fair shake for every litigant. What  a refreshing departure from President Obama and his so-called empathy  standard for selecting judicial nominees--really just another of the  left's ideological purity tests and one that was anything but  empathetic for individuals on the other side of the case. If you are  the litigant for whom the judge does not have empathy, you are in a  tough position before such a judge.   Finally, I would like to express my gratitude, once again, to  Chairman Chuck Grassley for his continued work to bring these  outstanding nominees to the Senate floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, that at 3:30 p.m. today, there be 30 minutes  of postcloture time remaining on the Barrett nomination, equally  divided between the leaders or their designees; that following the use  or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the confirmation of  the Barrett nomination; and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar Nos. 443 through 454  and all nominations placed on the Secretary's desk; that the  nominations be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no  further motions be in order; that any statements related to the  nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative  session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I remember the life of a great  Kentuckian, Ted Cook, who passed away on October 1, 2017, at the age of  70. He was a great friend, a local businessman, and a fixture of Laurel  County. Passing away after a battle with cancer, Ted's loss will be  felt by many.   A veteran of the U.S. Air Force, Ted was driven by a sense of  patriotism and community service. He was a generous man and a strong  supporter of the Kentucky High School Athletics Association. Ted made  it a priority to watch every basketball game he could, and he was an  ideal role model for the next generation of Kentuckians.   Ted loved the outdoors, spending time hunting, fishing, and raising  quail. He tried to instill that passion in young people, especially his  children and, later, his grandchildren. Ted also helped lead local,  State, and national organizations dedicated to the service of others.   Ted rarely sought any recognition for his good works, instead always  caring primarily for others. Those he impacted with his love and  friendship, however, will always remember him. Elaine and I send our  condolences to Ted's wife, Debbie, their children, their family, and  friends. I hope that their fond memories of Ted will help ease their  grief.   Mr. President, the Corbin Times-Tribune recently published an article  on Ted's life and career. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the  article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From the Corbin Times-Tribune, Oct. 2, 2017]                      Ted Cook Will Be Missed by Many                               (By Les Dixon)         Myself and many others across the State lost a great friend       on Sunday with the passing of Ted Cook. Mr. Cook--he would       always correct me to call him Ted--was one of the greatest       men I have ever known. He would do anything for anyone, and I       do mean anyone. He was one of the biggest supporters of kids       throughout the State that I have known.        We would always engage in high school sports talk any time       we saw each other. It didn't matter if we were at a       restaurant or if I paid him a visit at Cook Tire, high school       sports was always the topic of discussion--well, sometimes       politics would be as well, but only to give one of our       friends a hard time.        Even though I am a writer, I find it hard to write about       people I truly care about. It sounds odd doesn't it? But I       just don't think anything I can write would do justice about       my good friend Mr. Cook.        I know he was a joy to be around and he always made me feel       like I was one of his own. Heck, he was able to do that with       anyone he interacted with.        I always looked forward to seeing Mr. Cook at the Sweet       Sixteen Boys Basketball Tournament. You could bank on it       every Wednesday morning, I would go over to say hello  [[Page S6918]]       and he would always stick out his hand for a handshake and       say, ``Hello, young man. How have you been?'' He always       preceded with a big hug and then we preceded to talk about,       life, sports, my daughter and then anything else that would       come up. You could bank on the same routine happening every       year.        The one thing that will stick out to me more than anything       is how Mr. Cook always dressed in his `Sunday's best' for the       Sweet Sixteen Boys championship game. He was always in a suit       and a tie and that always stood out to me. He showed respect       to the event just like he showed respect to everyone he met.        I never really ventured over to Cook Tire as much as I       should to see how he would be doing, but our paths always       crossed, usually at least once a month and even more during       high school basketball season.        I believe KHSAA Commissioner Julian Tackett said it best on       his Facebook page: Ted Cook's passing means the loss of       another of that great generation of men who were independent,       self sustaining and hard working. In addition to being one of       the biggest supporters of kids throughout the state, he was a       counselor for so many people and a great friend.        I will end with this. I hope someday to be half the man Mr.       Cook was, it would be an honor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 244, S.
