 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate and congratulate USDA Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen  on her recently announced retirement.   Chief Christiansen has dedicated 40 years as a professional forester,  wildland firefighter, and land manager.   I have had the great privilege of working with Vicki and appreciated  her visit to the Allegheny National Forest.   While visiting, it was made clear her passion for problem-solving,  connecting people with their natural resources, and her commitment to  local collaboration.   The ANF is Pennsylvania's only national forest, and it plays a vital  role in our communities throughout the region.   Vicki's work as USDA Forest Service chief focused on saved natural  resources in ways that promote lasting economic, ecological, and social  vitality for all communities.   Madam Speaker, I thank Vicki Christiansen for her leadership,  dedication, passion, and advocacy for our Nation's national forests in  rural areas. May she enjoy her retirement.                            ____________________
