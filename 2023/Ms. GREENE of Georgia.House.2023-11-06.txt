 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of  rule IX, I seek recognition to give notice of my intent to raise a  question of the privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   Censuring my colleague Representative Rashida Tlaib for anti-Semitic  activity and sympathizing with terrorist organizations.   Whereas, in May 2019, Rashida Tlaib said that she celebrated the  Holocaust, and felt a calming feeling when thinking about the genocide  of millions of Jews;   Whereas, in 2020, Rashida Tlaib retweeted an illustration with the  caption: ``From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,'' and  this Palestine Liberation Organization slogan has been adopted by Hamas  and calls for the elimination of Israel and the death of all Jews;   Whereas, on November 3, 2023, Rashida Tlaib tweeted that the slogan  ``from the river to the sea,'' which calls for the genocide of all  Jews, ``is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful  coexistence'';   Whereas, in September 2022, Rashida Tlaib, as a member of the  Congressional Progressive Caucus, displayed her disdain for Israel  saying: ``. . . You cannot claim to hold progressive values yet back  Israel's apartheid government'';    Whereas, instead of denouncing the horrors of Hamas slaughtering  Israelis, Rashida Tlaib stated on October 8, 2023, ``The path to the  future must include lifting the blockade, ending the occupation, and  dismantling the apartheid system that creates the suffocating  dehumanizing conditions that can lead to resistance'';   Whereas, Rashida Tlaib exhibited her hatred for America by reposting  a message on October 12, 2023, blaming America for allowing the deaths  of Palestinian babies at the hands of Israel;   Whereas, Rashida Tlaib incited an illegal occupation at the United  States Capitol complex on October 18, 2023, which put Members of  Congress, their staffs, and Capitol visitors in danger by shutting down  elevators, stairwells, and points of egress, while obstructing official  business in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, including  a Senate Foreign Affairs Committee hearing;   Whereas, the illegal occupation incited by Rashida Tlaib was  organized by Jewish Voice for Peace, which the Anti-Defamation League  calls ``a radical anti-Israel activist group that advocates for a  complete economic, cultural, and academic boycott of the State of  Israel,'' and that believes ``Israeli policies and actions are  motivated by deeply rooted Jewish racial chauvinism and religious  supremacism'';   Whereas, several illegal occupiers at the Capitol belong to a group  messaging chat called Global Intifada, which is the Arabic word for  rebellion or uprising and refers to a series of protests and violent  riots carried out by Palestinians in Israel during the last century;   Whereas, by inciting an illegal occupation of the Capitol complex on  October 18, 2023, Rashida Tlaib followed Hezbollah's orders to carry  out a day of unprecedented anger following an explosion at a Gazan  hospital, lying about Israel's responsibility for the attack, which  United States intelligence agencies said was not perpetuated by Israel;   Whereas, over 300 arrests were made following the illegal occupation  of the Capitol complex on October 18, 2023, for violations of District  of Columbia law, such as crowding, obstructing, or incommoding, and for  assaulting police officers; and   Whereas, Members of Congress who denounce the United States while  praising terrorist organizations are unfit to hold office. Now,  therefore, be it resolved that Representative Rashida Tlaib be  censured; Representative Rashida Tlaib forthwith present herself in the  well of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure;  and Representative Rashida Tlaib be censured with the public reading of  this resolution by the Speaker.
