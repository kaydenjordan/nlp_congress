 Mr. Speaker, I join the people of Guam in not only  mourning but honoring the late, great Robert D. Camacho, who sadly left  this world last week.   Bob, as he was known to many, was a man of family and faith first  before anything. He was a husband, a father, a veteran, a law  enforcement officer, and a friend to many.   Bob and I go way back, as we were classmates in our University of  Guam Army ROTC days, and he served as my commander at the 368th MP  Company Army Reserves in Sumay, Guam. We also worked together at the  Department of Corrections, which is where our friendship turned to  family, as Bob became the godfather, or nino as we would say, for my  eldest daughter Abby.   In recent years, Bob has served the community in the capacity as the  director of the Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency, chief of the Guam  Airport Authority police department and most recently as the director  of Department of Corrections.   Bob will be greatly missed, and with this, and under the sacred and  historical Hall, on behalf of the Nation and the island of Guam, I  would like to thank Robert D. Camacho for his service to the country  and to the people of Guam and express our deepest condolences to his  wife, Pauline; his children; his family; and friends.   Bob, may you rest in peace and adios for now, my friend, until we  meet again.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the  Lower Energy Costs Act, a historic and consequential piece of  legislation to bring down our skyrocketing energy costs and secure  America's energy independence.   On my home island of Guam, energy costs have reached historical  highs. Less than a year ago, gas prices reached an all-time high of  $6.49 a gallon. On average, gas prices are still 40 percent higher than  they were before Biden took office.   The people of Guam can't continue to face these inflated costs. We  must deliver solutions here in Washington to help ease their pain.   This administration's misguided energy policies have shackled our  economy and penalized hardworking Americans. There is a misguided war  on American energy, and that war needs to end now.   Let's set the record straight. Critics on the bill claim it is simply  a handout to oil and gas companies. This couldn't be further from the  truth.   The Lower Energy Costs Act is an all-of-the-above energy solution.  This legislation streamlines regulatory burdens holding back our  infrastructure projects, whether it is a natural gas pipeline or  transmission lines from a solar facility--both are held back by the  same.   It also contains important reforms for not only traditional types of  energy but also the energy of tomorrow.   With the Lower Energy Costs Act, Republicans are delivering on one of  our fundamental campaign promises--to bring gas prices down and to ease  the burden on hardworking Americans. We are quite literally keeping the  lights on.   Many Guam residents constantly live under the growing threat of China  and North Korea. We are some, if not the only, Americans who receive  warnings during Korean missile tests and whose waters are routinely  invaded by Chinese vessels.   Standing up to our adversaries is what keeps America strong. Energy  security is national security.   For too long, we have allowed countries like China and Russia to  control energy production and dominate the critical mineral supply  chain.  [[Page H1503]]    Securing our energy independence and critical mineral supply chain  ensures that foreign adversaries can't use these resources to threaten  or pressure us in the future.   This legislation will make sure that the minerals we need for the  technologies of tomorrow are sourced clearly, safely, and responsibly  right here at home.   America has the highest standards for workplace safety and  environmental concerns, and we know the conditions in Chinese-operated  mines in countries like the Congo are truly horrific.    Mr. Chairman, do you want to know the best way to lower  global greenhouse gases?   Produce the energy right here in America.   Do you want to know the best way to secure critical minerals while  ensuring minimal impact on the environment? Mine right here in America.   Do you want to improve our national security while also giving the  economy a boost? Pass the Lower Energy Costs Act today.
