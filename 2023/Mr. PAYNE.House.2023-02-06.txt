 Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to acknowledge my new  friends from North Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise a great small business in my  district. Schneider Hardware in West Orange, New Jersey, celebrates its  100th anniversary this year.   It is one of the last full-service, independent hardware stores in  the State of New Jersey. It is located right in downtown West Orange in  my district.   Schneider Hardware is the oldest business still in operation in Essex  County. It specializes in helping owners repair their older homes that  populate my district.   It was started by Isadore Schneider in 1923. Today, Isadore's  grandsons, Roger and Gerald, are the third generation to run the store.  They help residents with everything from plumbing issues to repairing  lawnmowers.   Congratulations again to Schneider Hardware. It is a shining example  of the importance of small businesses to local communities.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Horsford for bringing forth  this Special Order hour and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Ivey) for  hosting this Special Order hour.   This Special Order hour focuses on the problem of police brutality,  especially in Black and Brown communities. I welcome the opportunity to  raise awareness for an issue that is so close to so many in my  community.   To the family of Tyre Nichols, I once again send my heartfelt  condolences for your tragic loss in the wake of the release of that  horrifying footage that the world watched of, yet again, another  despicable display of police brutality in this country.   Our cities and streets have been plagued for decades by this  senseless and unnecessary use of force by sworn officers of the law. It  has permeated facets of Black and Brown lives.   In the last 10 years alone, my State of New Jersey has been home to  109 excessive force lawsuits against officers and police departments  since 2012. Because of that number, I could not give you the names that  were involved in these situations--as I said, 109.   The profession of policing should not be costing States and local  taxpayers millions of dollars each year in settlements for wrongful  acts caused by those entrusted to protect and serve.   I voted for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which was  legislation that would end racial profiling in law enforcement, ban  choke holds and no-knock warrants, and establish a Federal standard for  policing in and against African-American communities.   The calling card for such a bill came after thousands of Americans  took to the streets in the summer of 2020 to protest the brutal murders  from policing violence of George Floyd and other African Americans.                                time  2000    For too long, many Americans were considered dangerous and violent  simply because of the color of their skin.   We have been witness for some time now that police officers have been  allowed to violate the sanctity and privacy of African Americans while  in their cars, homes, or even standing on the sidewalk.   The time is now for us to create a nationwide standard for police  conduct to stop police brutality against African Americans and other  minorities.   This is a day we have been waiting for in the Black community for a  long time. I am hopeful that we can work together in a constructive  manner with my colleagues across the aisle and get this done.   I am honored to be a part of the Congressional Black Caucus that has  been a conscience and a voice for the American people and the  conscience of this body as it continues to talk about righteousness in  this Nation.
