 Mr. President, I am glad I was here to hear the wise  words of the Senator from Texas. I look at our region, in the Tennessee  Valley, compared to California. California is moving ahead with a  policy a lot like Vice President Biden's. They have got a high goal for  powering that whole State on wind and solar and closing their nuclear  plants.   What is happening in California? Rates are going through the roof,  and they are having rolling blackouts. What is happening in Tennessee  and the Tennessee Valley? The TVA has very wisely expanded nuclear  power so that it is more than 40 percent of our electricity.   Of course, nuclear power is totally emission-free--no carbon, zero  carbon--it is reliable, and it is, by far, most of the carbon-free  electricity we produce in this country. The combination of that nuclear  power, hydropower, and natural gas in Tennessee has given us one of the  cleanest areas. In the East Tennessee area where I live, I can see the  mountains clearly now because pollution control is on all the coal  plants.   So we need a realistic energy policy, not a fanciful one. We don't  want rolling blackouts throughout the country like California has  because they have adopted exactly the policy that Vice President Biden  is advocating.
