 Mr. President, Hoosiers have one less hero. On July 7,  Detective Greg Ferency died in the line of duty in Terre Haute, IN.  This is a tragic loss for his community and our State. Greg's life was  dedicated to protecting people, pursuing justice, and preventing  violence.   For 30 years, he served Terre Haute, the town where he was born and  raised, as a police officer; during 10 of those, he doubled as a member  of a Federal Bureau of Investigation task force.   Greg broke drug rings, battled the evil of human trafficking, and  helped defend places of worship from terrorism. He was constantly on  the frontlines in the fight against crime, leading and securing over  550 methamphetamine lab investigations. He was a teacher, too, training  teammates, leading community forums, and authoring a book on drug  enforcement.   A father of two, Greg was admired by his police peers and valued by  the Federal agents he worked with. ``You'll never meet a finer  person,'' remembered a colleague. The hundreds of friends and fellow  officers who paid tribute during his funeral bears witness to this.   We mourn his loss, we celebrate his life, and we keep his loved ones  in our hearts and prayers. And we remember this: What we call bravery,  the men and women who wear the badge simply call duty. They willingly  stand in the way of threats to decency and order. They face grave  dangers so other Americans do not have to.   Greg Ferency was one of these guardians. There are no words to  adequately express our gratitude to him. I ask my colleagues, though,  to join me in extending our sympathies to his family and pledging to  never forget his sacrifice.                            ____________________
