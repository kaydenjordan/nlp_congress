 Madam President, I would like to recognize the  retirement of MG Arthur Dean as CEO and executive chairman of Community  Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, known as CADCA. MG Arthur T. Dean,  U.S. Army, Retired, came from humble beginnings in North Carolina to  rise to the highest, most distinguished levels of military service,  where he retired after 31 years at the grade of major general. He  possesses numerous military awards, with the highest being two awards  of the U.S. Army Distinguished Service Medal.   I have had the honor to work with CADCA for many years and have long  supported their efforts to prevent drug abuse. For instance, I  supported and led efforts to create the Drug Free Communities Program  in 1997.   Major General Dean began his career as CEO and board chair at CADCA  in 1998, so we have had the pleasure of working on anti-drug efforts  for over 20 years. I applaud him in his well-deserved retirement.   Over the past 23 years of service, I have had the pleasure to witness  General Dean use his superior leadership, diplomatic skills, and  passion to build CADCA into a world-class organization. Under his  leadership, the Drug Free Communities Program has grown, and now over  2,000 communities benefit from these grants.   General Dean is a leader with vision, compassion, and a steely  determination to ensure that substance use prevention remains a  national priority so the next generation of Americans can grow up safe,  healthy and drug free.   General Dean has been an outstanding leader of CADCA. His legacy will  be one of progress and dedication towards reducing rates of youth  substance use and misuse.   I want to thank General Dean for his dedicated and exceptional  service to our Nation, both as a military and civilian leader, and wish  him well in his much-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
