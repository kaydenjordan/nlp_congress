 Mr. President, I look forward to coming to the floor and  speaking about the nomination that is currently before the U.S. Senate,  the nomination of Judge Barrett to be placed on the U.S. Supreme Court,  but at this point, I think it is important that we talk about what is  happening in Colorado as we speak because of the heroic men and women  who continue to fight our Nation's fires and certainly the devastating  and catastrophic fires that we are seeing right now in Colorado.   This year we have already seen two of the largest fires in Colorado  history burning over 200,000 acres--wildfires that started out at  20,000 acres, 25,000 acres, and then within hours grew 80-, 90-,  100,000 acres in a day. It is unheard of growth for wildfires.   The picture that I am showing you here is Estes Park, CO. Most people  may be familiar with Estes Park. It is the gateway to Rocky Mountain  National Park. You can see Lake Estes here and the town here. The town  has been evacuated. A town of thousands of people has been evacuated  because of two fires that are now threatening the area.   One fire is the Cameron Peak Fire, which became the largest fire in  the State's history, only to be challenged by another fire coming  through Rocky Mountain National Park called the East Troublesome Fire.  Both are impacting Rocky Mountain National Park. The city of Estes  Park, the city of Grand Lake, and the city of Granby, overnight, they  did receive a winter storm. It is snowing now, and it is reducing the  fire activity. It will not put the fire out. But my prayers and  thoughts continue with the men and women who are fighting this fire so  valiantly and the people in these communities who are in harm's way.   We know that homes have been lost. We don't know how many, but we  know that homes have been lost, and we certainly acknowledge the loss  of life that has already occurred. A couple in Grand Lake, who stayed  in their home when the fire came through--they were together, but we  pray for them and their families, and we mourn their loss.   The East Troublesome Fire, which is the Medicine Bow-Routt National  Forest and Thunder Basin National Grassland, has a Type 1 management  team already assigned. It is the No. 1 priority of the U.S. Forest  Service in the country right now because of the aggressive fire  behavior, with spotting that has threatened places like Estes Park.  There are evacuations, road closures, trail closures, and has over 500  people, right now, assigned to this fire.   The Cameron Peak Fire has about 1,100 personnel working on the fire  right now. We know about 470 structures have been lost. It is over  208,000 acres.   The Calwood Fire in Boulder County has a Type 2 management team  fighting the fire right now. Their evacuation is in effect. There are  nearly 400 people fighting this fire. There were 28 structures lost.   The Ice Fire--an ironic name--in the San Juan National Forest, near  Silverton, CO, we know that it is about 600 acres right now.   There is the Williams Fork Fire, which has been burning for months in  Colorado and Grand County. In Arapahoe and Roosevelt National Forests,  we know that there have been several communities and energy  infrastructure threatened by all these fires.   If you think about this entire town being evacuated, in the Colorado- Big Thompson Project, which provides a great deal of water to the Front  Range of Colorado and through the South Platte River Valley, diversions  were stopped, energy production impacted, and major utility  transmission lines have been lost.   And, of course, there is the loss to some of the most magnificent  areas of Rocky Mountain National Park, perhaps an untold story that we  will learn about in the coming days.   This Congress and past Congresses have not been idle in the work that  we have done to protect our resources. In fact, in this last Congress,  we put an end to a practice that was known as ``fire borrowing,'' which  involved raiding accounts that were not meant to go to suppression of  wildfires to pay for increasingly expensive firefighter seasons.   The fix for fire borrowing was included in the 2018 spending package.  What that means is we will no longer be cannibalizing funding for fuel  reduction for mitigation that could have prevented a fire like this.  Instead, we will be fully funding the firefighting effort and allowing  those mitigation dollars and those fuel reduction dollars to be  continued to be used so we can prevent this kind of fire from  occurring.   We have also passed legislation for water resilience projects and  categorical exclusions to help with forest management. We passed  Healthy Forest Restoration Act language that includes fire and fuel  breaks. We have worked on 20-year stewardship contracts with cottonwood  reform. We have proceeded with reforms to fire hazard mapping  [[Page S6459]]  initiatives and to fuels management for protection of electric  transmission lines and Good Neighbor Authority to help make sure we  continue to give tools to our land managers.   The 2018 farm bill built upon many of the reforms that we passed in  the 2014 farm bill changes. We have worked to expand the Collaborative  Forest Restoration Program. We doubled its funding to help expand Good  Neighbor Authorities to Tribes and to counties. All of these tools will  help us deal with the wildfires, but, certainly, they are not going to  put this fire out today.   So I come to the floor just to thank the men and women who are  fighting these fires. To the leaders in these communities, the county  commissioners, the sheriffs, the law enforcement personnel, first  responders who have done a magnificent job in protecting structures,  protecting their communities, protecting their people, I commend you,  and know that you have the support of everybody here in our efforts to  give you the tools you need to do your jobs, to be safe, and to protect  our greatest resources and communities.   So, again, I look forward to coming to the floor to speak about Judge  Barrett and her nomination, but, for now, I think it is important that  we take this time to recognize the challenge that Colorado faces and  the need for continued work in this Chamber to address forest  management and Healthy Forest Initiatives to make sure that we can  prevent these fires.   These are some of the original beetle kill areas that came in 30, 40  years ago. It was an insect that deadened and downed trees that we knew  at some point could be a major challenge if there was a fire, and that  is exactly what we are seeing.   I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in prayers for our  State and States across the country that have been affected by  wildfires and know that we have more work to do to prevent the loss of  some of our greatest natural resources.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor and spoke  about the forest fires in Colorado, and luckily we have had a great  deal of snow on some of the most problematic conflagrations, and it has  slowed the fires down tremendously and has given us a chance to fight  back and make some containment progress. So the news on the fire front  is generally a good-news story today, with more challenges to come down  the road.                       Nomination of Amy Coney Barrett    Mr. President, this morning I come to the floor to talk about the  nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to be placed on the U.S. Supreme  Court. That will be the third Supreme Court Justice I have had the  honor and privilege of voting on this Congress and the previous  Congress, including Neil Gorsuch, Colorado's own Neil Gorsuch.   We have heard a lot of discussion about the Federalist Papers and our  Founding Fathers and the intent and the role of the Senate. The  language of the Constitution points out that the President shall  nominate and, with the advice and consent of the Senate, place Justices  throughout our judiciary.   We have heard in Federalist 69 by Alexander Hamilton, the President  is to nominate and, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to  appoint Ambassadors and other public ministers, Justices of the Supreme  Court.   In Federalist 69, Hamilton goes on to compare the power of  appointment that the President has or the Chief Executive has to that  of the King of Great Britain, even comparing the power of appointment  to the Governor of New York--Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 69 did-- and he stated that both the King and the Governor of New York at that  time had a greater power of appointment than the President due to the  requirement of advice and consent and the ability of the Governor of  New York to actually cast a vote on the matter himself. To quote  Alexander Hamilton, ``In the national government, if the Senate should  be divided, no appointment could be made.'' He pointed out that the  President has a concurrent authority in appointing offices and the  President is not the sole author of these appointments.   It is clear in Alexander Hamilton's writings that this power was  intended to be diluted; that it was to be balanced amongst the  Chambers; that the judicial branch was viewed as the weakest of the  three branches of government, not because it wasn't equal in power but  because it didn't have some of the mechanisms that the other two  branches do to protect it.   While the President makes that appointment, it is this Chamber--the  sole duty of this Chamber, in the Constitution, to agree or disagree  with that nomination.   We saw that disagreement occur in 2016 when this Chamber did not give  its consent to a nomination. Later, Neil Gorsuch--Colorado's Neil  Gorsuch--was confirmed to the Supreme Court. And just a matter of a  little more than a month ago, we lost a trailblazing leader in Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, leaving open another seat on the Supreme Court  that we are now asked to fill.   Federalist 78, also written by Alexander Hamilton, has been  referenced many times on the floor this past year, and particularly  during this debate. He wrote about the Constitution being fundamental  law, that it is the will of the people and that the courts are the only  true guardians--the only true guardians--of the Constitution; that the  Constitution is the highest manmade law, that any legislative act to  the contrary must be held void by the court, since ``the interpretation  of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts''--that  it was the guardian of the Constitution.   When Madison was talking about this in the First Congress, he  introduced, of course, the amendments that became what we call the Bill  of Rights today. He said that the courts would ``consider themselves in  a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights; they would be an  impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the  legislative or executive; they will be naturally led to resist every  encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution  by the declaration of rights.''   That idea of this ``guardian of the Constitution'' that the courts  play is a hallmark of our democracy today. And whether or not a Justice  has the support of a Member of this Chamber, I don't believe that  anyone would deny that role that our courts must play, and that is that  role as guardian of the Constitution.   It is clear in the confirmation hearing for Judge Barrett that some  people believe the guardian of the Constitution takes on a different  hue, that there is more to that role than simply looking at the law and  making a decision based on the law. As some called it--I believe it was  Justice Scalia and perhaps paraphrased by Justice Gorsuch--a judge's  role is to call balls and strikes. I would add to that it is not their  role to call the pitch.   But what we saw during the Judiciary Committee hearings, of course,  was a viewpoint of some that a judge should be more than calling balls  and strikes. A judge should be, in effect, a super legislator; that a  judge should accomplish things that this Chamber, this Congress, has  failed to do; that if there is a shortcoming in a policy, a judge or  Justice would look the other way and fill in that policy or write that  policy or proactively create that policy.   That is, again, going back to what we have known throughout this  country as the guardians of the Constitution. The guardians of the  Constitution don't make up policy. They don't fill voids of new  policies that the legislators didn't do or couldn't do because they  couldn't get it through their Chamber. So they decided they would count  on a judge to do it somewhere else. That is not the role of the courts.  It is certainly not the role of a guardian of the Constitution.   A guardian of the Constitution is somebody who looks at the law and  makes decisions on the law and upholds and protects that will of the  people, the fundamental law of the people. And, of course, an activist  judge--an activist Justice--would be reaching  [[Page S6559]]  into the law to fit their own personal opinion or beliefs to craft  something that they believe is perhaps more in line with what they  thought somebody wanted and more in line with their own opinions,  instead of looking at that letter of the law.   I think it is important that we keep in mind that that is not the  role of the courts. If this Chamber can't pass a policy or a law, if it  can't have its own victory in carrying the day in an argument, it is  not up to a judge or a Justice to fill in the blank. They have to rule  and carry out the law.   So that is a real key distinction that we saw during the Judiciary  Committee debates--that role of policymaker that some wish Judge  Barrett to be versus that role of protector, that guardian of the  Constitution, calling balls and strikes.   I look at any nominee for the courts, whether it is for district  court or appellate court or the Supreme Court, through this lens: Are  they going to protect that Constitution? Are they going to uphold the  Constitution? Are they going to fight and defend and be the guardian of  the Constitution? Are they going to protect and do the same with the  law, outside of the Constitution--the laws, the statutes that this body  enacts and passes and are signed into law by the President? Will that  judge or Justice uphold and defend that law--not make that law, not  change that law but uphold the law? And, of course, there is that  guardian of the Constitution role that they will play.   There is no doubt that Judge Barrett's qualifications are immense.  Her qualifications as a member of our great American community and  somebody with a beautiful family is mind-boggling. Jaime and I have a  challenge with our three kids, making sure they get to school on time  and making sure they are getting their homework done. I can't imagine  seven children, while also carrying the schedule that their family  does. But it is a testament to the incredible power and the leadership  of their family and their dedication to being upstanding citizens of  this Nation and giving back to this Nation with this new pursuit.   We know about that key intellect that has been shared with this  country over the last several years in the Seventh Circuit Court of  Appeals. We know of her time as a law professor, and we have had the  opportunity to look over a decade-plus worth of work.   We know that she is a person of faith in our community and has come  under incredible attacks because of that faith. We know in this Chamber  that our Constitution actually forbids the kinds of attacks that we  have seen on her faith. Our Constitution makes it clear that there is  no religious test. Our Constitution actually makes it very clear that  you cannot vote or deny public service appointment to someone because  of their religious beliefs.   We have seen it done. We have seen it tried, especially over the last  Congress. We saw it done at the Budget Committee with the nomination of  Russ Vought to be the deputy director of the Office of Management and  Budget, when a colleague of ours basically said that because of his  deeply held Christian beliefs that he was not qualified to be a public  servant in this country.   I hope the American people are hearing what is happening in some of  these debates, that Amy Coney Barrett is attacked because of her faith.  But it is not just limited or isolated to her. There are others who are  more and more accustomed, or who feel more and more empowered,  emboldened to use a person's faith to deny them their vote to  a position in our government. That is an unconstitutional test that  some in this Chamber are starting to rely on, and I hope the American  people will use this opportunity to see through it, to reject it, and  to get back to the values of our Constitution and the intent of that  language.    I had a conversation with Judge Barrett. I had a chance to visit with  her, and I talked about those three qualifications to uphold the  Constitution. Will you fight to protect the Constitution? Will you  protect the law? And will you avoid being that activist legislator?  Will you avoid legislating from the bench? And I received her  commitment. That is exactly the kind of judge that she will be,  somebody to be that guardian of the Constitution, the protector of law,  and to call balls and strikes.   I talked to her about the importance that I know that the vote that I  cast for her is something that matters not just next year or the next  year but 10 or 20 years from now, as she is on that Court and that that  same view will remain, and she assured me that it will because of the  same reason that I want it to. That is the future of our kids and their  kids, and she knows it means everything to her children as well--to  protect our Nation's laws and Constitution and to avoid that attempt,  that desire, that pull at the heart to legislate. Even if you want to  come out with an opinion that is different than your own interpretation  of the law, you have to follow the law, and that is what she has  assured me she has done. She has assured me that there are moments in  rulings that she has issued that she would have preferred a different  outcome personally, but that is not what the law required, and that is  why she ruled the way that she did.   In talking to my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, they talked  about her understanding of the law, and in watching the hearings, you  could sense the deep commitment and devotion to the law. There was a  time several decades ago, when President Ronald Reagan went to  introduce Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to a group of Federal judges at  the White House, and Ronald Reagan in his speech talked about what it  means to be a judge. He talked about the exacting standards of  integrity and fairness and intellect that are required for a Federal  judgeship--that it provides reassurance to all of us that our ideals of  liberty and justice are alive and well.   He went on to talk about the most important quality that we could  have in a judge, and that was wisdom. That wisdom is the quality that  we look for most, and I think you could sense a great deal of wisdom in  Amy Coney Barrett.   He went on to say that we demand of our judges a wisdom that knows no  time, has no prejudice, and wants no other reward. We entrust judges  with our ideals and freedom, and our futures depend on the way that  judge defines them. It requires the lonely courage of a patriot. And he  went on to say: A judge is a guardian of freedom for generations yet  unborn.   So, I hope that my colleagues will support the nomination of Amy  Coney Barrett. If you could take the politics out of the place, she  would probably have a unanimous vote. Unfortunately, the politicization  of this nomination is going to prevent that. But I just urge my  colleagues to look past the politics, to look past the partisanship,  and to vote for a truly qualified justice who is committed to the law  and to the Constitution, who is committed against activism on the  bench, and who will make sure that our country, for generations to  come, has a protector of that guardian of the Constitution with the  wisdom to get the job done.   I urge my colleagues to support Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and I am  honored, in just a few hours, to know that I will be able to cast a  vote in support of soon-to-be Justice Amy Coney Barrett.   I yield the floor.
