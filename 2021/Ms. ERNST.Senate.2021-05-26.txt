 Madam President, I rise again today in support of my  colleague in calling for consideration of the Military Justice  Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act. This is an effort whose time  has come for serious debate and consideration on the Senate floor.   For 8 years, the Senate Armed Services Committee, on which Senator  Gillibrand and I sit, has worked on countless efforts to seek justice  for victims of sexual assault, all within the chain of command. Many of  these were good provisions pushed by myself and others to reduce the  barriers in reporting sexual assaults. Provisions focused on both  prevention and professionalization of military courts handling sexual  assault cases and efforts to improve the culture and ensure all  enlistees receive sexual assault prevention training before attendance  at their initial training. This is just to name a few.   What has brought me here today supporting this effort with Senator  Gillibrand and Senator Grassley, with 64 cosponsors in the Senate, is  that while these efforts were well-intentioned, our plague continues.  That is not OK with me as a combat veteran, a former commander, and  sexual assault survivor myself.   If our military is going to face the threats of the decades ahead, we  will need a force that is free from the threats in its own ranks. As I  mentioned, this legislation has 64 bipartisan cosponsors and more than  50 percent of committee members' support.   It is the right bill at the right time, and we must not delay any  further. So I join with Senator Gillibrand in a call for consideration  of this bill.   I yield back to the Senator from New York.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, just 1 percent of the U.S. population  serves in the defense of our great Nation. America owes an immeasurable  debt of gratitude to this small number of citizens who give so much to  protect our freedoms and our way of life.   May is Military Appreciation Month, so on behalf of the people of  Iowa and me personally, I want to thank each and every one of the women  and men of our Armed Forces and their families.   We may celebrate you in May, but we appreciate you every single day.  You are the ones whom we call upon to defend our Nation from our  foreign adversaries and rogue actors who intend to harm us. You are the  ones we called upon when COVID-19 seeped into our borders and shut down  America. You stood guard to ensure our way of life succeeds. Thank you  for being the greatest fighting force on the face of the planet.   After 23 years of my own military service, with great pride, I now  get to watch as my daughter soon embarks on her career as an Army  officer.   Libby, thank you for your willingness to serve and the sacrifices you  have committed to.   While serving in the military is one of the most rewarding  experiences, it is not easy. As we approach Memorial Day, we must all  take time to remember the servicemembers and their families who have  paid the ultimate price, laying down their lives for our great Nation.   Iowa has lost 158 of our sons and daughters in Iraq and Afghanistan,  2 in Panama or Grenada, 7 in the first Persian Gulf war, and 867 in  Vietnam. Our Korean and world wars numbers were in the thousands.   While I won't be able to individually honor all of these heroes,  today I would like to echo a few names in remembrance of Iowans we lost  in the defense of our Nation.                          Honoring Our Armed Forces                      Gunnery Sergeant Jeffrey E. Bohr    Madam President, Marine GySgt Jeffrey E. Bohr, Jr., is from the tiny  farm town of Ossian. He was 39 years old when he was killed on April  10, 2003, after a 7-hour gun battle in front of a Baghdad, Iraq,  mosque.   Gunnery Sergeant Bohr served a 20-year career as an Army Ranger and  then a Marine. He was assigned to 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment,  Camp Pendleton, CA, at the time of his death. He was the first Iowan  killed by enemy fire in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he was  posthumously awarded the Silver Star.   Gunnery Sergeant Bohr left behind his wife Lori, who is also a native  of Iowa.                          Honoring Our Armed Forces                       Sergeant James C. Kearney III    Madam President, Army SGT James C. Kearney III--I know him as Jamie.  He was an Iowa National Guardsman from Emerson, which is 10 miles from  where I grew up. I knew Jamie before he enlisted in the Iowa Army  National Guard. He was very excited about his enlistment, and he told  me about his excitement and how he felt that he had found a place that  truly rewarded him.   He was 22 years old when he died on November 1, 2004, in Salerno,  Afghanistan, from injuries he sustained when his convoy was attacked by  enemy forces using rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire in  Afghanistan.   Sergeant Kearney was assigned to 1st Battalion, 168th Infantry, in  Glenwood, IA, at his death. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of  sergeant and awarded a Bronze Star with a ``V'' device for valor. He  was the first Iowan killed in Operation Enduring Freedom, and our  community misses Jamie to this day.                          Honoring Our Armed Forces                  Petty Officer 2nd Class Jaime S. Jaenke    Madam President, Navy PO2 Jaime Jaenke was a naval reservist and a  native of Iowa Falls. She is beautiful, isn't she? She was 30 years old  when she was killed on June 5, 2006, in Al Anbar Province, Iraq, when a  roadside bomb struck the Humvee that she was riding in.   She was assigned to the Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 25, based  in Fort McCoy, WI, at her death. She was posthumously awarded the Navy- Marine Corps Commendation Medal with ``V'' for valor.   She left behind her daughter, Kayla. She was the first woman killed  in Operation Iraqi Freedom from Iowa.                          Honoring Our Armed Forces                     Lance Corporal Adam Franklin Wolf    Madam President, LCpl Adam Franklin Wolf is from Eldon. He was 25  years old when he was killed on June 20, 2014, in Helmand Province,  Afghanistan, when a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device detonated  near his vehicle.   He was assigned to the 2nd Combat Engineer Battalion, 2nd Marine  Division, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force, from Camp Lejeune, NC.   He is Iowa's most recent fatality. His twin brother and family  survive him.                         Honoring Gold Star Families    Madam President, another group of strength and resiliency I want to  acknowledge today is our Gold Star families. They are the ones left  behind in battle and in war. We owe it to the heroes who gave their all  to protect and care for their families and their communities.   To every Gold Star family, thank you. Thank you for the sacrifices  you  [[Page S3486]]  have made and continue to make every day. I assure you, you are not  alone or forgotten.   I would like to take just a brief moment of silence in honor of those  we lost in combat or due to everlasting combat injuries.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Stephen  Voline, a legislative defense fellow in my office, be granted floor  privileges for the remainder of the day.
