 Madam President, I move to proceed to S.J. Res. 54.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I just wanted clarification. Was it  section 1546 or 1446?   You are right. OK.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use an  oversized floor display.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about one of  the great humanitarian crises facing our planet, and that is the  horrific war in Yemen.   In March of 2015, under the leadership of Muhammad bin Salman, who  was then the Saudi Defense Minister and is now, of course, the Crown  Prince, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen's  ongoing civil war. As a result of the Saudi-UAE intervention, Yemen is  now experiencing the worst humanitarian disaster in the world.   According to the United Nations, Yemen is at risk of the most severe  famine in more than 100 years, with some 14 million people facing  starvation. In one of the poorest countries on Earth, as a result of  this terrible war, according to the Save the Children organization,  some 85,000 Yemeni children have already starved to death over the last  several years, and millions more face starvation if the war continues.   Further, Yemen is currently experiencing the worst cholera outbreak  in the world, with there being as many as 10,000 new cases each week,  according to the World Health Organization. This is a disease that is  spread by infected water that causes severe diarrhea and dehydration  and will only accelerate the death rate. The cholera outbreak has  occurred because Saudi bombs have destroyed Yemen's water  infrastructure and because people there are no longer able to access  clean water.   Last week, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote an  article, which I urge all Members to read, that describes his recent  visit to Yemen.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the New York  Times article, ``Your Tax Dollars Help Starve Children.''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Dec. 7, 2018]               Opinion--Your Tax Dollars Help Starve Children                           (By Nicholas Kristof)         Aden, Yemen.--He is an 8-year-old boy who is starving and       has limbs like sticks, but Yaqoob Walid doesn't cry or       complain. He gazes stolidly ahead, tuning out everything, for       in late stages of starvation the human body focuses every       calorie simply on keeping the organs functioning.        Yaqoob arrived unconscious at Al Sadaqa Hospital here,       weighing just over 30 pounds. He has suffered complications,       and doctors say that it is unclear he will survive and that       if he does he may suffer permanent brain damage.        Some 85,000 children may have already died here in Yemen,       and 12 million more people may be on the brink of starvation,       casualties in part of the three-year-old American-backed       Saudi war in Yemen. United Nations officials and aid experts       warn that this could become the worst famine the world has       seen in a generation.        ``The risk of a major catastrophe is very high,'' Mark       Lowcock, the United Nations humanitarian chief, told me. ``In       the worst case, what we have in Yemen now has the potential       to be worse than anything any professional in this field has       seen during their working lives.''        Both the Obama and Trump administrations have supported the       Saudi war in Yemen with a military partnership, arms sales,       intelligence sharing and until recently air-to-air refueling.       The United States is thus complicit in what some human rights       experts believe are war crimes.        The bottom line: Our tax dollars are going to starve       children.        I fell in love with Yemen's beauty and friendliness on my       first visit, in 2002, but this enchanting country is now in       convulsions. When people hear an airplane today in much of       Yemen, they flinch and wonder if they are about to be bombed,       and I had interviews interrupted by automatic weapons fire       overhead.        After witnessing the human toll and interviewing officials       on both sides, including the president of the Houthi rebels       who control much of Yemen, I find the American and Saudi role       in this conflict to be unconscionable. The Houthis are       repressive and untrustworthy, but this is not a reason to       bomb and starve Yemeni children.        What is most infuriating is that the hunger is caused not       by drought or extreme weather, but by cynical and failed       policies in Riyadh and Washington. The starvation does  [[Page S7484]]       not seem to be an accidental byproduct of war, but rather a       weapon in it. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,       backed by the United States, are trying to inflict pain to       gain leverage over and destabilize the Houthi rebels. The       reason: The Houthis are allied with Iran.        The governments of Saudi Arabia and the United States don't       want you to see pictures like Yaqoob's or reflect on the       suffering in Yemen. The Saudis impose a partial blockade on       Houthi areas, banning commercial flights and barring       journalists from special United Nations planes there. I've       been trying for more than two years to get through the Saudi       blockade, and I finally was able to by tagging onto Lowcock's       United Nations delegation.        After a major famine, there is always soul-searching about       how the world could have allowed this to happen. What's       needed this time is not soul-searching a few years from now,       but action today to end the war and prevent a cataclysm.        The problem in Yemen is not so much a shortage of food as       it is an economic collapse--GDP has fallen in half since the       war started--that has left people unable to afford food.        Yaqoob was especially vulnerable. He is the second of eight       children in a poor household with a father who has mental       health problems and can't work steadily. Moreover, the       father, like many Yemenis, chews qat--a narcotic leaf that is       very widely used in Yemen and offers an easy high. This       consumes about $1 a day, reducing the budget available for       food. The family sold some land to pay for Yaqoob's care, so       its situation is now even more precarious.        A few rooms down from Yaqoob was Fawaz Abdullah, 18 months       old, his skin mottled and discolored with sores. Fawaz is so       malnourished that he has never been able to walk or say more       than ``Ma'' or ``Ba.''        Fawaz's mother, Ruqaya Saleh, explained that life fell       apart after her home in the port city of Hudaydah was       destroyed by a bomb (probably an American one, as many are).       Her family fled to Aden, and her husband is struggling to       find occasional work as a day laborer.        ``I used to be able to buy whatever I wanted, including       meat and fish,'' she told me. Since fleeing, she said, war-      induced poverty has meant that she hasn't been able to buy a       single fish or egg--and that is why Fawaz suffers severe       protein deficiency.        ``They asked me to buy milk for Fawaz, but we can't afford       it now,'' she said.        We think of war casualties as men with their legs blown       off. But in Yemen the most common war casualties are children       like Fawaz who suffer malnutrition.        Some will die. Even the survivors may suffer lifelong brain       damage. A majority of Yemen children are now believed to be       physically stunted from malnutrition (46 percent were stunted       even before the war), and physical stunting is frequently       accompanied by diminished brain development.        ``These children are the future of Yemen,'' Dr. Aida       Hussein, a nutrition specialist, told me, looking at Fawaz.       ``He will be stunted. How will he do in school?''        The war and lack of health care facilities have also led to       outbreaks of deadly diseases like diphtheria and cholera.       Half of the country's clinics and hospitals are closed.        In the capital, Sana, I met a child who was suffering both       malnutrition and cholera. The boy was Saddam Hussein (he was       named for the Iraqi leader), eight years old, and the parents       repeat the mantra I hear from everyone: Life is much worse       now because of the war.        ``We don't know what we will eat tomorrow,'' Saddam's       mother told me.        Yemen began to disintegrate in the aftermath of the Arab       Spring, and then the Houthis, a traditional clan in the       north, swept down on Sana and seized much of the country. The       Houthis follow Zaydi Islam, which is related to the Shiite       branch dominant in Iran, and the Saudis and some Americans       see them as Iranian stooges.        In some ways, the Houthis have been successful. They have       imposed order and crushed Al Qaeda and the Islamic State in       the parts of Yemen they control, and in Sana I felt secure       and didn't fear kidnapping.        However, the Houthis operate a police state and are hostile       to uncovered women, gays and anyone bold enough to criticize       them. They recruit child soldiers from the age of about 12       (the Saudi- and American-backed forces wait until boys are       about 15), interfere with food aid, and have engaged in       torture and attacks on civilians.        Still, the civilian loss of life has overwhelmingly been       caused not by the Houthis but by Saudi Arabia, the United       Arab Emirates and America, through both bombings and       starvation. It's ridiculous for the Trump administration to       be exploring naming the Houthis a terrorist organization. And       while the Houthis are allies of Iran, I think the Saudis       exaggerate when they suggest that the Houthis are Iranian       pawns.        The foreign minister on the Houthi side is Hisham Sharaf       Abdalla, a congenial American-educated official.        ``I love the U.S.,'' Mr. Sharaf told me. ``We look to the       U.S. as the only force that can stop this war.''        Peace talks are now beginning in Sweden--few people expect       them to solve the crisis soon--and he insisted that his side       was eager to reach a peace deal and improve relations with       America.        After our conversation, he brought me over to his desk and       showed me his assault rifle and two handguns. ``When I was in       the U.S., I was a member of the N.R.A.,'' he told me. ``I       would like to have an N.R.A. chapter in Yemen.''        Mr. Sharaf talks a good game but is not himself a Houthi,       just an ally, so I wondered if he was a figurehead trotted       out to impress foreigners. Later I interviewed a man whose       power is unquestioned: Muhammad Ali al-Houthi, the president       of the Supreme Revolutionary Committee. As his name       signifies, he is a member of the Houthi clan.        An aide picked me up and ferried me to him, for President       Houthi changes locations daily to avoid being bombed by the       Saudis.        President Houthi, a large, confident man with a traditional       dagger at his belly, was friendly to me but also suspicious       of the United States and full of conspiracy theories. He       suggested that Washington was secretly arming Al Qaeda and       that the United States was calling the shots for Saudi Arabia       in Yemen, at the behest of Israel.        Still, he said that he wanted peace and that although the       Houthis have fired missiles at Saudi Arabia, his side would       pose no threat to Saudi Arabia if the Saudis would only end       their assault on Yemen.        ``There's no need for enmity with the United States,'' he       told me in Arabic, and that seemed a message he wanted me to       convey to Washington and the American people.        I asked President Houthi about the sarkha, the group's       slogan: ``God is great! Death to America! Death to Israel!       Curses on the Jews! Victory to Islam!'' That didn't seem so       friendly, I said.        ``It's nothing against the American people,'' he replied.       ``It's directed toward the system.''        When I asked about Saudi and American suggestions that the       Houthis are Iranian pawns, he laughed.        ``That's just propaganda,'' he said. ``I ask you: Have you       ever seen one Iranian in Yemen? Do we speak Farsi?'' This was       all a trick, he said, analogous to the allegations of weapons       of mass destruction used to justify war with Iraq.        While the Houthis are called ``rebels,'' they clearly rule       their territory. In contrast, the Saudi- and American-backed       ``internationally recognized government'' of Yemen is a shell       that controls almost no territory--hence it is based in       Riyadh. The ``president'' of this exile government, Abdu       Rabbu Mansour Hadi, is said to be gravely ill, and when he is       gone it will be even more difficult to sustain the fiction       that this is a real government.        More broadly, I don't see any hint of a Saudi or American       strategy. There's little sign that bombing and starvation       will actually dislodge the Houthis, while the Saudi military       action and resulting chaos has benefited the Yemeni branches       of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. In that sense, America's       conduct in Yemen has hurt our own national security.        In one sign of the ineffectiveness of the Western-backed       government, the hunger is now as severe in its areas as in       the rebel-held north. I saw worse starvation in Aden, the       lovely seaside city in the south that is nominally run by the       internationally recognized government, than in Houthi-      controlled Sana.        And while I felt reasonably secure in Houthi-controlled       areas, I was perpetually nervous in Aden. Abductions and       murders occur regularly there, and my guesthouse offered not       a mint on the pillow, but a bulletproof vest; at night, sleep       was interrupted by nearby fighting among unknown gunmen.        What limited order exists in Aden is provided by soldiers       from the United Arab Emirates and allied militias, and I       worry that the U.A.E. is getting fed up with the war and may       pull them out without alternative arrangements for security.       If that happens, Aden may soon plunge into Somalia-like       chaos.        Mohamed Zemam, the governor of the central bank, believes       that there are ways to shore up the economy and prevent       starvation. But he cautions that the risk of another Somalia       is real, and he estimates that there may be two million       Yemenis in one fighting force or another.        ``What they have is the way of the gun,'' he said. ``If we       don't solve that, we will have problems for 100 years.''        Another danger is that the Saudi coalition will press ahead       so that fighting closes the port of Hudaydah, through which       most food and fuel come.        I stopped in Saudi Arabia to speak to senior officials       there about Yemen, and we had some tough exchanges. I showed       them photos on my phone of starving children, and they said       that this was unfortunate and undesired. ``We are not       devils,'' one said indignantly. They insisted that they would       welcome peace--but that they must confront the Houthis.        ``The most important thing for us is national security,''       the Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed Al-Jabir, told me.       Dr. Abdullah Al Rabeeah, an adviser to the royal court and       director of a fund that provides aid to Yemen, told me that       Saudis don't want to see hunger in Yemen but added: ``We will       continue to do what it takes to fight terrorism. It's not an       easy decision.''        Saudi and U.A.E. officials note that they provide an       enormous amount of humanitarian aid to Yemen. This is true,       and it mitigates the suffering there. But it's difficult to       give the Saudis much credit for relieving the suffering of a       country that they are bombing and starving.        To avert a catastrophe in Yemen, the world needs to provide       more humanitarian aid. But above all, the war has to end.  [[Page S7485]]         ``You're not going to solve this long-term until the war is       ended,'' said David Beasley, the executive director of the       World Food Program. ``It's a man-made problem, and it needs a       man-made solution.''        That solution will entail strong American backing for a       difficult United Nations-backed peace process involving       Yemeni factions and outsiders, aiming for a measure of power       sharing. This diplomatic process requires engaging the       Houthis, not just bombing them. It also means a cease-fire       and pressure on all sides to ensure humanitarian access and       the passage of food and fuel. The best leverage America has       to make the Saudis part of the solution is to suspend arms       sales to Riyadh so long as the Saudis continue the war.        In conference rooms in Riyadh and Washington, officials       simply don't fathom the human toll of their policies.        In a makeshift camp for displaced people in Aden, I met a       couple who lost two daughters--Bayan, 11, and Bonyan, 8--in a       bombing in a crowded market.        ``I heard the bomb and I went running after them,'' the       dad, Ahmed Abdullah, told me with an ache in his voice.       ``They were dead. One had her skull burst open, and the other       had no arms or legs left.''        He told me that the family then fled, and he married off a       15-year-old daughter so that someone else would be       responsible for feeding her. This is common: The share of       girls married by age 18 has increased from 50 percent before       the war to two-thirds today, according to Unicef.        Another son died of fever when the family could not afford       to take the boy to a hospital. There are several other       children, and none of them are going to school any more; a       10-year-old daughter, Baraa, who is next in line to be       married, couldn't tell me what seven plus eight equals.        A bit hesitantly, I told Ahmed that I thought that my       country, America, had probably provided the bomb that had       killed his daughters. He was not angry, just resigned.        ``I am not an educated person,'' he told me earnestly. ``I       am a simple parent.'' And then he offered more wisdom than I       heard from the sophisticated policy architects in America and       Saudi Arabia: ``My message is that I want the war to stop.''     Let me just take this opportunity to quote some of what  he said in that December 7 New York Times article:         Some 85,000 children may have already died here in Yemen,       and 12 million more people may be on the brink of starvation,       casualties in part of the three-year-old American-backed       Saudi war in Yemen. United Nations officials and aid experts       warn that this could become the worst famine the world has       seen in a generation.    ``The risk of a major catastrophe is very high,'' Mark Lowcock, the  United Nations humanitarian chief, told me. ``In the worst case, what  we have in Yemen now has the potential to be worse than anything any  professional in this field has seen during their working lives.''   Nicholas Kristof continues:         What is most infuriating is that the hunger is caused not       by drought or extreme weather, but by cynical and failed       policies in Riyadh and Washington. The starvation does not       seem to be an accidental byproduct of war, but rather a       weapon in it. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,       backed by the United States, are trying to inflict pain to       gain leverage over and destabilize the Houthi rebels. The       reason: The Houthis are allied with Iran.    He continues:         The problem in Yemen is not so much a shortage of food as       it is an economic collapse--GDP has fallen in half since the       war started--that has left people unable to afford food.    Kristof continues, and I want you to hear this:         We think of war casualties as men with their legs blown       off. But in Yemen the most common war casualties are children       like Fawaz who suffer malnutrition.    He continues:         Some will die. Even the survivors may suffer lifelong brain       damage. A majority of Yemen children are now believed to be       physically stunted from malnutrition.    Let me repeat that:         A majority of Yemen children are now believed to be       physically stunted from malnutrition (46 percent were stunted       even before the war), and physical stunting is frequently       accompanied by diminished brain development.    ``These children are the future of Yemen,'' Dr. Aida Hussein, a  nutrition specialist, told me, looking at Fawaz. ``He will be stunted.  How will he do in school?''         The war and lack of health care facilities have also led to       outbreaks of deadly diseases like diphtheria and cholera.       Half of the country's clinics and hospitals are closed.    That was written by Nick Kristof of the New York Times.   The fact of the matter is that the United States, with very little  media attention, has been Saudi Arabia's partner in this horrific war.  We have been providing the bombs the Saudi-led coalition has been  using, refueling their planes before they drop those bombs, and  assisting with intelligence.   In too many cases, our weapons are being used to kill civilians. In  August, it was an American-made bomb that obliterated a schoolbus full  of young boys, killing dozens and wounding many others. A CNN report  found evidence that American weapons have been used in a string of such  deadly attacks on civilians since the war began.   According to the independent monitoring group, Yemen Data Project,  between 2015 and March 2018, more than 30 percent of the Saudi-led  coalition's targets have been nonmilitary.   A few weeks ago, I met with several brave human rights activists from  Yemen in my office. They had come to urge Congress to put a stop to  this war. They told me, clearly, when Yemenis see ``Made in USA'' on  the bombs that are killing them, it tells them the USA is responsible  for this war, and that is the sad truth.   The bottom line is, the United States should not be supporting a  catastrophic war led by a despotic regime with a dangerous and  irresponsible military policy.   Some have suggested that Congress moving to withdraw support from  this war would undermine U.N. efforts to reach a peace agreement, but I  would argue that the exact opposite is true. It is the promise of  unconditional U.S. support for the Saudis that have undermined the  efforts toward peace. We have evidence for this.   Just yesterday, we received news that U.N. Special Envoy Martin  Griffiths made a breakthrough agreement for the exchange in that war of  some 15,000 prisoners--a significant development. This is an important  step in building the necessary trust for a broader peace agreement.   A piece published today in TRT World observes: ``[T]here seems to be  a firmer willingness to reach an agreement than in previous talks, as  the Yemeni government realises that the international pressure on its  backer, Saudi Arabia, is growing.''   So our effort to move this resolution forward may have already made a  positive impact. I thank all of my 18 cosponsors and all of the many  civil society organizations--progressive and conservative--who have  worked so hard to raise awareness of this horrific conflict.   Above and beyond the humanitarian crisis, this war has been a  disaster for our national security and for the security of the region.  The administration defends our engagement in Yemen by overstating  Iranian support for the Houthi rebels. Let me be clear. Iran's support  for Houthis is of serious concern for me, and I believe for all of us,  but the fact is, the relationship between Iran and the Houthis has only  been strengthened with the intensification of the war. This war is  creating the very problem the Trump administration claims it wants to  solve.   Further, the war is also undermining the broader effort against  violent extremists. A 2016 State Department report found the conflict  has helped al-Qaida and ISIS ``deepen their inroads across much of the  country.'' This war, as I see it, is both a humanitarian and a  strategic disaster.   Further--and I think it is important to state what everybody knows,  although we don't talk about it terribly often--Saudi Arabia is a  despotic regime, controlled by one family, the Saud family, one of the  wealthiest and most powerful families on Earth.   In a 2017 report by the Cato Institute--a conservative think tank-- Saudi Arabia was ranked 149th out of 159 countries for freedom and  human rights. For decades, the Saudis have funded schools, mosques, and  preachers who promote an extreme form of Islam known as Wahhabism.   In Saudi Arabia today, women are not treated as second-class  citizens; they are treated as third-class citizens. Women still need,  in the year 2018, the permission of a male guardian to go to school or  to get a job. They have to follow a strict dress code and can be stoned  to death for adultery or flogged for spending time in the company of a  man who is not their relative.   Earlier this year, Saudi activist, Loujain al-Hathloul, a leader in  the fight for women's rights in Saudi Arabia, was kidnapped from Abu  Dhabi and  [[Page S7486]]  forced to return to the country. She is currently being held without  charges. The same is true of many other Saudi political activists.   Human Rights Watch recently reported that imprisoned women activists  have been subjected to torture, including electric shocks, and other  forms of physical and sexual assault.   Further, as every Member of the Senate knows or should know, there is  now overwhelming evidence that Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman  was responsible for the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi  dissident who lived in the United States. He was a columnist for the  Washington Post. He made the mistake of going into the Saudi consulate  in Turkey and never came out alive. We believe his body was  dismembered, and nobody knows where it is.   Unbelievably, President Trump continues--despite the overwhelming  evidence of the Crown Prince's involvement in the murder of a man  living in the United States, a Saudi dissident journalist--to proclaim  his love and affection for the Crown Prince and the Saudi regime, but  that is not how, in my view, the American people feel.   For too many years, American men and women in our military have put  their lives on the line in the never-ending struggle for democracy and  human rights, and we cannot and must not turn their struggles, their  sacrifices aside in order to follow the military adventurism of a  despotic regime. That is not what this country is supposed to be about.   Finally, an issue that has long been a concern to many of us-- conservatives and progressives--is that this war has not been  authorized by Congress and is therefore unconstitutional. Article I of  the Constitution clearly states it is Congress, not the President, that  has the power to send our men and women into war--Congress, not the  President.   The Framers of our Constitution, the Founders of this country, gave  the power to declare war to Congress--the branch most accountable to  the people--not to the President, who is often isolated from the  reality of what is taking place in our communities.   The truth is--and Democratic and Republican Presidents are  responsible, and Democratic and Republican Congresses are responsible-- that for many years, Congress has not exercised its constitutional  responsibility over whether our young men and women go off to war.   I think there is growing sentiment all over this country from  Republicans, from Democrats, from Independents, from progressives, and  from conservatives that right now, Congress cannot continue to abdicate  its constitutional responsibility.   I believe we have become far too comfortable with the United States  engaging in military interventions all over the world. We have now been  in Afghanistan for over 17 years--the longest war in American history.  Our troops are now in Syria under what I believe are questionable  authorities. The time is long overdue for Congress to reassert its  constitutional role in determining when and where our country goes to  war.   If you want to vote for a war, vote for a war. If you want to vote  against a war, vote against a war, but we as a Congress have to accept  our constitutional responsibility; that it is ours, not the Presidents  of the United States.   This resolution provides that opportunity. It finally says that in  this one war in Yemen--this terrible, horrific war--that Congress is  prepared to act, and I hope very much that all of us will seize this  opportunity.   For the sake of starving children in Yemen; for the sake of what this  country stands for in terms of democracy and human rights and not  following the leadership of a despotic, authoritarian regime; for the  sake of the U.S. Constitution and the fact that it is Congress and not  the President who has the authority to make war; for all of these  reasons and more, I ask strong support for this important resolution.   With that, I yield the floor.
