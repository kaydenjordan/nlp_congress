 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Illinois for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the Department of Energy's Cheney Disposal Cell in Mesa  County, Colorado, is a critical component of the DOE legacy management  mission to protect public health and the environment.   The cell receives radioactive waste materials that were produced  decades ago during the uranium milling process. The waste materials  continue to be uncovered during road construction, bridge replacement,  home foundation excavation, and other construction activities in  several towns in western Colorado. Once the waste materials are  discovered, they must be properly disposed of at the Cheney Disposal  Cell.   The authorization for the Cheney Disposal Cell expires at the end of  2023, or when the site is filled to capacity. Currently, the remaining  capacity in the cell is approximately 234,000 cubic yards, therefore,  an extended authorization is required. H.R. 347 would extend the  authorization until 2031.   As my colleague from Illinois noted, we passed this legislation in  the last Congress, but this bill is now coming up at a critically  important time. According to the Department of Energy, if the disposal  cell is not reauthorized this year, DOE will have to take steps to  begin to decommission the site. This means no more materials will be  accepted in 2019 and we will lose a critical component of the DOE's  legacy management program.    I thank my colleague from Colorado, Ms. Diana DeGette, for her  support on this bill, and for her leadership on the Energy and Commerce  Committee for recognizing the need to bring this bill up now.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 347.
