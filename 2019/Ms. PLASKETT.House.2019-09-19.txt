 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lowey, and I thank the  leadership for bringing this CR and health extenders legislation to the  floor.   The bill contains critical Medicaid relief for my district, the  Virgin Islands. It extends the disaster-related 100 percent Federal  funding to sustain Medicaid on our islands through November 21.   While the territories are part of America, and we are American  citizens, Federal law unfairly places Medicaid funding caps on the  islands--unlike the States, where funding is open-ended--and it  requires them to pay a much greater percentage of Medicaid than the  States.   Supplemental funding has only been provided on a temporary basis.  Without the fix in this bill, the rate of Federal funding would plummet  nearly 50 percentage points to the permanent, capped level of 55  percent.   Cuts to that funding put basic healthcare at risk for many Americans  living on our islands.   The fundamental problem is that the U.S. territories are forced to  operate Medicaid under capped funding. A more equitable matching rate  is needed on a permanent basis.   I know that the Energy and Commerce Committee has done so in its  legislation. We are hopeful that when we work on a final budget, that  will take place.   I have sponsored legislation, H.R. 1354, to remove these caps  permanently. I thank everyone for advancing this cause and this CR.
