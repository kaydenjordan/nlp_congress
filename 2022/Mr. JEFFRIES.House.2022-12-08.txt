 Madam Speaker, I thank the chair for yielding and for  his leadership.   The founding document of this country, the Declaration of  Independence, reads:         We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are       created equally, entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit       of happiness.    Those words were eloquent in their articulation and complete in their  application.   As the great Barbara Jordan once pointed out, initially they didn't  apply to enslaved Africans or women, Native Americans, poor people of  every race, and certainly it didn't apply to the LGBTQ+ community. But  through a process of constitutional amendment ratification, court  decision, and legislation, those words have increasingly been brought  to life as we journey toward a more perfect union.   That is the work that is being done today with the Respect for  Marriage Act, particularly because of a radical, right-wing, reckless,  and regressive Supreme Court majority that threatens freedom and  marriage equality.   Madam Speaker, that is why I urge my colleagues to support the  Respect for Marriage Act.    Madam Speaker, I support the Respect for Marriage Act,  I respect freedom, liberty, and justice for all.
