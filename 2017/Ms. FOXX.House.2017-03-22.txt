Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1101.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from North Carolina?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 1101, the Small Business Health  Fairness Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, this week marks 7 years since ObamaCare was signed into  law. We all remember the promises former President Obama and Washington  Democrats made at the time.   Families were promised that their healthcare costs would go down.  They were promised more choices and more competition. Small businesses  and their employees were promised greater access to affordable health  care.   But for 7 years, we have watched as all of those promises were  broken. For 7 years, we have heard from families and small businesses  across the country that have seen their healthcare costs skyrocket and  their choices diminish.   Members of the House Education and the Workforce Committee recently  heard from Scott Bollenbacher, an Indiana small-business owner with 11  full-time employees. The company has been forced to switch healthcare  plans twice now under ObamaCare, and their only viable option this year  was a plan with a 78 percent premium increase.   Mr. Bollenbacher is one of countless small-business owners struggling  to make ends meet under a failed government takeover of health care.  Because of ObamaCare, 300,000 small-business jobs have been destroyed,  including nearly 8,000 in my home State of North Carolina.                                time  1400    Additionally, an estimated 10,000 small businesses nationwide have  closed their doors, and small business employees have lost $19 billion  each year in wages.   It should come as no surprise that, since 2008, the share of small  businesses with fewer than 10 employees offering health coverage has  dropped 36 percent. It is not that they don't want to; it is that  onerous mandates and regulations have made it simply unaffordable to do  so.   Fortunately, relief is on the way. This week we are not only moving  to repeal ObamaCare, we are also advancing positive reforms that  promote affordable coverage for working families, including the Small  Business Health Fairness Act.   As its title implies, this important legislation is about fairness  for small businesses and their employees. Today, small businesses are  on an unfair playing field with larger companies and unions when it  comes to health care. Large businesses have the ability to negotiate  for more affordable healthcare costs for their employees, but small  businesses do not have the same advantage. Because of their size, small  businesses have limited bargaining power, which means their employees  can end up paying more for health insurance.   With millions of Americans employed by a small business, it is long  past time to level the playing field. That is exactly what this  commonsense legislation is about. This bill would empower small  businesses to band together through association health plans, or AHPs,  to purchase high-quality health care at a lower cost for workers.   This bill represents a first step toward a more competitive health  insurance market that crosses State lines. Under H.R. 1101, small  businesses in different States could join together through a group  health plan. These plans would have strong protections and solvency  requirements to ensure workers can count on healthcare coverage when  they and their families need it.   What does all of this mean: more choices, more freedom, and more  affordable health care for working families and small-business owners  like Scott Bollenbacher. This is a better way, one that stands in stark  contrast to ObamaCare's failed approach. Instead of more mandates, this  bill empowers individuals to access the high-quality, affordable  healthcare plan that meets their needs.   I want to thank my colleague Representative Sam Johnson for  championing, for years, the positive reforms in this bill.   I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1101 so we can level the  playing field for small businesses and expand affordable health  coverage for working families.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Sam Johnson), the author of the bill.   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   I would like to start off by thanking Chairwoman Foxx and Chairman  Walberg for their strong support of my bill, the Small Business Health  Fairness Act.   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today is on an issue that has  long been near and dear to my heart: association health plans.  Association health plans would allow small businesses to join together  and provide healthcare coverage just like large corporations and unions  do today.   Association health plans are also a central part of replacing  ObamaCare with commonsense solutions.   You know, ObamaCare has been an absolute disaster. My constituents in  Collin County, Texas, have shared with me their negative experiences  with it since it became law nearly 7 years ago.   One of the groups hardest hit by ObamaCare is small businesses, the  backbone of our economy. Since 2008, over one-third of businesses with  fewer than 10 employees offering health insurance have dropped  insurance; and, you know, that is just wrong.   Because ObamaCare is failing, we need to repeal it and replace it  with better solutions for the American people. One of these solutions  is my association health plan bill.   What my bill does is simply allow small businesses to join together  through trade or professional organizations. As we all know, the basic  rule of insurance is the bigger the risk pool, the lower the cost.   Furthermore, my bill allows small businesses to join together across  State lines. My bill would also free small businesses from costly and  burdensome State and Federal requirements. This isn't anything  different from what large employers and unions already do. My bill is  simply about leveling the playing field for small businesses and their  hardworking employees.   This bill also has wide support from the business community,  including the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National  Federation of Independent Business, the National Retail Federation, and  the International Franchise Association.   Not everyone knows this, but I was a small-business owner myself  between my time in the Air Force and coming to Congress. In fact, I  established a home building business in north Texas from scratch, so I  can understand where small businesses are coming from.   For example, Bob Gibbons and his wife own a commercial real estate  business in my hometown of Plano, Texas. They have had a tough time  obtaining good, affordable health insurance, a problem that has gotten  worse since ObamaCare.   Bob sums up this entire issue pretty well in two sentences: ``Why  should someone's status as an employee give them preferential right to  decent group health coverage? Entrepreneurs are penalized when they  start a small business because they can't get comparable coverage.''                                time  1415    Bob's experience underscores the entire point behind the Small  Business Health Fairness Act.   Mr. Speaker, I include Bob's letter in the Record, along with letters  from the cities of Frisco, Richardson, and Anna in my district.                                  REATA Commercial Realty, Inc.,                                           Plano, TX, March 2, 2017.      Re Association Health Plans.       Hon. Sam Johnson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Johnson: I would like to register my       support of your recently introduced bill, H.R. 1101, which       would provide for association health plans. I am a small       business owner in your district in Plano, Texas. My wife and       I have been on a roller coaster of health coverage over the       years. We were covered by employer plans when I was an       employee (pre-ACA). Then we had to negotiate for an       individual plan when I started my own business (pre-ACA).       Then we were again covered by an employer plan when my wife       went to work (post-ACA). And now that she works with me, we       must navigate the purchase of an individual plan again, but       in the post-ACA failure environment.        I have always thought it was ridiculous that the only       decent health coverage was available to employees of       companies that provided it. Why should someone's status as an       employee give them a preferential right to decent group       health coverage? Entrepreneurs are penalized when they start       a small business because they can't get comparable coverage.        I was thrilled when I ran into Gabi Pate at a Plano Chamber       of Commerce Public Policy Committee meeting yesterday and       heard you were trying to help. Association health plans would       be a step in the right direction. At least then I could get       in on a group plan through trade associations, a chamber of       commerce or another qualified group. I truly hope that the       bill will allow for portability of that health coverage,       however, so I can leave the association if I choose and still       have coverage.        Thank you for your leadership in this area. Please don't       hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.            Sincerely,                                                       Bob Gibbons.  [[Page H2321]]                                          ____                                    Frisco Chamber of Commerce,                                         Frisco, TX, March 22, 2017.        On behalf of the Frisco Chamber of Commerce in Frisco,       Texas, I write in strong support of the Small Business Health       Fairness Act. The Frisco Chamber of Commerce provides       advocacy support for over 1,300 businesses of all sizes. We       consistently hear from our small business members about the       hardship in providing appropriate and adequate healthcare for       their employees at an affordable price. This legislation will       increase small businesses' bargaining power with health       insurance providers and ensure a level playing field for       smaller entities that want to help their workers and families       with healthcare costs.        Locally owned small businesses are a huge contributor in       the fabric of a business community. It is through the small       and medium businesses that we see the greatest job growth. It       is through the small and medium businesses that we see the       greatest increase in retail spending in the local       communities. However, while many see the benefit of a strong       small business community, they have been neglected in being       able to negotiate for competitive pricing in healthcare       costs.        For these reasons, the Frisco Chamber of Commerce strongly       supports the Small Business Health Fairness Act, which will       allow small businesses the opportunity to band together to       provide their employees with better, more affordable health       insurance coverage. With rising medical costs being a top       concern of both individuals and employers, the impact of this       increased availability of affordable insurance would be       significant.            Sincerely,                                                       Tony Felker,      President/CEO.                                   ____                                                  Richardson, Texas,                                             Chamber of Commerce,                                     Richardson, TX, March 21, 2017.      Re Association Health Plans.       Hon. Sam Johnson,      House of Representatives,      Washington DC.        Dear Chairman Johnson: On behalf of the Richardson Chamber       of Commerce, a 5-star chamber, I write in strong support of       the Small Business Health Fairness Act. This legislation will       increase small businesses' bargaining power with health       insurance providers and ensure a level playing field for       smaller entities that want to help their workers and families       with health care costs. The Richardson Chamber of Commerce       commends you for your longstanding leadership on this       important issue to the small business community. With more       than 650 member organizations, the Richardson Chamber of       Commerce continues the goal of its founding fathers to serve       as the cornerstone of economic and community development for       the city of Richardson. In order to continue that growth, our       small businesses must be allowed to offer affordable       healthcare to their employees.        While the small business community's economic output is       great, its negotiating power in the health care market is at       a competitive disadvantage. The federal Employee Retirement       Income Security Act, which currently permits large       corporations and labor organizations to ``self-insure'' and       offer insurance with certain exemptions from state law, does       not provide small business with the same advantage. The law       must be reformed to empower small employers with the ability       to obtain and offer competitively priced health insurance.        For these reasons, the Richardson Chamber of Commerce and       our member companies, strongly support the Small Business       Health Fairness Act, which will allow small businesses the       opportunity to band together to provide their employees with       better, more affordable health insurance coverage. With       rising medical costs being a top concern of both individuals       and employers, the impact of this increased availability of       affordable insurance would be significant.        The Richardson Chamber commends your efforts to provide       small businesses with health care options in a thoughtful and       constructive manner. We look forward to working with you on       this key legislation.            Sincerely,                                                William C. Sproull,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                                        Greater Anna                                             Chamber of Commerce,                                           Anna, TX, March 21, 2017.      Hon. Sam Johnson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Johnson: On behalf of the Greater Anna       Chamber of Commerce and our more than 200 members, including       a majority of small business, I would like to show our       support of the H.R. 101, the Small Business Health Fairness       Act. There are many small businesses in our community that       cannot currently economically and efficiently afford       healthcare for their employees. We hope this legislation will       help ease that affordability on both our businesses and       employees.        With better access to healthcare, employees could be more       willing to work at these smaller businesses instead of only       working for larger corporations. This will help our local       community by keeping our employees closer to their home,       families and children's schools. Again, we support for Small       Business Health Fairness Act and look forward to a better       solution to our current healthcare problem.            Best Regards,                                                     Kevin Hall,                                                 Executive Director,                                  Greater Anna Chamber of Commerce.    Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, by allowing small businesses  to band together, they can collectively purchase more affordable health  insurance for their employees.   Let's get this commonsense plan passed. Let's help those who power  our economy be able to get the health care they want, need, and deserve  for themselves and their workers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1101.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health,  Employment, Labor, and Pensions.  [[Page H2322]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe), a distinguished colleague, a member of the  committee, and the chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the distinguished chairman of the Small  Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), a member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Lewis), a member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  have spent a lot of their time extolling ObamaCare and indicating that  we should just stay with what we have, but we all know that ObamaCare  is failing.   Republicans are on a rescue mission. We truly do have a better way.  As some of my colleagues have stated, we will be passing the American  Health Care Act tomorrow. What we are doing here with this bill is  something we could not include in that legislation that will round out  what it is we want to do with keeping our promise in what we promised  last year in our program called A Better Way.   Let me just talk a little bit about the failures of ObamaCare. As my  colleagues have said, all the promises were broken: if you wanted to  keep your doctor, you could keep your doctor; if you wanted to keep  your healthcare plan, you could keep your healthcare plan. Those  promises were the most obvious ones that went away. The cost of health  care would be going down, and none of that happened.   Mr. Speaker, in addition to that, there is a 25 percent average  increase in premiums this year for millions of Americans trapped in  ObamaCare, healthcare.gov exchanges. Nearly one-third of U.S. counties  have only one insurer offering exchange plans; 4.7 million Americans  were kicked off their healthcare plans by ObamaCare. There was $1  trillion in new taxes, mostly falling on families and job creators; 18  failed ObamaCare co-ops out of 23, which my colleague from Tennessee so  eloquently pointed out.   These were established as an alternative to the public option. Those  healthcare co-ops collapsed, costing  [[Page H2327]]  taxpayers nearly 1.9 billion and forcing patients to find new  insurance; $53 billion in new regulations requiring more than  176,800,000 hours of paperwork. ObamaCare regulations are driving up  healthcare premiums and costing small-business employees at least $19  billion annually.   As I said in the hearing that we had on this bill, the Democrats want  a coercive system. Republicans want a system based on freedom.   Today we have an opportunity to make a real difference in the lives  of hardworking men and women who are employed by small business. We  have an opportunity to deliver much-needed relief to small-business  owners who are trying to do the right thing and provide high-quality  healthcare coverage for their employees. This legislation represents a  truly positive reform that will help lower healthcare costs for working  families and put small businesses on a fair and level playing field.   Small businesses are the backbone of our Nation's economy, and there  is no reason why they should be at a disadvantage when it comes to  finding an affordable healthcare plan. They should be treated in the  same fashion as larger businesses and have the ability to craft  healthcare plans that meet the needs of their employees. If we want to  encourage small businesses to offer health care at a lower cost to  workers, this is one commonsense step we can make.   Again, I thank our colleague, Congressman Sam Johnson, a true patriot  and servant of this country, for his longtime support of this  legislation.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1101, the Small Business  Health Fairness Act, which will help more Americans access high- quality, affordable health care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Herrera Beutler    Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Add at the end of section 6 the following:        (c) Coordination With Existing Law.--Nothing in this Act       shall require plans to become certified under section 802 of       the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as       amended by this Act, or require plans that are not certified       under such section to comply with the requirements under part       8 of such Act, except to the extent provided in section 809       of such Act.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 210, the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler) and a Member opposed  each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington.   Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Foxx and the  Committee on Education and the Workforce for their work on this  important bill that will benefit small businesses and the families who  work for them.   My amendment to the Small Business Health Fairness Act provides a  straightforward clarification to ensure that existing association  health plans can continue to operate and provide high-quality,  affordable care to as many people as possible.   This amendment safeguards association health plans that have been  successfully operating under State and Federal law--many of them for  decades. We will be making certain that they would not inadvertently be  disadvantaged by new Federal legislation or regulation or vulnerable to  efforts to restrict access and limit choices.   Why do we need this amendment?   Because I fear what happened in my State will happen in others, where  the insurance commissioner attempted to reject 42 out of about 60  association health plans. His office interpreted ObamaCare as giving  him a mandate as justification for attempting to eliminate virtually  all of these popular plans. By adopting my amendment, it will make  crystal clear in the underlying bill that this won't be tolerated, and  it will support both existing and future association health plans.   Talk to one of the nearly 400,000 individuals in my home State of  Washington who get their care from an association plan, and you will  find out why so many Washington businesses renew their plans every  year.   Our State has been fortunate to have a robust AHP market that has  become essential to providing cost-effective choices to small-business  employers, thanks to bipartisan legislation enacted in the mid-1990s.  In the case of one association plan operating in my State, roughly 40  percent of participating small-business employers did not previously  offer health coverage.   My amendment is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In its  letter to me, which I include in the Record, the U.S. Chamber indicated  that it shares my interest in making sure that State-based association  health plans that currently exist are able to continue operating in  accordance with existing State and Federal law. My amendment is also  supported by the Association of Washington Business.                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                     Washington, DC, March 20, 2017.      Hon. Jaime Herrera Beutler,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Herrera Beutler: Thank you for your       attention to the concerns raised by the Association of       Washington Businesses regarding H.R. 1101, the ``Small       Business Health Fairness Act.'' The U.S. Chamber of Commerce       has several state chambers of commerce members that provide       state-based quality health care coverage to their member       companies. The Chamber shares your interest in making sure       that the state-based Association Health Plans that currently       exist are able to continue to operate in accordance with       existing state and federal law without being disadvantaged by       this new federal legislation.        The Chamber appreciates your commitment to small businesses       and to ensuring that current affordable coverage options       continue to be available alongside new options in a       nondiscriminatory and fair environment. Thank you for your       dedication and efforts, and we look forward to continuing to       work with you to advance the priorities and interest of       business.            Sincerely,                                                 Randel K. Johnson.    Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I am confident that the underlying  legislation before us today will improve the ability of small  businesses to access affordable, high-quality health coverage in every  State across the country. However, first, this body should, as clearly  as possible, ensure that those States that already have successfully  operating association health plans are not disrupted, which is what my  amendment would do.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I thank the  chairwoman for her work on this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from North Carolina is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, this motion is nothing more than a last-ditch  attempt to defeat a commonsense bill that will help expand access to  affordable healthcare coverage for working families. In fact, this  motion represents the same failed approach to health care we have  experienced in recent years.   We have seen what happens when the Federal Government dictates the  kind of health insurance individuals can and cannot buy. Healthcare  costs skyrocket and patients have fewer choices.   While our Democrat colleagues offer a motion that doubles down on a  failed approach to health care, my Republican colleagues and I are  offering the American people a better way.   The Small Business Health Fairness Act is about empowering  individuals, families, and small-business owners so more Americans have  access to affordable healthcare coverage. By rejecting this motion and  supporting the underlying bill, we can take an important step in  keeping our promise to deliver free-market, patient-centered healthcare  solutions.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit and  ``yes'' on the Small Business Health Fairness Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by  5-minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered; and the motion to  suspend the rules and pass H.R. 1238.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 179,  nays 233, not voting 17, as follows:                               [Roll No. 185]                                 YEAS--179       Adams      Aguilar      Barragan      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Boyle, Brendan F.
