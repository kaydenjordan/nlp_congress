 Mr. Speaker, today, our country has a choice: Our  Constitution or chaos?   Our democracy was attacked on January 6. We survived this once, but  we will not survive another attack. This commission ensures that we are  better prepared if one is to come to this House again.   We don't just owe this to our democracy, we owe it to the men and  women in uniform, who fought in hand-to-hand combat for hours to  protect our lives. These are the cops that we see every day. These are  the cops who take care of us. Three of them lost their life. One of  them lost a number of fingers, and one of them had his eye gouged out.  Don't walk away from these cops.  [[Page H2581]]    We can't agree on much as a country anymore. We choose the news that  agrees with us. But this commission cannot be spun. The testimony is  the testimony. It is unimpeachable. It is going to be factual. And we  owe those facts, the ground truth, not only to our democracy, but to  the police officers who so bravely served us that day.
