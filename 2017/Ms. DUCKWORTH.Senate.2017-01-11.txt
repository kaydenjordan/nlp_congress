 Madam Clerk, how am I recorded?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is not recorded.    On behalf of the 1.2 million Illinoisans--   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate is not allowed during a vote.   The Senate will be in order.   --who will lose health insurance with this repeal of  the ACA and for all those with preexisting conditions, I stand on  prosthetic legs to vote no.
