 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2, the  Secure the Border Act.   This legislation is the culmination of months of hard work and  collaboration of three House committees: Homeland Security, on which I  serve as a member; Judiciary; and Foreign Affairs. It represents what  is possible when we work together for the good of our Nation.   In my very first floor speech as a Member of Congress, I echoed the  concerns and fears I have heard from the constituents that I represent  and what I have seen firsthand at the southern border.   Americans are not safe, and our country is under attack at the  southern border. Illegal immigrants, drug runners, and human smugglers  continue to exploit this administration's open southern border policy  as this administration looks the other way.   This last weekend, in just 72 hours, Border Patrol apprehended over  26,000 migrants, had approximately 7,500 got-aways, and seized 11  pounds of fentanyl, enough to kill 2.5 million Americans. If this is  what operational control looks like to this administration, it is no  wonder why Americans are worried.   Title 42 is set to expire tomorrow, bringing not a surge but an  invasion of illegal immigrants that our communities, hospitals,  schools, and law enforcement officials simply can't handle. This  debacle created by this administration has not seen its worst day.   Just this morning, the administration released a statement outlining  how they plan to deal with this incoming invasion. The Department of  Homeland Security press release says they have finalized a rule to  incentivize the use of lawful immigration pathways. They are choosing  to incentivize illegal immigrants to follow our laws when we should be  punishing those who don't follow our laws. The fact is, President  Trump's border policies worked for America.   Now more than ever, we must pass this legislation and move toward a  lawful, safe, secure, and orderly border. We don't have time to waste.   Among many important provisions, this legislation would grant DHS  authority to suspend entry and gain operational control of the border,  similar to title 42. I am pleased to stand here today with my  colleagues in support of this legislation that begins to address the  massive failure of this administration.   H.R. 2 reflects Republicans' commitment to make America safer. I urge  my colleagues to support this bill. It is up to us to stop this  invasion of America at the southern border because no one else will.                                time  1945
