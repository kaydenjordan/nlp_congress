 Madam President, I rise today to join in the  reintroduction  [[Page S315]]  of the Reproductive Freedom for All Act, a bipartisan bill that would  restore the previous legal framework that governed abortion access in  this country for nearly 50 years since Roe v. Wade. This bill would  ensure the right of women to make certain reproductive choices without  undue government interference, including the right to obtain and use  contraception.   I support a woman's right to have an abortion, and I believe that the  threshold question of whether abortion is legal needs to be consistent  at the national level. States can account for regional differences with  regulations like parental notification requirements, but the basic  right as articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court prior to its decision in  Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization needs to be the same  regardless of the State in which a woman happens to reside.   In Dobbs, the Supreme Court abandoned a nearly 50-year precedent that  had been reaffirmed and on which women had relied for decades. The  Dobbs ruling was, as the Chief Justice described it, a ``jolt'' to our  legal system. This action has further divided the country at a moment  when, more than ever in modem times, we need the Court to demonstrate  consistency, predictability, and restraint.   Prior to the Court's decision in Dobbs, I introduced, with Senator  Murkowski, the Reproductive Choice Act to enact into Federal law the  abortion rights established by Roe and affirmed by Planned Parenthood  v. Casey.   In the wake of the Dobbs decision, I worked with my colleagues  Senator Kaine, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Sinema to draft a more  comprehensive, bipartisan bill that would codify the abortion rights  articulated by the Supreme Court in Roe, Casey, and Whole Women's  Health v. Hellerstedt, as well as the contraception rights first  articulated in Griswold v. Connecticut and later clarified in  Eisenstadt v. Baird and Carey v. Population Services International.   Our legislation would enshrine important abortion and contraception  rights into Federal law without undercutting basic conscience  protections that have been in place for decades and that are relied  upon by healhtcare practitioners who have religious objections.   Our goal with this legislation is to do what the Court should have  done--provide consistency in our laws that Americans have relied upon  for nearly half a century regarding the ability to make certain  reproductive choices.   This bill would ensure that the legal framework in place before Dobbs  is reinstated as the law of the land. Our bill accomplishes this goal  by tracking the Supreme Court's language in the seminal cases I  mentioned.   Specifically, and consistent with decades of Supreme Court  jurisprudence, the Reproductive Freedom for All Act provides that a  State may not impose an undue burden on the ability of a woman to  choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability.  During this time, States may enact reasonable regulations to further  the health or safety of a woman seeking to terminate a pregnancy,  unless such regulations impose an undue burden.   After fetal viability, a State may regulate or even proscribe the  ability of a woman to terminate her pregnancy but not when such a  termination is necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman.   Moreover, by codifying Griswold, Eisenstadt, and Carey, the bill  makes clear that a State cannot prohibit an individual from obtaining  or using contraceptives.   Finally, the legislation specifically preserves conscience  protections that have been relied upon by healthcare providers who have  religious objections.   The best path forward for our country is to reinstate the legal  framework that was in place before the Supreme Court issued its ruling  in Dobbs. Our bill would enshrine into law the important protections  articulated in the Supreme Court cases that I mentioned without  undercutting statutes that also have been in place for decades.   I urge all of my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Barrasso, Mrs.          Blackburn, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Daines, Mr.          Johnson, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Scott of South Carolina, Mr. Tillis,          and Mr. Young):   S. 338. A bill to provide accountability for funding provided to the  Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Treasury under Public  Law 117-69; to the Committee on Finance.
