 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is an unusual sight of a Senator in the  Capitol between Christmas and New Year's. This is the one time we  really try to reserve for our personal and family responsibilities. Our  families, like others, look forward to the Christmas season. It is the  one time of the year we desperately try to find ways to come together.   Of course, COVID-19 intervened and made that more challenging. But,  even so, the notion of coming back to Washington this week and staying,  perhaps, more than a day to try to finish our work is unusual, and the  circumstances surrounding it are extraordinary, as well, not the least  of which is the fact that we have two bills that have to be thought of  in the context of our responsibilities.   First and foremost is the National Defense Authorization Act. This  month, both the House and the Senate passed, with overwhelming  bipartisan majorities, the fiscal year 2021 National Defense  Authorization Act.   Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, a Republican, was on the floor before me.  He and Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island put in more time than most  Members can appreciate to make sure that this bill really served our  military and the goal of national security. They came up with a good  bill, one I was proud to support it.   This annual legislation has been signed into law for six consecutive  decades. When the Senate fails to do anything, they always do the  National Defense Authorization Act. It shows Congress can come  together, at least on this measure, when it comes to supporting our men  and women in uniform and keeping our country safe.   This year, the bill authorized $740.5 billion in defense spending. It  provides another 3 percent, well-deserved, pay raise for our troops. It  also recognizes that many in the Armed Forces are on the frontlines  here at home, as well, helping fight the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic,  providing our troops with necessary benefits and protections, including  a 10-percent increase in hazardous duty pay.   The bill also includes a number of provisions that I authored and  supported, including language expressing strong support for the Baltic  States and Ukraine, especially in the face of continued, unforgivable  Russia aggression. It requires the renaming of military bases in the  United States which were once named in honor of Confederate generals,  those who served in the Confederacy in an attempt to secede from the  Union and to defend the institution of slavery and have been enshrined  in the names of these bases for many, many years. This effort to rename  them is long, long overdue. It tries to correct and recognize the  mistakes of our past and really address the sensitive racial inequities  at the Pentagon when it comes to this decision-making.    It places restrictions on the transfer of military equipment to law  enforcement agencies. We have to address the issue of the  militarization of our police at a time when we are, frankly, making an  assessment of the role of police to make certain that the overwhelming  majority of law enforcement officers--those who are good, principled,  civic-minded individuals--is honored and that those who fail to meet  the test are removed from service.   It expands benefits to our veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange  during the Vietnam war. There are 191,000 Vietnam-era veterans in my  State of Illinois. Many of them were exposed to toxins, such as Agent  Orange, during their service and now are paying the price.   It makes it easier for victims of military sexual trauma to report  instances of such crime and expand support for survivors. The most  recent, horrible incident at Fort Hood was a reminder of what we need  to do to bring the military into the 21st century when it comes to  respecting the rights of all people, men and women.   It strengthens safeguards against foreign cyberattacks. We know how  important that is since the recent revelation confirmed by Secretary of  State Pompeo that Russia is at work again in its attempting to  compromise our Federal agencies, their data, their information, and the  security secrets that they keep for our protection.   It authorizes funding for PFAS-related research. If you have never  heard of the phrase ``PFAS'' before, I can tell you that you are bound  to hear it in the future. This was used as a flame retardant and in  some other capacities on many Air Force bases and military bases around  the United States. We are finding that it is still there and is still  dangerous. We need to put money into remediation to help these military  installations, including the Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, IL,  where PFAS was detected earlier this year.   Still, despite all of the good things in this bill and the  bipartisanship that supported it, President Trump decided to veto the  bill--one of his rare vetoes. He prefers we continue to honor the  Confederate leaders who committed treasonous atrocities in order to  preserve slavery. I don't think that this is reflective of the United  States of today or its values, but that is his position.   When he was called out for this racist inclination, he changed the  reason for his veto. He claimed the bill didn't do enough to fight  China or that we should include a measure to address liability issues  for tech companies--  [[Page S7965]]  never mind that tech company liability matters have nothing to do with  the National Defense Authorization Act. He just doesn't like that there  was criticism coming down for some of the misstatements and lies and  disinformation he has been spreading on social media.   The President also fails to recognize that this Defense authorization  bill, in fact, does get tough on China. It creates a new Pacific  Deterrence Initiative that puts America back in the seat of leadership  in that region, where we need to be. The Trump administration could  have started this initiative on its own, but it did not, so Congress  stepped up and created this security partnership because the White  House was asleep at the wheel. At the end of the day, I suppose we  can't expect anything more from a President who has denigrated our  troops by calling them suckers and losers.   I voted to support the fiscal year 2021 NDAA. I will support it again  to override this President's unforgivable and reckless veto. I am glad  the House did so on Monday. I hope we in the Senate do the same. Coming  back to Washington was not something I looked forward to this week. I  wanted to stay home. Yet I knew, when it came to funding our troops, I  had to be here. Many of my colleagues feel the same. I hope, tomorrow,  we can take that up quickly.                            ____________________     Mr. President, there was then the drama around the COVID- 19 relief bill.   It was hard to describe what we went through in the last week to 10  days with messages from the White House. I wish that the President and  those around him, advising him, would have called to mind the 335,000  Americans who have lost their lives due to this deadly pandemic and the  many more who have lost a family member, friend, or loved one. In  Illinois, we have lost 16,000 lives to COVID-19--tragic, historic. I  extend my deepest condolences to the friends and families of those who  have died or who are fighting this virus. Many are my friends.   More than 121,000 Americans spent last night in the hospital--a grim  new record of hospitalizations as our heroic nurses and doctors face  unrelenting stress from this crisis. I just think, as I reflect on the  interviews of these men and women who are on the frontline of  healthcare, how stoic they usually are, how controlled they usually  are, and how they are losing it now. With the overwhelming numbers they  are facing and the terrible prospect of someone's dying with a member  of the family being unable to even enter the room in the last minutes  of one's life has got to be heartbreaking on a scale that none of us  can imagine. Think about doing that every single day. They have done  it. I will tell you we will never be able to repay them with our  gratitude. They are true American heroes.   Many of us returned to Washington this week. As I said, we are  celebrating the holidays in a fashion like never before with social  distancing, Zooms, FaceTime, and calls with family and loved ones. It  is no substitute for the kids being there to open their gifts on  Christmas morning, but it is the reality of what we face today.   There is some hope on the horizon, and though I have been many times  critical of the Trump administration, I do want to give the President  credit for the Warp Speed Program. It is amazing, as I read the  stories, of what they were able to achieve in discovering two vaccines  that can treat Americans and people around the world and keep them safe  as they face this coronavirus. It broke all the records in the  discovery of these vaccines. As I read about it, I continue to be  grateful and want to make sure America recognizes the doctors, the  scientists, and the researchers.   Barney Graham--I didn't know his name until yesterday--came out of a  story published in the New Yorker. He works at the National Institutes  of Health. He is given a great deal of credit for the breakthrough in  the first two vaccines that have been approved. There are others just  like him. I salute Dr. Francis Collins, of the National Institutes of  Health, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, both of whom have become my friends over  the years--and what a job they have done for America. So many more  deserve recognition, and I hope there will be an opportunity to give it  to them.   The fact is, these doses of vaccines are starting to move across the  country. Last week, Illinois--I am proud to say--led the Nation. I  congratulated our Governor, J.B. Pritzker, yesterday. More than 100,000  healthcare workers received their first shots last week. I asked him  why we led, and he said: I don't know. We just put together our own  program of distribution, and it worked. Thank goodness it did. Lives  will be saved because of it, but there is so much more to do.   Progress in administering the vaccine has been slow as we still  struggle to reach the hardest hit areas. The rosy projections from the  administration have not come to fruition yet, but the fact is, we have  two viable vaccines. That is miraculous. I look forward to the new  administration's--the Biden administration's--new management in this  effort, and I am glad Congress came together to pass a relief bill that  included $30 billion for vaccine development and distribution.   When the President said he wasn't going to sign this bill, I thought:  How can he say that? He should be taking credit, rightfully, for the  Warp Speed Program and his role in seeing that program move forward  instead of complicating the distribution of the vaccines by threatening  to veto the bill. Fortunately, for us, in the end, he signed the bill.    On Sunday evening, the President signed the bipartisan annual  spending bill and the COVID-19 relief bill. There were complaints about  the size of the bill. Well, the entire Federal budget was included in  that bill, as well as the COVID-19 relief undertaking, as well as many  other bills, such as the Water Resources Development Act. All of these  are major pieces of legislation, and they were combined in one bill  that went way beyond 5,000 pages.   Unfortunately, the President delayed in signing the bill and created  needless uncertainty in America, particularly among the unemployed and  others who are suffering from this public health and economic crisis.  This agreement provides much needed support for many of them, but they  will have some delay in receiving their checks because of the  President's period of indecision. Enhanced unemployment benefits of  $300 a week and an extension of the unemployment program, created under  the CARES Act, through March 14 will bring more relief to many millions  of families.   Possibly the largest single item in the COVID relief bill--$325  billion--went to provide our Nation's ailing small businesses another  chance at survival. The Paycheck Protection Program worked in the  initial CARES Act, and it was renewed in this undertaking.   An extension of the Federal eviction moratorium through January 2021,  coupled with $25 billion in emergency rental assistance, will literally  mean that people will not be evicted right after Christmas.  Approximately, $850 million is going to Illinois to help keep families  in their homes during this pandemic.   The 15-percent increase in nutrition assistance is certainly needed.  It goes through the SNAP program, which was historically known as food  stamps, to make sure that families have something on the table. I can  tell you that I woke up this morning in Springfield, IL, to look at the  front page of the newspaper and learn that an anonymous donor had given  our local food bank $500,000. The people at the food bank were, of  course, appreciative and said they desperately needed it in my hometown  and towns all across America. This increase in food stamp assistance is  long overdue, and I am glad it was included.   The bill includes a number of important measures, but we have to go  to work to make sure that we deal with the sharp turn of an emergency  response to this bill and do more. We address the needs required to  respond to this pandemic immediately, but more will follow. It was a  tough negotiation and an honest compromise, and I was happy to be part  of a bipartisan group of Senators who may have gotten the ball  rolling--at least we think we did--in order to hand it over to the  leaders to finish the job. I think what we have achieved, on a  bipartisan basis, was largely included in the final bill, and it  addressed the major elements that were necessary.  [[Page S7966]]    One of the most important items that Congress failed to reach  agreement on was funding for State and local governments. States and  localities are struggling with increased costs and decreased revenues  due to the pandemic. By this summer, my home State of Illinois will  have lost more than $5 billion in revenues. I can tell you that this is  going to cause pain and cutbacks. This is not money that was lost in  our pension system, which has its own share of troubles; it is money  that was directly attributable to the downturn in revenues because of  the COVID-19 pandemic. It isn't just happening in Illinois; it is  happening all around the country--in red and blue States. Our  neighboring State of Kentucky, to the south of us, is facing the same  hardships we are.   Federal funding for States and localities needs to be done for our  great cities and great States that are struggling, and I certainly hope  that the next President, when he is sworn in on January 20, will take  this up as one of his highest priorities. Our Nation's economic  recovery is slowed down by budget cuts that will be necessary in States  and localities because of this cutback in revenues.   Now, the most widely discussed measure of the COVID-19 relief bill is  a second round of economic impact payments. Just yesterday, the House  of Representatives passed the CASH Act, which is a measure that would  increase the direct payments to individuals--adults and children--from  $600 to $2,000 for those who earn less than $75,000 a year. The measure  passed in the House by a vote of 275 to 174. Over the past several  months, we have heard time and again from economists that we run the  risk of doing too little, which far outweighs the risk of doing too  much when it comes to this economic recovery.   The head of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Powell, has really  instructed us to keep the foot on the accelerator so that our economy  doesn't slump into a recession. At a time when so many American  families are laid off, unemployed, and simply struggling to get by,  there is nothing more invigorating to the economy than to have a cash  infusion. Those with limited resources who are battling to pay bills  turn around and spend that money quickly. They don't salt it away for  some future rainy day. They need it now. That is why we should  seriously consider this.   By passing this enhanced measure, we can restore the American  public's confidence in Washington and by the fact that we are listening  and working together, on a bipartisan basis, to respond. This measure  that passed the House of Representatives has the support of the  President, Speaker Pelosi, House Democrats, as well as many House  Republicans. Leader Schumer and my Senate Democratic colleagues support  it. So I hope Senator McConnell--the Republican leader--and his  colleagues in the Republican caucus will join us and allow us to pass  this bill quickly this week. Let's step up to the plate and get this  done. The American people have waited too long for this relief.   I, for one, am proud of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  coming together and passing a meaningful relief bill, but the time for  patting one another on the back is over. Let's finish the job. Let's  make sure that we have this authorization bill for the Department of  Defense and that we come to the rescue of our families across America  who need defense against the vagaries of this pandemic and this  economy. We can finally see a slight glimmer of light at the end of  this tunnel. If we want to address the needs of Americans in crisis, it  starts with passing this legislation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
