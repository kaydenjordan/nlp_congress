 Mr. Speaker, the national media's continued  crusade against President Trump further demonstrates that they are not  mainstream.   A Morning Consult poll found that a majority of Americans believe the  media is ``out of touch with everyday Americans.'' Most significantly,  37 percent said they trusted President Trump to tell the truth, while  only 29 percent said the media is truthful.   The media's open hostility to the President continues to erode his  credibility. A poll by the University of Virginia Center for Politics  found that 88 percent of Trump voters agree with him that the media  ``is the enemy of the American people.''   Let's hope the media will put aside their bias and give the President  fair and objective coverage. It may be the only way for the media to  rebuild their credibility.                            ____________________
