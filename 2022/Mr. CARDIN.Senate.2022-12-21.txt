 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order       for the quorum call be rescinded.         Madam President, tonight, Jews in America and around the       world will be celebrating the fourth night of Hanukkah. Hanukkah       represents the successful revolt by the Maccabees against suppression       of the Jewish community that dates back to the second temple, in the       second century BCE. So we have seen, over a long history of the world,       attacks against the Jewish people and the unfortunate anti-Semitism       that has existed since basically the beginning of time.        What is shocking is the current increase in the number of anti-      Semitic episodes that we have seen in speech and in action here in the       United States and around the world.        Let me bring it closer to home. Last Saturday, in Montgomery County,       MD, just a few miles from where we are, at Walt Whitman High School,       anti-Semitic graffiti was put on their walls.        It was the second time in just over 1 month in Montgomery County that       we have seen anti-Semitic type activities through graffiti. In mid-      November on the Trolley Trail, a similar episode occurred.        The number of episodes that arise of anti-Semitism is shocking. The       Anti-Defamation League has given us the numbers--61 percent increase       between 2020 and 2021 in speech and attacks against Jewish institutions       here and around the world.        I have the privilege of being the Special Representative of the OSCE       Parliamentary Assembly for Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance. I       attended, on behalf of the United States, the Berlin Conference on       Anti-Semitism in 2004. There were many lessons learned from those       conferences that we had, but the most important lesson we learned is       that leaders must speak out and act against any form of anti-Semitism       or any form of hate. It cannot be normalized.        We have seen just the opposite from our leaders recently--former       President Trump and a dinner he had at Mar-a-Lago with a known anti-      Semite and a known White supremacist and a photograph then later with a       QAnon follower. This gives oxygen to hate.        We need to strengthen our resolve to make sure that we will never       allow this to be normalized, and we need to recognize that there is a       direct link between the attacks on our democratic institutions and our       rule of law and the rise of anti-Semitism and other forms of hate.       Therefore, we all must speak out about disinformation and election       deniers. We need to speak out against the conspiracy theorists who use       theories such as the ``replacement theory,'' promoting old-age anti-      Semitic tropes. We know where that leads. It leads to violence.        On November 29 of this year, I conducted, under the auspices of the       OSCE Helsinki Commission, a roundtable discussion. I was pleased to be       joined by our Presiding Officer, Senator Rosen, and I thank her for her       extraordinary leadership with Senator Lankford in establishing the       bipartisan and bicameral caucus in regards to fighting anti-Semitism. I       was also joined by Senator Blumenthal and Congressman Veasey. We had       representatives from the White House, from the Department of Homeland       Security, Department of State, Department of Justice, the Anti-      Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, and the U.S.       Holocaust Memorial Museum. All were present as we talked about what we       can do.        That was followed up by a hearing at the Helsinki Commission last       week on December 16--actually, just almost a week ago--in which we had       Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt, our Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat       Antisemitism, and Rabbi Andrew Baker, who is the Special       Representative, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in       Europe on anti-Semitism. We all met again in a public forum as to what       we should do. And I want to compliment the Biden administration. Doug       Emhoff had a similar roundtable discussion with all the stakeholders.        Out of all those meetings, one thing became abundantly clear: We need       a whole-of-government approach in fighting the rise of anti-Semitism.       We need a coordinated strategy.        So I want to thank President Biden for his statement on December 12       where he did set up an interagency group, led by the domestic policy       staff, in order to develop a unified national strategy to combat anti-      Semitism and all forms of hate. That came out of the recommendations       that our Presiding Officer helped lead all of us together to make that       a reality.        We need a unified national strategy. It must include education. And I       am so proud of this body approving additional funds for Holocaust       education. It is important. It is an important part. People need to       understand their history so that we are not doomed to repeat the       horrors of the past. It includes safety. Public safety is very       important. It is a reality that we have to provide our communities with       the security they need. These nonprofits security grants are critically       important. I was glad to see again that we are going to act later today       to provide the resources we need to help our religious institutions       protect themselves against the threats that are out there today. We       need to engage law enforcement with training and accurate data       collection so we understand the problem and we can take steps to combat       it.        Yes, we need a coalition of all groups. We need to work together. As       President Biden said when he set up the task force, we need to       coordinate U.S. Government efforts to counter anti-Semitism,       Islamophobia, and related forms of bias and discrimination within the       United States. We need to work in coalition.        I had a sidebar meeting in Luxembourg at one of the OSCE       Parliamentary Assembly meetings on anti-Semitism, and it became loud       and clear that if any minority group is in jeopardy, we are all in       jeopardy. So we need to work together.        I am going to close by quoting from an op-ed written by Howard Libit       that ran in the Baltimore Sun on December 14, which was entitled       ``Stemming the rise of antisemitism once more.'' Mr. Libit serves as       the executive director of the Baltimore Jewish Council. Let me just       quote some what he put in that op-ed:                   These days, the media's common refrain focuses on the            ``normalization'' of antisemitism. Essentially, we are seeing            so many antisemitic comments and actions from leaders in            politics, sports, entertainment, and social media, it is            casually becoming part of our everyday conversation and            debate. Immediate and universal condemnation used to be the            norm when public figures or public debate crossed the line            into antisemitism. That no longer seems to be the case--           whether it is because of the overall coarsening of our public            debates or the relentless rise of anonymous social media, or            simply the fact that there is fatigue from so many            antisemitic comments seemingly everywhere.              We can never normalize anti-Semitism.        The editorial continues:                   But as a leader in our Jewish community here in Baltimore,            I say that we must commit to fighting antisemitism on all            fronts, from all political points of view, no matter how big            or how small. The gap between rhetoric and action has always            been frighteningly narrow, which is why strong and immediate            confirmation from all corners of leadership must again be the            norm. The narrow gap between words and violence is why we            must shine the brightest light possible on antisemitism.              I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the       Capitol to work with me, work with all of us--the Biden administration,       our allies, our civil society partners--to loudly and decisively call       out anti-Semitism wherever it manifests itself and to work together in       the whole-society approach to combat and eradicate it from our society.        On this Hanukkah, let us rededicate ourselves that there should be no       place            [[Page S9733]]            for hate in America and that we will fight anti-Semitism here and lead       the international efforts against anti-Semitism.        I yield the floor.        I suggest the absence of a quorum.         Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to our colleague       and friend, Senator James Inhofe. There are few Senators more       conservative than Senator Inhofe. And yet he is always working across       the aisle, collegially, on issues where he can find bipartisan       agreement. I have enjoyed working with him on the Senate Environment       and Public Works Committee. We disagree on most of the ``Environment''       portion of the committee's jurisdiction, but we certainly agree on the       ``Public Works'' portion. Because of his leadership, EPW is ``the       committee that gets things done,'' as he likes to put it.        Senator Inhofe served in the U.S. Army from 1957 to 1958. He served       in the Oklahoma State Legislature for 10 years, including 4 as senate       minority leader. He was elected mayor of Tulsa three times. He won       election to the U.S. House of Representatives four times. And he won       election to the Senate six times. He has served as chair and ranking       member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Armed       Services Committee.        Senator Inhofe has had a long career in public service, but he also       worked in the insurance industry, real estate development, and one of       his greatest passions, aviation. Senator Inhofe is a pilot, with over       11,000 flight hours. I believe he is the only Member of Congress to       pilot his own plane--a twin-engine Cessna--around the world, something       he did in 16 days in 1991, recreating Wiley Post's historic 1931       journey. He is one of general aviation's most dedicated advocates and a       member of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, AOPA.        If you want an example of grace under pressure, in 1999, Senator       Inhofe lost the propeller off his Grumman Tiger May 8 but made a       successful emergency landing at Claremore, OK.            [[Page S9764]]            As AOPA reported at the time, ``In a strange coincidence, the propeller       was found by one of Inhofe's high school classmates from Tulsa, who       called the airport asking if anyone had lost a prop. G. W. Curtiss       returned the prop to the airport and reunited with the senator, whom he       hadn't seen in some 40 years.''        Senator Inhofe is a rightfully proud of his role on the Armed       Services Committee in producing the National Defense Authorization Act,       NDAA, each year, and it is fitting that this year's NDAA bears his       name. He has worked especially hard on building U.S. relations with       countries in Africa and led the effort to establish AFRICOM as a       separate combatant command in 2007. I have appreciated his strong       support for Israel and for cosponsoring my measure, the Israel Anti-      Boycott Act.        On EPW, I have enjoyed collaborating with Senator Inhofe on surface       transportation and water development bills. For many years, Senator       Inhofe was the only Republican to join my Dear Colleague letters to       fund the Water Resources Development Acts of 2014 through 2020, with       the grant programs under those bills receiving steady increases in       their appropriated levels. These increases have accrued to State       Revolving Funds for wastewater and drinking water but also to smaller,       objective-specific programs to reduce lead in drinking water, for       instance.        Senator Inhofe and his beloved wife Kay celebrated their 63rd wedding       anniversary this Monday. He is devoted to her and to his 20 children       and grandchildren. I know he is eager to spend more time with them.        There is much that Senator Inhofe and I disagree on, but we both know       that our friendship transcends those disagreements by a wide margin,       and, as a result, we have accomplished much together where we agree,       especially on water infrastructure. I am grateful for our friendship       and for his public service spanning eight decades--from his Army       service in the 1950s to today--and wish him a happy, well-deserved       retirement.                                      ____________________                Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to our colleague       and, more importantly, my dear friend, Senator Roy Blunt. By Senate       standards, Senator Blunt has had a brief career--two terms--but he has       been extraordinarily effective. I know I speak on behalf of all of our       colleagues when I say we will miss Senator Blunt's calming influence       and steady hand at the helm of good old-fashioned bipartisan       legislating.        Senator Blunt is native Missourian. He grew up on a dairy farm, so he       knows about hard work. He received both his undergraduate and graduate       degrees in the State. He entered public service at the age of 22 when       he became the Greene County Clerk and Election Official, a post he held       for 12 years.        In 1984, Senator Blunt was elected to serve as Missouri's secretary       of state, the first Republican to hold that position in 50 years. In       1996, he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives and was       reelected six times. I got to know him while we both served in the       House.        Before Senator Blunt was elected to serve in Congress, he was a high       school history teacher. He also taught at his alma mater, Southwest       Baptist University, and served as its president from 1993 to 1996.        Senator Blunt was well-schooled in civics and governance when he       arrived in Congress, so it is no surprise that he quickly rose through       the ranks to hold Republican leadership posts both in the House and in       the Senate. He became the majority whip in the House earlier in his       career than any predecessor over the previous 80 years. He entered       Senate Republican leadership as a freshman.        I have had the privilege and the pleasure of working with Senator       Blunt on many issues, chief of which is the New Markets Tax Credit       program, NMTC. We have worked together since 2015 to extend and       increase the allocation for the New Markets Tax Credit program, which       provides a 39 percent Federal tax credit for businesses or economic       development projects in areas with poverty rates of at least 20       percent, or median incomes at or below 80 percent of the area median,       driving investment and strengthening communities in areas that need it       most. In Missouri, I understand that more than 500 projects have       benefited from the tax credit, covering everything from afterschool       programs and affordable housing to research hubs and local small       businesses.        Senator Blunt and I serve as cochairs of the Atlantic Council's U.S.-      Colombia Task Force, where we have worked together to strengthen the       economic, diplomatic, and security ties between our two nations.        Earlier this month, Senator Blunt, who serves as the ranking member       on the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, was instrumental in       helping pass S. 5229, a bill I introduced directing the Joint Committee       on the Library to remove the bust of Roger Taney from the Old Supreme       Court Chamber and to obtain a bust of Thurgood Marshall. Taney was       Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who wrote the majority opinion in       the infamous Dred Scott case in 1857. Marshall was the first Black       Supreme Court Justice.        Senator Blunt is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, and       he has skillfully looked after his State's interests. But he has had a       much broader vision, too, particularly when it comes to the National       Institutes of Health--NIH--located not in Missouri, but in my home       State of Maryland. As the former chair and now the ranking member on       the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human       Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Labor/HHS), Senator Blunt       secured seven consecutive funding increases for NIH totaling $15.4       billion.        Thanks in large part to Senator Blunt's leadership, Alzheimer's       disease research funding has more than quintupled, increasing from $631       million to nearly $3.5 billion. In September, NIH dedicated the Roy       Blunt Center for Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Research in       Bethesda, MD.        Thanks in large part to Senator Blunt's leadership, the National       Cancer Institute has received an increase of nearly $2 billion, or 40       percent, over the past 7 years.        The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which President Biden signed       into law in June, included more than $8.5 billion to expand the       successful Excellence in Mental Health Program, which created Certified       Community Behavioral Health Clinics--CCBHCs--to every State that       chooses to participate. Nine states, including Missouri and Michigan,       are currently participating in the CCBHC program; 10 additional States       may opt into the program every 2 years.        Senator Blunt worked with Senator Stabenow to pass the Excellence in       Mental Health Act in 2014. The law, which marked the most significant       expansion of community mental health and addiction services in decades,       created CCBHCs that provide a wide range of services, including 24/7/      365 crisis services, immediate screenings, risk assessments, and       diagnoses. Missouri was one of the first eight States selected to       participate in the Excellence pilot program, and has done so since       2017.        Start-up grants have expanded the number of clinics to more than 300       communities across 40 States, plus Washington, DC, and that number       continues to grow. Annual funding for CCBHC expansion grants started at       $100 million in fiscal year 2018 and is now $315 million. The total       funding for fiscal years 2018 through 2022 exceeds $1 billion. In 2020,       Congress also provided an additional $850 million through emergency       COVID funding. These clinics serve about 1.5 million people across the       country.        These are just a few of Senator Blunt's many accomplishments on       behalf of his beloved Missourians, all Americans, and people around the       world. Senator Blunt is always interested in trying to find consensus,       and he usually succeeds. Wherever there are bipartisan ``gangs,'' as we       call them, working on thorny issues from infrastructure to marriage       equality to Electoral Count Act reform, you will find Senator Blunt.       His service provides a model all Senators should strive to emulate.        I will miss collaborating with Senator Blunt but am grateful that our       congressional careers have overlapped for the past 26 years. We all owe       a debt of gratitude to his lovely wife Abigail--            [[Page S9765]]            Abby--and his 10 children and grandchildren for ``sharing'' him with       Congress and the Nation for a public service career spanning half a       century. Senator Blunt has made his mark, and we are all better for it.                                      ____________________                Madam President, I rise on behalf of myself and my       colleague Senator Van Hollen to congratulate the Army Corps of       Engineers, Baltimore District, on the occasion of its 175th       anniversary. The Baltimore District has a long and storied history from       the early 1800s and the construction of Fort McHenry, protecting       Baltimore against British attacks in the War of 1812. When the threat       of coastal attack diminished in the 1820s, the Baltimore District       turned its attention to work that signified the start of its civil       works mission, developing roadways, railways, canals, and more. Today,       the Baltimore District's mission is to deliver vital engineering       solutions in collaboration with its partners to strengthen the Nation,       energize the economy, and reduce disaster risks. With approximately       1,200 employees, the District's work spans Maryland; northern Virginia;       Washington, DC; West Virginia; Pennsylvania; Delaware; lower central       New York; overseas locations; and across the Susquehanna, Potomac and       Chesapeake Bay watersheds.        The Baltimore District has an extensive flood risk management       program, inspecting nearly 150 miles of levee systems and operating 16       dams, contributing to the prevention of more than $16 billion in flood       damages to date. The District maintains 290 miles of Federal channels,       including dredging for Baltimore Harbor, from which material is used       beneficially in projects such as the expansion of Poplar Island in the       Chesapeake Bay and the construction of the Mid-Chesapeake Bay Island       Ecosystem Restoration project. The District carries out important       restoration work for native oyster populations in the Bay. The       Baltimore District is the only district to operate a public utility--      the Washington Aqueduct--that produces an average of 135 million       gallons of drinking water per day at two treatment plants for       approximately 1 million people living, working, or visiting the       National Capital Region. The District also cleans up Formerly Used       Defense Sites, decommissions and deactivates former nuclear power       plants, and performs cleanup of low-level radioactive waste from the       Nation's early atomic weapons program. The Baltimore District executes       a robust military construction program and provides real estate       services. These civil and military missions and diverse engineering       services support communities and our military while protecting our       national security. With today's ever-evolving and complex challenges,       the urgency of climate change, and the connections between ecosystem       health, environmental quality, and economic growth, the work of the       Baltimore District is more vital than ever.        Senator Van Hollen and I congratulate the Baltimore District on its       175th anniversary; we are proud of its headquarters' presence in       Baltimore, and we look forward to its ongoing and future collaborations       in Maryland and the wider region it serves.                                      ____________________                Madam President, I rise today to praise one of our fine       civil servants--Mr. Carl Sosebee, of Silver Spring, MD--for his service       and leadership at the Peace Corps, which has culminated in his role as       senior advisor to the Director. Mr. Sosebee's outstanding service in       the Agency spans 20 years and a range of roles.        Throughout Mr. Sosebee's Peace Corps career, he has demonstrated his       willingness to serve by taking on whatever position and challenge he       was asked to fill, whether as attorney advisor, deputy general counsel,       acting general counsel, acting chief of staff, and acting Associate       Director of External Affairs, to name just a few. Thanks to this       breadth of experience, Mr. Sosebee's knowledge of the Peace Corps'       operations is unmatched and has uniquely qualified him to serve as a       trusted adviser to several leaders of the agency.        Mr. Sosebee's skills and judgement were essential to helping the       Agency weather one of its greatest challenges in recent years: the       global evacuation of almost 7,000 volunteers at the beginning of the       COVID-19 pandemic, followed by the detailed planning and systemic       changes the Peace Corps undertook to return volunteers to service in a       world that has fundamentally changed. It was in no small part thanks to       Mr. Sosebee's efforts that the Peace Corps, which just started sending       volunteers overseas again in March of 2022, is already back in service       in 45 countries, with 11 more on the way shortly.        Throughout his 20 years at the Peace Corps, Mr. Sosebee has       functioned as an adhesive glue between administrations, consistently       supporting each new leadership team that arrived in the Agency, while       also providing career staff with a stable management presence during       times of transition. Mr. Sosebee worked tirelessly as a dedicated civil       servant to help each administration, regardless of political       affiliation, achieve its goals with regards to the Peace Corps.        Mr. Sosebee is highly regarded within the Peace Corps. He is       respected by his colleagues for his sharp intellect, professionalism,       kindness, dedication to service, and for being a consummate team       player. Mr. Sosebee consistently answered the call to service, enabling       the Peace Corps to even more effectively fulfill its mission of       promoting world peace and friendship.        In addition to his service at the Peace Corps, Mr. Sosebee has held       positions at the Community Services Administration, the Department of       State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Prior to his       Federal service, Mr. Sosebee was a private legal practitioner, handling       criminal and civil cases in the District of Columbia.        I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Carl Sosebee for his more       than 40 years of service to the United States and in wishing him       continued success in his future endeavors.                                      ____________________                Madam President, I rise today to honor Mary Ann Ullrich,       manager of the Office of Congressional Publishing at the Government       Publishing Office, GPO. On December 31, 2022, Mary will retire from the       GPO after more than 37 years of public service. Mary's career--which is       truly an American dream as she will tell you herself--started after she       graduated from high school with excellent typing skills and a strong       work ethic. She started in 1980 in the personnel office of what was       then known as the Government Printing Office as a clerk typist. She is       now retiring from GPO as the second shift manager in congressional       publishing.        Mary is a New York City native, who grew up in the Bronx before       relocating to Maryland. After she started working at GPO, she quickly       moved up through the ranks through printing procurement, customer       service, and quality assurance, where she reviewed printing for quality       defects and was commended for discovering a loophole in the QATAP       Program that contractors must adhere to as a procurement requirement,       potentially saving taxpayer dollars. Mary then worked for the       superintendent of documents designing marketing materials and the       postscript service section processing electronic prepress files and       posting government documents online. Mary received a prestigious Hammer       Award for her work on GPOAccess during the Clinton administration ``for       helping to create a government that works better and costs less.'' She       posted publications online such as the daily Congressional Record, the       Starr Report, and many assorted congressional and Federal Government       publications.        Mary then went to typography and design where she typeset many       different products, including Ronald Reagan's lying in state card and       program when he was interred in the Capitol. She received a plaque from       Mrs. Reagan for her efforts. She also typeset and produced the White       House programs for Presidential events during the Clinton and Bush       administrations, Colin Powell's ``Joint Force Quarterly (JFQ)       Magazine,'' and other government publications such as the ``Senate       Catalogue of Fine Art'' and ``Glenn Brown's History of the Capitol''--      both fine art books for the Senate Curator's office and the Architect       of the Capitol's office respectively.        Mary was working with the White House public affairs staff on a White       House program the morning of September 11, 2001, when news of the       terrorist attack on our country was broadcast. She proudly worked       almost 32 hours straight to produce the 9/11 Memorial Ceremony Program       to ensure that all was ready for the 10 a.m. memorial service at       Washington National Cathedral. For her dedication to excellence, then-      First Lady Laura Bush sent a personally signed thank you to Mary.        On October 1, 2006, Mary moved up to congressional publishing, where       she worked directly with congressional staff to procure the       publications of Congress. She handled the procurement and press sheet       inspection of the Glenn Brown Book that she had typeset in T&D,       finishing the production cycle full-circle. Mary also worked with the       Senate Curators to produce the ``Senate Catalogue of Graphic Art'' and       the reprint of ``Constantino Brumidi, Artist of the Capitol'' fine art       book--all high-quality printed books--as well as large projects such as       the House's new Members orientation products. Mary then went to second       shift on October 21, 2012, working with the House and Senate Official       Reporters on the daily Congressional Record printing and online       services; the Senate and House Bill Clerks and Enrolling Clerks on       producing bills and legislation; and the House and Senate       Appropriations Committees' omnibus bills and other materials, to name       just a few of her responsibilities.        I often say that our nonpartisan career civil service is one of our       Nation's most important and least appreciated assets. It consists of       hundreds of thousands of people like Mary Ullrich, mostly anonymous,       who serve their fellow Americans with pride and distinction. If you ask       Mary, she will tell you how proud she is to be a career civil servant       and how fortunate she has felt to work at the GPO. Mary has looked up       at the Capitol Dome every day from the front door of GPO, brimming with       pride for the part she has played in ``Keeping America Informed'' about       Congress and the legislative process. I want to congratulate Mary Ann       Ullrich of the GPO on her well-earned retirement after over 37 years of       loyal Federal service.                                      ____________________
