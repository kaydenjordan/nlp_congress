 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 682, the  Launch Communications Act.   In central Florida, the busiest spaceport in the world is right in  our backyard in Cape Canaveral. We had a record year of 57 launches  from the cape in 2022, and we are expecting a total of 87 launches or  more this year, so quite often we see 2 or more in a single week.   When we see bad weather, as you can imagine, some of these launches  start to stack up, which is why having a lengthy FCC license process  for each launch can be cumbersome and costly.   That is why I introduced this bill with my colleague and fellow  Floridian, Dr. Dunn, to streamline the process and ensure our  spaceports continue to be the most efficient in the world.   The Launch Communications Act allocates certain spectrum for  commercial launches and reentries. It streamlines the process for  authorization to said spectrum while also keeping it available to other  users and ensuring coordination to prevent any interference with  government systems.   As we continue to break launch records year after year, we need to  streamline these processes to continue to ensure that America remains  the world leader in space. This bill does exactly that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce  Committee, Chair Latta, Chair McMorris Rodgers, Ranking Member Pallone,  Ranking Member Matsui, and, of course, my fellow Floridian, Dr. Dunn,  for passing this bill out of committee unanimously.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Launch  Communications Act.
