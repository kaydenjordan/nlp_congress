 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the Federal  Career Opportunities in Computer Sciences Work Act.   Mr. Speaker, I, along with most of the country, was recently  horrified by the cyberattacks against critical parts of our national  infrastructure, in particular, the cyberattack against Colonial  Pipeline that shut down gasoline deliveries for much of the Eastern  United States and the cyberattacks against JBS meat processing, which  disrupted operations at one of the largest food processing facilities  in our country.   It has become increasingly clear that dealing with these threats will  require highly trained professionals in the computer sciences and the  data sciences as part of not just our civilian workforce but also our  Federal workforce.   Unfortunately, many people are surprised to learn that we do not  currently have Federal career occupational series that are dedicated to  the computer sciences. This bill, the Federal Career Opportunities in  Computer Sciences Work Act, will establish those series in such fields  as data management, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.  This will enable our Federal Government to better attract and retain  the highly qualified technical computer scientist talent that is needed  to respond to these attacks in the future.   This is bipartisan legislation. It is an easy and commonsense  solution to this problem, and I urge support for this bill.
