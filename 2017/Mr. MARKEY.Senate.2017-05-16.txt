 Mr. President, I would like to commemorate National  Police Week and the lives and sacrifices of two extraordinary  Massachusetts law enforcement officers who fell in 2016: Thomas Clardy,  a trooper with the Massachusetts State Police, and Ronald Tarantino, a  police officer with the Auburn Police Department. Their names will be  inscribed on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in  Washington, DC, in honor of their service.   By the end of this year, more than 21,000 names will be on that wall.  We will never forget their service and sacrifice to our communities and  to our country. With the help of the National Law Enforcement Officers  Memorial Fund, we pledge to their families and loved ones that they  will have the support and resources they need.
