 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank Representative Raskin for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Madam Speaker, the right to vote is of paramount importance in our  Republic. We all agree on that. Prohibitions against discriminatory  barriers to the right to vote have been grounded in Federal law since  the Civil War and, more recently, through the Voting Rights Act of  1965.   We all agree: Discrimination should have no place in our voting  system. However, the majority would have us believe that the Voting  Rights Act does not prevent any of this and would rather pass this  partisan legislation for a Federal takeover of elections.   I anticipate that the 2013 Supreme Court case Shelby County v. Holder  will be brought up many times today, but I would like to point out to  my Democratic colleagues that, in that decision, the Supreme Court only  struck down one outdated provision of the Voting Rights Act.   This provision, section 4(b), was struck down because it was outdated  as it had not been updated since 1975, and it violated principles of  equal State sovereignty and federalism. H.R. 4 is, quite  simply, unconstitutional, as the Supreme Court had held that Federal  control over local elections is allowed only when there is proof of  discriminatory treatment in voting.    Further, I believe it is important to point out that other very  important provisions of the Voting Rights Act remain in place,  including section 2 and section 3.   Section 2 applies nationwide and prohibits voting practices or  procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color, or the  ability to speak English. Section 2 is enforced through Federal  lawsuits just like every other Federal civil rights law, and the United  States and civil rights organizations have brought many cases to  enforce the guarantees of section 2 in court, and they may do so in the  future, as well.   Section 3 of the Voting Rights Act also remains in place. This  section authorizes Federal courts to impose preclearance requirements  on States and political subdivisions that have enacted voting  procedures that treat people differently based on race in violation of  the 14th and 15th Amendments.   If a Federal court finds a State or a political subdivision to have  treated people differently based on race, then the court has discretion  now to retain supervisory jurisdiction and impose preclearance  requirements as they see fit until a future date at the court's  discretion. This is all valid now without this bill.   Section 3 has been utilized recently, in fact. U.S. District Judge  Lee Rosenthal issued an opinion in a redistricting case that required  that the city of Pasadena, Texas, be monitored by the Justice  Department because it had intentionally changed its city council  districts to decrease Hispanic influence.   States should be allowed to implement their own laws regarding their  elections and voting security to ensure all results are accurate on  election day. State and local governments know more about how to handle  their elections than bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.   I applaud State and local governments that are taking the necessary  steps to modernize and secure their elections. For example, in Arizona,  my home State, we have made continual progress on improving voter  turnout and participation.   Mr. Raskin said that the section that was taken out by the courts was  genius. Well, I believe the opposite is true.   Arizona was under this outdated preclearance formula, and I can tell  you personally that this section was not genius. Both Arizona Democrats  and Republicans, alike, thought to have to preclear every single  decision that elected election officials made with the Federal  bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., was a total disaster.   Arizona now has free, open, and secure elections, despite not being  under this Federal control preclearance anymore. Nearly 80 percent of  Arizonans vote by mail. We have a robust online voter registration  system, so it is easy to register to vote. We have approximately 1  month of early voting.   While Arizona has made voting easier and more accessible for voters,  we have also made our elections more secure by outlining the practice  of ballot harvesting. In Arizona, we believe it should be easy to vote  and hard to cheat. The policies in Arizona seem to be working, as we  have seen in election after election that voter turnout continues to  grow.   A couple months ago, I had the opportunity to participate in a field  hearing in Phoenix, Arizona, to discuss the Voting Rights Act. There, I  spoke with staff of the Maricopa County Recorder, an elected Democrat.  She relayed to me how disappointed they were to not have been asked to  testify at this hearing as they felt that they had not been able to  speak to the story of the successes in Arizona and why they were very  concerned about H.R. 4. They did not want the Federal Government  preclearing every single decision they made.   Think about it: They don't want to have to go back to the Federal  Government every single time they change early ballots or voting  locations. They, instead, are making great progress and strides. Voter  turnout has soared. They don't want bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.,  slowing down important and time-sensitive decisions.   This rule also includes H. Res. 326.   I am curious why my Democratic colleagues decided to bring forward  this nonbinding resolution as opposed to bringing up H.R. 336, a bill  that I am personally a proud cosponsor of, which is identical to the  text of S. 1, the Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East  Act of 2019, which passed the Senate by a vote of 77-23--totally  bipartisan--on February 5, 2019. Instead of the nonbinding resolution  we have before us today, H.R. 336 would take concrete steps to counter  the BDS movement against Israel.                                time  1245    Instead, I am saddened the Democrats brought up this resolution, a  resolution that rebukes and ties the hands of the Trump administration  and embarrasses Israel. In fact, the resolution expressly states a  proposal must be put forward that is consistent with previous  administrations' proposals, completely undercutting the Trump  administration. This should not be a partisan issue with only Democrat  sponsors and not one Republic cosponsor as this bill has. We should not  be handicapping our President.   My Republican colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee tell me  that a resolution that supports a two-state solution, without  attempting to undermine the President, could have been bipartisan.  However, this resolution singles out settlement expansion and  annexation. These are some of the most delicate issues in our bilateral  relationship with Israel, and it shines a spotlight on them in the  middle of an ongoing and contentious time in Israel.   The resolution spells out specific Palestinian Authority demands  without listing critical Israeli preconditions, such as acknowledging  Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state with an undivided Jerusalem  as Israel's capital and providing assurances for Israel's safety and  security through a demilitarized zone.   As a whole, this resolution disproportionately criticizes the Israeli  Government while failing to recognize the dangerous actions targeting  innocent Israelis that further remove the possibility of peace.   We already voted to support a two-state solution over the summer in  H. Res. 246 in a bipartisan manner.   So why do we need this partisan bill?   So, Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to this rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Zeldin), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If we defeat the previous question, I will bring to the floor H.R.  2207, the Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2019, which most people  know as the bill that will eliminate the medical device tax.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, H.R. 2207 was introduced by Mr. Kind from  Wisconsin, and it has 253 bipartisan cosponsors, including myself.   Since the medical device tax was imposed by the Affordable Care Act,  commonly known as ObamaCare, folks have known that it was detrimental  to innovation and to patient access to necessary devices and  treatments. The 2.3 percent excise tax has been suspended twice because  we know it is bad policy. So what are we waiting for?   Madam Speaker, we should be bringing legislation to this floor that  showcases how we can work together. The American people need to see us  united on issues as important as this. We need to stand together when  opportunities like these arise to better the lives and truly help all  of our constituencies. H.R. 2207 does just that.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana  (Mrs. Walorski).    Madam Speaker, in closing, H.R. 4 is totally partisan,  without one Republican cosponsor; and H. Res. 326, another totally  partisan bill, ties the Trump administration's hands and embarrasses  Israel.   Madam Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question, ``no'' on the  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
