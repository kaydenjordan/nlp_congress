 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Inflation Reduction Act.   This transformational legislation will lower healthcare costs for  millions of Americans and thousands of Alabamians by extending ACA tax  credits for an additional 3 years and reducing the prescription drug  costs for our seniors by allowing HHS, for the first time, to negotiate  drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and capping out-of-pocket  drug costs to $2,000 per year. This is a big deal for American families  and especially the families that I represent in Alabama.   This bill is also the single largest climate investment in America's  history. This bill includes my Carbon Capture and Sequestration  Expansion Act that will extend the 45 credit eligibilities for carbon  capture projects to 2023.   When I think about all the great things that are in this particular  bill, it is truly transformational for the people that I represent and  for the American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.  Let's put people first over politics.
