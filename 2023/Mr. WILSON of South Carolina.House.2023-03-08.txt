 Madam Speaker, last week, The  Washington Times featured a thoughtful open letter from Clifford D.  May, president of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, to  President Biden. He wrote: ``Dear Mr. President, first, kudos to you  for going to Kyiv.''   ``For the past year, you've been providing the Ukrainians enough  weapons to prevent them from losing but not enough . . . to drive out  the [Putin] invaders. Why not ask such military experts as retired  General Jack Keane what's necessary to get the job done as fast as  possible?''   ``The moral argument for supporting Ukraine is obvious to most people  but you still haven't made clear why its defense is a vital American  national interest. . . . The rulers of neoimperialist Russia, Communist  China, and Islamic Iran share a goal: the diminishment--if not death-- of the United States.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   Congratulations, Ambassador Georgi Panayotov, for the Library of  Congress National Bulgaria Day reception.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.  Con. Res. 21.   Stopping the resurgence of ISIS now, before more attacks on American  families, is critical. My appreciation of military service is as a 31- year Army veteran myself, but I am particularly grateful that I have  had four sons: Alan, who served in Iraq; Addison, who served in Iraq;  Julian, who served in Egypt; and my youngest son, Hunter, who did a  tour in Afghanistan. So I know personally the significance of military  service.   I think of the last 20 years that our military, because of 9/11, has  stopped attacks in the United States. So this strength must be  maintained.   At the height of ISIS' reign of terror, Operation Inherent Resolve  was formally launched in October of 2015 to counter the terrorist  network's rapid expansion in Iraq and Syria. Upon defeat of the  physical caliphate in Baghouz in 2019, the United States conducted a  drawdown of forces.   Currently, there are approximately 900 U.S. soldiers in northeast  Syria. The remaining troops assist the Syrian Democratic forces in  deterrence of continued terrorist threats from Iranian-backed terror  organizations and maintenance of facilities containing--amazing; this  is incredible; the American people need to know--10,000 hardened ISIS  prisoners who are dedicated and trained mass murderers, along with  thousands of their radicalized family members.   While the American-led coalition was successful, the threat of ISIS  and the extremism in the region remain. Reporting indicates that ISIS  is making significant efforts to reorganize in Syria and Iraq. Iranian- backed terrorists, who back up the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad,  also continue attacks on U.S. forces at Al-Tanf and pose a tremendous  destabilizing effect. Upon withdrawal, terrorists would also have  unfettered access to the Omar oil field.   A full withdrawal of the efficient forces remaining would completely  open the region to the resurgence of ISIS and other terrorist  organizations whose mission is the destruction of American families.   Such a threat to American national security would warrant  intervention. Uprooting the small contingent of troops who have  successfully maintained order to the extent possible would simply  ensure that we will be returning to a much larger, more complex problem  at a higher cost and threat to Americans worldwide.   The resolution, we know, is well-intended, but deterrence is cheaper  and more effective than facilitating a full-scale response after the  fact. We don't need to repeat 9/11. Peace is best maintained through  strength.
