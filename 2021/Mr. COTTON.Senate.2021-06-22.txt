 Mr. President, I had not planned to speak about the  Democratic power grab known as S. 1 and H.R. 1, the For the People Act.  I have said my piece on this bill before on the Senate floor and in  many other forums. But I have listened to my Democratic friends all day  long talk about this bill.   We will later today vote on what is known as a motion to proceed to  the debate on this bill. That motion will fail. It won't come close to  passing. And our Democratic friends are saying: They won't even debate.  They won't even debate election reforms.   Well, first off, let me say, if you ask me what the Republican plan  to federalize our elections is, my answer is, we don't have a plan to  federalize our elections. We don't think we should federalize our  elections. We think the States and their counties have done a pretty  good job, traditionally, of running our elections.   I would also remind my Democratic friends that what they present as  some kind of unprecedented affront to having a democratic debate in the  Senate happened repeatedly, hundreds of times, in the last  administration.   My Democratic friends simply voted not even to have a debate--not  even to have a debate on, say, a coronavirus relief package last  summer, which could have gotten aid to families and businesses when  they needed it. When the pandemic was still raging, when vaccines were  still months away, they filibustered even a debate until after the  election, when we passed, in December, almost exactly the same bill  that was under consideration.   They blocked even a debate--even a debate--on policing reforms last  summer that might have helped provide police departments across the  country with additional financial support or training resources.   I could go on and on about the bills on which they blocked even a  debate, like protecting unborn children who can survive outside their  mother's womb. Yet, today, the Democrats act as if it is some terrible  affront that we are not even going to have a debate on a bill that  would be one of the biggest power grabs by Washington in the history of  our democracy.  [[Page S4668]]    Then you have a lot of Democrats who are complaining that the civic  rules and customs--the filibuster has to go. They say it is a racist  relic of the Jim Crow era.   I will acknowledge that some Democrats over the years used the  filibuster to block civil rights progress, but I will also remind my  Democratic colleagues that, yes, they used the filibuster hundreds of  times in the last administration.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  this letter written on April 7, 2017, persuasively authored by Susan  Collins and Chris Coons and signed by more than 60 of our fellow  Senators urging Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer to ``preserve the  existing rules, practices and traditions as they pertain to the right  of Members to engage in extended debate on legislation.'   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, April 7, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader       Schumer: We are writing to urge you to support our efforts to       preserve existing rules, practices, and traditions as they       pertain to the right of Members to engage in extended debate       on legislation before the United States Senate. Senators have       expressed a variety of opinions about the appropriateness of       limiting debate when we are considering judicial and       executive branch nominations. Regardless of our past       disagreements on that issue, we are united in our       determination to preserve the ability of Members to engage in       extended debate when bills are on the Senate floor.        We are mindful of the unique role the Senate plays in the       legislative process, and we are steadfastly committed to       ensuring that this great American institution continues to       serve as the world's greatest deliberative body. Therefore,       we are asking you to join us in opposing any effort to       curtail the existing rights and prerogatives of Senators to       engage in full, robust, and extended debate as we consider       legislation before this body in the future.            Sincerely,        Susan M. Collins, Orrin Hatch, Claire McCaskill, Lisa       Murkowski, Christopher A. Coons, Joe Manchin, John McCaine,       Patrick Leahy, Roger F. Wicker, Luther Strange.        Angus S. King, Jr., Michael F. Bennett, Amy Klobuchar,       Robert P. Casey, Jr., Martin Heinrich, John Boozman, Lindsey       Graham, Richard Burr, Mark R. Warner, Jerry Moran.        Roy Blunt, Marco Rubio, Jeanne Shaheen, Thom Tillis,       Sherrod Brown, Shelley Moore Capito, Kirsten E. Gillibrand,       Brian Schatz, Michael E. Enzi, Dean Heller.        Cory A. Booker, Mazie K. Hirono, Dianne Feinstein, John       Thune, Bill Cassidy, Heidi Heitkamp, Jeff Flake, Chuck       Grassley, Maria Cantwell, Rob Portman.        Lamar Alexander, John Kennedy, John Tester, Thomas R.       Carper, Pat Roberts, Margaret Wood Hassan, Tammy Duckworth,       Jack Reed, Thad Cochran, Joe Donnelly.        Ben Sasse, Todd Young, Kamala D. Harris, Bill Nelson,       Johnny Isakson, Edward J. Markey, Mike Lee, Debbie Stabenow,       Sheldon Whitehouse, Robert Menendez, Tim Kaine.    They note that these rules have changed on our Executive  Calendar when we consider traditional nominees or executive branch  nominees, but they say:         We are mindful of the unique role the Senate plays in the       legislative process, and we are steadfastly committed to       ensuring that this great [American] institution continues to       serve as the world's greatest deliberative body. Therefore,       we are asking you [Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell] to       join us in opposing any effort to curtail the existing rights       and prerogatives of Senators to engage in full, robust, and       extended debate as we consider legislation before this body       in the future.    Let me remind you, more than 60 Senators signed this. Twenty-six  Democrats currently serving in the Senate signed it, 27 if you include  the Vice President.   Let me just give you a few notables. As I said, the Vice President  signed it. The following chairs of Senate committees signed this letter  4 short years ago: Senators Leahy, Warner, Cantwell, Carper, Reed,  Stabenow, and Menendez. Some other notable Senators--as I said, it was  authored by Senator Coons, one of Joe Biden's closest friends in the  U.S. Senate. Senator King, who often finds himself in the middle of  consequential debates; Senator Heinrich, who apparently has changed his  tune and today is advocating aggressively to eliminate the filibuster,  just like Senator Schatz; Senator Booker; Senator Feinstein, one of the  longest serving Democrats in the Senate; Senator Kaine, who was the  Vice Presidential nominee for the Democratic Party in 2016; Senator  Tester, again, who often finds himself in the middle of consequential,  bipartisan negotiations.   Yet, somehow, something has changed since 2017. Something has  changed, and most of these Democratic Senators now think that the  Senate rules must be destroyed so they can pass their massive power  grab. What could it be that has changed? What could it be? I don't  know. Maybe--maybe it is that Democrats have the most slender reed of  power with Joe Biden in the White House and a 50-50 Senate and a four- seat majority in the House.   I wish my Democratic colleagues understood that the shoe can pinch  when it is on the other foot.
