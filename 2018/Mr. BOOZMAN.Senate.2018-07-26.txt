 Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Marine  Corps Caucus, I rise to pay tribute to Lt. Col. Pete McAleer, who has  selflessly served our great country as a U.S. marine. Lieutenant  Colonel McAleer will retire on July 31, 2018, after a successful 24- year military career as an infantry officer.   Lieutenant Colonel McAleer's service was inspired by the example set  by his family. His grandfathers both served in WWII, and his father,  retired Marine Col. Rob McAleer, was a 30-year Marine infantry officer  who served in Vietnam and Desert Storm. As a military child, Lieutenant  Colonel McAleer learned firsthand what it meant to serve. Like most  military children, he endured numerous relocations, which included  Japan, Norway, and England, while experiencing the true meaning of  service and sacrifice. These challenges developed his personal  resilience and an undeniable sense of patriotism.   It was his experiences growing up that solidified his desire to serve  in the Marine Corps. Lieutenant Colonel McAleer was commissioned in  1994 upon graduating from the University of Notre Dame and was then  assigned to Company A, 1st Battalion, 4th executive officer for two  WESTPAC and CENTCOM area deployments. In each of his following  assignments, he not only excelled, but continued to pursue personal and  professional development, earning masters degrees from both the U.S.  Naval War College and the U.S. Army War College.   Throughout his career, Lieutenant Colonel McAleer served honorably in  numerous assignments that took him to seven States, the Nation's  Capital, and overseas, where he served in five combat deployments  including tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.   During his career, Lieutenant Colonel McAleer demonstrated what it  means to be a leader. A highly decorated marine, he earned several  service awards, including the Bronze Star, for his heroic service.   As a testament to Lieutenant Colonel McAleer's exemplary service, he  was selected to serve as the commandant of the Marine Corps' Senior  Fellow at the Center for a New American Security.   He was also chosen to represent the U.S. Marine Corps as a military  legislative fellow for Senator Judd Gregg R-NH. Following his  successful year on Capitol Hill, he served as the deputy director for  the Marine Senate Liaison Office.   As his final assignment in uniform, Lieutenant Colonel McAleer served  as a strategic policy adviser to the Chief of Naval Operations.   Lieutenant Colonel McAleer faithfully served his country. He was  motivated to join the Marines because of the example set by his father  and the challenge of earning the title of marine. He was encouraged to  continue his service because of the mission and the men and women he  served alongside.   Lieutenant Colonel McAleer, congratulations on your successful career  and well-deserved retirement. I join my colleagues in Congress and all  Americans as we express our appreciation for your service, acknowledge  your many accomplishments, and wish the very best for you, your wife,  Laura, and your daughter Paige in the future.                            ____________________
