 Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, this bill is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  While the language touts supporting access to family planning, in  reality, it is likely a $5 billion gift for Planned Parenthood and  other abortion-related providers.   Prior to the Trump administration's protect life rule, Planned  Parenthood received nearly $60 million per year in title X funds. The  Biden administration reversed this rule and has aggressively deployed  title X funds to abortion providers like Planned Parenthood.   Under this bill, Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers  would be allowed to use the funds to build clinics, and abortion  counseling referrals would be mandatory. The bill would also force  religious providers to violate their beliefs. Congress should not green  light family planning dollars at the expense of family destruction.   For those reasons, I object.
