 Mr. Speaker, as we enter the heart of hurricane season,  it is important to understand hurricane storm surge.  [[Page H7673]]    Storm surge is the abnormal rise in water caused by hurricanes and  the deadliest part of the storm. For large storms, mathematical models  can predict a storm surge up to 48 hours before landfall. However, a  48-hour window is not sufficient for emergency management to make  decisions on an evacuation order needed to save lives.   I recently met a young woman named Cindi-Ann Findley who has been  working on solutions to this problem as she completes her undergraduate  studies. With a National Science Foundation grant, Cindi-Ann is  spending the summer exploring the sensitivities that lead to errors in  forecasts by simulating previous storms using a detailed operational  model. She hopes to find the characteristics that cause the largest  storm surge errors.   Her work illustrates just one way that mathematics can be used to  approach real-world problems and save lives.                            ____________________
