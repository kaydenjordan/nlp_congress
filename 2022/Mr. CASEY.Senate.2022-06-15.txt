 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to executive session to  consider the following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 732 and 735;  that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without intervening  action or debate; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table; that any statements related to the nominations be  printed in the Record; and that the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action and the Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I have some remarks on the nominations.   As the Senator from Indiana noted, the two individuals talked about  are Timothy ``T.J.'' Baker and Mary Lu Jordan to serve on the Federal  Mine Safety and Health Review Commission. Mr. Baker and Ms. Jordan are  highly qualified nominees who were nominated last year.   Mr. Baker currently serves as the associate general counsel of the  United Mine Workers of America and previously worked for the Federal  Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, first as an attorney-advisor  in the Office of Administrative Law Judges in Pittsburgh and then as  attorney-advisor in the Office of the Commissioners in Washington, DC.  Mr. Baker is also the son of a coal miner.   Ms. Jordan was appointed as a Commissioner on the Federal Mine Safety  and Health Review Commission in 1994 and has served in that capacity  almost continuously since then. Her most recent term as Commissioner  ended in 2020, and she has since served as senior attorney-advisor at  the Commission.   Given their expertise and commitment to public service, both Mr.  Baker and Ms. Jordan would be assets to the Federal Mine Safety and  Health Review Commission. It is past due that the Senate confirm their  nominations. Confirming both would give Democrats a majority on the  Commission.   Mr. Baker and Ms. Jordan are among the excellent nominees who have  been put forward by the Biden-Harris administration. Nominees like Mr.  Baker and Ms. Jordan will help us represent our Nation's coal miners,  and I hope we can advance their nominations today.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have seven requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.
