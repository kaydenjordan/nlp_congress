 Madam Speaker, childcare is so very neglected--a neglect  that has been amplified by this pandemic. Without adequate care,  parents simply cannot go back to work. Always essential for economic  development, adequately funded, quality childcare is more than daycare,  more than babysitting. It should play a key role in educating the next  generation.   The National Association for the Education of Young Children has  estimated that without adequate Federal support, over 4 million  American children will lose their childcare this year.   In Texas, with Governor Abbott offering inadequate State support, and  temporarily, but recklessly, suspending facility safety precautions,  like taking temperatures, the lives of children and their families have  been endangered with coronavirus infections at more than 1,400  childcare facilities.   Our two-pronged legislative approach today cannot undo such  ineptness, but it does offer much-needed resources for both childcare  providers and parents in making one of their most important  investments. This is the first of many steps needed to build an early  learning system truly worthy of our youngest children.    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman.   Madam Speaker, for the past 3 years, it has been my good fortune to  sit next to Mr. Lewis on the dais of the Committee on Ways and Means.   His warmth, his humility, his lack of bitterness after all that he  endured was truly extraordinary. His decades of service touched so many  lives. With his multi-volume graphic novel, ``March,'' he found a way  to reach a younger audience with his enduring message of struggle,  hope, and love.   Reading it to my own grandchildren, they were hooked early when John  talked about the fact that, as a young boy, he preached to his  chickens--and that is how he became the great orator that we know him  as being. He noted that: They would never quite say amen.   The dedication in March reads, ``To the past and future children of  the movement.'' Not just this work, but his entire life's work was  dedicated to the past and future children of the movement. For all that  you have done, for all our children, John, we say ``amen.''   John knew that America could not call itself a democracy until  everyone could cast a ballot, and that the struggle for voting rights  was a struggle for democracy itself. He dedicated himself to completing  the promise of the Declaration of Independence as he exhorted the crowd  down the Mall here at the Lincoln Memorial at the March on Washington  to ``Get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and  hamlet of this Nation until true freedom comes, until the revolution of  1776 is complete.''   And, again, in 2015, as he annually commemorated that March across  the Edmund Pettus Bridge, John asked ``Get out there and push and pull  until we redeem the soul of America.''   John Lewis worked so tirelessly to get in ``good trouble.'' When the  LBJ Foundation from Austin awarded him with the Liberty & Justice For  All Award, I learned that he had experienced over 40 arrests, physical  attacks, and serious injuries. But then I had seen, sitting next to  him, some of the marks on his balding head of those very attacks.   Through it all, he maintained that ``good trouble'' was what America  really needed. There will never be a time when America can afford to  forget the legacy of John Lewis. He fought so long, so selflessly to  advance our democracy, and he called the right to vote ``sacred.''   Madam Speaker, we honor his tireless labor by picking up the baton  and voting. We honor his legacy when we vote and enable more of our  friends and neighbors to do the same. John Lewis now rests, but we  cannot. Inspired by his sacrifice, we must continue his struggle.   No one can ever replace him, but no one person must. There are so  many who share John Lewis' dream. And we will grow our numbers, and  when we do, we will overcome.                                time  2015
