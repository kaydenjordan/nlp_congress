 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am  not opposed.    Mr. Chair, I also rise in strong support of the Bergman- Correa amendment.   This amendment will push the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the  VA, to carry our large-scale studies into drugs like psilocybin, MDMA,  and others which have been designated as breakthrough therapies by the  Food and Drug Administration.   Why? It is because we owe it to our veterans.   Mr. Chair, what you have to do is listen to veterans' testimonies-- veterans who have the invisible scars from the wounds they brought back  from the battlefield--and their challenges, psychological challenges.  Psilocybin promises up to 80 percent success after one treatment of a  veteran's challenge, and, today, as the law stands, these veterans have  to go outside the country to get treatment.   That is no way, Mr. Chair, to treat our veterans.   Let's take care of business. Let's make sure the VA takes these tests  and studies and brings back data so that we can create a program that  takes care of our veterans.   Veterans have fought for our freedom. It is time that we continue and  step up to fulfill our moral obligation to take care of them, as well.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join us in voting ``yes'' on this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
