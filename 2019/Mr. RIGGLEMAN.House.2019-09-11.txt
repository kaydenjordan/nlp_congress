 Madam Speaker, 18 years ago, America experienced the  worst act of terrorism in its history. Nearly 3,000 people were killed,  with many others in emergency services and law enforcement suffering  long-lasting health complications, sometimes resulting in death.   September 11, 2001, a day none of us will ever forget, had a deep and  lasting impact on the lives of all Americans. I was one of the  thousands who answered the call to serve and to hunt down those  responsible.   When I woke on that tragic day, I was serving in the United States  Air Force as an intelligence officer at Mountain Home Air Force Base in  Idaho with the 366th Air Expeditionary Wing, 34th Bomb Squadron--the B- 1 bombers. I was and am a proud Mountain Home Gunfighter. Our squadron  deployed almost immediately as the on-call wing. By early October, I  and my brothers and sisters in arms were mission planning the first  bombing runs into Afghanistan.   I still remember the morning of September 11. Memories come to my  mind as vividly as if they were yesterday: buttoning the buttons on my  uniform when my wife yelled at me up the stairs that a plane had hit  the World Trade Center in New York; a phone call seconds later that I,  in no uncertain terms, needed to get my butt into the squadron to brief  my commander on the situation and start loading Conexes; working  through the night while the base was in lockdown and much of the  country was in a fog; trying to answer questions from my young  daughter, wife, and friends about what was happening.    You are seeing my daughter, here, as I came home from deployment.   My memories are not unique, and every American has a different  viewpoint on what happened that day. Some lost friends or family, and  the tragedy we as a nation felt that day should not be forgotten.   But the impact of those attacks was not limited to that day, and  history will write that heroic Americans responded with valor and  bravery.   One of the most heinous acts ever committed on American soil did not  bring us down but brought us together. In the words of former President  George W. Bush: ``One of the worst days in America's history saw some  of the bravest acts in Americans' history.''   Less than 24 hours after the first plane hit the towers in New York,  deployment orders came. I still remember that feeling, standing on the  tarmac and then watching from the plane as my three daughters, all  younger than 10 years old, waved small American flags from down below.  I was deployed on Active Duty and would be spending the next weeks  planning bombing runs on Afghanistan to respond to these attacks.   Our Armed Forces are asked to make sacrifices; leaving their families  is often one of them. But after 9/11, when so many Americans had  sacrificed so much more, my brothers and sisters in arms were willing  to make that sacrifice. Inspired by the heroism of so many  firefighters, first responders, law enforcement, and citizens who  answered the call, we knew that America would emerge stronger.   Eighteen years later, we remember the heroes of 9/11, honor their  sacrifice, and admire their patriotism. Their memories will last for us  forever because we will never forget what they gave us, heroic  Americans who answered the call.   I was proud to serve with heroes like General Seve Wilson, Bull,  Bullet, Eli, Scar, Jimbo, Rooster, Mongo, IROC, Stainless, Lost,  Krenkle, Frengle, Sergeant Lowery, Migo, Psycho, Sassy, Tank, Rachel,  Linda Vadnais, Atteberry, and so many more. From Ground Zero in New  York to the Pentagon and across the country, American heroes answered  the call, and we are forever in their debt.   God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
