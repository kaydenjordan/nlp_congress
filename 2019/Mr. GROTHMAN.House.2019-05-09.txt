 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the crisis at  our southern border.  [[Page H3668]]    Obviously, we have a big problem on the southern border. If you have  been paying attention to what is on TV, at the beginning of the year,  about 50,000 people were arriving here every month. We are now, we  believe, at 100,000 people illegally entering this country.   One of the reasons this is happening, it is not surprising that  people from other countries think the United States does not enforce  their immigration laws. Many local governments are sanctuary cities,  sanctuary counties, or even sanctuary States, sending the clear message  to people in other parts of the world: the United States does not  enforce their immigration laws.   Sadly, even in my home State of Wisconsin, the Governor of Wisconsin  pulled the Wisconsin Air National Guard off the border, sending the  message that a Governor of a State does not apparently believe we  should be spending money enforcing our immigration laws.   The chief executives of the biggest city in the country and the  biggest State in the country have both made it clear that they will  provide, or want to provide, free medical care to people who come here.   By the way, I should point out that, right now, at a time when so  many Americans have huge deductibles, they are almost better off being  here illegally and getting the free medical care than our citizens are.   In any event, it is not surprising that we are flooded with people  who want to come here.   Another evidence of that is this body's refusal to appropriate enough  money to build the wall. Now, in the last week--at least, it has been  put out there--we have the majority party's suggestion or guidance for  where we are going to spend money in the next budget.   Now, Madam Speaker, given the crisis at the border, you would think  the biggest increase in the next budget compared to the 2020 budget  would be at Homeland Security--but, no.   So the people back home understand, when we pass our annual  appropriations, when we fund the budget, we break it into 12 different  subcommittees, subcommittees like Agriculture, Rural Development, Food  and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies; subcommittees like  State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs; subcommittees like  Defense and the subcommittee in charge of protecting our southern  border, Homeland Security.   Of the 12 groups that this body is going to vote on, which  classification is getting the smallest increase in this budget?  Homeland Security. One more time, the Congress itself is sending the  message that we do not take our immigration laws seriously.   It is time for us to send the message to people abroad that they  should be taking our immigration laws seriously. After all, given the  complete irresponsibility from so many politicians up here, it doesn't  surprise me people think we don't take our immigration laws seriously.   What can we do?   Well, recently FAIR came out with a report in which they guessed that  maybe over half the people who are in this country illegally are  getting some sort of public benefit. When I went down to the border in  Arizona awhile back and talked to Customs people who went through  people's wallets and people's purses, they found evidence of people  receiving public benefits who were not citizens here.   I am glad our HUD Secretary is beginning to look into the, I believe,  large number of people here illegally taking advantage of low-income  housing.   I want to point out, there is nothing wrong with legal immigrants  coming here. Neither myself nor Donald Trump, who ran on this issue,  want to decrease the 700,000 people who are sworn in every year as  legal immigrants, and we do not want to decrease the 4 million people  who are here on legal work visas. As a matter of fact, we said, if need  be, we would even increase that.   But to have so many people come here illegally is, no question, a  huge problem. I would suggest to President Trump, because you can't  wait for Congress to do anything around here, that he send a message  that, when Secretary Carson finds people in low-income housing who are  here illegally, they should be deported.   I certainly have anecdotal evidence from back home that people who  are here illegally are benefiting from SNAP benefits; and people who  are, again, here illegally taking--not deporting everybody, but if they  are taking advantage of our public benefits, again, they should return  home and try to make a living in their home country or get benefits  available in their home country.   The next thing I would like to see happen, I know it is something  President Trump ran on--I think it is time he rings the bell--is ending  birthright citizenship. Birthright citizenship is something that can  cause somebody to become legal here whose parents are illegal.   We should not reward illegal behavior by having people come here  illegally and have a child in the country; not to mention, it is not  right to encourage pregnant people to just fly here and have a baby in  this country and wind up having their family stay here legally by that  way as well.   One thing that intrigues me is that apparently Canada is looking to  get rid of their birthright citizenship law, one of the few other  Western countries that has it. It would be very embarrassing if Justin  Trudeau's Canada gets rid of the antiquated birthright citizenship law  ahead of Donald Trump's United States.   In any event, I strongly encourage President Trump to counteract the  message being sent by so many other elected officials and make it clear  that our immigration laws are to be taken seriously.   Please, Mr. Trump, send the message. Congress is paralyzed. Stand up  not only to the people overtly discouraging and ignoring our  immigration laws, but stand up to the Chamber of Commerce lobby and say  that, in the future, we want our immigrants to be picked, merit-based  immigrants, not whoever decides to break the law.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
