 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 5, the  nonequality Equality Act.   This legislation is not about promoting equality but provides  preferential rights to some people at the expense of the rights of  others. This bill is a blatant attempt to normalize and promote laws  that are both unfair and dangerous to our society.   H.R. 5 circumvents the bipartisan Religious Freedom Restoration Act,  making it illegal to oppose abortion and forcing taxpayers to fund  abortion and healthcare professionals to perform abortions in violation  of their sincerely held beliefs.   H.R. 5 will also violate women's right to privacy and safety by  opening the door for predatory men to prey on them in the most  vulnerable of places: in shelters, changing rooms, and showers.   It will strip parental rights by permitting children to undergo life- altering sex changes without parental consent, which is nothing short  of child abuse.   It will undermine both individuals' and businesses' faith-based  convictions.   Today, I proudly stand in defense of our women, our children, and  people of faith by saying no to H.R. 5; no to biological males in  women's sports; no to biological males in women's shelters, locker  rooms, and showers; no to religious oppression of any kind; no to  taxpayer-funded abortion; and no to transgender medical treatments for  children, which is child abuse. Yes, child abuse. Transgender medical  treatments for children is child abuse.   God help us, have we lost our ever-loving minds? Just think, think  for a minute.   I ask my colleagues to consider the threats this bill poses to their  families, their communities, and join me in protecting and upholding  our Constitution by opposing this shameful legislation, H.R. 5, that  shows favoritism to some while trampling on the rights of others.                            ____________________
