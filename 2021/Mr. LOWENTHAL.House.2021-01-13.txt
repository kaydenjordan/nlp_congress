 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of impeaching  President Donald Trump for the second time. This is not an action I  take lightly, but an action I am compelled to take in order to uphold  my oath as a Member of Congress. President Trump is a threat to our  nation and in full public view violated his duties to the Constitution,  to our democracy, and to the American people.   For months, the president and his enablers lied about the election,  whipping up misplaced anger among his followers. He then encouraged his  followers to come to Washington for a ``wild'' rally to support  overthrowing the election results. At the rally, the president  continued to incite his followers, further encouraging their anger.  Then he pointed down Constitution Avenue and told his followers to  march to the U.S. Capitol and unleash their anger on Congress. They  did, and five people died.   Make no mistake, the president set the stage, invited the audience,  and lit the match that sparked the deadly insurrection at the Capitol.  Just as disturbing was his lack of response while Congress Members were  begging for him to help, while Capitol Police were being beaten and  killed, and while his followers hunted through the Capitol seeking to  do harm to Members of Congress and even his own Vice President.  President Trump has abrogated the responsibilities of his office and  violated his oath to the Constitution.   Every day he remains in office is another chance for him to foment  further violence. He must be removed now. The House must do its duty to  protect our nation from the president by impeaching him and the Senate  must act quickly to convict the president and remove him from office.
