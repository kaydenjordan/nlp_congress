 Mr. President, I came to the floor during the last part  of the remarks of the distinguished Democratic leader, and it just  reminded me of a headline I saw in this morning's newspaper that just,  to me, exemplifies how dishonest, sometimes, the way questions are  framed here when it comes to dealing with our financial  responsibilities. The headline in the Washington Post talked about  President Trump's proposal slashing Medicaid, like the Democrats have  criticized the House healthcare replacement bill slashing Medicaid even  though, as a factual matter, Medicaid would continue to grow year after  year after year.   As the distinguished Presiding Officer and I have previously  discussed, one question is, What is a responsible rate of Consumer  Price Index or inflation to deal with medical inflation so that when we  return Medicaid to the States, spending at let's say 2016 levels, what  is a responsible rate of continued growth to deal with medical  inflation so that the States are not left with an unsustainable burden?   But the idea that spending at current levels, plus an additional  cost-of-living index year after year after year, means that Medicaid  spending won't go up every year--next year it will be more than this  year. The following year it will be more than next year. So only in the  fevered imagination of, apparently, the headline writers at the  Washington Post and in some of our Democratic friends could that be  considered a cut. In the rest of the country, they would consider that  as Medicaid growing, not being cut.   It is true that one of the things the House did that I think is an  important reform of one of our principle entitlement provisions was to  put some sort of sustainable cap on the growth of spending on  entitlements, which perviously had been uncapped.   Some day there is going to be a day of reckoning in this country when  it comes to spending. We have $20 trillion in debt. We know now that  the Federal Reserve is loosening its hold on interest rates, that those  are creeping up, and one of the estimates is that if interest rates due  to improved economic performance were to reach historic norms, we would  soon be paying more for interest on the national debt than we would be  paying for defense spending. That is simply unsustainable, not to  mention the fact that we would then be essentially appropriating 30  percent of what the Federal Government spends and leaving 70 percent  untouched.   We can't get the country on a sustainable financial path just dealing  with 30 percent of what the Federal Government spends, and we need to  have a serious conversation, not a misleading characterization of the  problem. We need a serious conversation about the reality facing our  country and future generations because right now we are spending their  inheritance, so to speak. In other words, I consider it an act of  immorality for me to be spending money and forcing my children and  future generations to pay it back. That is just not fair to them, and  we need to come to grips with that sooner rather than later.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
