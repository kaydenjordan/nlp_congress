 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 543) recognizing Hong Kong's bilateral  relationship with the United States, condemning the interference of the  People's Republic of China in Hong Kong's affairs, and supporting the  people of Hong Kong's right to protest, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 543         Whereas the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992       (Public Law 102-383) states--        (1) ``[s]upport for democratization is a fundamental       principle of United States foreign policy'';        (2) ``the human rights of the people of Hong Kong are of       great importance to the United States and are directly       relevant to United States interests in Hong Kong [and] serve       as a basis for Hong Kong's continued economic prosperity'';       and        (3) ``Hong Kong must remain sufficiently autonomous from       the People's Republic of China to justify a different       treatment than accorded to the People's Republic of China       under United States law'';        Whereas the United States maintains substantial economic       and political interests in Hong Kong, with more than 1,200       United States firms operating in the Special Administrative       Region, due largely to Hong Kong's strong business       environment, predicated on respect for the rule of law and an       independent judiciary;        Whereas the United States supports Hong Kong's ``high       degree of autonomy'' promised by the Joint Declaration       between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain       and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the       Question of the Hong Kong (``Joint Declaration'' ) in       accordance with the ``One Country, Two Systems'' framework       through bilateral agreements, the promotion of trade and       investment, and the bolstering of educational, academic, and       cultural links;        Whereas the Department of State reported in its 2019 Hong       Kong Policy Act Report, dated March 21, 2019, that the       People's Republic of China has carried out a number of       actions inconsistent with China's commitments in the Basic       Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (``Basic       Law'') and the Joint Declaration, which have diminished Hong       Kong's high degree of autonomy;        Whereas China has increasingly constrained Hong Kong's       freedoms in violation of the ``One Country, Two Systems''       framework by, among other actions, supporting the restriction       of entry into Hong Kong for individuals critical of the       Communist Party of China, instructing to the Hong Kong       Government to refuse a United States extradition request in       May 2018, and abusing the national security rationale to       justify interference with matters related to Hong Kong       politics and governance;        Whereas on April 3, 2019, the Government of Hong Kong       introduced the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance       in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019       (commonly known as the ``extradition bill'') that would amend       the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance by expanding the existing       extradition arrangement to include mainland China, allowing       for the handover of any persons in the territory of Hong       Kong, residents and non-residents, as well as any materials       in their possession;        Whereas the Department of State issued a statement on June       9, 2019, warning that the lack of procedural protections in       the bill could negatively impact Hong Kong's longstanding       protections of human rights, fundamental freedoms, and       democratic values;        Whereas on June 9, 2019, as many as 1,000,000 people       protested against the bill, and on June 12, 2019, tens of       thousands staged a protest near the Legislative Council       building to express opposition to the bill;        Whereas on June 12, 2019, the Government of Hong Kong took       advantage of the acts of a small group of protesters to       classify the largely peaceful protest as an unlawful assembly       and a ``riot'', a charge that can result in a prison sentence       of up to 10 years for those who were arrested;        Whereas the police's excessive use of force on June 12,       2019, as seen in video footage, to disperse the protestors,       including the use of tear gas, bean bag rounds, rubber       bullets, batons, and pepper spray, caused severe injuries to       protesters;        Whereas the excessive use of force fueled tensions and       contributed to the worsening of violence;        Whereas on June 16, 2019, as many as 2,000,000 people       peacefully gathered in the Admiralty district, which is       likely the largest protest in Hong Kong's history;        Whereas on July 21, 2019, a group alleged to be linked to       organized crime violently attacked protestors, innocent       bystanders, and journalists with sticks and metal bars in       Yuen Long, which resulted in the hospitalization of forty-      five people, with one person in critical condition;        Whereas the Hong Kong Police Force have been slow to take       meaningful action against those who attacked the protestors       on July 21, 2019, suggesting the police may be complicit in       their actions;        Whereas the protestors' demands included--        (1) the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill;        (2) the implementation of universal suffrage in the       election of the Chief Executive and all members the       Legislative Council;        (3) the establishment of an independent commission to       investigate police conduct during the protests;        (4) the declassification of the protests as a riots; and        (5) the dropping of all charges against persons who       participated in any protests;        Whereas on July 27, 2019, nine people were injured when       police fired rubber bullets at demonstrators in Yuen Long who       were protesting the July 21 violent attacks against       protestors and the lack of a police response to them;        Whereas on July 29, 2019, China's spokesman for the State       Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office issued a       statement referring to the protesters as ``radical elements       committing evil and criminal acts'';        Whereas on July 30, 2019, China's Foreign Ministry falsely       claimed that the pro-democracy protests are the ``work of the       United States'', alleging that American officials have       interfered in Hong Kong's internal affairs;        Whereas the Chinese Communist Party has called the protests       ``absolutely intolerable'', ``terrorism'', and ``terror       atrocities'', raising fears that China may use the People's       Liberation Army or the People's Armed Police to violently       suppress the protestors;        Whereas on August 5, 2019, teachers, aviation workers,       finance employees, and civil servants went on strike across       seven districts, the largest citywide strike in decades,       which evolved into a wave of demonstrations  [[Page H8117]]       and resulted in the police firing approximately 800 tear gas       rounds to clear the protestors, almost as many as were used       in the previous 8 weeks combined;        Whereas on August 5, 2019, a mob violently attacked       demonstrators with sticks and metal bars in North Point after       the demonstrators were dispersed by police from the Admiralty       district, and again the police did not respond to the ambush;        Whereas on August 6, 2019, a Chinese Communist Party       official threatened the demonstrators by stating, ``those who       play with fire will perish by it'', and ``as for their [the       demonstrators'] punishment, it's only a matter of time'';        Whereas on August 7, 2019, Chinese state media began       publishing articles accusing the Political Counselor to the       United States Consulate General in Hong Kong of being ``a       black hand creating chaos in Hong Kong'', as well as publicly       identifying family members of the Consulate General staff;        Whereas on August 11, 2019, Hong Kong police beat fleeing       protesters with batons and fired pepper ball rounds at them       at close range;        Whereas on August 11, 2019, it was reported that a young       woman, allegedly a medic, who has since become a symbol for       the protest movement, sustained a serious eye injury from a       bean-bag round after the police fired a projectile into the       crowd;        Whereas on August 18, 2019, as many as 1,700,000 Hong Kong       people attended a peaceful rally against police brutality;        Whereas on August 31, 2019, Hong Kong Police Force Special       Tactical Squad officers beat with batons protesters and train       passengers at Prince Edward station; and        Whereas on September 4, 2019, Hong Kong Chief Executive       Carrie Lam announced the Government would withdraw the       extradition bill from the Legislative Council's agenda when       it reconvenes in October 2019: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls on the Government of Hong Kong to begin       negotiations to address the demonstrators' remaining demands,       which include--        (A) the formal withdrawal of the bill from the Hong Kong       Legislative Council;        (B) the implementation of universal suffrage;        (C) the establishment of an independent investigation into       police conduct during the protests;        (D) the declassification of the protest as a riot; and        (E) the dropping of all charges against persons arrested       during the protests;        (2) condemns--        (A) the Hong Kong police's use of force against the       demonstrators in ways that are inconsistent with       international standards for the use of such equipment and in       violation of citizens' rights to freedom of expression and       peaceful assembly; and        (B) the Hong Kong Government for tolerating the use of       violent force against protesters by police;        (3) calls on the Administration to review the       appropriateness of sales by United States firms of munitions       and crowd-control equipment to Hong Kong, to ensure that they       are not used to repress peaceful protests;        (4) condemns efforts by the Hong Kong and Chinese       Governments to characterize the protests as ``riots'' and to       falsely accuse the United States of orchestrating political       instability that they alone created;        (5) shares the concerns of the people of Hong Kong that the       Hong Kong Government's proposed amendments to the Fugitive       Offenders Ordinance, if adopted, would negatively impact the       territory's long-standing protections of human rights,       fundamental freedoms, and democratic values as enshrined in       the Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration;        (6) recognizes that the ``One Country, Two Systems''       framework and the Basic Law require that Hong Kong is       afforded a high degree of autonomy with respect to economic       and trade matters and the rule of law;        (7) condemns Chinese state media for targeting staff and       family members of the United States Consulate General in Hong       Kong;        (8) calls on the Government of Hong Kong and all       governments--        (A) to protect the rights of freedom of expression and       peaceful assembly;        (B) to condemn all acts of violence against those seeking       to further their democratic rights; and        (C) to refrain from the use of violence; and        (9) calls on the Government of Hong Kong and the Government       of China to abide by the provisions of the Joint Declaration       and the Basic Law.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H. Res. 543.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The world is watching Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is watching the floor  of the House of Representatives. People by the tens of thousands in  Hong Kong have demonstrated in favor of bills we are considering here  today. In doing so, they have taken great risk to themselves and showed  tremendous courage. The least we could do is pass these bills.   I rise today to speak in favor of these bills on Hong Kong. I am  proud to cosponsor all of the legislation under consideration dealing  with Hong Kong.   I want to first focus on a resolution I introduced with our  colleagues, Mrs. Wagner; Mr. Connolly; and Mr. Yoho, the ranking member  of the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, my  partner on the Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation Subcommittee.   This resolution demonstrates that the so-called extradition bill is  an infringement on the rights of the people of Hong Kong, including  their right to a high degree of autonomy, autonomy that was granted to  Hong Kong when that city was returned to the control of Beijing.   This resolution also establishes that the House of Representatives  stands with Hong Kong protestors and supports their five major demands.  These demands are:   Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill;   Universal suffrage in the election of the chief executive and all  members of the Legislative Council;   The establishment of an independent commission to investigate the  police's excessive use of force against the protestors;   The changing of the classification so these protests are not  classified as riots and the participants are not classified as rioters;  and, finally,   Having all charges against the people who participate in these  protests dropped.   Many of us in Congress and around the United States have been  inspired by the people of Hong Kong standing up for their fundamental  rights over the last few months. One of the protests brought nearly 25  percent of the entire population of Hong Kong into the streets. That is  simply unprecedented.   It would behoove Beijing to heed the protestors' demands. Sadly,  instead of recognizing their own role in causing these protests, the  Chinese Communist Party has tried to characterize the demonstrations as  the handiwork of the United States. We categorically reject this  assertion.   These protests were motivated, first and foremost, in reaction to the  effort by the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist  Party to interfere in the autonomy that was promised to the people of  Hong Kong. These protests were motivated by the policies of Beijing and  the Hong Kong government that have increasingly reduced the city's high  degree of autonomy.   The state-run media has even gone so far as to accuse a particular  State Department official by name of orchestrating the protests. That  is an insult to the people of Hong Kong, who speak for themselves and  act for themselves. Moreover, it has put that diplomat and her family  in danger. This is simply unacceptable behavior, and the Stand with  Hong Kong Resolution criticizes this egregious action by the Chinese  Government.   Finally, let me reiterate my support for the other complementary  bills that we are considering today on Hong Kong.   The first is the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019,  which was introduced by our colleague Mr. Smith, who will be managing  time on the other side. This legislation will amend the Hong Kong  Policy Act of 1992 to account for the changes that have taken place  over the last 25 years.   The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act also conveys to Beijing  that it cannot undermine the city's freedom while expecting America to  still give that city preferential trade arrangements.   I am also a strong supporter of Congressman Jim McGovern's PROTECT  Hong Kong Act, which would restrict U.S. firms' ability to sell the  Hong Kong police weapons to use against protestors.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H8118]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume, and I will close.   Mr. Speaker, several years ago, I joined the then chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Royce, in visiting Hong Kong. We had a  chance to spend a lot of time with both young and more experienced  leaders fighting for democracy and autonomy for Hong Kong. And this  has, in fact, been the policy of the United States since the 1992 Hong  Kong Policy Act, which establishes our support for democratization as a  fundamental principle of U.S. foreign policy.   In recent days, we have seen demonstrators in Hong Kong asking the  U.S. Congress to pass the three pieces of legislation that are before  us. The protestors want to know if our support for democracy is merely  rhetorical or if we are willing to take action to defend our  principles.   By passing these three bills today, we will affirm that the U.S.  Congress supports democracy, human rights, and appropriate autonomy for  Hong Kong.   Mr. Speaker, as to all three bills, I want to thank Speaker Pelosi  and Chairman Engel and many other colleagues for their leadership on  this issue.   Mr. Speaker, turning to the specifics of H. Res. 543, the specific  matter before us at this moment, I want to thank my Foreign Affairs  Committee colleagues for helping to introduce this measure, including  Mrs. Wagner, Mr. Connolly, and Mr. Yoho, who spoke just a few minutes  ago.   H. Res. 543 recognizes our country's strong relationship with the  people of Hong Kong. It is an important measure of solidarity at a time  when protesters are facing police brutality and China is trying to take  away the autonomy that it promised.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3289) to amend the Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3289         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

It is the policy of the United States--        (1) to reaffirm the principles and objectives set forth in       the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law       102-383), namely that--        (A) the United States has ``a strong interest in the       continued vitality, prosperity, and stability of Hong Kong'';        (B) ``[s]upport for democratization is a fundamental       principle of United States foreign policy'' and therefore       ``naturally applies to United States policy toward Hong       Kong'';        (C) ``the human rights of the people of Hong Kong are of       great importance to the United States and are directly       relevant to United States interests in Hong Kong [and] serve       as a basis for Hong Kong's continued economic prosperity'';       and        (D) Hong Kong must remain sufficiently autonomous from the       People's Republic of China to ``justify treatment under a       particular law of the United States, or any provision       thereof, different from that accorded the People's Republic       of China'';        (2) to support the high degree of autonomy and fundamental       rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, as enumerated       by--        (A) the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United       Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the       Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question       of Hong Kong, done at Beijing December 19, 1984 (referred to       in this Act as the ``Joint Declaration'');        (B) the International Covenant on Civil and Political       Rights, done at New York December 19, 1966; and  [[Page H8120]]         (C) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, done at       Paris December 10, 1948.

SEC. 9. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 3289.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking Mr. Smith for authoring the  measure before us.   The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is a bill to advance our  support for the people of Hong Kong. This bill updates the longstanding  U.S. policy on Hong Kong so as to reflect what is happening on the  ground today.   The foundation of our relationship with Hong Kong was laid back in  1992 when Congress passed the Hong Kong Policy Act. That is where we  got the one country, two systems approach that paved the way for our  strong partnership with Hong Kong.   But we are watching now the Chinese Communist Party trying to break  down that system, trying to strip Hong Kong's autonomy and bring it  under full control of the government of the mainland. This has  motivated millions of Hong Kongers to take to the streets and protest  in defense of their rights. To support them, we need to make sure that  our policy is brought up to date so it can match the challenges of the  U.S.-Hong Kong relationship today.   The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act does just that. It makes  clear that the United States will stand up for Hong Kong's autonomy and  democratic aspirations of its people. It beefs up reporting so that we  can track any efforts by China to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs and  to use Hong Kong to avoid U.S. export controls. It slaps sanctions on  anyone responsible for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy or violating  Hong Kongers' humans rights.   This bill sends a strong message to China that the United States  stands with the people of Hong Kong.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                    Washington, DC, October 8, 2019.      Hon. Elliot Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 3289, the       Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019. In order to       permit the H.R. 3289 to proceed expeditiously to the House       Floor, I agree to forgo formal consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of H.R. 3289 in light of the       changes that have been made to the bill as introduced, which       focuses the bill on matters within the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs. The Committee also does so with       our mutual understanding that, by foregoing formal       consideration of H.R. 3289 at this time, we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that our Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward with regard to any matters in the       Committee's jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation that involves the Committee's       jurisdiction and request your support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 3289.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, October 10, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       3289, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019. I       appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Financial Services under       House Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on       H.R. 3289 to expedite floor consideration. I further       acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with respect       to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I also acknowledge that your Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward, and will support the appointment       of Committee on Financial Services conferees during any       House-Senate conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, October 10, 2019.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 3289, the ``Hong Kong Human       Rights and Democracy Act of 2019'' that fall within our Rule       X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on those       provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to your       including them in the bill for consideration on the House       floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to forgo       action on H.R. 3289, with the understanding that we do not       thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have  [[Page H8123]]       worked regarding this matter and others between our       committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, October 10, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       3289, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019. I       appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.R.       3289 to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge       that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       Committee on the Judiciary conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I join with the gentleman from New Jersey  in praising the staff members who helped create these bills, not only  the one under consideration, but the other two that deal with Hong  Kong.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), a great champion for human rights.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers on this side,  so I yield myself such time as I may consume for the purpose of  closing.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Smith for introducing this legislation.   Thirty years since Tiananmen Square and Chinese authorities are still  turning to violence and intimidation to crush dissent and attack basic  freedoms. With this important legislation, we send a clear signal that  the United States stands with the people of Hong Kong.   Mr. Speaker, I hope all Members will join me in supporting the  passage of this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4270) to prohibit commercial exports of certain nonlethal  crowd control items and defense articles and services to the Hong Kong  Disciplined Services, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4270         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Placing Restrictions on       Teargas Exports and Crowd Control Technology to Hong Kong       Act'' or the ``PROTECT Hong Kong Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,       along with human rights organizations, has called for an       investigation of the use of crowd control tactics used in       Hong Kong which fall short of international standards,       including the United Nations Code of Conduct for Law       Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use of       Force and Firearms for Law Enforcement Officials.        (2) United States companies have reportedly provided the       Hong Kong Police Force with munitions and non-lethal crowd       control equipment that were reportedly used by the police.        (3) Hong Kong citizens and the international community have       called for changes to the Hong Kong Police's crowd control       tactics and these requests have gone unheeded by the Hong       Kong Special Administrative Region Government.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States--        (1) to restrict the export of security assistance and crime       control and detection instruments and equipment to any       government that engages in a consistent pattern of gross       violations of internationally recognized human rights,       consistent with the requirements of section 502B(a) of the       Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2304(a)); and        (2) to use export controls on crime control and detection       instruments and equipment to deter the development of a       consistent pattern of human rights abuses, distance the       United States from such abuses, and avoid contributing to       civil disorder in a country or region, in accordance with       section 742.7(b) of part 774 of subtitle B of title 15, Code       of Federal Regulations.

SEC. 5. REPORT ON COVERED DEFENSE ARTICLES AND SERVICES AND                     COVERED MUNITIONS ITEMS EXPORTED TO THE HONG                     KONG POLICE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on H.R. 4270.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), Speaker of the House, a woman who has  dedicated decades of her life to the fight for human rights.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel), the chair of the full Foreign Affairs Committee, a  stalwart supporter of human rights.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   The people of Hong Kong have the right to peaceably assemble without  fear of violence. They need to know that their friends in the United  States are not providing tools of the violent repression being used  against them.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 4270, and I urge all  Members of the House to do likewise. I yield back the balance of my  time.
