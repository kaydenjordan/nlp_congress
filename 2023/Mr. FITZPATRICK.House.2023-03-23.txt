 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in favor of my amendment,  designated as amendment No. 8 to H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights  Act.   Madam Chair, we have a responsibility to be mindful of the cost and  implementation of this bill on our schools, parents, and communities.   My amendment would require the GAO to report on the impact of this  legislation and provide peace of mind to taxpayers, educators, and  families alike.   Our priority must be to set our children up for success. That means  giving parents the transparency and voice they deserve in their child's  education.   It also means making the Federal Government answerable to the  potential costs of this bill on State and local educational agencies  and individual schools throughout our Nation.   We have made a commitment to our constituents to demand more  accountability from their government over the use of their taxpayer  dollars, as well as to safeguard a better future for the next  generation of Americans. My amendment would guarantee that we keep that  promise.   Madam Chair, I urge the amendment's adoption, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
