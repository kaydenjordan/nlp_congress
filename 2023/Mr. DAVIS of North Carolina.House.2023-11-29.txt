 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  the grand opening and dedication of the youth center at the First  Baptist Church of Weldon, North Carolina.   Faced with determining the best use of the church's parsonage, Pastor  T.J. Walker and church leaders, who could have done many things with  it, decided to renovate the parsonage and turn it into a youth center.  The youth center includes game, pool, reading, and study rooms.   The First Baptist Church of Weldon realizes that children in small  rural communities need opportunities. The youth center will be a safe  haven for young minds, a place for them to flourish and to prepare them  to live the American Dream.   Indeed, the First Baptist Church of Weldon has demonstrated through  their actions that we must train up children the way they should go so  they don't depart.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and  our co-chairs for leading this Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of eastern North Carolina to address my  highest legislative priority: improving access to healthcare in rural  America.   In honor of National Rural Health month, I join my colleagues here to  speak about how we can fund commonsense bipartisan solutions to the  most pressing challenges facing our healthcare system.   Since taking office in January, healthcare has been my number one  legislative priority, having led, co-led, or cosponsored more than 60  bills in this space.   As we are here today, the people of eastern North Carolina are  hurting, and at the root of this pain is the lack of access to  healthcare.   To tackle these health disparities, I joined two colleagues in  restarting the State Medicaid Expansion Caucus to demonstrate the  overwhelming public support for basic access to healthcare.   After more than a decade of waiting, or in some cases dying, over  95,000 eastern North Carolinians will gain access to lifesaving  healthcare starting this Friday, December 1.   As co-chair of the State Medicare Expansion Caucus, I will continue  leading the charge in Congress to expand Medicaid across the country.   Beyond Medicaid expansion, I have championed the cause of rural  hospitals. In the past decade, four rural hospitals in eastern North  Carolina stopped operations, creating significant barriers to  lifesaving medical care.   Martin General is the most recent example of suspending operations in  the East.   While we have limited tools at our disposal, especially in  communities where the payer mix skews toward Medicare and Medicaid, the  Rural Emergency Hospital Designation Authority is a critical part of  the solution.   As eastern North Carolinians grapple with limited access to care, the  opioid epidemic continues to plague the region.   To combat this crisis, I introduced bipartisan legislation with  Congressman   John Rutherford to stem the flow of counterfeit  substances, including fentanyl, that have flooded the drug market.   H.R. 4988, the Modern Authentication of Pharmaceuticals Act, will  come down hard on counterfeit controlled substances by requiring on- dose identifiers to guarantee the legitimacy of pharmaceuticals. I urge  my colleagues to support this legislation and put a dent in the  fentanyl crisis.   While eastern North Carolinians and Americans across the country  suffer from opioid addiction, patients recovering from injuries face  their own barriers to treatment.   To ensure our most vulnerable patients get the care they require and  deserve, I will soon introduce legislation to cut red tape for physical  and occupational therapists, streamlining the delivery of care for  patients recovering from debilitating injuries.                                time  1615    If passed, the legislation would ease the burdensome plan of care  requirements that currently prevent payment for physical therapy  services until the therapy provider receives a physician-signed plan of  care within 30 days of a first evaluation. No patient should ever have  to wait unnecessarily for vital healthcare services, including  outpatient services.   As a member of the Bipartisan Rural Health Caucus, you can count on  me to champion the causes of patients, healthcare workers, and  providers alike.   We all have a responsibility in the greatest Nation on Earth to  deliver a standard of healthcare befitting this greatness.
