 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this en bloc  amendment which includes two of my amendments.   The USDA Office of Tribal Relations serves as the vital, single point  of contact for our rural communities as they work through what is  available for them. As we know, our Tribal communities are rural, and  they must have access to the USDA Office of Tribal Relations.   My amendment No. 4 would restore funding levels for the USDA Office  of Tribal Relations. Separately, my amendment No. 25 would increase  funding to USDA Rural Development by $7 million to use these funds to  improve its oversight of the Section 515 loan program for Rural Rental  Housing.   Outrageously, in my district, three of these properties have  experienced serious management and maintenance issues. The city of  Espanola even condemned a property recently. This has left residents in  unsafe conditions. USDA needs the necessary research to make sure its  properties are livable.   Mr. Chair, while I am in favor of this en bloc, I must state again my  opposition to the appropriations bill itself. I previously stood on  this floor in opposition to the severe cuts to our rural communities.  We must prioritize our rural communities, not cut them to 2007 levels.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment, but I am opposed to the  bill itself.
