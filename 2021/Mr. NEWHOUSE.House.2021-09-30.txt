 Madam Speaker, this week we learned that either  President Biden ignored the advice of his top military advisers and  lied to shift the blame for his disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal or  that those advisers lied to Congress under oath.   General McKenzie and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General  Milley both informed the Senate and House Armed Services Committees  that they recommended to President Biden that we keep 2,500 troops in  Afghanistan. Yet President Biden has adamantly claimed that he never  received such advice.   Americans have been abandoned, left to the mercy of a terrorist  regime that wants to destroy Western culture and institutionalize  widespread and systemic gender apartheid.   Our military weapons and equipment have been turned over to our  adversaries for their use against us.   And our President continues to negotiate with terrorists after our  servicemen and -women have been murdered.   Every last American must make it home. Anything less is inexcusable  and a dereliction of his sworn oath.   The President's lack of leadership is not only failing us abroad, but  it is also threatening our safety here at home. Just this year more  than 1.3 million people have illegally crossed our border, including  known terrorists.   An open southern border threatens our national security and the  safety of all Americans, and I hope we can all agree that we must do  something to stop this disturbing trend.   The President has a duty to act. Our Federal Government must enforce  our  [[Page H5559]]  Nation's immigration laws, reimplement successful policies from the  Trump administration, and commit further support for our Border Patrol  agents and our Customs enforcement officers.   That is why I signed on to a resolution calling for the President to  fully enforce our immigration laws in light of the current surge at the  border and the ongoing self-created border crisis.   Lastly, the President and his far-left Democrats are racking up debt  that Americans cannot afford, exacerbating the current inflationary  crisis that we are facing.   The proposed $4.3 trillion tax-and-spending spree is a continuation  of the Biden administration's reckless policies that have created an  unstable outlook for our economy, for our Nation's future, and for the  next generation of Americans.   Not only does this package unravel the progress we have made to  encourage work and raise wages, but it increases the national debt by  up to $17 trillion, putting our national security further at risk.   The Speaker and the far left are wildly spending tax dollars on their  socialist priorities, while increasing taxes on small businesses, on  family farms, and by raising the corporate tax to a rate higher than  Canada, higher than Italy, higher than the U.K., and even higher than  Communist China, which we know will directly hurt job growth and wage  growth for men and women across our communities.   Our economy is already running at the highest rate of inflation in 13  years. To recklessly increase our spending is fiscally irresponsible  and downright dangerous. As Senator Manchin even said, it is truly the  definition of fiscal insanity.   Madam Speaker, it is clear to me, just as I know it is clear to my  constituents, the President, time and time again, is failing to display  the leadership America needs and deserves. He must uphold the promises  he made to the American people, and I call on him, I ask him to put an  end to the era of crisis that we are now under.                       National Hispanic Heritage Month     Madam Speaker, today I rise in celebration of National  Hispanic Heritage Month and the histories, cultures, and contributions  of Latino and Hispanic Americans throughout the United States.   Growing up in Sunnyside, Washington, I have witnessed firsthand how  Hispanic Americans contribute to our communities through  entrepreneurship, military service, and cultural diversity. They are  our friends, our family, our neighbors, and our coworkers. They are  small-business owners, doctors, police officers, and soldiers.   In central Washington and across the country, we are proud of our  Hispanic friends and neighbors who prove that the American Dream is  alive and well. Because of them, we are a stronger, more diverse,  prosperous society.   Today I ask my colleagues, join me in honoring our Hispanic-American  neighbors and in recognizing National Hispanic Heritage Month.    Madam Speaker, today, of all days, amidst the ongoing  flurry of dysfunction, Democrat leader Chuck Schumer is inserting a  vote to confirm Tracy Stone-Manning as director of the Bureau of Land  Management through the United States Senate, hidden from the view and  the attention of local communities.   For months, my Western Caucus colleagues and I have been pleading  with our Senate colleagues to listen to the voices of those who have  spoken up of Ms. Stone-Manning's radical views, her violations of  several Federal laws, and her collusion with ecoterrorists.   Ms. Stone-Manning is simply, clearly, and patently unfit to hold this  office. Even several Obama administration officials, including his BLM  director, agree.   Let me be clear, a vote for Tracy Stone-Manning is a vote against  farmers, ranchers, our public land users, and our rural communities  throughout the West.   This is a shameful display of hyperpartisanship. The Senate should  reject her nomination and recognize that rural America deserves better.                            ____________________
