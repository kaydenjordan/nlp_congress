 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair for  yielding and for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, we are once again getting big things done for everyday  Americans.   We passed the American Rescue Plan, saved the economy, put shots in  arms, money in pockets, and kids back in school.   We passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to fix our  crumbling infrastructure and create millions of good-paying jobs.   We passed gun safety legislation for the first time in 30 years that  will save lives.   We passed the CHIPS and Science Act that will bring back domestic  manufacturing jobs to the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Inflation  Reduction Act, another transformative bill brought to you by your  friendly neighborhood Democratic Party.   The Inflation Reduction Act will lower energy costs; confront the  climate crisis with the fierce urgency of now; set our planet forward  on a sustainable trajectory; lower healthcare costs by strengthening  the Affordable Healthcare Act, as well as reducing the deficit by $300  billion, and giving Medicare the ability to use its bulk-price  purchasing power to drive down the high cost of lifesaving prescription  drugs.   It is a big F-ing deal.   The Inflation Reduction Act is going to dramatically improve the  lives of everyday Americans. We are putting people over politics.  Fighting to lower costs for safer communities and better paying jobs.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Republicans, will  oppose this groundbreaking legislation. They would rather defend Donald  Trump than defend the American people.   Vote ``yes'' on the Inflation Reduction Act so we can continue to put  people over politics.
