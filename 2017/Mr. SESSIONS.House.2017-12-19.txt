 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 667 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H.

All points of order against the       conference report and against its consideration are waived.       The conference report shall be considered as read.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1  hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), my dear friend, who is the ranking member of the Rules  Committee, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), my dear friend, who is the ranking member of the Rules  Committee, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the  underlying legislation.   This rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3312, the Systemic Risk  Designation Improvement Act of 2017; and the conference report  accompanying H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and JOBS Act.   Mr. Speaker, this rule, and specifically the underlying conference  report, is the reflection of a bicameral agreement between the United  States House of Representatives and the United States Senate, whereby  we took some of the best ideas from across not only our conference, but  this country, and from our respective ideas to make a tax bill that  would combine them for the best interests of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that what we are doing here today is  that the Republican Party is relying upon the greatest system ever  invented: the free enterprise system.   The free enterprise system has brought the United States of America  not only the greatest economic opportunities in the world, but it is a  system of rule of law. It is a system of a Tax Code. It is a system of  ideas that has made America the envy of the world.   Mr. Speaker, I also get politically what is happening. We are taking  what the Democratic Party and President Obama did to raise taxes by $1  trillion, the largest tax increase in the history of the United States,  and we are trashing that today.   We are saying that the production that it made of 1.2 percent over 8  years is unacceptable to the United States of America. It was  unacceptable then, and we will not allow that to be the gauge that we  will measure our success in the future.   Secondly, we are also going to deal properly and fairly with the  Affordable Care Act, a law that placed extensive burdens not only on  people who did not want the healthcare bill that was placed forward,  but placed a tremendous cost on the middle class of this country and  the American people.                                time  1030    What we are doing today is bold. We are going to make the big deal  the big deal the American people want and need: a stronger, brighter  economic future.   It is a progrowth bill that will overhaul our Tax Code and unleash  our free enterprise system. It lowers tax rates on businesses of every  size so job creators can focus on hiring workers, increasing paychecks  and growth.   Growth and competition are the keys to an expanding economy. More  jobs and increased wages in my home of Dallas, Texas, have allowed  Texas to lead the Nation not only in job creation, but to make us the  envy of the world. We are now going to do that for the entire United  States and help make back home for every Member of Congress competitive  in the world market.   With the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world, the  United States today has a broken Tax Code that has forced businesses to  not only move their jobs and research overseas; it has forced us to be  able to strand billions of dollars of economic advantage that should be  in the United States.   That changes today. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will stop and reverse  that trend. It will encourage American companies to bring their jobs  and their operations back to the United States by lowering corporate  tax rates to be competitive anywhere in the world at 21 percent and  encourages U.S. businesses to bring their foreign earnings home,  unleashing trillions of dollars in our economy. That is the future that  the Republican Party wants for the United States of America and the  free enterprise system.   The conference report also simplifies tax filing. It eliminates  costly special interest tax breaks. It protects the abilities of small  businesses to write off interest on loans and offers a first-ever 20  percent tax deduction to businesses organized as S corps, partnerships,  LLCs, and sole proprietorships. This will be a boom not only for the  stock market, which we have seen since the day after the election, but  we have seen a boom on Main Street as job creators and new small  businesses are seeking to reinvest not only in their business and in  their community, but for the opportunity to benefit workers in the  United States of America.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a direct and immediate boost for middle- income Americans who have been struggling--struggling for 8, now, 9  years--to get a handle on not only their ability to work with a broken  tax system, but the ability to work with their own local businesses to  make sure that their city succeeds, also.   It reduces the tax rate for low-income and middle-income Americans.  It increases and extends the child tax credit to more families and,  roughly, doubles the standard deduction. With this piece of legislation  today, legislation for middle-income families will allow them to be a  part of an economic growth model for years to come.   We are proud of what we are doing and delighted that we offer this  not only to the United States House of Representatives today, but to  the American people to see the Republican answer for economic growth  and development vitality for the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), who serves on the Financial  Services Committee. Congressman Luetkemeyer, from St. Elizabeth, will  talk about a piece of this bill that is from the Financial Services  Committee.  [[Page H10192]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, by the way, the gentlewoman would want to  state that we are not taking this away. There will be a 1-year  transition. So, I am sorry, but it will not be Ebenezer Scrooge at  Christmas. It will be the bright lights of a big future that lies ahead  for us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).   Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Sessions  for his leadership and for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we are about to make history this week by delivering a  tax cut to families at every income level.   The math clearly shows that the average family of four, making the  country's median income of $73,000, will receive a $2,000 tax cut.   Yet many of my friends on the other side of the aisle continue to say  this bill is going to raise taxes on millions of middle class families.  That is just not true, unless you are referring to 2025, when these tax  cuts expire and we go back to the status quo.   Why is there an expiration date?   Because many of the very same people, using this as a talking point  against this bill, are the reason they sunset. If we could get 60 votes  in the Senate, requiring just a few of my friends on the other side of  the aisle to work with us, we could make this tax cut for middle class  families permanent right now. They have chosen not to work with us.   I will be giving my friends on the other side of the aisle another  chance to support tax cuts for hardworking families in their district.  I will be introducing a bill to make the individual tax cuts permanent.   I am not sure there is anyone who truly believes that a future  Congress would let them expire, given the fact that we have extended  the Bush tax cuts in the past.   Nonetheless, I am introducing this bill to ensure these tax cuts will  be in place for middle class families this year, and to make sure they  are here to stay.   Mr. Speaker, I hope each and every one of my colleagues will sign on  as a cosponsor.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to, if I could, advise the  gentlewoman that, to balance out the time, I am going to allow her to  have the next couple of speakers so that we can equal the time.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.  [[Page H10195]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Barton).   (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Lawrenceville, Georgia (Mr. Woodall), the Rules Committee designee to  the Budget Committee and the gentleman who sits with esteem on the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to advise the gentlewoman  that we are through with our speakers, that I will be closing, so I ask  that she go ahead and consume her time.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York, the ranking  member of the Rules Committee, and really each of the members of the  Rules Committee for their diligence in working yesterday for a long  period of time.   As the Rules Committee met last night, not only to consider this, but  really to offer full and open debate, an opportunity was given for the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) to come and speak representing  the Democratic Party; the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), to come  and represent the Ways and Means Committee; and the distinguished  gentleman from The Woodlands, Texas (Mr. Brady), the chairman of the  Ways and Means Committee, to come and thoughtfully articulate not only  the ideas behind this bill but what we are going to do.                                time  1130    Mr. Speaker, it is true that what we are doing is taking what was  done by President Obama and a Democratic majority in the House and the  Senate that raised taxes a trillion dollars, that, in 2008, 2009, 2010,  and 2011, really raided the American people by raising taxes on them,  by causing an economic downturn, a GDP rate of 1.2 percent--an assault  on not just the taxpayer, but on the free enterprise system.   It is true that we promised this last election, through the election  of Donald Trump, to Make America Great Again. Part of making America  great again means making Americans great again also, making Americans  not only proud of their country, but giving them an economic  opportunity, and that is what the Republican Party is doing here.   We have heard not only from Mike Kelly, Congressman Kelly, who spoke  about making America better, making the free enterprise system better,  we heard from Congressman Woodall about being in 24th place, which is  what America is, 24th in the world in doing business in a friendly  environment.   We cannot survive in 24th place--24th place--by keeping the current  Tax Code we have, where over and over and over we see not only  companies moving to other locations within the United States of  America, but moving offshore, stranding dollars, and jobs going with  that.   What we are attempting to do in this bill is to make America number  one, make America and the American worker number one again. We are  going to make the big deal the big deal for people wherever you live in  the United States. We are going to offer an opportunity for you to not  only be taxed less, but that business that is in your city, your State  that proudly they represent their hometown, they will have the  opportunity to now be competitive.   Forget this, ``Oh, Republicans want to move jobs offshore.'' That is  what we are sick and tired of hearing. We are sick and tired of hearing  that jobs and investments go overseas.   They are coming back to America because this places America, instead  of being the bottom wrung in terms of taxes, as the highest in the  world. We are going to go to where we are the most competitive, where  the American worker will stand a chance to stamp ``Made in America'' on  those items that they want, made from my hometown, the pride of  authorship of the middle class of this country, pride of authorship of  knowing not just is my country going to get better, but my community  and I will be better.   It is about financial responsibility, but it is also about the  integrity of the free enterprise system. The free enterprise system is  the greatest economic system in the history of the world. It will  continue to produce great and better things for so many people.   But, Mr. Speaker, the Democratic Party tried to kill the free  enterprise system when they came after the free enterprise system. We  knew it and we saw it, and the world saw it, too. 1.2 percent GDP  growth as opposed to, now, with a new viewpoint about making America  great, we have not only doubled GDP, but we have added, net, 1 million  jobs. If the summer had not produced the storms it had, no telling what  our job growth would be.   This is what lies ahead, and this is what this Republican bill does.  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying bill on this conference report.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee, I  rise in strong and unyielding opposition to the rule and the Conference  Report to H.R. 1, the so-called ``Tax Cut and Jobs Act,'' which more  accurately should be called the ``Republican Tax Scam Act.''   There are four reasons why I oppose this cruel and immoral $1.7  trillion tax giveaway to wealthy corporations:   1. The GOP tax scam raises taxes on tens of millions of middle class  households and distributes the largest tax cuts to those in the top 1  percent causing $1.7 trillion to be added to the debt;   2. It eliminates or reduces tax benefits that directly benefit the  middle class at every stage of life;   3. It results in 13 million fewer Americans with health insurance  coverage; and   4. And it adds over $2 trillion dollars to deficit spending, which  triggers statutory PAYGO's automatic spending cuts to mandatory  programs such as Medicare, which along would see a $25 billion cut.   Instead of doing tax reform the Republicans have found new ways for  the wealthy who use tax accountants and lawyers to further game the tax  payer system by adding new loop holes that are only for the  corporations and the wealthy.   Corporations receive a 14 percentage point reduction in their  statutory tax rate, from 35 percent to 21 percent, the largest one-time  rate reduction in U.S. history.   Republicans designed this tax scam to benefit the wealthiest in our  country and now they are working as hard as possible to make sure  Americans are too busy looking the other way to notice.   I have to tell them that it is too late, the American public sees  what you are doing and they are not going to have any of it.   The Republican Tax Scam doubles the dollar amount at which the estate  tax, currently affecting only the wealthiest 2 in 100 families.   It lifts the level at which the alternative minimum tax (AMT) would  kick in, while dropping the top tax rate from the current 39.6 percent  to 37 percent.   Mr. Speaker, where are the promises made to working Americans to give  them a break.   Americans are not fooled; they know trickle-down economics has never  worked, and they see right through this phony tax plan and recognize it  for the scam that it is.   What people may not understand is they will not have to wait until  2027 to see the pain and misery that this tax cut will cause.   Congress has established mechanisms in rules that require pay-fors  when budget deficit spending reaching astronomical levels, like what we  have in this bill's wholesale giveaway of taxpayer money to  Corporations and the wealth--it is called PAYGO.   The PAYGO compels new spending or tax changes not to add to the  federal debt.   PAYGO requires that new spending must either be ``budget neutral'' or  offset with cuts to existing programs.   So the Tax cut that corporations will be getting today, will cost the  American workers dearly in next year when the Budget Committee must  draft a budget that will have to slash domestic programs to pay for  these cuts.   Mr. Speaker, as you may know, my constituents and others in Texas are  still struggling to recover from the devastation caused by Hurricane  Harvey, the worst storm ever to make landfall in the continental United  States.  [[Page H10198]]    Two weeks ago, nearly 8,000 of them took time out of their busy  schedules to join me in a tele-town hall to discuss the tax scheme that  has been rushed to the floor for a vote by the Republican leadership in  the hope of passing it before the American people learn its insidious  details.   My constituents understand and let me know that they believe it is  important that the United States has a tax system that is fair,  balanced, smart, and provides the resources and opportunities to allow  all Americans to reach their potential.   And by margins exceeding 90 percent, they reject:   1. Any cuts to Medicare or Medicaid to finance tax cuts for wealthy  corporations and the top 1 percent;   2. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction;   3. Eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes;   4. Eliminating existing deductions for student loan interest or  making taxable college endowment funds or college fellowships expenses.   Mr. Speaker, my constituents, and Americans across the country,  oppose this unfair Republican tax giveaway because nearly half of the  $1.7 trillion tax cut goes to just the top one percent.   In fact, the average annual tax cut for the top one-tenth of one  percent is $320,000; for the top one percent it is $62,000, and for  those earning $1 million a year it is $68,000.   Nearly 25 percent of the tax cut goes to households in just the top  one-tenth of one percent, who make at least $5 million a year (2027).   While super-wealthy corporations and individuals are reaping  windfalls, millions of middle-class and working families will see their  taxes go up:   1. 13 million households face a tax increase next year.   2. 45 million households face a tax increase in 2027.   3. 29 million households (21 percent) earning less than $l00,000 a  year see a tax increase.   On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a $794  increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on families  struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook.   It is shocking, but not surprising, that under this Republican tax  scam, the total value of tax cuts for just the top one percent is more  than the entire tax cut for the lower 95 percent of earners.   Put another way, those earning more than $912,000 a year will get  more in tax cuts than 180 million households combined.   The core of this Republican tax scheme is a massive tax cut from 35  percent 20 percent corporations, but that is not the only way that the  wealthy are rewarded.   The massive tax cuts for corporations are permanent but temporary for  working and middle-class families.   Another immoral aspect of this terrible tax scam is that it abandons  families that face natural disasters or high medical costs by repealing  deductions for casualty losses and medical expenses.   Mr. Speaker, in what universe does it make any sense to eliminate, as  this bill would, a deduction for:   1. teachers who purchase supplies for their classroom;   2. moving expenses to take a new job and taxes employer-provided  moving expenses; or   3. Dependent care assistance, making it harder for families to afford  day care, nursery school, or care for aging parents?   This Republican tax scam jeopardizes American innovation and  competitiveness by eliminating the deduction for student loan interest,  which affects 12 million borrowers, and cuts total education assistance  by more than $64 billion.   Under the extraordinary leadership of President Obama and the  determined efforts of ordinary Americans, we pulled our way out from  under the worst of the foreclosure crisis when the housing bubble burst  in 2007.   Inexplicably, Republicans are now championing a tax scheme that will  make the homes of average Americans less valuable because deductions  for mortgage interest and property taxes are much less valuable than  under current law.    A tax plan that reduces home values, as this one does, puts pressure  on states and towns to collect revenues they depend on to fund schools,  roads, and vital public resources.   Mr. Speaker, an estimated 2.8 million Texas households deduct state  and local taxes with an average deduction of $7,823 in 2015.   But this is not the end of the bad news that will be delivered were  this tax scam to become law, not by a long shot.   The proposed elimination of the personal exemption will harm millions  of Texans by taking away the $4,050 deduction for each taxpayer and  claimed dependent; in 2015, roughly 9.3 million dependent exemptions  were claimed in the Lone Star State.   Equally terrible is that this Republican tax scam drastically reduces  the Earned Income Tax Credit, which encourages work for 2.7 million  low-income individuals in Texas, helping them make ends meet with an  average credit of $2,689.   The EITC and the Child Tax Credit lift about 1.2 million Texans,  including 663,000 children, out of poverty each year.   So to achieve their goal of giving more and more to the haves and the  ``have mores,'' our Republican friends are willing to betray seniors,  children, the most vulnerable and needy, and working and middle-class  families.   The $5.4 trillion cuts in program investments that will be required  to pay for this tax giveaway to wealthy corporations and individuals  will fall most heavily on low-income families, students struggling to  afford college, seniors, and persons with disabilities.   America will not be made great by financing a $1.7 trillion tax cut  for the rich by stealing $1.8 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid,  abandoning seniors and families in need, depriving students of  realizing a dream to attend college without drowning in debt, or  disinvesting in the working families.   America will not be positioned to compete and win in the global,  interconnected, and digital economy by slashing funding for scientific  research, the arts and humanities, job retraining, and clean energy  just to pay for a tax cut to corporations and individuals who do not  even need it.   Mr. Speaker, the tax scheme presented here by Republicans is not a  plan but a scam that represents a betrayal of our values as a nation.   This tax scam is not a revenue policy adapted for the real world that  real Americans live in but a fantasy resting on the monstrous belief  that the wealthy have too little money and that poor, working, and  middle-class families have too much.   Our Republican friends continue to cling to the fantasy belief that  their tax cuts for the rich will pay for themselves despite all  precedent to the contrary and evidence that their tax scheme is  projected by experts to lose between $3 trillion and $7 trillion.   Mr. Speaker, in evaluating the merits of a taxing system, it is not  enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal responsibility.   To keep faith with the nation's past, to be fair to the nation's  present, and to safeguard the nation's future, the plan must also pass  a ``moral test.''   The Republican tax bill fails both of these standards.   I strongly oppose the Conference Report to H.R. 1, the ``Republican  Tax Scam Act,'' and urge all Members to join me in voting against this  reckless, cruel, and heartless proposal that will do nothing to improve  the lives or well-being of middle and working class families, and the  poor and vulnerable `caught in the tentacles of circumstance.'   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 667 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:       ``SEC. 5.

A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
