 DAVIS of Illinois changed their vote from ``yea'' to  ``nay.''   Ms. ADAMS, Messrs. BISHOP of Utah, YOHO, and Ms. GRANGER changed  their vote from ``nay'' to ``yea.''   So the conference report was agreed to.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chair, I rise in strong support  of H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act. It is the  solution whose time has come.   According to the CBO, this bill will save $448 billion from Medicare  alone, which can be used to provide other services to seniors and  people with disabilities.   I thank the Democratic leadership for including my bills to reduce  maternal mortality and morbidity by doubling the MIECHV program and by  expanding the successful Health Profession Opportunity Grants program  to train low-income individuals to help relieve the health shortage  that exists in this country.   Madam Chair, Elijah Cummings would be proud of this bill to carry his  name, and I urge its passage.                                time  2000
