 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the issue of  vaccinations, vaccine hesitancy, and the rising rates of the COVID-19  delta variant.   For the last few months, I have traveled across my district  administering vaccines to Iowans. It has been a pleasure to see my  constituents and the entire country have a renewed sense of freedom and  begin to return to normal.   But fully engaged living is threatened by the delta variant, which is  causing increased hospitalizations and death, especially among those  unvaccinated. Those vaccinated have a much milder course of disease.   It is miraculous to have three safe and effective vaccines for COVID- 19 so rapidly. However, this speed of development may give some  Americans pause. Therefore, it is critical to emphasize that no safety  shortcuts were taken and reassure our constituents that they are safe  and effective.   Decades of research informed the development of these breakthrough  vaccines, and millions have been vaccinated with tremendously low risk.  Given the rise in the delta variant, I would once again encourage  everyone to get a vaccine as soon as possible so that we continue our  path to normalcy and not go back to lockdowns and mask mandates.    This vaccine is how we get back to normal and get our lives back. If  you have questions or concerns, please talk to your doctor.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to take this time to wish the youngest  of 10 in our family, Mari-Eleanor Martino, a happy birthday.                            ____________________
