 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a  group of heroes who went above and beyond to save the life of one of my  district office staff. It is important to note that my district office  is located at the Corona City Hall, a detail that was vital in the  events that transpired.   On November 4, 2019, at 1:50 p.m., a member of my staff experienced a  medical event that required immediate attention. Jackie Lansing noticed  the event and brought it to the attention of the other district staff,  who responded quickly and calmly.   While Jackie provided immediate assistance to the staffer, Kathleen  McGravan called 911. Danielle Shade hurried to a number of offices in  city hall to find on-site medical personal. At the same time, Shawna  Rimke directed our intern, Noah Ritter, who had previously received CPR  training, to administer chest compressions.   Shawna then ran to retrieve Cari Lee Smith, a volunteer at city hall  who Shawna knew was also a Corona Fire Department volunteer. Cari  assisted Noah in CPR compressions but quickly realized that she needed  a defibrillator. She sprinted off to secure one of city hall's AEDs.   While this was taking place, Ryan Cortez, a Corona city employee and  an off-duty EMT, was in a meeting with the City Manager's Office when  he received an alert on the PulsePoint Respond app. This app notifies  certified personnel of a medical emergency near them.   While Ryan rushed downstairs to respond, Cari and Noah administered  the first AED shock. Upon revival, Ryan administered the second AED  shock, which stabilized the staff member.   At 1:56 p.m. the firemen arrived. Ryan was able to explain to the  firemen exactly what transpired as well as brief them on the AED  readings.   I am very grateful to say that this member of my staff, who has been  a dedicated and instrumental part of my team for many years, is  recovering and doing well.   That day may have ended very differently if not for the quick actions  of my staff and the lifesaving techniques administered by Noah Ritter,  Cari Lee Smith, and Ryan Cortez. To those three individuals, the entire  Calvert team sends their heartfelt gratitude.                            ____________________
