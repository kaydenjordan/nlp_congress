 Mr. Chair, I thank my friend from Arizona for yielding me  time.   Mr. Chair, I rise to oppose this bill today for a number of reasons,  but building a road through a congressionally designated wilderness  area is without precedent. There are lots of other reasons.   I would note that at least today's debate shifts the focus of this  Congress in the right direction because, when we look to Alaska, it  requires a gaze just a little bit further into Russia, and I only wish  that what we were debating today was the sanctions bill that passed the  Senate by a vote of 98-2. The reason that we should be debating that  bill today is readily apparent to anyone who has been paying attention  to recent events.   Just this morning, we read of the President's interview with The New  York Times, and we think about a President who took action to fire the  acting Attorney General, to urge the FBI Director to go easy on Flynn  in the Flynn investigation, who fired the FBI Director because of the  Russia investigation, and who just now, in this interview yesterday,  threatened the acting FBI Director, the Attorney General of the United  States, and the person carrying out the investigation of Russia and the  potential ties between his administration and Russia.   All of this gets to the larger point, which is we are getting ready  to go home at the end of next week for August, and if we go home  without passing the sanctions bill and getting tough on Russia, we will  have failed the American people on a vital national security issue. We  will be showing weakness at a time when the American people expect to  see strength, expect us to stand up to Russian attempts to interfere  with our election, to stand up when we learn about an eight-person--for  now, eight-person--meeting that was put together with the sole purpose,  according to the emails, of providing information to help President  Trump, then candidate Trump, get elected with the assistance of the  Russian Government.   We don't know where this will all lead. I acknowledge that. But it is  because what we do know about Russia that we have to act not against  the administration--it is a mischaracterization to suggest that. The  bill passed 98-2 in the Senate. This is a bill that will enable us to  move forward in a bipartisan way, which the American people desperately  want, to stand up to Russia.   It is for that reason that is I ask unanimous consent that the House  bring up H.R. 3203, which is the Russia sanctions bill that passed the  Senate 98-2--98-2. When has this body seen that kind of bipartisanship?   I ask that that bill be brought up so that we can vote on it and not  disappoint the American people before we leave here in August. That is  what we ought to be doing. I hope we will have the chance to do it now.   Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that we bring up the Russia  sanctions bill to debate and to pass that bill today.   The CHAIR. The gentleman's request cannot be entertained in the  Committee of the Whole.                           Parliamentary Inquiries     Mr. Chair, a point of parliamentary inquiry.   The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.    May the request that the Russia sanctions bill, H.R.  3203, that passed the Senate 98-2 be brought up for consideration when  we are no longer meeting as the Committee of the Whole?   The CHAIR. A request may be made at that time.    And one further point of parliamentary inquiry.   The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.    When we have an opportunity to make the unanimous consent  request to bring up the Russia sanctions bill so we can get tough on  Russia, as the American people expect us to do, is that something that  would require, when I ask for unanimous consent, can the Speaker alone  refuse to grant that consent?    The CHAIR. The Chair will not respond to a hypothetical question.
