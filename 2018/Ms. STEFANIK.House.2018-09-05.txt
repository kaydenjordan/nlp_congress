 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairwoman Foxx.   Today, young Americans are burdened with more than $1.4 trillion in  student debt. As the cost of college tuition continues to rise, we know  that students who do not complete their degrees and graduate bear the  heaviest burden when paying back loans.                                time  1500    This is why we must ensure that borrowing is done wisely and that we  provide students with information so they don't feel compelled to drop  out because of a change in finances.   Financial literacy is the foundation needed for students to make  informed decisions, yet over 40 percent of students carrying high debt  loads cannot remember ever receiving financial counseling.   Many students work very hard to line up savings, scholarships,  grants, and loans to pay for their education only to have something  change in their personal life. This could be the death or an illness of  a family member, the loss of a parent's or student's job, an investment  that didn't work out, or any number of situations resulting in a  significant change to the student's financial circumstances.   When students are faced with these hardships, some rush into a loan  that may not be in their best interest, and some may even decide to  drop out of school. We should not accept either of those outcomes,  especially when our Nation's schools are equipped with the dedicated  support of financial aid officers. These individuals are able to help  guide a student through the many complexities of financing higher  education and are also ready and willing to guide students through  unexpected financial turbulence.   We know that students who do receive adequate financial guidance are  positioned to have much stronger financial health than those who do  not. One challenge to this goal of financial literacy is ensuring  students know who to go to when finances become an issue. This problem  is particularly harmful to first-generation college students who may  not have any family members or friends who can help advise on this type  of situation or may not know where to look for additional financial  guidance.   My amendment adds to the important work of this underlying bill by  ensuring all students receive an explanation of how they can seek  additional assistance from their financial aid office should they face  a change in personal financial circumstances.   Since students will not be required to take out the maximum loan that  they are eligible for, my amendment also clarifies that the loan the  borrower receives is the amount the borrower wants to take out.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague and friend, the  gentlewoman from Oregon, for her support.   As she mentioned, this is a commonsense amendment. It particularly  helps first-generation college students access the financial counseling  they need. This improves the bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
