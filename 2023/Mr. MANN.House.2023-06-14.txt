 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss America's debt crisis.   We are in the exact same position today that we have been in for  years. Our national debt is ballooning, and wasteful spending  continues. In early 2025, we will hit the debt ceiling again and run  out of money.   Congress must commit to ending the wasteful government spending that  is causing this debt crisis in the first place.   America is bleeding out financially, and I am sounding the alarm. We  must stop governing from crisis to crisis because all we are doing is  organizing deck chairs on the Titanic. Our ship is sinking, and if we  don't act fast, our economy, the value of the dollar, our children's  future, and the future of this great Nation are going to be forgotten  relics at the bottom of the sea.   Kansas and the Big First sent me to D.C. to stop the borrowing and  spending spree. They sent me to pass legislation like this week's REINS  Act, which would block costly rules and regulations. Today, America is  $31 trillion in debt, and soon we will be at $34 trillion in debt. This  must end.   We must work together now to create a real solution to this crisis,  which means coming to the table, having the hard conversations, and  getting this right for the future of the country.                            ____________________
