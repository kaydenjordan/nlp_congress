 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with an incredibly  heavy heart to honor the life of my dear friend, Reverend Maggie  Howard, a woman whose kind soul is impossible to describe in just this  1 minute that I have.   From her Stapleton UAME Church on Tompkins Avenue on Staten Island,  Reverend Howard led a ministry of service that was impossible to miss.   Through her soup kitchen and pantry, she not only opened the doors of  her church; she opened her heart and soul to anyone in need. When  others might see someone homeless or suffering and look the other way,  no, Maggie would offer them a meal or even a job.   That love for her community earned her the nickname Stapleton's  Mother  [[Page H2521]]  Teresa, and it was her fierce spirit that allowed her to overcome so  many challenges in her life, including fighting through her own health  struggles.   I know that all of Staten Island is feeling the pain of losing  Reverend Howard this young, but I want to close out with words of  optimism that were near and dear to her heart: ``No matter what  happened yesterday, tomorrow can be better if we start today.''   Today, Staten Islanders are going to come together to honor and  celebrate Reverend Howard's life, and we will never forget her memory.                            ____________________
