 Mr. Speaker, as we observe National Nurses Week, I rise  to honor our medical professionals on Guam and the incredible work they  do for our island community.   Nurses are an integral part of our healthcare system, providing  patients with compassionate care and support. Shown next to me are some  of Guam's nurses tending to the well-being of our island residents.   As the backbone of our healthcare system, nurses work tirelessly  around the clock to ensure everyone receives the best possible  treatment.   Oftentimes, they sacrifice their own well-being and comfort to  provide excellent care to their patients. This can mean working long  hours, dealing with difficult individuals, or managing stressful  situations.   Not to forget, on Guam and everywhere else, nurses were at the  forefront of the fight against COVID-19, putting their own lives at  risk to save others.   Today and every day, we honor our nurses for their hard work and  dedication.   Happy National Nurses Week.           Celebrating Guam Chamber of Commerce's 99th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, the Guam Chamber of  Commerce celebrated its 99th anniversary. That is nearly a century of  promoting the economic, social, and environmental well-being of the  island of Guam.   The Guam Chamber of Commerce has taken the initiative in extending  and fostering trade and commerce on island, developing and protecting  the many industries that call Guam home, advocating for probusiness  policies, and providing forums for business entities to grow.  [[Page H2252]]    Their Armed Forces Committee has tirelessly continued a decades-long  tradition of walking the Halls of Congress and knocking on doors to  promote mutually beneficial and responsible military growth in Guam.   As someone who has spent many years in the private sector and proudly  sat on the board of directors of this prestigious organization many  years ago, it is my honor to stand here in these sacred Halls of  democracy to congratulate the Guam Chamber of Commerce on their  historic milestone of celebrating 99 years.   On behalf of a thankful nation and island, I commend them for their  many services toward both Guam's business community and the people of  Guam.                 Honoring and Recognizing Guam's Centenarians     Mr. Speaker, as our island and Nation celebrate and honor  our senior citizens, or manamko, as we refer to them back home, I will  to take this time to recognize a handful of centenarians on Guam, who  will be celebrating a birthday spanning 100 years or older this year.   This list includes:   Ms. Rosario Flores Leon Guerrero, who is celebrating her 103rd  birthday.   Ms. Teodora Andrada, who is celebrating her 102nd birthday.   Ms. Josefina de la Concepcion Diaz, who is celebrating her 101st  birthday.   Ms. Lillian Leon Anderson is celebrating her 100th birthday this  year.   Also celebrating birthday No. 100 is Ms. Magdalena Perez Taitano  Fausto.   Sadly, we recently lost Ms. Victoria Robeniol Rebugio, who would have  celebrated her 101st birthday in December of this year.   On behalf of a great nation and a loving island community, and from  these sacred Halls of democracy and history, please join me in honoring  Guam's centenarians and wishing them a happy birthday.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2, because  protecting America's borders also means protecting my community.   Guam is geographically closer to China than any other part of the  United States. For that reason, I view border security as an important  piece of national security.   While securing the border, H.R. 2 also makes it easier for employers  to hire H-2A workers. I support these efforts, because the similar H-2B  visa program is an irreplaceable source of labor for the Department of  Defense and is absolutely necessary to supplement Guam's construction  labor force, which ultimately serves the purpose of protecting our  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their work on H.R. 2.
