 Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to the  majority leader and his requests that we come forward and bring  amendments to the floor--all of our ideas about how we can improve our  healthcare system so that this would be an opportunity through budget  reconciliation for us to deal with those issues.   I asked my staff to prepare amendments in order to protect the  Medicaid system from cuts. I asked my staff to prepare amendments to  protect the essential health benefits that are in the Affordable Care  Act because it is important that we preserve those benefits, whether it  is mental health and addiction services or one that is particularly  important to Maryland; that is, pediatric dental. In Maryland, we all  recall the loss of a 12-year-old not too many years ago because he  couldn't get dental care--Deamonte Driver.   I asked my staff to take a look at preparing amendments to protect  minority health and health disparities because the Affordable Care Act  made tremendous advancements in trying to close that gap on the  disparities in minority health and health disparities. I asked my staff  to take a look at the tax provisions because we want to make sure that  we are not giving tax cuts to wealthy people at the expense of cutting  the Medicaid system. I asked them to look at this in a lot of different  ways.   Listening to the majority leader, I also have introduced legislation  that I will talk about that could build on the Affordable Care Act, and  I was wondering what bill I should amend? What is the bill that we are  considering? It is not the bill that Senator McConnell brought forward  because that bill was defeated. It is not the repeal--and we are  starting with a blank slate--because that was defeated. I don't believe  it is the House bill because that has been discredited, called a mean  bill by the President, as well as by Members of this body, who said it  has no chance of passing. So my dilemma is that I don't know what I  should be amending.   I expect we will get to see another bill somewhere along the process  with virtually no notice and no opportunity to read and no opportunity  to amend, but the majority leader says I am going to have that  opportunity. Yet we don't know what the bill is that I am supposed to  be addressing my amendments to.   We know that all the bills we have seen today--every single one from  the Republicans--have been scored by the Congressional Budget Office as  to tens of millions of Americans losing their insurance coverage--tens  of millions. I understand it is about 33 million if we just repeal the  Affordable Care Act, 22 million if we use the type of replacement that  the majority leader was suggesting. All of those move in the wrong  direction.   We also know that in every one of these proposals to date, insurance  premiums are going to go up, not down.   That is one thing I have heard from my constituents. They would like  to see us bring down the growth rate of health insurance costs and  healthcare, not increase it. So, yes, I would like to be able to offer  amendments, but I don't know what to offer amendments to.   I also am concerned when I see that every one of the bills that have  been suggested by the Republicans would reverse the protections that we  put in law against the wrong practices--the discriminatory practices-- of insurance companies. I have talked to many of my constituents who  tell me that if we reimpose caps, either yearly or lifetime--they have  the circumstance where their child was born with a disability and that  cap would have been expended within a matter of months--they would be  left without insurance coverage. They tell me about how preexisting  conditions could be jeopardized. All of us have some form of  preexisting condition, and, on a lot of these plans that are being  suggested where you could choose the type of coverage you want,  insurance companies are not going to offer the benefits you need.  People who have challenges are going to be most discriminated against.  So I don't quite understand how I can offer amendments and we could  have a vote on the floor when we don't know what we are trying to  amend.  [[Page S4260]]    I must state that there is a common theme here, and we know it. We  know that there is now talk that the majority leader might bring up,  sometime during this process, what has been called in the press a  ``skinny'' bill. I call it a slow death of the Affordable Care Act,  and, in fact, I am afraid it might be a fast death of the Affordable  Care Act because, if the reports are accurate, one of the provisions  that the majority leader is looking to bring in as the final bill that  we would vote on would eliminate the requirement that companies have to  provide insurance coverage to their employees and individuals must have  coverage.   Now that seems innocent enough, except for the tens of millions who  are going to lose their insurance coverage--people who are working for  companies that decide to terminate their policies, healthy people who  decide not to buy insurance policies. I believe you are going to find  that there still will be tens of millions of people losing their  insurance coverage, and that is unacceptable. But it goes beyond that.  That proposal will also increase premium costs by a very large percent.  Why?   Think about this for a moment. If you don't have to buy insurance and  you are young and healthy, are you going to buy insurance or not? Many  will say no until they need the insurance, and then they will buy the  insurance. Actuaries tell us that without the requirement to have  insurance, the insurance pools will contain a very high percentage of  adverse risks--people at higher risk--and when that happens, the  purpose of insurance to spread the risk is no longer done. It means  premiums will go up dramatically. That doesn't help the people who are  going to need it.   What you also find when you eliminate this requirement is that people  get what we call job locked. They may have a company that provides  health benefits, but now they may have to leave that company. But if  they want to leave that company and start a job or go to another job  that doesn't have insurance, they are locked into where they work. All  of that adds to anxiety, adds to lack of coverage, adds to people who  don't have health insurance, adds to people not getting adequate  healthcare, adds to bankruptcies, adds to the problems that we  addressed with the Affordable Care Act.   But there is another explanation here. Maybe this is just a shell  bill that is going to go back--hopefully, as the Republicans believe,  but I hope it does not happen--to the House, and then we will put in  the Medicaid cuts and the tax relief and all the other things that are  not in the bill. This is just a shell to get us back to one of the  bills that couldn't get the votes here on the floor, where tens of  millions of people will lose their insurance coverage, premiums will go  up, and insurance company arbitrary and discriminatory practices will  return.   Every one of these proposals--every single one--moves us in the wrong  direction in healthcare. We recognize that we can improve our  healthcare system. I am for improving our healthcare system. I think we  can work together--Democrats and Republicans--to improve our healthcare  system.   So here is my request: Vote for the Casey motion. Why? For two  reasons. One, I would hope that on this anniversary of the ADA, or the  Americans with Disabilities Act, we would want to do no harm to those  with disabilities in our healthcare system and they would have adequate  coverage. I was in a celebration over the weekend in Baltimore City  with the disabilities community. We celebrated one of the great  victories in America, the Americans with Disabilities Act--a bipartisan  bill, with Democrats and Republicans coming together in a proud moment,  in the best traditions of the Senate, to say that people with  disabilities will be treated fairly in America. On this day we should  adopt the Casey motion on the issue of protecting people with  disabilities.   But there is a second issue here.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2  additional minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    I will try to conclude my remarks. On this day that we  are celebrating the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act,  let's do right by that. There is a second part to the Casey motion that  sends it back to committee so we can use the regular process, as  Senator McCain talked about yesterday. Let's have the committee  hearings, as Senator Alexander talked about. Let's have the committee  markups and work together. I introduced legislation that would bring  down the cost of healthcare and lower the rate of increase of  individual premiums. I do that by suggesting more competition in the  individual marketplace, by having a public option, by providing  stronger subsidies to lower income families, by making sure that cost- sharing is in fact paid for so we don't have that uncertainty, with the  reinsurance that Senator Carper was talking about to deal with the  overall cost of healthcare, by dealing with prescription drug costs,  and by dealing with coordinated care so that we can deal with the whole  patient rather than their individual disease.   All of those issues would improve the Affordable Care Act, but before  we get there, we have to get off of this train. We have to stop this  disastrous course. I am going to do everything in my power to make sure  that, as to the bill we have, whenever it comes forward, we stop it  right here, and then work together, Democrats and Republicans, to  improve our healthcare system, not to take away insurance coverage and  increase costs for so many Americans.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.    Madam President, I intend to offer a motion to commit the  reconciliation bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to  report the bill back to the Senate within 3 days, not counting any day  on which the Senate is not in session, with changes eliminating  provisions that would weaken access to essential health benefits,  reduce access to affordable preventive services, and undermine the  prohibition of annual and lifetime limits and caps on out-of-pocket  expenditures for health insurance plans.   I am offering this motion because the reconciliation bill affects  tens of millions of Americans who gained health coverage under the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, ACA. The reconciliation  bill allows insurers to eliminate coverage of essential health  benefits. Insurance companies could exclude essential benefits like  maternity care, substance use disorder treatment, mental healthcare,  prescription drugs, and hospitalization--the very services people buy  insurance to obtain. Before the ACA, one-third of individual market  health plans did not cover substance use disorder services, nearly one- fifth of those plans did not cover mental health, and only nine States  required all insurers on the individual market to cover maternity care.   Allowing States to waive essential health benefits would also allow  insurance companies to reinstate annual and lifetime caps. This means  that a premature baby could exceed its lifetime limit within its first  few months of life or that a cancer patient could hit an annual cap  just a couple of months into treatment.   Before the ACA, too many people and families were hurt physically and  financially because they could not afford access to healthcare. They  didn't get the tests they needed. Perhaps they did not catch a  preventable disease early enough--so the treatment costs skyrocketed.  We saw too many families go through bankruptcy because they could not  afford the healthcare that they needed. We saw too many people  literally cutting their prescription pills in half, hoping to stretch  out their medicine because they could not afford more, even though they  knew they were compromising their health. We cannot go back to this  cruel, dreadful situation.   The following Senators support my motion to commit: Senators Carper,  Brown, Blumenthal, Warren, Nelson, Van Hollen, Duckworth, and Stabenow.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my motion to commit be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Cardin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) eliminate provisions in the bill that would weaken       access to essential health benefits, reduce access to       affordable preventive services, and undermine the prohibition       of annual and lifetime limits and caps on out-of-pocket       expenditures for health insurance plans.     Madam President, I intend to offer a motion to commit the  reconciliation bill to the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions,  HELP, Committee with instructions to report the bill back to the Senate  within 3 days, not counting any day on which the Senate is not in  session, with changes that would eliminate provisions in the bill that  would increase health disparities among certain populations, including  disparities on the basis of race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status,  gender, religion, disability status, geographic location, and sexual  identity and orientation.   I am offering this motion because communities of color and  disenfranchised communities have faced significant barriers to  accessing affordable health coverage, and these barriers have  contributed to health disparities, which are evident in higher rates of  diabetes, heart disease, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS and infant mortality,  among other conditions. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act's vital coverage reforms, which include Medicaid expansion, cost  sharing reductions, eliminating annual and lifetime limits, and  creating coverage options for individuals with preexisting conditions,  has led to sharp declines in the uninsured rates for minorities and  low-income populations. With the implementation of the major ACA  coverage provisions in 2014, the uninsured rate dropped dramatically  and continued to fall in 2015. In 2015, the nonelderly uninsured rate  was 10.5 percent, the lowest rate in decades, with the most dramatic  changes seen among low-income Latino Americans, African Americans, and  Asian Americans.   Minorities now make up more than 35 percent of the American  population, and that number is expected to rise in the future. Every  community across this great Nation deserves optimal health. A person's  ethnic or racial background should never determine the length or  quality of his or her life. We must work to bridge health equity across  communities, ensure that all Americans have access to affordable, high- quality healthcare, and continue our efforts to eliminate health  disparities.   The following Senators support my motion to commit: Senators Booker,  Hirono, Brown, Carper, Stabenow, Markey, Blumenthal, Van Hollen, and  Nelson. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my motion to  commit be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S4276]]                          Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Cardin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) eliminates provisions of the bill that would increase       health disparities among certain populations, including       disparities on the basis of race and ethnicity, socioeconomic       status, gender, religion, disability status, geographic       location, and sexual identity and orientation.     Madam President, I intend to offer a motion to commit the  reconciliation bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to  report the bill back to the Senate within 3 days, not counting any day  on which the Senate is not in session, with changes that would  eliminate provisions that hand out tax breaks to large corporations and  the most affluent Americans while the bill makes cuts to Medicaid,  which serves millions of our most needy Americans, including the  elderly poor and poor children.   I am offering this motion because the Finance Committee should review  the implications of depriving millions of Americans, including  children, veterans, individuals with disabilities, and older people, of  their health insurance while at the same time providing large tax  breaks to the richest Americans and biggest corporations. H.R. 1628  offsets those tax breaks by voraciously cutting the Medicaid Program.  Republicans are using the Medicaid Program as a pay-for for these large  tax breaks. As a result, the Republican bill harms far more people than  it will help. Former President John F. Kennedy said, ``To govern is to  choose.'' The Republicans have made a cruel choice, and I object to it.   The following Senators support my motion to commit: Senators Harris,  Van Hollen, Casey, Udall, Coons, Markey, Booker, and Leahy. I ask  unanimous consent that the full text of my motion to commit be printed  in the Record.
