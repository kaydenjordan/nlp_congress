 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, I urge the Speaker to immediately  schedule this important bill.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, it is true that on June 21, 2018, President Trump's  Office of Management and Budget released a plan to reorganize the  executive branch. In that plan, they identified numerous ways to  eliminate duplicative programs, to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in  the government. One of the recommendations would merge the Office of  Personnel Management with the General Services Administration.   I think it is important that we highlight the word ``merge.'' This is  not an elimination of OPM. It is a merger of the two.   OPM's employees work hard to serve retiring Federal employees.  Unfortunately, they are working with outdated 20th-century technology.  It is extremely difficult for them to be able to attract IT talent  necessary to operate this outdated IT system.   The intent of OPM's proposed merger is to fix this problem by  creating one agency focused on delivering efficient, effective employee  services governmentwide.   Admittedly, OPM has not shown that this is an effective way to  address the many problems that are facing OPM. Further, it is true that  despite repeated requests for legal analysis on the administrative  authorities and cost-benefit analysis, the Oversight and Reform  Committee continues to wait for supporting information.                                time  1945    The gentleman from Virginia knows that we have supported that effort  to try to get that information so that we can do our job.   The whole challenge that we are facing is, indeed, ongoing. And while  I share the gentleman's frustration with the lack of information to  inform our committee, this amendment is not the answer. We have the  same goal. We want to find ways to improve services for Federal  employees and get retirement benefits for Federal retirees. But while  we search for a solution, we need to keep all solutions and all options  on the table.   Maybe a merger could gain considerable operational efficiencies,  including providing support to OPM's beleaguered IT operation. If we  see any evidence to support that, we should give this proposal serious  consideration.   We should also give serious consideration to other proposals. If the  chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee's Government Operations  Subcommittee is aware of any other proposals, I would certainly hope  and encourage him to incorporate those proposals into bipartisan  oversight efforts.   But in the meantime, this amendment does nothing to help OPM's  mission, and actively closes options to help OPM. For that reason, I  stand in opposition to this amendment, but look forward to working with  the gentleman as we move forward.    Madam Chair, I would just again reiterate that  we need to keep all options on the table, and this amendment takes a  possible solution off the table.   I think we just need to do further research and consider this. I just  encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment is nothing other  than, once again, an attack on President Trump and his family.   We have seen this time and time and time again from the Democrat  majority. They are simply obsessed with President Trump. Instead of  doing the hard work of governing, my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle are continuing to waste our time here in Congress with their  never-ending attempts to go after the President.   And as it relates to this specific amendment, we have already seen  this amendment. It was in H.R. 1, the so-called For the People Act,  which passed the House here on a party-line vote. It was a bad idea  then in March, and it is still a bad idea.   If an incoming President, Vice President, or Cabinet member took  office while owning a business that held a previously existing contract  with the Federal Government, this amendment would criminally fine that  individual after taking office. And since the President has not  committed a crime under existing laws, this majority is considering  making new crimes, again, in order to go after the President.   How far will they go in their attempt to go after the President?   But even if we ignore the reprehensible aspects of this bill, this  amendment has real implications that go far beyond this administration.  For example, we have seen, with this President, talented individuals  with backgrounds in business, not politics, that can bring a refreshing  change to the swamp here in Washington. But this amendment would drive  qualified people away from public service by imposing more and more  disincentives on individuals with actual, real-world experience.   This amendment is nothing more than a weakly veiled attempt at  harming this administration by trying to make new crimes out of  business decisions that occurred long before the President took office.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I would remind my friend that the  executive branch is already required to divest.   As it relates to finding it laughable that I made a comment about the  inability of the majority party to govern, I don't find that a laughing  matter at all.   Week after week--week after week after week right now--we are coming  into this people's House, wasting time on messaging bills and  amendments, as we are doing even right now, that have no chance of  going anywhere.   It is an absolute waste of time and continual evidence being proven  right before us that this majority has lost its capacity to govern  because of its obsession to go after this President. This amendment  before us here is a clear example of yet another step in that  direction. This is what it is.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
