 I thank my colleague from Missouri.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to talk about my strong opposition  to Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. I want to  specifically focus on what his confirmation could mean for the future  of voting rights in this country.   The right to vote is our most sacred responsibility as citizens of  this great Nation. Martin Luther King, Jr., called voting ``the  foundation stone for political action.'' That is because when the right  to vote is restricted, it undermines the very foundation of our  democracy. If certain groups are barred or discouraged from voting,  then our elected representatives cannot be held accountable for  protecting the rights and interests of all of us.   When you cast your vote, you decide who should be entrusted to  protect all of your rights--your right to make private decisions about  how and when to start a family, your right to organize and advocate for  fair pay and safe working conditions, your right to affordable  healthcare, and your right to breathe clean air and drink clean water.  Yet, if Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court, there is no  doubt he will help his friends in far-right special interest groups  continue their coordinated campaign to make it harder for millions of  Americans to vote. These are the very same groups who recommended his  nomination to the President.   These special interest groups have helped to pass State laws that  have been designed to create obstacles at every step of the voting  process, like making it more difficult to register to vote, to cast  your vote, and to have your vote counted equally. These groups also  know that they can count on Judge Kavanaugh to uphold these  discriminatory laws.   As a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Kavanaugh has a  record of supporting laws that perpetuate voting discrimination,  particularly against communities of color. In 2012, he wrote an opinion  for a three-judge panel that upheld South Carolina's stringent voter ID  law even though the Department of Justice had determined that the law  would violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   Unfortunately, discriminatory voting laws, like the one Judge  Kavanaugh upheld, have a long and shameful history in this country.  When this country was founded, generally only property-owning White men  had the right to vote. It took 80 years to expand the franchise to all  male citizens regardless of their race or color. It took another 50  years to grant women the right to vote and another 4 years after that  to grant that right to all Native Americans. Yet the expansion of the  legal right to vote did not always translate into access at the polls.  It took us over a century to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which  outlawed discriminatory poll taxes, literacy tests, and other voter  intimidation tactics. This landmark civil rights legislation finally  put real teeth in the promise of the 15th Amendment--that no one should  be denied the right to vote on account of one's race or the color of  one's skin.   Unfortunately, in 2013, the Supreme Court gutted one of the most  important protections of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v.  Holder. Since then, far-right special interests at the State level have  doubled down on their efforts to make it harder for people to vote by  eliminating same-day and online voter registration, by limiting early  voting, by enacting voter ID laws, and by purging infrequent voters  from the registration rolls. These latest efforts make it harder rather  than easier for people to vote. They show us there is still so much  work to be done to fulfill the promise of the 14th and 15th  Amendments--that every citizen can vote.   We deserve a Justice who is committed to making our democracy more  representative so that we remain a government for the people and not  just for some of the people. We need a Supreme Court Justice who  appreciates the history of this hard-won fundamental right and who will  not reverse course on centuries of progress. Judge Kavanaugh's opinions  show that he will uphold State laws that make it harder for communities  of color and people of low-income to make their voices heard.   Our voting laws reflect our beliefs about who should have a voice in  this country. I am proud to represent Minnesota, the State with the  highest voter turnout in the Nation, and I believe that our next  Supreme Court Justice should vigorously defend the right of all  eligible citizens to exercise their most fundamental constitutional  right--the right to vote. Unfortunately, Judge Kavanaugh's record  demonstrates he will not be that Justice.   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing his nomination, and I  urge the American people to make their voices heard.   I thank the Presiding Officer.
