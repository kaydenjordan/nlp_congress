 Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 480,  S. 3985.    Mr. President, first I want to wish all my fellow  Senators and our staff colleagues here in the Capitol a happy and  healthy new year. In particular, I would like to extend our gratitude  to the Capitol Police, offices of the Secretary of the Senate and the  Sergeant at Arms, and the many other staff who have gone above and  beyond to help us attend to important business this holiday season.                            ____________________     Today, by the grace of God, the genius of science, and  the resilience of the American people, we appear to have a bright 2021  on the horizon. Our great Nation is poised to defeat this pandemic in  the months ahead through safe and effective vaccines.   The pace of the American people's economic recovery has already  beaten expectations and predictions. Thanks to the ingenuity of our  citizens and historic relief policies from Congress, overall personal  income in our country is already higher now than it was prior to the  pandemic.   Now, the country needs more support, and the significant remaining  pain is not--I repeat, not--evenly distributed, far from it. So we just  enacted another historic $900 billion rescue package to get vaccines  distributed, to keep small businesses alive, and to get a whole lot  more targeted support to struggling people who actually need it. From  multiple kinds of extra Federal unemployment benefits to nutrition  assistance, rental assistance, direct cash, and beyond.   This latest, huge, historic package was just signed into law less  than 1 week ago. It is beginning to take effect right now. Many  households have already received the latest round of direct cash, or  will receive it very soon, to help them turn the page into this brand  new year.   While this huge new aid package takes effect, a bipartisan,  commonsense caucus in both Chambers is not keen to let Speaker Pelosi  and Senator Sanders rush to borrow half a trillion dollars for  universal cash giveaways, regardless of need. A huge chunk would  essentially be socialism for rich people--money flowing to  [[Page S7996]]  households earning well into six figures who did not lose any jobs or  income last year.   The House Democrats' bill is just simply not the right approach. That  is what editorial pages across the political spectrum say. That is what  even liberal economists say. And that is what common sense tells us.   Here is what the Senate is focused on: completing the annual Defense  legislation that looks after our brave men and women who volunteer to  wear the uniform. We passed this legislation 59 years in a row and, one  way or another, we are going to complete the 60th annual NDAA and pass  it into law before this Congress concludes on Sunday.   It is a serious responsibility, but it is also a tremendous  opportunity to direct our national security priorities to reflect the  resolve of the American people and the evolving threats to their safety  at home and abroad. It is our chance to recommit to research and  development so that our 21st century military is equipped to outmatch  any adversary. It is our chance to ensure that we keep pace with  competitors like Russia and China. It is our chance to remind brave  servicemembers and their families that we have their backs with  facilities, resources, and support benefiting the finest fighting  forces in the world.   Over the past year, our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee  have made sure the legislation delivers for our troops and for our  Nation. Now it is time for us to deliver this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I know of no further debate.
