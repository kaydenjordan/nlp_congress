 Mr. Speaker, we hear a lot of talk about the soaring costs  of prescription drugs, but we seldom hear about the sad fact that  Medicare is not allowed to negotiate prescription drug prices.   Earlier this month, drug companies announced yet another painful  price hike on critical medications. The soaring price of prescription  drugs is crushing Americans at the pharmacy counter, driving up health  insurance premiums and creating unaffordable costs for taxpayers, who  finance Medicare. That is right. We, the people, fund Medicare. Yet,  due to an antiquated law, Medicare has to pay drug prices without the  right to negotiate.   That is why, last week, I led a group of my colleagues in sending a  letter to leadership, demanding that Medicare negotiation of drug  prices be included in the upcoming reconciliation bill.   This is common sense, and it is long overdue.   According to the CBO, allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices  would save American taxpayers $456 billion in just the first 10 years  alone, with those savings heading right back into the pockets of  American families. And it would bring down drug prices for all  Americans, not just Medicare recipients. Together, we can get this  done.                            ____________________
