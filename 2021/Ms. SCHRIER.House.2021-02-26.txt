 Speaker, I rise today in support of Section 1001 of the  American Recovery Plan Act of 2021. This section provides necessary  resources to strengthen food and agriculture supply chains that have  been ravaged by COVID-19 and provides $300 million to allow the U.S.  Department of Agriculture to conduct surveillance of animals that are  susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.   As a physician, making sure we approach this and future pandemics  from a One Health perspective is key for both human and animal health,  and as a Member of the Agriculture Committee, I am personally invested  in making sure USDA has adequate resources to do their part. We have  already seen documented evidence of a strain of COVID-19 impacting  people in Europe that matches a strain that has been documented in  captive mink. We cannot ignore the One Health implications of this  pandemic.   The resources provided in this section will help ensure USDA can  follow science-based international surveillance recommendations. I look  forward to working with the Department of Agriculture to fully  implement these provisions, because this is how we can stay one step  ahead as this virus evolves, and also how we can detect the next virus  that jumps from animal to human before it becomes a pandemic.
