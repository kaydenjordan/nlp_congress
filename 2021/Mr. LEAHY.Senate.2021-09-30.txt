 Madam President, we will have before us a substitute  amendment identical to H.R. 5305, which we will be voting on today.  H.R. 5305 is the House-passed continuing resolution, except that the  provision raising the debt ceiling has been removed because Republicans  continue to block raising the debt ceiling.   But the stop-gap measure really keeps the government funded through  December 3. It provides $28 billion to help States that have been  ravaged by hurricanes and wildfires. It provides critical assistance to  Afghan refugees who fled the Taliban in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal  from Afghanistan. Many of those refugees have worked with American  forces and helped us. So I urge all members to vote for it.   But I agree with the majority leader that it is shameful we can't  reach an agreement today to raise the debt ceiling and protect the full  faith and credit of the United States. If Republicans don't want to  vote to protect the full faith and credit of the United States, if the  Republicans don't want to vote for the money that pays for the programs  that they had supported under Donald Trump, well, then, stand out of  the way and Democrats can raise the debt ceiling.   Over and over, the last few days, we heard from Members on the other  side of the aisle speak about the importance of passing a continuing  resolution that contained disaster relief to help hurricane-ravaged  States, like Louisiana and Texas. They are pleading for help. Well, we  are about to pass a CR that provides that help.   I have always taken the position that if there is a disaster in any  State, that we should all come together to provide assistance because  we are the United States of America; it is not just one State. Whether  it is my State of Vermont or Texas or any other State, we can provide  the assistance.   But they may go home and say: Hey, we voted to get money, disaster  relief for our hurricane-ravaged States.   Somebody is going to say: Well, wait a minute, where does the money  come from to help recover and build if the U.S. Treasury is literally  out of money?   In other words, they have a position where they can vote for  something that would be popular back home, and it is kind of like ``the  check is in the mail.'' We are not going to give you any money for it,  but, boy, we are going to speak about how important it is to help.   Many Senators here today want to provide a billion dollars to fund  Israel's so-called Iron Dome, even though Israel has not spent the  money we have already given them. Well, we will pass a bill to do just  that. But if there is no money in the U.S. Treasury to pay the bills,  it is nothing but an empty promise to one of our closest allies. We are  voting on a blank check.   According to the Treasury Department, we are going to reach the debt  ceiling in 18 days. Now, I say that because we ought to know what we  are not voting on. What we are not voting on--as the majority leader  pointed out, we are not voting on the debt ceiling.    We could say: Oh, we are helping hurricane-ravaged areas; oh, we are  making others happy with things we vote for, but we are not voting for  the money.   If we don't raise the debt ceiling, once that happens, we run out of  money to pay our men and women in uniform. We all support our men and  women in uniform. We are just not going to put in the money to pay  them. We can't send out Social Security checks. Find a Senator in this  place that would say they are against Social Security. But to put the  money in for it, they are not ready to do that. Just saying: Oh, we all  support our veterans. Of course, we do. We are just not going to put  the money in to support them.   For the first time in history, the U.S. will default on its debt. The  economy will take such a hit that it will take years to recover.  Millions of people will be out of work. Bills will not be paid. Watch  the stock market go down faster than we have ever seen and millions of  Americans' lifetime savings will be at risk. Oh, we are for all of  those--we just--you are on your own.   Now, the Republican Party is playing political games with U.S.  economy and with people's livelihoods, and it is shameful. Senator  McConnell said he would not provide a single Republican vote to raise  the debt ceiling. It is interesting because most of this debt was  incurred under a Republican President and a Republican-controlled  Senate.   But as irresponsible as it is for the Republican leader to say we  won't vote to pay for the debt that we incur, we, on the Democratic  side, are prepared to show what leadership looks like and do it all on  our own. We are willing to pass this with Democratic votes.   But the Republicans continue to filibuster. If we don't resolve the  debt issue in the coming days, make no mistake where the blame lies:  squarely at the feet of the Senate Republicans.   When we go back and say all these wonderful things we have done for  you in the continuing resolution, but we are not going to pay for it-- we need to pass the CR today, of course, to avert a government shutdown  tomorrow. A government shutdown, as we know from those in the last  administration, wastes billions, accomplishes nothing. But it is also  essential not only to pass the continuing resolution, but to unite and  pass the debt limit extension, or there is not going to be money in the  Treasury--no money to pay for the funding of this bill for American  families, for the elderly, for our troops.   Now, prior to the final passage, we will have a series of three  amendment votes. With only 13 hours for the government set to shut  down--13 hours and a few minutes--any one of these amendments could  peril the continuing resolution. They are controversial. They could  complicate House passage. So I would urge a ``no'' vote on all three  amendments and an ``aye'' vote for final passage.   Any one of those things in those three amendments, bring them up as  legislation somewhere else, but don't shut down the government because  you didn't get your political amendments.                              Amendment No. 3830    (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute.)    Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3830.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up all  remaining amendments, in order, with respect to H.R. 3505 en bloc, and  ask that they be reported by number.    We obviously have these amendments, so we will have them  in order to be voted on. I call them up to have them all before us.   I can assure you that the three amendments that I have referred to, I  will strongly oppose them because, were they to pass, we would not be  able to get the continuing resolution done, the government will be  closed, billions of dollars goes out the window, and we would not have  done our job.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the Cotton Amendment short changes critical  assistance provided to Afghan parolees that is included in the  underlying bill and it should be defeated.   It shortens the length of time that we provide refugee assistance to  thousands of Afghan men and women who fled to the U.S. to escape the  wrath of the Taliban--financial assistance, medical care, emergency  housing, mental health care, job placement services, the things that  they desperately need to begin their new lives in the U.S. For some,  this would mean benefits for only a matter of months, and then they are  on their own. This is not nearly sufficient for them to get on their  feet in a new country. Especially when many of them came here with  nothing.   Many of these men and women were critical U.S. partners during the  war in Afghanistan, putting their lives at risk along with our men and  women in uniform. We cannot turn our backs on them now.   The amendment also limits their ability to apply for a driver's  license. A driver's license is vital to successful integration in this  country--to securing a job, to getting an education, to starting a  small business. This is especially true outside of urban areas and  without public transit, where many are likely to resettle.   This should not even be a debate. I urge a no vote on the Cotton  Amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3833     Mr. President, families across the country are frustrated,  and so am I.   People are doing everything they can to end this pandemic, only to  see some Republicans trying to prolong it with bills like this.   We are fighting a highly contagious virus. It has killed over 685,000  people in our country.   And that that number is only going to keep going up if people don't  get vaccinated, and variants like Delta will continue to spread,  undermine our economy, and take lives.   We need to end this pandemic, and getting people vaccinated is one of  the most important things we can do to accomplish that.   So why would we pass an amendment that weakens one of our strongest  tools to get people safely through this crisis?   I urge all of my colleagues to stand with people across the country  who have been following the public health guidance, and who are ready  for this pandemic to an end, by voting against this dangerous,  counterproductive amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3831     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, you know, this amendment has no business  whatsoever being in a CR which has to be enacted by 12 midnight  tonight. It may make a great sound bite or political ad, but it is not  good policy. It is not a thoughtful solution to the many complicated  reasons that we fail to enact budget resolutions or appropriations  bills precisely on October 1.   We all have serious policy disagreements that lead to inaction or  delay. Let's debate those policies. Threatening to withhold pay or  whatever has absolutely nothing to do with the structural issues, but  it would do one thing. It would make sure that we had only  multimillionaires in the House and Senate. It is a dangerous precedent  and potentially corrosive influence of public policy.   Let's stop the political posturing. If you want this, do it as a  freestanding bill, under regular order, by the Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee. The CR is not the place for it.   I urge a ``no'' vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3832     Mr. President, I thank the Senators who stayed with us to  [[Page S6810]]  make sure we could get a good continuing resolution passed, which we  are about to do. I just want to thank everybody and urge--it will be a  voice vote, but shout ``yes'' on this next vote. Thank you.   I yield the floor, and I yield back the time on both sides.
