 Mr. Chairman, let me just start by associating my  remarks with the remarks of my friend, Mr.   Joe Wilson, from South  Carolina. It is not often that we get to do that on the floor of this  House.   Joe and I come from different places but we believe in America. We  believe in America and we want to protect America.   It has been a long time since we have had to stand here and talk  about the Republican Party being pro-Russia, the Republican Party being  pro-Putin.   Just to be clear, 62 percent of Americans in the last poll want to  support Ukraine, so it is just factually inaccurate to say that most  Americans are against this.   Why is it important? It is important that we support Ukraine because  American lives are on the line. Serving in Iraq in the Marines, it was  our allies that saved American marines lives. It was our allies that  made a difference.    If you are soft on Russia, by being hard on Ukraine today, you are  being soft on China because American lives will be on the line if China  thinks they can do what Putin is trying to do in Ukraine.
