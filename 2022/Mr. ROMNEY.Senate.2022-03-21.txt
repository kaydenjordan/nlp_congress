 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the  entire Jacobsen Construction team on celebrating their centennial of  successful operations, an incredible milestone and culmination of their  sustained hard work and ingenuity.   As an employee-owned enterprise, each and every member of the  Jacobsen community should feel a sense of pride in Jacobsen's legacy of  building up communities here in Utah and around the world. Teamwork is  the key ingredient of the company's success.   Utah is one of the fastest growing States in the Nation, and Jacobsen  has been consistently reliable in helping our State accommodate its  growth and remain prepared for major projects and improvements.  Jacobsen's presence is felt throughout the State. Its logo displays  prominently on a myriad of projects, evidence of the deep and far- reaching impact the company has on Utah's economic strength.   From humble beginnings at the dawn of the 20th century, Jacobsen now  holds its head high over our skylines and in our communities, providing  us places of work, worship, health, and recreation. As the Jacobsen  team reflects on its past century of prosperity, may they continue to  build on their success for the next 100 years and many more.                            ____________________
