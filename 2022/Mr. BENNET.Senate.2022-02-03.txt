 Madam President, I would ask through the Chair how long  the Senator from Texas might be.    Madam President, I defer to the Senator from Texas.    The Senator from Texas was yielding patiently, and just  for clarity of the record, I yield to the senior Senator from the State  of Texas.    Madam President, first I would like to congratulate the  senior Senator from Texas for his leadership on this incredibly  important issue with Senator Warner, the senior Senator from Virginia.   It really is important that we get this passed. Our national security  depends on it. I think the American economy depends on it.   The Senator mentioned that there was a time in our country's history  not long ago--I am going to use my words, not his, but I will  paraphrase it--where I think we thought that making things as cheaply  as possible was the same thing as making things as efficiently as  possible. And I would argue that we privileged the people in our  economy who wanted to make stuff as cheaply as possible in China when  there are a lot of really other important values at work, including our  national security, the supply chains that we rely on, making sure that  communities in our country have jobs and wages being created.   I think we have an incredible opportunity as a nation to come  together and build an economy that, when it grows, grows for everybody  once again. And in my mind, that is what this bill represents.   So I just want to say to the Senator from Texas how grateful I am for  his leadership, and I hope that it won't be long before we pass it.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2497    Madam President, 80 years ago this month, President Franklin  Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, 2 months after the bombing of  Pearl Harbor, and it led to some of the most disgraceful chapters in  our Nation's history--the forced dispossession, relocation, and  concentration of over 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II.   Two-thirds of them were citizens of this country, forced out of their  homes and into internment camps by their own government. They were our  neighbors, and they were parents and shopkeepers and students, doctors  and factory workers. They were Americans in every sense of the word.   But racist fear forced them into these camps--crowded, squalid, and  at war with everything that we stand for as a nation. One of those  camps was Amache in Colorado, where nearly 10,000 Japanese Americans  were detained against their will.   This is a photo of that camp.   I will mention, just because I looked it up--I figured this might be  true, because we have Senators from Nevada and Texas here--that there  were five such places in Texas, as well--internment camps.   But this is one that was in southeastern Colorado, and these children  are among the first arrivals at Amache, and they were forced to build  the camp where their own families were interned for the duration of the  war.   I can't tell exactly the ages of the children in this photo, but I  would be surprised if the pages on this floor are any older than them.  And I would say to the President, in front of the pages, to ask them to  imagine a time when our country interned people the age of the people  who are pages on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   I have had the opportunity to visit Amache a few years ago with John  Hopper, who is a high school teacher, a principal, out there near the  camp, who along with his students, created the Amache Preservation  Society.   There wasn't anybody else to do it. It was just a high school teacher  and his students. They recognized how much this site meant to Colorado,  how much this site meant to the country. And, acting completely on  their own, they worked year after year after year to restore the site  so that the next generation of Coloradans and Americans--the young  people sitting on this floor today--would have the opportunity to learn  about what happened here.   If it were up to me, every student in Colorado and throughout the  American West and, for that matter, in our entire country would come to  this site and learn about the Americans of Amache--the men and women  who held on to hope year after year, who supported one another, who  forged a community behind the barbed wires of this site, who never gave  up on the United States of America, even as it was interning them on  their own soil.   And if they did go to Amache, they could learn about one of my  heroes, Colorado's former Governor Ralph Carr, who spoke out against  what was happening at a time when most politicians in the West and in  this country--going all the way up to our President, Franklin  Roosevelt--were either not speaking out or allowing this to happen.   At that time, many Western Governors opposed internment camps, not  just because they were unjust but--I am sorry. At that time, many  Western Governors were comfortable locking up their fellow citizens so  long as they were locked up in someone else's State because there was  an anti-Japanese American prejudice in the land.   Some Coloradans in nearby communities gave way to shameful fear of  their fellow citizens and objected to their presence. To say the least,  they objected to their presence.   Speaking to an angry crowd one day on the Eastern Plains--I say to my  colleague from Texas that this is where my colleague Senator Cory  Gardner was from, this part of the State of Colorado--Governor Carr  said: ``I am talking to . . . all American people whether their status  be white, brown or black . . . when I say that if a majority may  deprive a minority of its freedom, contrary to the terms of the  Constitution today, then you as a minority may be subjected to the same  ill-will of the majority tomorrow.''   He went on: ``The Japanese are protected by the same Constitution  that  [[Page S515]]  protects us. An American citizen of Japanese descent has the same  rights as any other citizen. . . . If you harm them, you must first  harm me.''   He went on to lose his next election. I think it was to the U.S.  Senate. And I shudder to think what would have happened if people like  Governor Carr hadn't been there to stand for our highest ideals as a  country, or if survivors and their descendants and community leaders,  many of whom have close connections to Colorado to this day or who live  in Colorado to this day, hadn't worked for decades to preserve the site  and the memory of what happened there.   Thanks to their work, we now have the opportunity to give Amache the  recognition and resources it deserves. That is why I introduced this  bill, along with my colleague Senator Hickenlooper, to make Amache part  of the National Park System. This would ensure Amache has the legal  status and funding to preserve the site and the memory of what happened  there for years to come.   In the House, Congressmen Ken Buck and Joe Neguse introduced the  bill. Not everybody here would know this, but I know Congressman Buck  would know this. He and I ran against each other in 2009 and 2010. That  was a tough, tough, tough election, and I barely--barely--won. I barely  won. But I am proud to serve with Congressman Buck in the House and  Congressman Neguse in the House who also have come together, just like  me and Senator Hickenlooper, to support this bill.   This site is in Ken Buck's district in Prowers County. Ken won 74  percent of the vote there in 2020. By the way, I think I won 33 percent  in 2016, so Ken is outpacing me there. We don't agree on a lot, but we  agree 100 percent that this matters to our State and the legacy we want  to pass on to the next generation.   I have a list of 65 groups that support this bill: the Asian Chamber  of Commerce, the Colorado Council of Churches, the Colorado Municipal  League. If that weren't enough, the bill also has the support of the  chairman and the ranking member of the Environment and Natural  Resources Committee.   But today, there is 1 Senator out of 99--and it is not the senior  Senator from Texas--who is objecting to this bill.   This bill passed the House of Representatives with all but two votes.  We have 99 Senators on one side who support this and 1 objecting. I  have absolutely no idea why that one Senator is objecting, and I hope  that it is just a misunderstanding of some kind. We fight for a lot of  things on this floor, but there is a bipartisan tradition going back to  Teddy Roosevelt of both parties coming together to protect places that  matter to our heritage as a nation.   Amache matters to Colorado, and it matters to America. This is about  whether we are going to ignore the worst parts of our history or lift  them up and give future generations the opportunity to learn from them  so that we can move this country closer to our highest ideals.   So I hope that the Senator who is objecting to this bipartisan bill,  with massive support in both the House and Senate, that is of critical  importance to the State of Colorado, that doesn't touch or concern any  other State in the Union, except to the extent that people from those  States of the Union might someday like to come here and learn an  important episode in our country's history--I feel strongly about this,  in part, because my own mom and her family were dislocated by the same  war. They were living on the other side of the world in Poland. The  entire family was killed except for an aunt and my grandparents and my  mom. And she got here when she was 11 years old, which is probably the  same age as these young children here who were picked up from  their homes all across the Western United States and brought to a place  that they never had known before. It seems to me, the least we could  do, with this massive bipartisan support, is to pass this bill.    So as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 255, H.R.  2497; further, that the committee-reported amendment be agreed to; that  the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Madam President, I thank the senior Senator from Texas  who, in fact, is a noncombatant in this effort. And I am sorry that he  has had the misfortune of having to come out here and object.   I will say that Colorado and Utah are right next to each other, and I  faced the same travel issues that the Senator from Utah faces, I guess.  I hope he gets where he is trying to go, but I stayed here this evening  not because I objected to this but because I thought it was so  incredibly important for us to get this work done.   And I want the record to reflect that I actually didn't name the  Senator who objected, but the Senator from Texas did.   My fervent hope is that we can work this out because, really  importantly, we are having the anniversary of Franklin Roosevelt's  decision to inter these young people this month. And if we don't get  this back to the House of Representatives, we may miss that  anniversary, and people in Colorado would miss the chance to be able to  demonstrate that they are carrying this really important legacy  forward.   When I think about my mom's experience and the experiences here and  the country that these young men and women are growing up in who are  with us today, it just makes me think even more about how important all  of this is. And, Madam President, I can't think of anybody I would  rather have this discussion with than with you presiding in the Chair.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
