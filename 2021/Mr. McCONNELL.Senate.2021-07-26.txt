 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this weekend, we received the bad  news that our friend and former colleague, Mike Enzi, was involved in a  serious accident while riding his bicycle.   Mike's colleagues on both sides of the aisle were sorry enough to see  him depart the Chamber and begin his well-earned next chapter just a  few months ago. Mike and Diana were a fantastic Senate couple in every  respect, from major legislative accomplishments to the generosity and  kindness they showed to everyone from Senate staff to the pages. So I  know Members on both sides of the aisle are very much thinking of Mike  at this time. We pray for his health and for the entire Enzi family
