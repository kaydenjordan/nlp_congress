 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  H.R. 3525.   Yet again, I fear that this partisan legislation is a missed  opportunity to seriously address the humanitarian and security crisis  that exists today on our southern border.   All of us here today can agree that every human being is worthy of  dignity and respect.   As a physician, I understand the importance of efficient and  compassionate healthcare. At the same time, I understand firsthand how  difficult it would be to achieve the requirements that are outlined in  this bill.   Establishing an electronic health records system in any medical  system takes at least a year, in the best case scenario. In the  bureaucratic web of the Federal Government, this tedious task becomes  nearly impossible.   For years, Members of this House have been working to help the  Department of Veterans Affairs implement its electronic health records  system, yet the VA won't have this completed for another 9 years.   Quite frankly, requiring the Department of Homeland Security to  implement an interoperable electronic health records system for illegal  immigrants in 90 days--it is simply unrealistic.   Adding to the problem, this costly project would distract from other  pressing needs on the border. Our Customs and Border Protection law  enforcement agents are hardworking Americans who have been tasked with  an incredibly difficult job.                                time  1530    While protecting our country on the southern border, they are also  providing humanitarian aid to an unprecedented number of immigrants.  They need our help. They do not need Congress to add unnecessary and  unachievable burdens to their duties.   It is disappointing, but it is not surprising that House Democrats  have chosen this approach. Time and time again, we return to the floor  to debate partisan bills that will do nothing to address the underlying  cause of this crisis.   Rather than continuing to grandstand on the House floor, I encourage  my colleagues to, once again, return to the Committee on Homeland  Security to work on solutions that will secure the border, end asylum  loopholes, and protect our country.
