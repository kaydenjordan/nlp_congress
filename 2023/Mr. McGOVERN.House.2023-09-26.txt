 Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 426 of the  Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I make a  point of order against consideration of the rule, House Resolution 723.   Section 426 of the Budget Act specifically states that the Rules  Committee may not waive the point of order prescribed by section 425 of  that same act.   The first section of House Resolution 723 states that all points of  order against consideration of the bill are waived. Therefore, I make a  point of order pursuant to section 426 that this rule may not be  considered.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, decades ago, Republicans came up with a rule that  basically says that we cannot impose mandates on States and local  governments that will cost them significant amounts of money. That rule  is routinely waived, including in this rule.   Do you know what will cost States and local governments significant  amounts of money? A government shutdown.   The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimated that the 5-week  partial government shutdown in 2018-2019 reduced economic output by $11  billion in the following two quarters, including $3 billion that the  U.S. economy never regained. Moody's Analytics estimated that the 2013  full government shutdown reduced GDP growth by $20 billion. At the same  time of the 2013 shutdown, consumer confidence fell, threatening the  economic recovery following the Great Recession.   A shutdown this fall would jeopardize the improvements of consumer  confidence as inflation has returned to more normal levels. A  bipartisan congressional report found that the last three government  shutdowns led to the equivalent of 56,940 years in lost productivity  from Federal workers being furloughed. These lost work hours deprive  the American people of important public services, delayed furloughed  Federal employees from receiving backpay, and cost the government at  least $338 million in additional processing costs and late fees.   While Federal employees are guaranteed backpay during shutdowns, a  prolonged shutdown could mean multiple missed paychecks and strained  household budgets for these workers.   In 2013 and again in 2018, roughly 850,000 out of 2.1 million  nonpostal Federal employees were furloughed. Additionally, at the  beginning of the 2018-2019 partial shutdown, about 380,000 Federal  employees were furloughed and another 420,000 reported to work but went  unpaid.   Over 80 percent of Federal workers live and work outside of the D.C.  area, meaning that local economies across the country would be harmed  by Federal worker furloughs as families delay purchases or are forced  to miss regular bill payments.   Let's consider more impacts of the Republican shutdown and how it  will cost State and local governments. It would force servicemembers  and law enforcement officers to work without pay. Under a Republican  shutdown, all Active-Duty military personnel and many law enforcement  officers would remain at work but receive no pay until appropriated  funds are available.   It would endanger disaster response. A Republican shutdown would  create an increased risk that FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund is depleted  and would complicate new emergency response efforts  [[Page H4482]]  if additional catastrophic disasters occur. Funding for long-term  recovery projects would also remain halted, worsening ongoing delays as  FEMA awaits new appropriations.   It would undermine research on cancer and other diseases. A  Republican shutdown would stall critical research on diseases like  cancer and Alzheimer's disease because the National Institutes of  Health would be forced to delay new clinical trials. New patients, many  of whom are desperately waiting for a chance for a new treatment  through a clinical trial, would be turned away.   It would eliminate Head Start slots for kids. Under a Republican  shutdown, 10,000 children across the country would immediately lose  access to Head Start as the Department of Health and Human Services  wouldn't be able to award Head Start grants during a shutdown, with the  impacts only growing worse over time.   It would risk significant delays for travelers. Air traffic  controllers and TSA officers would have to work without pay,  potentially leading to significant delays and longer wait times for  travelers at airports across the country like there were during the  previous shutdown.   It would undermine public health and environmental protections. Most  EPA-led inspections at hazardous waste sites, as well as drinking water  and chemical facilities, would stop. EPA would halt oversight and  review of permits and plans to ensure safe water and clean air in  communities. Additionally, efforts to address dangerous contaminants  that are linked to severe health effects would be stopped. This would  be a disaster.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1800     Madam Speaker, the gentleman said the Democrats shut  down the economy during the pandemic. I should remind him that Donald  John Trump was the President of the United States and the Republicans  controlled the House.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's comments,  but I should remind him that the Republicans set an amendment deadline  on appropriations bills after the shutdown deadline, so don't tell me  you are interested somehow in avoiding a shutdown.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Boyle), the ranking member on the Budget Committee, to speak more  about that.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I would just say to my colleagues, I  have never seen such incompetence ever in this Chamber.   They say that they are against dilatory tactics. Yet they have only  passed one appropriations bill. Now they are going to try to rush 11  more in record time across the finish line. This should have happened  in June and July.   By the way, all these bills are so extreme that they are dead on  arrival. They are going nowhere.                                time  1815    Their Homeland Security appropriations bill, even if we pass it, they  are going to hold it at the desk until the Senate passes their  ridiculous border bill, H.R. 2, which they know is going nowhere. They  are not even sending that over to the Senate.   They are wasting all this time for what, I don't know, but in the  meantime, right now we should be considering a continuing resolution so  this government doesn't shut down.   I never thought I would ever be on the floor saying anything nice  about the Senate, but over there Democrats and Republicans are actually  talking to each other. They actually came to an agreement on a  continuing resolution, and hopefully they will act on it and they will  send it over here so we can end this nonsense.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 209,  nays 198, not voting 26, as follows:                               [Roll No. 404]                                 YEAS--209       Aderholt      Alford      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bean (FL)      Bentz      Bergman      Bice      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (NC)      Boebert      Bost      Brecheen      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Burchett      Burgess      Calvert      Cammack      Carey      Carl      Carter (GA)      Chavez-DeRemer      Ciscomani      Cline      Cloud      Clyde      Cole      Collins      Comer      Crane      Crawford      Curtis      D'Esposito      Davidson      De La Cruz      Diaz-Balart      Donalds      Duarte      Duncan      Dunn (FL)      Edwards      Ellzey      Emmer      Estes      Ezell      Fallon      Feenstra      Ferguson      Finstad      Fischbach      Fitzgerald      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flood      Foxx      Franklin, C.

A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.   Stated for:    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, forgive me, but what the hell is going on around here?  We just heard the gentleman from Texas scream talking points that sound  like they were written in Mar-a-Lago.   This is crazy. I can't believe I have to say this, but the Federal  Government of the United States is shutting down on Saturday because a  handful of MAGA Republicans didn't get everything they wanted. I have  to tell you, that is a bad thing. It is a bad thing for our country.   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are acting like  a shutdown is no big deal. Stop it. Stop it. This is not a mock  Congress. This isn't the Model U.N.   We are talking about real people's lives here. Shutdowns cost  taxpayer money. Shutdowns hurt the economy. Shutdowns mean people don't  get paid. Shutdowns are bad. Yet, Republicans are on the verge of  shutting down the government.   We have a Democratic President. We have a Democratic Senate. All we  need is this Republican House of Representatives to get their act  together, but they can't.   Their bumbling, incompetent leadership can't even do the basic job of  standing up to their extreme Members so we can keep the lights on.   It might have made sense for them to pass these appropriation bills  and send them to the Senate to iron out our differences if it were  still June or July. It is September.   They have spent months fighting with themselves, and now we are 4  days from our deadline. Have they ever looked at a calendar? Have they  ever heard of the concept of scheduling? Have they ever heard of clock  management?   You don't start a months-long process 4 days before the deadline, but  here we are, considering the most extreme, partisan, unhinged MAGA  messaging bills this majority could come up with.   My colleague from Texas talks about the border, the border, the  border. It is an important issue, but these bills cut funding for the  border. He cares so much about securing the border that he is willing  to--wait for it--defund the border.   Madam Speaker, they are not even sending their Homeland Security  appropriations bill to the Senate. What brilliant legislative mind came  up with this bright idea?   Let me explain what this rule does. The House is refusing to send  this bill to the Senate until the Republicans' extreme immigration bill  is signed into law, which is never going to happen.   What will happen because of all their nonsense is that the people who  actually work to secure the border will not get paid. This is nuts.   These bills are chock full of MAGA culture wars. Their agriculture  bill takes money away from food assistance for pregnant mothers and  newborns. I could spend all day talking about how awful these bills  are.   The bottom line is we have 4 days, and I am asking my Republican  colleagues: Do not shut this government down because you are all  fighting with yourselves. Do your job and keep the government open.  That shouldn't be too much to ask.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman from South Carolina says  we keep on talking about government shutdown, government shutdown. The  reason we do is because we listened to you.   On September 19 in the PBS Hour interview, you were asked: How likely  is a shutdown right now?   Your response was: It is 100 percent.   We have heard that from other Members.   The gentleman keeps on talking about the border. We believe the  border is a serious issue. The border is not open. Maybe people think  it is open because you guys keep on saying it is open. You are  signaling to people that it is open. It is not open, and we don't  believe it should be open. We don't view this issue as a political  talking point. We want to get results.   My friends on the other side of the aisle voted against a fiscal year  2023 government funding package that President Biden signed into law  that provided Border Patrol with $7.153 billion, a 17 percent increase  from the year before.   The funding package provided $65 million for 300 new Border Patrol  agents, $60 million for 125 new personnel at every point of entry, and  $230 million for technology, like the autonomous surveillance towers.  Does any of that sound like open borders?   Here is the kicker. House Republicans voted ``no.''   By the way, Mr. Norman, this bill does nothing about Mr. Mayorkas'  salary, but it does cut salaries for people who are working at the  border, Border Patrol agents.   The gentleman from Texas said that he wants the Senate to get their  act together.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a  press release from the chair of the Appropriations Committee, U.S.  Senator Patty Murray, who just announced that Democrats and Republicans  have come to a bipartisan agreement on a continuing resolution.    Madam Speaker, they are talking to each other. You  can't even get an agreement amongst Republicans--how pathetic.   Madam Speaker, at this time I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, breaking news, news flash, the Senate  just voted on cloture on the motion to proceed on the CR, 77-19. They  are working in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion to get this thing  done so we don't shut the government down.   What are my Republican friends doing?   They are still fighting amongst themselves. We don't even have a  draft of anything that they are proposing in terms of avoiding a  shutdown.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Mrs.  Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Pennsylvania  complaining about the mismanagement of this House of Representatives.  It is reinforcing our message. He can complain all he wants, but he  can't blame Speaker Pelosi, Joe Biden, or anybody but his own  leadership. I hate to tell him, but his party is in charge.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Boyle), the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, there is a pattern here that I have seen develop over  the years. When Republicans are in charge, the debt doesn't matter.  When Democrats are in charge, all of a sudden, the debt is the central  issue. It is funny, when Donald Trump, who I don't know how many  indictments he has against him at this particular point, how many  dozens of years in jail he faces if he is convicted, but when he was  President, he added $8 trillion to the debt, and there was silence from  the other side of the aisle. That was only in 4 years, by the way. It  is a little bit ironic to hear some of this back and forth here.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Business as usual for my Republican friends is more tax cuts for  corporations and millionaires and billionaires, slashing programs that  help the most vulnerable in our country, and subsidies to Big Oil  companies and more and more money to big defense contractors.   Let me just explain to some of my colleagues, especially the moderate  Republicans, if there are any of them left:   The ag appropriations bill, before the manager's amendment, which, by  the way, imposed even deeper cuts in some of these programs, slashes  WIC by $800 million. It reduces the value for WIC fruit and vegetable  vouchers by $1.2 billion, hurting both families and farmers.    It guts the Rural Energy for America Program by $500 million.   It guts rural electric investments in clean energy and energy  efficiency from the Inflation Reduction Act by $1 billion.   It eliminates a lifeline that has already helped more than 20,000  distressed farmers who have received assistance from the Inflation  Reduction Act.   It blocks FDA from acting on important tobacco issues, banning  menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars, and limiting the nicotine in  cigarettes.   It blocks the Biden executive orders on diversity, equality,  inclusion, and accessibility.   It reverses the 2023 FDA decision to allow mifepristone to be  dispensed in certified pharmacies with a prescription instead of only  hospitals, clinics, and medical offices.   This bill, made worse by a manager's amendment, guts food programs,  nutrition programs to our kids, to pregnant mothers and newborns.   What are they thinking? What sense does that make? How does anybody  on that side of the aisle vote for a bill that does that? To my  moderate friends, if they are still around, how do they do that? This  is unacceptable. By the way, read the fine print in these  appropriations bills, look at the programs they cut.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Lois Frankel).                                time  1930     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, for the gentleman to say that people on our side of  the aisle don't care about the fentanyl problem in this country, that  we don't care that our constituents are dying, that people are dying in  this country, that is offensive.   One of the reasons why people watching this debate despise Congress  at this moment is because of the characterizations that are made by the  gentleman.   I will tell you this: We believe we should fund our Border Patrol  agents. We believe we should do more to confront these issues. We don't  use these matters as a political football or political talking point.  To come down here and say that somehow we don't care, that is  offensive.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record an  article from CBS News titled: ``Government shutdown could jeopardize  U.S. credit rating, Moody's warns.''    Madam Speaker, months after Fitch Ratings downgraded  the U.S. credit rating, a Moody's analyst wrote that a shutdown ``would  underscore the weakness of U.S. institutional and governance strength  relative to other AAA-rated sovereigns that we have highlighted in  recent years.''   Extreme MAGA Republicans are embarrassing our country internationally  and exacerbating economic hardship at home when they openly brag about  how they would welcome a government shutdown.   Madam Speaker, this is the theater of the absurd. The gentleman comes  down here and talks about the border. Once again, his bill defunds  border security. Does he propose to secure the border through  volunteerism?   I am so sick of listening to the Republicans rant and rave about  spending. Joe Biden has added $1.8 trillion to the national debt. That  is a fact. Donald Trump, the last Republican President, added $8.2  trillion. Trump added as much in 4 years as his predecessor did in 8  years, and Republicans added $2 trillion to the debt with their tax  cuts for the rich.   Now, the so-called pro-life party has the nerve to try to cut WIC,  the women, infants, and children program, which helps provide food to  new moms and very young children.   Now, let me explain this to the gentleman from Texas and to my  Republican colleagues: Cutting funding for WIC means more malnourished  babies. Malnourished babies end up needing expensive healthcare. Who  pays the bill? It is Medicaid that pays. It is taxpayers who pay. In  fact, according to USDA, every dollar spent on WIC means $3 in taxpayer  savings.   Madam Speaker, what kind of twisted values would make someone think  it is a good idea to cut taxes on billionaires but a bad idea to fund  WIC, a program that saves money, a program that helps women, infants,  and children?   All of these appropriations bills that are being brought to the floor  at this last minute are so extreme that Republicans in the Senate won't  even support them. These bills shouldn't go over to the Senate. They  should go to a shredder.   Republicans want to gut programs that help seniors, gut programs that  help students, gut programs that help working people. Instead of trying  to do anything that helps anyone, they are obsessed with banning Pride  flags from flying at our embassies. What is wrong with them?   This is absurd. What is happening here is not governing.   Just so everyone is clear: All of this should have been done months  and months ago, and doing it now, 4 days before a shutdown and having  no plan to avoid a shutdown, is incompetence, pure and simple.   I just saw a tweet from a reporter about conference calls that are  going on amongst Republican Members, where Republicans are warning each  other about getting their list of priorities straight, trying to figure  out how you get to a deal, if you can get to a deal. They are saying we  need some organization. You are just having those conference calls now.   Let me just say that it is clear that my Republican friends have no  idea at all what they are doing. It is clear they have no plan to get  us out of this mess. My Republican friends need to move out of the way  and let serious people on both sides of the aisle do what we have to do  to clean up the GOP's mess and keep government funded.   The Senate right now has come to a bipartisan compromise. That is a  good thing. They are trying to avoid a shutdown that my friends on the  other side of the aisle in this Chamber don't seem to think is a big  deal. They will know it is a big deal when they shut the government  down and their constituents start calling and complaining about not  getting paid, about the services that are being cut. They will hear  loud and clear from their constituents--Democrats, Independents, and  Republicans.   Now is time for the adults in the room to figure this out. The Senate  has given us a way forward. We should take it.   When my friends say that they need more time to figure all this out,  what have they been doing? For months, what have they been doing?   We have had enough of this nonsense. We have had enough talk about  shutdowns. We need to work together in a bipartisan way, work in the  way that our constituents expect us to work to get things done, not to  shut things down, not to tear things apart, not to blow things up.   At the end of the day, we have our policy differences. When I look at  these appropriations bills, I can say honestly to my friends that we  don't share the same values. I don't understand how you can gut food  and nutrition programs. I don't even understand how you can cut border  security. I don't get the thinking behind all of that, but that is your  problem to work out.   In the meantime, let's come together and do the right thing. Let's  keep this government open.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
