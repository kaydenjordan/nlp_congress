 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak a truth, and that truth  is quite simple. I stand on the shoulders of giants.   I hail from Atlanta, which is the home of the King Center, a place  dedicated to the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., one of  America's greatest citizens. We honor him with a Federal holiday and  memorial on our National Mall, just outside of this Chamber.   I am also the heir to the seat held by the late, great John Lewis.  Congressman Lewis was by Dr. King's side, and Congressman Lewis  dedicated his life to peaceful nonviolence.   Congressman Lewis was a beacon in this Chamber for the dozens of  years that he served. It is one of the greatest honors of my life to be  able to complete the term for which he was last elected and take the  baton and bring his service across the finish line.   But I would be remiss if I did not use this opportunity to make sure  their lessons are known for generations to come.   That is why it is critical that we make sure we preserve the  buildings in metro Atlanta that give life to their work. We must  establish the former headquarters of the Southern Christian Leadership  Conference, where Dr. King did his work alongside Congressman Lewis, as  a National Historic Site.   If we do this, we can do our small part to ensure that those who  follow in our footsteps do so mindful of the example of these giants of  the civil rights movement.                            ____________________
