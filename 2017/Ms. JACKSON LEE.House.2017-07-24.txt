 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 3218, the ``Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act  of 2017.''   H.R. 3218 eliminates the current 15-year cap for veterans to use the  benefits provided in the GI Bill, therefore enabling future eligible  recipients to use their GI bill benefits for their entire lives.   This change would greatly aid our brave veterans in facilitating the  transition from active duty to civilian life by ensuring that veterans  have access to retraining at any point after service to meet the needs  of a changing economy.   Furthermore, H.R. 3218 would enhance GI Bill benefits for survivors  of military members killed during active duty by granting them access  to the Yellow Ribbon Program, which is a program that covers more costs  at private institutions of higher learning for eligible recipients.   By expanding access to financial assistance, this bill ameliorates  the often high cost barrier associated with higher education for  survivors of military members killed in the line of duty.   H.R. 3218 will also protect veteran's GI Bill benefits from the  closures of private, for-profit universities, a development that has  negatively impacted many student veterans across the nation.   Madam Speaker, our veterans deserve better than to see their hard- earned benefits lost, especially for events beyond their own control.   This bill also increases GI Bill benefits for nine additional months  for student veterans enrolled in STEM 5-year degree programs.   I am pleased that this bill gives our veterans the resources they  need to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the growing  technology industry.   Last, this bill would qualify post-9/11 Purple Heart recipients for  full GI Bill benefits.   It is imperative that service members whose active duty is cut short  due to an injury suffered in the line of fire have their heroic service  recognized fully when receiving GI Bill benefits.  [[Page H6170]]    H.R. 3218 corrects previous inequities faced by our nation's brave  veterans, and protects their future.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3218.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2364, which  authorizes financial institutions to invest more of their capital in  small business investment funds.   As it stands, federally insured banks and savings associations are  limited to investing a maximum of 5 percent of their capital and  surplus in Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC).   Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC) are private funds,  licensed and regulated by the Small Business Administration, that make  investments in small businesses using their own capital or loans  borrowed with an SBA guarantee.   Under H.R. 2364, financial institutions would be able to invest as  much as 15 percent of their capital and surplus in SBICs.   There are over 8 million small businesses in America, which account  for 54 percent of all U.S. sales.   Small businesses also provide 55 percent of all jobs and 66 percent  of all net new jobs since the 1970s.   With more than half of Americans either owning or working for a small  business, it is clear these companies are a vital part of our nation  economy.   As the representative for Houston, one of the leading cities for  entrepreneurs and small businesses, I remain mindful of the  significance of, and have strongly advocated for policies that will  preserve and create jobs and keep our nation's small business sector  strong.   When small firms are able to grow and thrive, we all benefit from  their innovations, job-creating power, and ability to make the U.S.  more competitive globally.   That is why I urge all members to join me in supporting H.R. 2364.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee and vigilant defender of our national security, I  rise in support of H.R. 3180, the ``Intelligence Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2018,'' which will provide the Intelligence Community (IC)  with the necessary resources and authorities to ensure they remain  capable of protecting and defending the United States.   This bill authorizes appropriations for Fiscal Year 2018 for vital  intelligence activities of the U.S. government, the Community  Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)  Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes.   H.R. 3180 comes at a critical time in the status of our national  security and the IC's ability to protect it.   As we continue to face a diverse and growing array of threats from  terrorist groups, hostile nation states, and questionable or  incompetent figures in the Trump administration, it is crucial that the  IC receive all the resources it needs to do its job while Congress has  the necessary tools to carry out rigorous oversight of its work.   This bill seeks to meet these challenges by supporting critical  national security programs, particularly those focused on countering  terrorism and cyberattacks.   Under H.R. 3180, the Director of National Intelligence will be  required to electronically publish an unclassified advisory report on  foreign counterintelligence and cybersecurity threats to federal  elections.   It also bolsters intelligence oversight by ensuring that IC  contractors can meet freely with Congress.   Lastly, this bill improves IC accountability to Congress by requiring  the IC to provide reports on:   Investigations of leaks of classified information;   Security clearance processing timelines;   The process for reviewing information about computer vulnerabilities  for retention or potential release;   And Russian influence campaigns directed at foreign elections and  threat finance activities.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3180 is a necessary response to the overwhelming  evidence pointing to a carefully planned and executed infiltration of  our 2016 Presidential Election by the Russian government and its  operatives.   The issue of cybersecurity, particularly with regards to our federal  election computer system infrastructure, has been of great concern to  me and the American public as more and more reports of Russian hacking  efforts have come to light.   In addition, the provision requiring reports on security clearance  processing timelines should shed light on the highly dubious and  inscrutable security clearances of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.   Donald Trump's blatant and irresponsible nepotism towards his  daughter and son-in-law have made us all vulnerable to Russian and  other foreign influence at the highest levels of our federal  government.   H.R. 3180 will give the American people what they crave and deserve:  clarity and transparency to pierce through the haze of cover-ups and  distractions surrounding the Trump Administration.   This bill also takes significant, much-needed steps to improve  benefits for members of the IC, such as increasing employee  compensation and authorizing $514 million in appropriations for the  CIA's Retirement and Disability System.   Congress must do its part to adequately recompense the patriotic  Americans who serve our nation through their work in the IC, especially  employees with disabilities, who make up 9 percent of the intelligence  workforce.   At the same lime, we must continue to ensure that Congress can  exercise oversight over and maintain transparency for the 17 agencies  that comprise the IC.   I am heartened that my Republican colleagues in the Intelligence  Committee are starting to see the light in recognizing the sinister  threat of Russian infiltration and White House collusion, both of which  endanger our nation's ability to practice and protect its core  democratic values.   I look forward to working with all Members of Congress to strengthen  our IC, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, within hours, the Senate will begin a  sinister unraveling of the safety net for millions of Americans--$774  billion cut from Medicaid--and they will throw on the ground some $200  billion that is just a bait to be able to bring votes in.   It was sad to see the administration speak today about having people  lose their lives because, without healthcare, they will. I ask the  Senate to vote ``no.'' Kill this bill.   It would be important if the President would also have an agenda--6  months and he has no jobs bill, no insurance, and no infrastructure  bill.   I hope also to restore constitutional integrity, and I expect to  introduce legislation dealing with preventing the President from firing  the special counsel and from abusing the pardon power to pardon people  who are under investigation.   I ask that we work together, and that is to save lives. Vote ``no''  on that Senate bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague Congresswoman  Plaskett for hosting this special order for members of the  Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) to speak about the first 6 months of  Republicans' failure to govern in the White House and in Congress.   Today marks 185 days since the inauguration of Donald Trump, and 203  days since the start of this Republican Congress.   Despite the countless promises Trump made to the American people, the  Trump presidency has been defined by chaos and incompetence from Day 1.   In addition to being mired in controversy, Trump lacks an agenda and  has no major accomplishments to tout after six months in office.   Following in the footsteps of their leader, Republicans in both  chambers of Congress have utterly failed to produce legislation that  actually improves the lives of everyday Americans in any meaningful or  measurable way.   Of the 43 bills that have been signed into law, 58 percent of these  were noncontroversial suspensions and 33 percent were partisan GOP  special-interest bills that strip vital protections away from the  American people.   The Republican leadership has demonstrated a remarkable incapacity to  actually lead their respective majorities in the House and Senate;  instead their ``leadership'' has been marred by empty legislation,  regressive policies, and damage control to rein in each new scandal  spiraling out from the White House.   On January 20, 2017, Trump restated his trademark campaign promise to  the American people: ``Together we will make America great again.''   Six months later, and that slogan rings hollower with each passing  day.   Six months later, he has forged virtually no deals; he has not  achieved his goal of ``insurance for everybody,'' nor has he put  forward a single jobs or infrastructure bill, nor has he achieved tax  reform, nor has he negotiated a single trade agreement.   Donald Trump promised that his extensive business experience would  lead to better deals for the American people, and that he would be the  ``greatest president for jobs that God ever created.''   Six months later, he has taken no action to support job creation or  grow the economy.   Instead, the Trump budget includes draconian cuts to education,  research, infrastructure, and other key areas that support job creation  and the American economy.   Before he entered office, Trump showed off his infamous ``deal-making  skills'' when he promised to make Carrier Corp. keep their furnace  factory jobs on American soil.   On the 6-month anniversary of his inauguration, Carrier announced  plans to cut 632 workers from the very Indianapolis factory Trump  visited last December.   These manufacturing jobs will move to Monterrey, Mexico, where  minimum wage is $3.90; the White House has not addressed this failure  of Trump's strong-man, isolationist economic policy.   During his campaign, Trump claimed that he would save the coal  industry--a sector that only employs 0.03 percent of the economy--and  in June, 2017, Scott Pruitt of the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) declared that the U.S. had miraculously created 50,000 coal jobs  since 2016.   This staggering figure turned out to be a staggering lie; according  to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the coal sector has added about  1,000 jobs since October, 2016; it appears as though Mr. Pruitt  ``miscalculated'' his estimate by 5,000 percent.   Not only have Trump's predictions for unparalleled job creation and  economic growth proved to be pipe dreams or outright lies--the White  House's budget proposal cruelly imposes drastic cuts to food stamps,  student loans, and disability payments among a host of critical  programs.   Trump promised that there would be no cuts to Social Security,  Medicare, or Medicaid--that everybody was going to be taken care ``much  better than they're taken care of now.''   Six months later, the Republicans do not have a plan that would  ensure all Americans have access to affordable, quality healthcare.   Six months later, the existing Trumpcare plan, which has completely  stalled in the Senate, would make 23 million Americans lose their  health coverage and increase costs for millions more.   Trumpcare cuts Medicare and Medicaid, and his budget proposal cuts  Social Security.   Trumpcare would allow discrimination against Americans with  preexisting conditions and imposes an age tax on older Americans.   Thousands of Americans--both Republicans and Democrats, conservatives  and liberals, old and young, healthy and sick--have cried out to their  Congressmembers to keep the Affordable Care Act and to prevent  Trumpcare from ever seeing the light of day.   Americans oppose Trumpcare by a three-to-one margin, but this  overwhelming majority sentiment seems to have fallen on deaf ears for  Donald Trump and the Republican leadership.   Trump also promised clean air and water in America.   Six months later, the Trump Administration and G.O.P. Congressmembers  are rolling back vital environmental protections.   In a move that drew universal ire from the international community  and concerned Americans, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate  Agreement.   He has signed executive orders rolling back the Clean Power Plan and  Clean Water Rule, and 37 Congressional Review Act bills, several of  which roll back environmental protections.   His budget proposal would seek to inflict a 31 percent cut to the EPA  and eliminates clean water programs for the Great Lakes and Chesapeake  Bay.   On the campaign trail, Trump made repeated declarations about  restoring national security and being ``tough on Russia.''   Six months later, Trump has failed to put forward a plan to defeat  ISIS or strategies to address the situations in Syria, Iraq, Somalia,  or Yemen.   Every week, a new report indicating collusion between the Trump  Administration and the Russian government seems to come to light.   American citizens and lawmakers alike have responded to this growing  list of scandals with growing anxiety, animosity, and exasperation.   In this and a few other respects, Trump has excelled.   For instance, he racked up 991 tweets since his inauguration; even  more impressive, he has made 836 false or misleading claims according  to the Washington Post's Fact Checker team.   He has spent a record 40 days at his own golf properties.   His approval rating is without equal at 36 percent--the worst of any  president ever at the 6-month mark.   To recap, Trump's legislative accomplishments total at exactly zero:   No plan to lower healthcare costs;   No jobs bill;   No infrastructure bill;   No tax reform;   No plan to avoid defaulting on our debt;   And no budget.   By stark contrast, former President Obama had made great strides at  this point in his presidency.   By the 6-month mark, Obama had:   Signed the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the American Recovery and  Reinvestment Act into law to improve protections for the American  worker;   Outlined an extensive new energy policy;   Published an op-ed piece in 30 global newspapers simultaneously to  discuss the growing economic crisis;   Passed an historic climate change bill through Congress;   Set out a new approach to Afghanistan and Pakistan;   Announced a new auto emission policy aimed at getting greener cars on  the road;   Launched his successful campaign to overhaul the U.S. healthcare  system;   And much more.   Americans want a President who can inspire them; they want a  President who can lead effectively, with all the dignity and tact  befitting the most powerful office in the world.   To our collective dismay and frustration, Trump and the Republicans  have been their own worst enemy in preventing major, commonsense  legislation from being voted on or signed into law.   I commend my colleague, Congresswoman Plaskett, for hosting this  special order examining the disastrous results that have resulted from  6 months of Republican control over our federal government.
