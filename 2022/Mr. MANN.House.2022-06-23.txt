 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to deliver the twelfth  installment of my Farm Bill Impact Series: The Second State of  Agriculture.   We are at the end of the second quarter, and one of the biggest  issues facing agriculture across the board is the cost of things.  Farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers are laboring under the  skyrocketing input costs while they work hard to keep our country fed,  fueled, and clothed. They deserve workable solutions to this inflation  crisis before the situation gets any worse.   The U.S. farm economy crashed in the early to mid-1980s due in part  to surging inflation. From 2000 to 2020, the average annual rate of  inflation was 2.1 percent, which economists consider a normal rate of  inflation that helps drive overall economic growth. Last year, prices  increased 7 percent overall throughout 2021, which was the largest  December-to-December percentage change since 1981.                                time  1045    Inflation is a matter of life and death for the American farm. We saw  it in the early 1980s, and now we are seeing it again. Farmers,  ranchers, and agricultural producers are feeling the effects of  inflation more acutely than almost anyone else in America.   In agriculture, commodity prices generally rise during periods of  inflation, but input costs rise as well. Data collected by USDA shows  that over the past three decades, on average, the input costs for U.S.  farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers tend to increase more  than the rate of inflation and more than the prices that they receive  for their products. To make matters worse, USDA estimates that input  costs will continue to rise at least 5 to 6 percent throughout 2022.   In the last 12 months, feed, supplies, and repairs are all up 13  percent while ag chemicals, building materials, and machinery are all  up 21 percent.   Most shockingly, just during the last 12 months, fuel is up 115  percent, natural gas is up 202 percent, and fertilizer is up 220  percent.   Think about that. This year it is costing farmers more than double  what it cost last year to farm their land.   The farm bill contains relief safety net programs like crop insurance  and livestock indemnity, but these programs don't account for the  rising costs of fuel, fertilizer, pesticides, and seed. Agriculture is  a business, and business owners can't afford to lose money year after  year, which is happening now thanks to skyrocketing inflation. We need  to get this situation under control.   A Kansas wheat grower recently said to me:   ``Fertilizer is one of the largest expenses on any commercial farming  operation. My farm has already used more than 450 tons of fertilizer  for this cropping season, which includes nearly 350,000 pounds of UAN,  specifically. Even though we cut back on how much we use because of the  increased price, it will still cost our farm almost $70,000 more than  last year. Looking forward, we will undoubtedly have to cut back on  fertilizer again until prices begin to come down.''   Fertilizer cost is a major problem, but the rising cost of everything  else is only compounding the issue further. For instance, if you are a  Kansas rancher looking to replace all the fence on your farm with 4- barb, Red Brand wire, last year you would have been quoted $10,000 per  mile. This year, quotes are coming in at around $20,000 a mile, so it  has doubled. Think about that.   From fertilizer to fuel to equipment to fencing, inflation is  crushing producers across this country. How can small business owners  keep up with this? How can we expect the people who bear the  responsibility of feeding, fueling, and clothing the world to shoulder  that burden while going broke from doing so?   The people who make sacrifices so that we can eat can't afford to buy  gas to drive their kids to school right now. They can't afford to pay  their mortgages. American farmers are perfectly capable of producing  plentiful, healthy affordable food, but no matter how much they grow  and sell, inflation is killing their margins and they are going out of  business.   How does the Biden administration respond to this crisis? Well, the  President's budget proposal dismantles the stepped-up basis and imposes  new capital gains taxes like the farm killer tax on small businesses  held in families for 90 years or more. These proposals would destroy  thousands of American family farms overnight. House Democrats, for  their part, would like to distract the Federal Reserve with social  policy while inflation is at a 40-year high.   These ideas are a slap in the face to every American farmer, rancher,  and agricultural producer. While this administration burns through  money like there is no tomorrow, American producers are working  tirelessly to keep America secure despite the effects of inflation on  their businesses. We owe them not only a debt of gratitude, but also  real solutions to the inflation crisis before it is too late.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of the  McGovern-Dole Food for Education and Childhood Nutrition Program, named  in part after a Kansas legend, the late Senator Bob Dole.   The McGovern-Dole program has provided 5.5 billion school meals  benefiting 31 million school-age children in 48 countries over the last  two decades, improving the food security, nutrition, literacy, and  primary education of these children and their families. When schools  closed due to COVID, the program distributed 23,000 metric tons of  commodities to more than 1.7 million children and their families. This  program is a success story of public-private partnership.   Representative McGovern and I have a resolution before the House  expressing this body's commitment to building on the success of the  McGovern-Dole program and supporting the American farmers, ranchers,  and agricultural producers who provide the commodities required for it  to function.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this resolution,  submit appropriation requests for funding, and ensure that this program  can continue to support nutrition and education for children around the  world.                            ____________________
