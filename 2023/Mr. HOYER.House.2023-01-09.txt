 Mr. Speaker, I lament that the 2 minutes are no longer  magic.   Mr. Speaker, these rules are largely the rules that we have had for  some period of time over the years, but they have important changes.  Unfortunately, I view those changes as not facilitating our work but  seeking to impede our work. I think that is unfortunate.   They are also designed to target Federal employees if Members of  Congress don't like what they do. There, of course, is a process to do  that, but as the leader on the other side did at one point in time, he  just cut out the salary for an employee he didn't like or thought was  acting improperly. That was not appropriate, and of course, that did  not prevail.   I regret that we don't have an opportunity to look at these rules in  the way that so many on this floor talked about doing.   First of all, of course, they are not single issues. There are a lot  of issues. It is the rules.   Secondly, there are ways and means to provide for consideration in a  transparent, open fashion in which I could offer an amendment to a rule  that I thought was not in the benefit of this House or the American  people.   Unfortunately, this is the process, which is the very first process  under which we have considered a piece of business, not necessarily  legislation, and that is ironic. It is what it is, but it will, as such  a process does, force us to vote against a piece of organizational  rules because we don't agree with some of those rules. That is what I  will do.                                time  1815     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and adopt  all the remarks he made in his opening statement.   This debate about IRS lends itself to being the most dishonest and  demagogic rhetoric that I have seen in the Congress at any point in  time.   I rise as the former chairman of the Treasury-Postal Committee, now  the Financial Services and General Government Committee to which I will  return having left the majority leader's spot.   This bill is a bad bill. Every small American taxpayer ought to be  for this bill because this bill will make sure that others pay their  fair share as they do.  [[Page H82]]    That is the issue. They are paying their fair share, as the chairman  noted, because we take it out of their salary. But the people who get  it through dividends and capital gains, et cetera, et cetera, aha, they  have got the lawyers, the accountants, and the people who can tell them  how not to pay their fair share.   This is a bill against small business. This is a bill against the  small taxpayer. This is against paying your fair share.
