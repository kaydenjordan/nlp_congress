 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1619) to clarify the status of gaming conducted by  the Catawba Indian Nation, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1619         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Catawba Indian Nation Lands       Act''.       SEC. 2. APPLICATION OF CURRENT LAW.         (a) Lands in South Carolina.--Section 14 of the Catawba       Indian Tribe of South Carolina Claims Settlement Act of 1993       (Public Law 103-116) shall only apply to gaming conducted by       the Catawba Indian Nation on lands located in South Carolina.        (b) Lands in States Other Than South Carolina.--Gaming       conducted by the Catawba Indian Nation on lands located in       States other than South Carolina shall be subject to the       Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) and       sections 1166 through 1168 of title 18, United States Code.       SEC. 3. REAFFIRMATION OF STATUS AND ACTIONS.         (a) Ratification of Trust Status.--The action taken by the       Secretary on July 10, 2020, to place approximately 17 acres       of land located in Cleveland County, North Carolina, into       trust for the benefit of the Catawba Indian Nation is hereby       ratified and confirmed as if that action had been taken under       a Federal law specifically authorizing or directing that       action.        (b) Administration.--The land placed into trust for the       benefit of the Catawba Indian Nation by the Secretary on July       10, 2020, shall--        (1) be a part of the Catawba Reservation and administered       in accordance with the laws and regulations generally       applicable to land held in trust by the United States for an       Indian Tribe; and        (2) be deemed to have been acquired and taken into trust as       part of the restoration of lands for an Indian tribe that is       restored to Federal recognition pursuant to section       20(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25       U.S.C. 2719(b)(1)(B)(iii)).        (c) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall--        (1) enlarge, impair, or otherwise affect any right or claim       of the Catawba Indian Nation to any land or interest in land       in existence before the date of the enactment of this Act;        (2) affect any water right of the Catawba Indian Nation in       existence before the date of the enactment of this Act;        (3) terminate or limit any access in any way to any right-      of-way or right-of-use issued, granted, or permitted before       the date of the enactment of this Act; or        (4) alter or diminish the right of the Catawba Indian       Nation to seek to have additional land taken into trust by       the United States for the benefit of the Catawba Indian       Nation.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, today is the first day of the month that is dedicated  to Native American heritage. As we all know, the United States'  historic treatment of our indigenous governments and peoples is fraught  with genocide, displacement, termination, and attempts to eliminate  Native American culture, language, and identity.   But as a Nation, we have also taken actions to remedy and to build  back from that sad history. In 1934, Congress recognized that  termination was the wrong policy and passed the Indian Reorganization  Act, which recognized Tribal governments and placed most remaining  Tribal land into trust. In 1975, we passed the Indian Self- Determination Act, which allowed Tribes to reassert their sovereignty  and jurisdiction over their own lands and programs intended to benefit  them, but the work is far from done.   Through bipartisan legislation we are debating today, and many other  legislative initiatives we will undertake this 117th Congress, we are  furthering Tribal recognition and reacquisition of Tribal homelands. We  are strengthening the consultation requirements to provide better  healthcare to the 70 percent of Native Americans living in urban areas.  In the infrastructure bill and Build Back Better Act, we will have  historic levels of funding for programs that meet the trust  responsibilities owed to Native Americans, promised to them as the  United States entered into treaties and took over their historic lands.   Our work today declares that it is not enough to just acknowledge  Native American heritage, we must also pass the legislation that  protects that heritage and strengthens Tribal sovereignty and self- determination.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Majority Leader Hoyer for scheduling  these bills to be heard today as we begin Native American Heritage  month. I especially want to thank Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member  Westerman for moving the bills through the Natural Resources Committee.   Madam Speaker, I wish to thank the sponsors of the bills and the  committee staff who dedicate themselves to getting things done on  behalf of the indigenous peoples of our country.   Madam Speaker, I will turn to H.R. 1619. The Catawba Indian Nation  Lands Act, introduced by Representative Clyburn of South Carolina, will  ratify and confirm the Department of the Interior's decision to take  into trust 17 acres of land in Cleveland County, North Carolina, for  the benefit of the Catawba Indian Nation.   The Catawba Indian Nation is the only Federally-recognized Tribe in  South Carolina, and its approximately 3,400 members reside primarily in  the Catawba River Valley. The current Catawba Reservation is made up of  multiple parcels of land in South Carolina, totaling about 700 acres.   To improve the Tribal economy and meet the needs of Tribal members,  the Catawba Nation petitioned the Department of the Interior to place  approximately 17 acres of land, known as the Kings Mountain site, into  trust in Cleveland County, North Carolina, for gaming and other  purposes.   On March 12, 2020, the Department of the Interior accepted the  Catawba Indian Nation's request to transfer the land into trust. The  Department's decision derived from the terms of the Catawba Indian  Tribe of South Carolina Land Claims Settlement Act of 1993, which ended  the Nation's fight against the State of South Carolina in its assertion  of aboriginal land claims.   The Act not only restored the Federal trust relationship between the  Nation and the Federal Government, but it also contained various  provisions about the trust acquisition of land by the Secretary of the  Interior, the use of such land for gaming, and the applicability of the  Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.  [[Page H6040]]    Following the announcement of the Department of the Interior's  decision, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians filed a suit against it  to block the Nation's plans to construct a casino complex at the Kings  Mountain site.   Among other assertions, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians claims  that the project will encroach upon its aboriginal territory. However,  the historical records demonstrate the Kings Mountain site is within  the aboriginal and historical lands of the Catawba Nation.   H.R. 1619 will thus reaffirm the Department of the Interior's  recognition of Catawba Indian Nation's historical and ancestral ties to  the lands in Kings Mountain and the Catawba Nation's right to conduct  gaming operations on those lands under the terms of the Indian Gaming  Regulatory Act.   The legislation will provide much-needed economic development  opportunities to the Nation and the surrounding local communities.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Clyburn for championing this  bipartisan legislation, and I urge its quick adoption. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Madam Speaker, I think that we have heard today about the importance  of how we are, in essence, making history by undoing a little bit of  the unfortunate history of the United States. This small parcel of  land, which will be taken into trust, will yield significant benefits  for the Tribe.   I do appreciate the fact that, like all the legislation we are  considering today, it is bipartisan and that all of those who are  supporting it recognize the benefits that it will bring to the Catawba  Nation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2758) to provide for the recognition of the Lumbee  Tribe of North Carolina, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2758         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2758, the Lumbee Recognition Act, introduced by  Representative Butterfield from North Carolina, will extend Federal  recognition to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina.   With approximately 60,000 members, the Lumbee Tribe is the largest in  North Carolina, the largest Tribe east of the Mississippi River, and  the ninth largest Tribe in the Nation.   In 1885, the Lumbee Tribe was recognized by the State of North  Carolina.  [[Page H6042]]  The Tribe then sought Federal recognition from the United States in  1889 and has been pursuing its recognition ever since.   Over the past 130 years, numerous bills have been introduced in  Congress to federally recognize the Lumbee people, resulting in a  significant record of hearing transcripts and committee reports. In  addition, numerous studies have been undertaken in academia on Lumbee  ancestry, including reports filed by the Department of the Interior on  the Tribe's validity.   All of these documents and these reports consistently conclude one  thing: The Lumbee people are indeed a distinct, self-governing  community that has been continuously and undeniably present in the  Robeson County area. However, in 1955, when the Lumbee Tribe once again  sought Federal recognition, the U.S. Government was actively  terminating its relationship with Tribal governments.   To that end, the Department of the Interior recommended that Congress  amend the recognition legislation to deny eligibility for the benefits  and services available to the Tribe after becoming recognized under the  bill. Congress then enacted this amended legislation in 1956, which had  the effect of simultaneously federally recognizing the Lumbee Tribe and  effectively terminating that recognition.   In 1987, the Lumbee Tribe attempted to restore their Federal  recognition through the Federal acknowledgment process at the  Department of the Interior. However, the Department determined that the  Tribe was ineligible to participate in the Federal acknowledgment  process because Congress, according to the 1956 act, had terminated its  relationship with the Tribe. Therefore, only Congress could restore  that relationship. This is what the enactment of H.R. 2758 will  accomplish.   Federal recognition is the formal establishment of a government-to- government relationship between the United States and a Tribal nation.  Its importance to Tribes cannot be overstated.   Federal recognition allows a Tribe to reestablish its homelands and  place that land into trust for future generations. Recognizing Tribes  as sovereign entities enables Tribal governments to manage resources,  including local jurisdiction and taxation issues. Recognition also  entitles Tribal citizens to distinctive benefits, including eligibility  to participate in many Federal programs, including for healthcare and  education.   That is why the enactment of this legislation is vital to the Lumbee  Tribe. Let's keep in mind that the Lumbee Tribe has been seeking formal  Federal recognition for over 100 years. Now is the time.   Other Tribes that were terminated by congressional action had come  before Congress and had their relationship reestablished through  legislation. After a century of inaction, it is finally time that we  extend Federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representative Butterfield for  championing this bipartisan legislation. I urge its quick adoption, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for  time, and I would inquire whether my colleague has any remaining  speakers on their side.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I, too, want to thank Mr. Bishop,  Mr. Butterfield, Mr. Westerman, and Mr. Grijalva for championing this  legislation so that we may today undo 100 years of injustice.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1975) to take certain land located in San Diego  County, California, into trust for the benefit of the Pala Band of  Mission Indians, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1975         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Pala Band of Mission Indians       Land Transfer Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. TRANSFER OF LAND IN TRUST FOR THE PALA BAND OF                     MISSION INDIANS.         (a) Transfer and Administration.--        (1) Transfer of lands into trust.--If, not later than 180       days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Tribe       transfers title to the land referred to in subsection (b) to       the United States, the Secretary, not later than 180 days       after such transfer, shall take that land into trust for the       benefit of the Tribe.        (2) Administration.--The land transferred under paragraph       (1) shall be part of the Pala Indian Reservation and       administered in accordance with the laws and regulations       generally applicable to land held in trust by the United       States for an Indian Tribe.        (b) Land Description.--The land referred to in subsection       (a)(1) is the approximately 721.12 acres of land located in       San Diego County, California, generally depicted as ``Gregory       Canyon Property Boundary'' on the map titled ``Pala Gregory       Canyon Property Boundary and Parcels''.        (c) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall--        (1) enlarge, impair, or otherwise affect any right or claim       of the Tribe to any land or interest in land that is in       existence before the date of the enactment of this Act;        (2) affect any water right of the Tribe in existence before       the date of the enactment of this Act; or        (3) terminate or limit any access in any way to any right-      of-way or right-of-use issued, granted, or permitted before       the date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Restricted Use of Transferred Lands.--The Tribe may not       conduct, on the land taken into trust for the Tribe pursuant       to this Act, gaming activities--        (1) as a matter of claimed inherent authority; or        (2) under any Federal law, including the Indian Gaming       Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) and regulations       promulgated by the Secretary or the National Indian Gaming       Commission under that Act.        (e) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:        (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.        (2) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Pala Band of       Mission Indians.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1975, the Pala Band of Mission Indians Land  Transfer Act of 2021, introduced by Representative Issa from  California, will direct the Secretary of the Interior to take 721.12  acres of land into trust for the Pala Band of Mission Indians.   The Pala Band of Mission Indians is located in northern San Diego  County with 918 enrolled members. Members of the Pala Band belong to  the Cupeno and Luiseno Tribes who were forced together by Spanish  Franciscan missionaries during the 1800s.   The Pala Band recently purchased property that includes the remaining  portion of Gregory Mountain that is not on the existing Pala Band  Reservation and other sacred and culturally significant sites in  Gregory Canyon. The land was purchased to protect and preserve Gregory  Mountain, Medicine Rock, and other sites considered sacred by Luiseno  Tribes.   Taking land into trust is an integral part of the government-to- government relationship between the U.S. Government and Tribal  governments. By maintaining Tribal lands, Tribal governments can  protect and preserve their ancestral homelands or sacred sites  considered culturally significant.   This bill takes 721.12 acres into trust for the benefit of the Pala  Band, ensuring that the sacred sites and cultural history located on  those lands will be honored appropriately and safeguarded. The bill  also stipulates that current  [[Page H6044]]  land and water rights are not affected by its enactment, nor are any  rights-of-way or rights of use that are currently permitted.   Lastly, the Pala Band may not conduct any gaming activities on the  land.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representative Issa for championing  this bipartisan legislation, and I urge its quick adoption. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I do want to thank Representative  Issa, Representative Westerman, and Chair Grijalva for moving this  bipartisan bill forward and taking the action that is required at this  time to ensure that the Pala Band of Indians can, indeed, control this  land for their sacred and cultural sites.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5221) to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement  Act to establish an urban Indian organization confer policy for the  Department of Health and Human Services.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5221         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Urban Indian Health Confer       Act''.       SEC. 2. URBAN INDIAN ORGANIZATION CONFER POLICY.          Section 514(b) of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act       (25 U.S.C. 1660d) is amended to read as follows:        ``(b) Requirement.--The Secretary shall ensure that the       Service and the other agencies and offices of the Department       confer, to the maximum extent practicable, with urban Indian       organizations in carrying out--        ``(1) this Act; and        ``(2) other provisions of law relating to Indian health       care.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 5221, the Urban Indian Health Confer Act,  introduced by Natural Resources Chair Raul Grijalva from Arizona will  require agencies and offices within the United States Department of  Health and Human Services, or HHS, to confer with Urban Indian  Organizations, or UIOs, on policies and initiatives related to  healthcare for American Indians and Alaska Natives.  [[Page H6045]]    The Indian Health Care Improvement Act established Urban Indian  Organizations in response to many American Indians and Alaska Natives  living in urban areas and seeking healthcare. Today, approximately 70  percent of all American Indians and Alaska Natives live in urban areas.   The Indian Health Service supports contracts and grants to 41 UIO  programs that offer medical services ranging from dental care,  optometry, pharmacy services, and community services, such as alcohol  and drug abuse prevention, nutrition education, and counseling.   An urban confer policy at HHS will serve as the preferred method of  dialogue between the agency and UIOs. Currently, the Indian Health  Service is the only agency that maintains a legal obligation to confer  with UIOs. This limited scope serves as a barrier for UIOs to  communicate with other agencies and offices within HHS.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, the issues with this limited confer  policy were, sadly, highlighted. Despite congressional and Tribal  support for the inclusion of UIOs and the agency's vaccine allocations,  HHS refrained from initiating communications with them. As a result,  UIOs were unable to provide input on the vaccine rollout allocations  until the deadline, which delayed the vaccine's distribution to many  urban American Indians and Alaska Natives.   The failure to communicate with UIOs about healthcare policies that  impact urban Indian communities is inconsistent with the Federal trust  responsibility and contrary to sound public health policy.   H.R. 5221 will establish direct lines of communication for UIOs  across the entire Department and ensure that urban American Indians and  Alaska Natives are aware of significant healthcare policy changes.   I want to thank Chair Grijalva for championing this critical  bipartisan legislation. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the bill and  I urge quick adoption. I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                   Washington, DC, October 26, 2021.      Hon. Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,      Chair, Committee on Education and Labor, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Scott, I write to you concerning H.R. 5221, the       ``Urban Indian Health Confer Act.''        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Education and Labor. I acknowledge that your Committee will       not formally consider H.R. 5221 and agree that the inaction       of your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in the       bill that fall within your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction.        I am pleased to support your request to name members of the       Committee on Education and Labor to any conference committee       to consider such provisions. I will ensure that our exchange       of letters is included in the Committee Report and the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work with you as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Raul M. Grijalva,      Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Education and Labor,                                   Washington, DC, October 21, 2021.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva: I write concerning H.R. 5221, the       Urban Indian Health Confer Act. This bill was primarily       referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and       additionally to the Committee on Education and Labor. As a       result of Leadership and the Committee on Natural Resources       having consulted with me concerning this bill generally, I       agree to forgo formal consideration of the bill so the bill       may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee on Education and Labor takes this action with       our mutual understanding that by forgoing formal       consideration of H.R. 5221, we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and we will be appropriately consulted and       involved as the bill or similar legislation moves forward so       we may address any remaining issues within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I also request that you support my request to       name members of the Committee on Education and Labor to any       conference committee to consider such provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate a response confirming this       understanding and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the Committee Report filed by       the Committee on Natural Resources and in the Congressional       Record during floor consideration of H.R. 5221.            Very truly yours,                                         Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,      Chairman.                                   ____                                            House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                   Washington, DC, November 1, 2021.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chair, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Pallone: I write to you concerning H.R. 5221,       the ``Urban Indian Health Confer Act.''        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy       and Commerce. I acknowledge that your Committee will not       formally consider H.R. 5221 and agree that the inaction of       your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in the       bill that fall within your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction.        I am pleased to support your request to name members of the       Committee on Energy and Commerce to any conference committee       to consider such provisions. I will ensure that our exchange       of letters is included in the Committee Report and the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work with you as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Raul M. Grijalva,      Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                   Washington, DC, November 1, 2021.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chairman, Committee on National Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva: I write concerning H.R. 5221, the       ``Urban Indian Health Confer Act,'' which was additionally       referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce.        In recognition of the desire to expedite consideration of       H.R. 5221, the Committee agrees to waive formal consideration       of the bill as to provisions that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee. The Committee takes this       action with the mutual understanding that we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. I also request that       you support my request to name members of the Committee to       any conference committee to consider such provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter       into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of       the measure.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.                                time  1645     Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the chairman of  the Natural Resources Committee.    Madam Speaker, I want to, once again, thank  Ranking Member Westerman, as well as Ranking Member   Don Young and  Chair Grijalva, for bringing forth this legislation. It addresses  immediately something that we saw that had lingered, but the pandemic  shown its ugly light on what happens when we let things linger and do  not deal with them. This legislation fixes that. It highlights the  importance of communication, of cooperation, and the confer policy that  must be adopted across all of our agencies, not only at HHS.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3616) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to  conduct a study to assess the suitability and feasibility of  designating certain land as the Bear River National Heritage Area, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3616         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3616, the Bear River  National Heritage Study Act, introduced by my Natural Resources  Committee colleague, Representative Blake  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this bill. I look forward to listening to the many interconnected and  complex stories that will come out of this study and to perhaps  visiting the heritage area in the near future. I urge my colleagues to  support the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 108) to authorize the Seminole Tribe of Florida to  lease or transfer certain land, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 108         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. APPROVAL NOT REQUIRED TO VALIDATE CERTAIN LAND                     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLORIDA.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law, without further approval, ratification, or authorization       by the United States, the Seminole Tribe of Florida may       lease, sell, convey, warrant, or otherwise transfer all or       any part of the interest of the Seminole Tribe of Florida in       any real property that is not held in trust by the United       States for the benefit of the Seminole Tribe of Florida.        (b) Trust Land Not Affected.--Nothing in this section--        (1) authorizes the Seminole Tribe of Florida to lease,       sell, convey, warrant, or otherwise transfer all or any part       of an interest in any real property that is held in trust by       the United States for the benefit of the Seminole Tribe of       Florida; or        (2) affects the operation of any law governing leasing,       selling, conveying, warranting, or otherwise transferring any       interest in any real property that is held in trust by the       United States for the benefit of the Seminole Tribe of       Florida.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, S. 108, introduced by Senator Rubio of Florida, will  allow the Seminole Tribe of Florida to lease, sell, convey, warrant, or  transfer its real property that is not held in trust by the United  States.   The Seminole Tribe of Florida is a federally recognized Tribe with  its Tribal headquarters located in Hollywood, Florida. It is one of  three federally recognized Seminole entities, and many of its enrolled  members reside on its six reservations in Florida.   In recent decades, a large portion of the Tribe's economic  development strategy has been its investment in commercial real estate  properties. So far the Tribe owns one of the largest cattle operations  in the U.S., along with the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino franchise and  its 74 international properties.   To manage the Tribe's growing portfolio, the Tribal Council  established a commercial real estate investment fund to help create  generational stability for the Seminole Tribe. Ultimately, the Tribe's  hope is to establish a State-chartered subsidiary entity to act as a  holding company for certain properties owned by the Tribe.   Unfortunately, the Tribe has been unable to move forward with this  project due to concerns raised by lenders and proposed title insurance  companies about the Indian Nonintercourse Act.   The act prohibits any ``purchase, grant, lease, or other conveyance  of lands, or of any title or claim thereto, from an Indian nation or  Tribe of Indians'' unless authorized by Congress.   At least two title insurance companies approached by the Tribe have  interpreted the act to apply to real estate owned by a State-chartered  subsidiary entity of the Tribe. As such, the title companies will not  insure the mortgage without an exemption from the act, which in turn  effectively kills any ability to finance an acquisition.   S. 108 will, therefore, provide relief from the Indian Nonintercourse  Act by clarifying that the Seminole Tribe of Florida has the authority  to lease, sell, convey, warrant, or otherwise transfer their interests  in property not held in trust by the Federal Government without further  approval from the Federal Government.   This bipartisan effort is led in the House by the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Soto), who is the sponsor of the House companion bill. I  congratulate him on his strong advocacy to get this legislation to the  President's desk.   S. 108 will allow the Seminole Tribe the ability to continue its  economic development, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am grateful for this bipartisan  legislation. I also think it gives us a path forward on what we might  need to do for all Tribes who encounter this issue, but for now I am  very much in support of S. 108 and urge my colleagues to support the  legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4881) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to  take into trust for the Pascua Yaqui Tribe of Arizona certain land in  Pima County, Arizona, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4881         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.          This Act may be cited as the ``Old Pascua Community Land       Acquisition Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:  [[Page H6049]]         (1) Compact-designated area.--The term ``Compact Designated       Area'' means the area south of West Grant Road, east of       Interstate 10, north of West Calle Adelanto, and west of       North 15th Avenue in the City of Tucson, Arizona, as provided       specifically in the Pascua Yaqui Tribe--State of Arizona       Amended and Restated Gaming Compact signed in 2021.        (2) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Pascua Yaqui Tribe       of Arizona, a federally recognized Indian tribe.        (3) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian Tribe''--        (A) means any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other       organized group or community, including any Alaska Native       village that is recognized as eligible for the special       programs and services provided by the United States to       Indians because of their status as Indians; and        (B) does not include any Alaska Native regional or village       corporation.        (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 3. LAND TO BE HELD IN TRUST.         Upon the request of the Tribe, the Secretary shall accept       and take into trust for the benefit of the Tribe, subject to       all valid existing rights, any land within the Compact-      Designated Area that is owned by Tribe.       SEC. 4. APPLICATION OF CURRENT LAW.         Gaming conducted by the Tribe in the Compact-Designated       Area shall be subject to--        (1) the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et       seq.); and        (2) sections 1166 through 1168 of title 18, United States       Code.       SEC. 5. REAFFIRMATION OF STATUS AND ACTIONS.         (a) Administration.--Land placed into trust pursuant to       this Act shall--        (1) be a part of the Pascua Yaqui Reservation and       administered in accordance with the laws and regulations       generally applicable to land held in trust by the United       States for an Indian Tribe; and        (2) be deemed to have been acquired and taken into trust on       September 18, 1978.        (b) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall--        (1) enlarge, impair, or otherwise affect any right or claim       of the Tribe to any land or interest in land in existence       before the date of the enactment of this Act;        (2) affect any water right of the Tribe in existence before       the date of the enactment of this Act;        (3) terminate or limit any access in any way to any right-      of-way or right-of-use issued, granted, or permitted before       the date of the enactment of this Act; or        (4) alter or diminish the right of the Tribe to seek to       have additional land taken into trust by the United States       for the benefit of the Tribe.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4881, the Old Pascua Community Land Acquisition  Act, introduced by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the  Natural Resources Committee Chair, will direct the Secretary of the  Interior to take approximately 30 acres of land into trust for the  Pascua Yaqui Tribe.   The Pascua Yaqui Tribe is located in southern Arizona, near the city  of Tucson, and has approximately 22,000 enrolled Tribal members, with a  2,216-acre reservation.   Before the Federal recognition of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, Yaqui  leaders, local leaders, and others worked together to establish a home  for Tribal citizens. In 1921 these efforts led to the formal Pascua  Village in Tucson, Arizona.   Before the formal Federal recognition and the establishment of a  reservation in 1978, former Congressman Mo Udall of Arizona introduced  a bill to establish 202 acres of land southwest of Tucson to the Pascua  Yaqui Association.   While many families relocated to this new land base, many other  families remained in the Pascua Village, known as Old Pascua. With the  growing city of Tucson and the geographic distance from the formal  reservation, the Tribe has worked to ensure the Tribal members living  within the Pascua Village have remained cared for, including working  with the Bureau of Indian Affairs to designate Old Pascua as near- reservation lands.   Earlier this year, the Tribe entered into a State-negotiated compact  with the State of Arizona to provide gaming activities in the Old  Pascua community. The Secretary of the Interior approved the compact in  May 2021.   Further, the Tribe signed an intergovernmental agreement with the  city of Tucson to transfer a parcel of land within Tucson into trust  for the benefit of the Tribe.   This bill ensures the Old Pascua community remains intact with the  Tribe's homelands, and the bill will allow the Tribe to conduct gaming  activities, expand economic development opportunities, and engage in  cultural practices on their historic land.   I am pleased to cosponsor H.R. 4881, which is a bipartisan bill, with  support from the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, the city of Tucson, the State of  Arizona, and the Arizona delegation. I support the Old Pascua Community  Land Acquisition Act, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the  bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the chair of the  Natural Resources Committee.    Madam Speaker, this bill, once again,  demonstrates that there is strong bipartisan support for our Native  American tribes and indigenous communities. I thank Ranking Member  Westerman as well as Ranking Member   Don Young on the Subcommittee for  Indigenous Peoples of the United States.   The other thing this bill does, as has been highlighted by Chairman  Grijalva, is it comes out of collaboration and conversation with  everybody on the ground, the local communities, the States, the county,  the Tribe. The people of southern Arizona are asking us to take action,  and that is what we must do today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2088) to take certain Federal lands in Tennessee  into trust for the benefit of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2088         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 2088, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Historic Lands Reacquisition  Act, introduced by Representative Fleischmann from Tennessee, takes  specified lands and easements in Monroe County, Tennessee, into trust  for the use and benefit of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.   These areas include the Sequoyah Museum, the Chota Memorial, the  Tanasi Memorial, and land to support these properties and cultural  programs.   The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is one of three federally  recognized Cherokee Tribes and is the only federally recognized Tribe  in North Carolina.   The Eastern Band's ancestral homeland includes substantial parts of  seven eastern States, including Tennessee. The 57,000-acre Qualla  Boundary is the name of the Cherokee Indian Reservation in North  Carolina.   In 1979, the completion of the Tellico Dam by the Tennessee Valley  Authority caused large areas of the Eastern Band's ancestral lands  along the Little Tennessee River to be flooded, completely submerging  the sacred sites and archaeological remains of the historic Overland  Cherokee towns, including the Cherokee capitals of the 1700s.   The Eastern Band can never recover these flooded lands and sites.  Especially with that loss in mind, it is important to recognize that  there are other locations in the area that require protection and  preservation, and we can do that today.   H.R. 2088 helps this cause by transferring approximately 76 acres of  historically significant lands from the TVA to the U.S. Government to  be held in trust for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. It also  grants two permanent easements over TVA property to be held in trust  for the Tribe to create recreational trails between the sites.   This legislation will give the Eastern Band greater control over  their historic homelands and the opportunity to memorialize the history  and culture of the Cherokee people.   I support H.R. 2088, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of  this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I once again thank Ranking Member Westerman for his support of this  package of bipartisan bills that we have brought to the floor today.   It is historic that we begin this month with this commitment to these  bills and to getting them passed in a bipartisan manner.   I thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann) for his work  and for the bipartisan support we have today on this floor for cultural  preservation of Tribal sites.   The idea that we are committed to safeguard--that is such a beautiful  word he used--the stories and places of sacred importance to Tribes  because we know that too often they are overrun with other interests,  that they take over, and they lose those sacred sites.   I am so grateful to all of you for the support of this legislation  and the other pieces of legislation that we have brought forward today,  which we emphasize, and we dedicate ourselves to a new era where we are  working to protect sacred sites, where we are making sure that the  healthcare of Indian Tribes is maintained and improved in our urban  areas.   It is a very good day on the floor.   I urge all my colleagues to support this bill and all eight bills we  have brought forward today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
