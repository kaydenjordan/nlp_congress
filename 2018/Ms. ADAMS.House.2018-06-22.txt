 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the thousands of  families being ripped apart by President Trump. Like the majority of  Americans, I vehemently oppose Trump's cruel and immoral zero-tolerance  policy.   In less than 2 months, nearly 2,000 children have been snatched from  their parents. Why? Because this administration is willing to use  toddlers as bargaining chips for a wall.   This Trump-created nightmare is absolutely unacceptable. This  executive order does nothing to stop immigrant families from being  detained. What a shame.   Congress has the responsibility to act and create a bipartisan  solution. The Ryan immigration bill is not that. It codifies hatred,  putting families at greater risk.   I urge my colleagues to abandon this hyperpartisanship and find a way  to keep all families together and to reunite these children with their  parents.                            ____________________
