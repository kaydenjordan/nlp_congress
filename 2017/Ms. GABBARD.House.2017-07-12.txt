 Mr. Speaker, net neutrality is something that is  fundamental to our country. It is rooted in our First Amendment rights.  It allows for an open marketplace, exchange of ideas, center for  innovation, hub for communication, and so much more.   In today's digital age, especially, ensuring an open, free, and equal  internet for all--not just for those who can afford to pay to play--is  crucial to level the playing field for everyone.   The FCC's current proposal rolls back these freedoms for the benefit  and profit of big internet service providers on the backs of students,  entrepreneurs and innovators, small businesses, and all of us. Millions  across the country have already sent in comments to the FCC expressing  their strong opposition.   On today's net neutrality day of action, I encourage everyone to make  their voices heard. In just 5 days, the FCC public comment period  closes. Now is the time for us to raise our voices to protect net  neutrality, fairness, and equality for all.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, too often we hear about human trafficking  and sex slavery. It is often dismissed as a crime that only happens  ``over there''--overseas or in a foreign country.   The Global Slavery Index estimated that nearly 46 million people  across 167 countries were victims of human trafficking in 2016. This  problem is very real. But here at home, it is also a problem, where we  have children and young people who are forced or coerced into sex work  and hard labor in our communities all across the country.   As America's gateway to Asia, my home State of Hawaii sees an  unprecedented number of people taken from their homes to be exploited  here on our shores. In 2010, the FBI freed 400 Thai nationals from a  Hawaii farm, the largest human trafficking case in our modern history.   In Hawaii, I know personally of girls as young as 11 and 13 years old  who were recruited from schools, malls, beaches, and other places, and  exploited by traffickers. While every State, including Hawaii, has  passed legislation to ban trafficking and classify it as a felony,  clearly stronger, further action is needed to combat this modern,  international slave trade.   This bill, the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and  Protection Reauthorization Act, will do many things, including  expanding programs to help educators recognize and respond to signs of  human trafficking in minors to try to prevent this abuse and support  local law enforcement as they identify prosecutors who will focus on  cases involving sex and slave trafficking.   I strongly support this legislation and urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' to give these innocent men, women, and children a chance for  safe, proactive, and healthy lives in our communities.
