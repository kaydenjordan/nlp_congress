 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  speak for up to 10 minutes.    Mr. President, the Senate is in a bad spot. In the  first 2 years of President Trump's Presidency, there were 128 times  that the President sent over a nomination and the minority party has  said: We want additional time to be able to debate those folks.   These are individuals who have already gone through vetting at the  White House. They have already gone through FBI checks. They have  already come to the committee. They have done full vetting at the staff  level, then had a full hearing at the Member level, and then had  questions for the Record. They passed out of the committee, then had a  lapse of time, and then a majority vote was set up to be able to move  them. At that time, there was a request for additional time 128 times.   Just to do a quick comparison of how common that is--because folks  say this is normal and this is the way the Senate functions all the  time--for President Obama, in his first 2 years, that happened 12  times. For President Bush, that happened a total of 4 times. For  President Clinton, that happened a total of 8 times. But for President  Trump, it happened a total of 128 times.   This is a new way of operation for the Senate, and I really should  say it is a new way of not operating for the Senate. It is an issue  that has to change. It is not just about President Trump. It is about  this body, who we are going to be, and how we are going to operate.   In the past, when there was a nomination from a President, there was  the assumption that the President was elected and they could hire their  staff. Now the resistance has stepped up and said: The President is  elected, but we will not let you hire a staff, and we will not let you  put your policies in place because we want to prevent you from getting  any people into a spot.   Guess what. As soon as there is a Democratic President elected--and  at some point in the future, there will be--Republicans will retaliate  back to that and say: We will do the same thing. You can't hire your  staff.   This is a new precedent that has been set. If we don't correct it, it  is damaging to our Republic. A President should be able to hire their  staff. All of the Agencies need Senate-confirmed individuals to be able  to actually conduct their business. We need judges to be able to  execute across the country. Those are basic things that need to occur.   I have heard folks say: Well, there has been no problem getting  judges through. In fact, Republicans have bragged about the total  number of judges coming through.   Let me give you a comparison. If we stay on the same pace right now  with judges--just for the district court judges, which are the most  common judges across our country--and President Trump is in office for  8 years, he will have put in 193 judges. President Obama put in 272  judges. It is factually not true that we are able to ram through all of  these judges to be able to work through the process. We are not on an  epic pace.   There has been a higher number for circuit court judges, which is  correct, because this Senate has prioritized working on circuit court  judges, but that is to the detriment of everything else because you  can't do all of it because there is this constant request for  additional time at the end of it.   Again, I have heard folks say that two hours is not enough time to be  able to debate. That would be true only if 2 hours was the only thing  that was allocated for debate. These individuals have already been  through vetting at the White House and vetting in committee. They have  gone through the process and have been approved. This is not 2 hours of  time. It is actually 26 hours of time because people are conveniently  leaving out the fact that there is an intervening day required. We are  talking about nominees moving from 54 hours of floor debate time to 26  hours of floor debate time. It is just convenient to leave out that  extra day that happens to be in there, if you want to make the  argument.   Our simple conversation is this: How can we get the Senate back to  work again? In 2013, Harry Reid led a movement, which 78 Senators  approved of, to be able to say that for 2 years--2013 and 2014--we  would fix the nominations process in the Senate. There was wide  agreement to be able to do that. At the time, Harry Reid stood on the  floor and said: Now, let me make this clear. We shouldn't have all of  these nominees go through postcloture and all the debate on the floor  anyway. Most of these passed through committee. They should be done by  voice vote. In the rare exception that someone has to come to the  floor, let's limit the floor time because it is not really used anyway.  It is just a tactic to delay.   If you need evidence of that, there is all of the conversation that  has recently been held on this floor about debate and about how we need  to have all of this additional time for debate because these are  lifetime appointees, these are essential people, and so they need to  have a debate on the floor about them. Let me tell you what that really  looks like in real life. That sounds very sanctimonious here on the  floor.   In real life it looks like this. Here are the circuit court judges we  have confirmed this session of Congress so far. These are for the  circuit court. This is the appellate court. These are very important  folks in the process. These folks currently have 30 hours, and for all  of these folks, there was a demand to get 30 hours of extra debate time  on the floor because they were so important.   Here is the actual problem. When that 30 hours of debate time was  done and was blocked off, and that was respected, the first of the  circuit court nominees actually got on the floor 1 hour and 16 minutes  of actual debate, not 30 hours. People actually coming to the floor and  debating that nominee was 1 hour and 16 minutes. The next nominee had  18 minutes and 57 seconds total of debate on this floor, although 30  hours of debate was blocked off, which meant most of the time the floor  was empty, waiting for someone to actually debate. The next nominee was  1 hour 23 minutes.   Then, there is one my favorites. A circuit court judge had 4 minutes  and  [[Page S2175]]  22 seconds of actual debate when 30 hours of debate was demanded for  this lifetime appointment. The next circuit court judge was 23 minutes  and 6 seconds.   The next one for the DC Circuit was actually very controversial.  There was lots of noise about this nominee: 47 minutes and 28 seconds.   It is one thing for folks to say these are lifetime appointments so  we need to make sure we block off a significant period of time on the  floor. It is another thing to actually see the facts. These folks have  gone through committee and we all know it. They have gone through  background checks and we all know it. Every one of these individuals  has been cleared and we know the outcome of all of these. We should  respect each other and acknowledge that if this body is going to do  legislation and personnel, no one can lock up the body and demand 30  hours of time on a nominee when we actually use 4 minutes and 22  seconds.   If we want to shift it off of judges and shift it onto executive  nominees, recently we had a demand for 30 hours of additional debate  time from our Democratic colleagues for the Bureau of Labor Statistics  nominee. They demanded extra time because they were so controversial.  On this floor, there was exactly zero minutes and zero seconds of  debate on that nominee.   You see, this is not about actually debating whether people are  qualified or not qualified. This is about preventing President Trump  from getting nominees by locking up the floor and making sure he can't  actually hire staff or can't actually put people on the court.   This will be reciprocated in the days ahead for every Democrat, and  it will be done to every Republican President in the future if we don't  fix this now. We had 2 years and 3 months of bad muscle memory on a  process that should not be like this and has not been like this in the  past. We can fix this.   When there was a Democratic President and a divided city, led by  Democrats at the time, Republicans joined Democrats to be able to fix  that nomination process for a Democrat President. The mistake we made  was to do it only for a 2-year time period. We should learn from our  mistake, and we should fix this from here on out. This is doable.   To give an example, in the last session of Congress, 386 nominees  were never heard on this floor. They were sent back at the end of  Congress and told: You have to start all over again. Those are folks  who quit their job, went through FBI background checks, went through  reviews, went through hearings, and confronted all the questions that  were brought at them, and 386 of them were then stalled out and never  heard. They were sent back to the White House.   That means that in the future we will have less opportunity to get  more people who are qualified to be able to apply for this. We want the  best of the best to actually come and serve in our government. We will  not get that if people have to quit their jobs to go through the  nomination process, wait a year or 2 years, and then get sent back and  told: You have to start all over again to go through the process.   Who will want to go through that process in the days ahead? We need  to fix this both for the nominees who are going through the process and  the Senate, which needs to have a better process of actually expediting  nominees through. Quite frankly, we need to fix it for the country.    It is a simple process. It is not trying to gain partisan advantage.  Regardless of who is in the White House, it is trying to fix it for the  long term. Let's fix it this week. We have talked about this for 2  years. We have floated different proposals. Let's fix it this week and,  from here on out, have a better process in the Senate.   Why in the world are we arguing about our rules of the Senate when we  should be worrying about the issues the American people face? Of all  places, of all people, we should have fair rules in the Senate to  actually have a debate, have a vote, finish, and then move on to the  next thing. There is more to be done.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 11 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
