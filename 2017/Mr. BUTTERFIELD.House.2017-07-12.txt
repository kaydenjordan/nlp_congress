 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time  and for his leadership on the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2430, the FDA  Reauthorization Act of 2017, which reauthorizes the FDA's user fee  programs that are critical to drug development, the medical device  approval process, and, most importantly, to the patients who will  benefit from these advances.   While I support this critical bill overall, I want to highlight, in  particular, sections 503 through 505, which is the RACE for Children  Act that my friend Mike McCaul, Congressman Mike McCaul, and I  introduced earlier this year. Scientific advances have shown that some  childhood and adult cancers share the same molecular targets.   RACE, Mr. Speaker, will help facilitate the expeditious development  of innovative and promising treatments for children living with cancer  by providing the FDA new authority to require a pediatric investigation  into an adult cancer drug if that drug uses molecular targeting and is  relevant to the cancer.  [[Page H5480]]    I am grateful to Mr. Walden and Ranking Member Pallone and their  respective staffs for understanding the urgent need to enact the RACE  for Children Act and for working with me, working with my staff, to see  that it was included.   I would also like to highlight section 701 and 702, which is the text  of a bill I introduced with Dr. Bucshon to modernize and streamline  FDA's medical device inspection process by moving to a risk-based  inspection approach. The provision will allow FDA to better use its  limited resources and improve patient safety by focusing on facilities  that have the most potential to impact public health.   Finally, passage of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 will send a  strong signal to the administration that Congress values the critical  importance of medical research and patient safety.
