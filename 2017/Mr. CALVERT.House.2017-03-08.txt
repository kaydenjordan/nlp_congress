 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the FY2017  Defense Appropriations bill. I commend Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking  Member Lowey, our new Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member Visclosky  for their leadership on this bill. I would also like to thank our  dedicated professional staff who have tirelessly worked on this  agreement.   I have served on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee for  many years and providing for our men and women in uniform is a  privilege and an honor. This bill provides vital funding for our Armed  Services, including a 2.1 percent pay raise and additional funding for  increased end strength.   As many of us have noted, our military is in a precarious position,  and this bill is an important first step to rebuild and restore our  military strength. It provides funding for necessary shipbuilding;  aircraft and vehicle procurement; and important research and  development to maintain our technological superiority. The bill also  provides vital Operations and Maintenance funding for facility  sustainment, restoration, and modernization programs.   I look forward to working with the new Administration and providing  the resources our military needs to maintain our position in the world  as well as continue to invest in our most important asset--the men and  women our United States Armed Forces.
