 Madam Speaker, I was unable to attend the full schedule  of votes on September 15, 2020, due to a medical procedure a family  member underwent in Chicago. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 185, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 186, ``nay'' on  rollcall No. 187, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 188.
