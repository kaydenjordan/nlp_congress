 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Russ  Peterson, a remarkable Georgian.   Russ was born in Park Ridge, Illinois, and was the son of the late  Russ and Helen Peterson, devoted husband to his wife, Louise Peterson,  and loving father and grandfather.   Russ was known for his good sense of humor, his love for life, and  contagious laughter among friends.   Russ earned his bachelor's degree from DePauw University in  Greencastle, Indiana, and went to work with Allstate Insurance. He  retired as a regional vice president after more than 35 years of  service.   Russ was heavily involved in the betterment of his community, serving  as president of the Landings Association. Russ also served on the Board  of Marshes of Skidaway Island, St. Joseph's Hospital Foundation Board,  the Chatham Leadership Board, and was involved in the American Cancer  Society.   He played a major role in the building of the beautiful bridge to  Skidaway Island and started a Parkinson's support group that continues  to benefit people today. He was also very involved in the Republican  Club of Skidaway Island.   A loving father and husband, outdoorsman, community advocate, and  agent of change, Russ will be dearly missed.                            ____________________
