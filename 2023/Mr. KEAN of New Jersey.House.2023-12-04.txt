 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 1547) to direct the Secretary of Transportation  to conduct a study on the costs and benefits of commuter rail passenger  transportation involving transfers, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1547         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``One Seat Ride Act''.       SEC. 2. STUDY ON COMMUTER SERVICE.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Transportation shall       conduct a study identifying the benefits of commuter rail       passenger transportation and major obstacles to providing       commuter rail passenger transportation that does not involve       a transfer for passengers.        (b) Requirements.--In conducting the study under subsection       (a), the Secretary shall--        (1) consider economic, logistical, and quality of life       factors in analyzing the major obstacles to implementing       single-seat trips on commuter rail passenger transportation       for as many passengers as possible; and        (2) include in such study an analysis of the costs and       benefits with respect to single-seat trips on commuter rail       passenger transportation on the New Jersey Transit Raritan       Valley line during peak hours and the impact such trips would       have on other New Jersey Transit lines.        (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House       of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and       Urban Affairs of the Senate a report on the study required       under subsection (a).        (d) Commuter Rail Passenger Transportation Defined.--In       this section, the term ``commuter rail passenger       transportation'' has the meaning given such term in section       24102 of title 49, United States Code.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 1547.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1547, which requires the  Secretary of Transportation to conduct a study analyzing the costs and  benefits of providing commuter rail service that does not require  riders to change trains. Furthermore, the Secretary must submit the  report to the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the  Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs within 1 year  of the legislation enactment.   The one-seat-ride issue for commuter rail passengers is something  that I championed both here and in the New Jersey State Senate.  Examining this issue is a priority for my constituents who rely on New  Jersey Transit.   Anyone living in the Seventh Congressional District of New Jersey or  along the Raritan Valley Line can describe the difficulties of  commuting to and from New York City. Seventh District residents who  travel to Manhattan by train are regularly frustrated with unnecessary  delays mainly due to the aged infrastructure, often making weekly  commutes hours longer than they need to be.   Worsening matters, passengers traveling on the New Jersey Transit  Raritan Valley Line must change trains, almost always on a different  track, at Newark Penn Station to make trips to the city. During peak  commute hours, Raritan Valley passengers have very little time to make  their way, alongside thousands of other rushed passengers, through  Newark Penn Station.   These daily transfers make trips longer and increasingly exhausting  for passengers. The longer commute times cause commuters to spend less  time with their families, making it more difficult to make their  child's sporting events, scouting meetings, and cherished family  dinners.   According to the Raritan Valley Line Coalition, the RVL makes up  about 10 percent of New Jersey Transit's daily ridership systemwide.   Additionally, the impact of a one-seat-ride service has been studied  in a report published by the Regional Plan Association. The report  shows its impact on towns surrounding the train line in a positive way.  Rail lines with one-seat-ride service into Manhattan are more desirable  and encourage more development of residential housing units, retail  stores, and offices located near existing train stations.   Some of the benefits of a town with a one-seat-ride option are that  towns with the one-seat-ride service have fewer vacancies and a more  diverse and economically viable selection of restaurants, stores, and  offices in downtown, and they have increased train service westbound,  allowing towns along the RVL east and west to flourish.   My hope is to get, in the future, as many commuters on rail traveling  westbound in the morning as they do eastbound.   One-seat-ride on the RVL is something that my constituents and many  New Jerseyans want to see become a reality before the completion of the  Gateway Project years down the road.   I thank Representative Watson Coleman of New Jersey for cosponsoring  this legislation, and I note this bill passed out of committee with  strong bipartisan support.   Madam Speaker, I urge the support of this legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I  am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1547 represents an important step in improving  the commuter experience for all individuals who rely on transit, and  the bill also ensures, as it reviews the broad issue, that the New  Jersey Transit Raritan Valley Line is examined specifically.   Madam Speaker, I urge the support of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (S. 992) to amend the Intermodal Surface  Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 to designate the Texas and New  Mexico portions of the future Interstate-designated segments of the  Port-to-Plains Corridor as Interstate Route 27, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 992         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``I-27 Numbering Act of       2023''.       SEC. 2. NUMBERING OF DESIGNATED FUTURE INTERSTATE.         (a) In General.--Section 1105(e)(5)(C)(i) of the Intermodal       Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law       102-240) is amended by inserting ``The routes referred to in       clause (i) (other than subclauses (V)(aa) and (V)(bb) and       subclause (IX)(aa) of that clause) and clause (iv) of       subsection (c)(38)(A) are designated as Interstate Route I-      27. The route referred to in subsection (c)(38)(A)(i)(V)(aa)       is designated as Interstate Route I-27E. The route referred       to in subsection (c)(38)(A)(i)(V)(bb) is designated as       Interstate Route I-27W. The route referred to in subsection       (c)(38)(A)(i)(IX)(aa) is designated as Interstate Route I-      127N.'' before ``The route referred to in subsection       (c)(45)''.        (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 1105(c)(38)(A)(i) of       the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991       (Public Law 102-240) is amended--        (1) in subclause (V)--        (A) by striking ``Lamesa, the Corridor'' and inserting the       following: ``Lamesa--         ``(aa) the Corridor''; and         (B) in item (aa) (as so redesignated), by striking ``87       and, the Corridor'' and inserting the following: ``87; and         ``(bb) the Corridor''; and         (2) in subclause (IX)--        (A) by striking ``(IX) United States Route 287'' and       inserting the following:        ``(IX)(aa) United States Route 287''; and        (B) in item (aa) (as so redesignated), by striking       ``Oklahoma, and also United States Route 87'' and inserting       the following: ``Oklahoma; and        ``(bb) United States Route 87''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials in the Record on S. 992, as  amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of S. 992, the I-27  Numbering Act of 2023, a bipartisan bill that has passed the Senate.   The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure favorably  reported companion legislation that amended a bill introduced by  Congressman Jodey Arrington in November.   This legislation officially designates segments of the Ports-to- Plains Corridor of Texas, previously marked as a future Federal  interstate route, as Interstate Route 27.   The Ports-to-Plains Corridor connects with other highways to span  from the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas through our country's heartland to  Alberta, Canada, and serves as a crucial infrastructure asset for  American agricultural and energy accessibility. This designation will  benefit farmers, ranchers, and producers across Texas and the country,  boosting our trade economy.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger).    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, again, I am proud to support this bipartisan  legislation championed by my colleague Mr. Arrington of Texas here in  the House, along with Mr. Cruz and Mr. Cornyn in the Senate.   Ports-to-Plains Corridor connects with other routes to span more than  2,300 miles across eight states. It connects significant agriculture  and energy centers to the rest of our Nation, which relies on these  industries.   This bill ensures congressional follow-through on this designation by  formally naming segments of the corridor in Texas Interstate Route 27  and will contribute to the continuity of American advantages in  agriculture, international trade, connectivity, and economic  development.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 4688) to direct the Administrator of General  Services to sell the property known as the Webster School.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4688         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SALE OF WEBSTER SCHOOL.         (a) Sale.--Not later than December 31, 2025, the       Administrator of General Services shall sell the property       described in subsection (b) at fair market value and at       highest and best use.        (b) Property Described.--The property described in this       subsection is property located in the District of Columbia       generally consisting of Lot 822 of Square 375 at 940 H Street       Northwest in Washington, District of Columbia, including the       building known as the Webster School, subject to survey and       as determined by the Administrator of General Services.        (c) Treatment of Net Proceeds; Future Appropriation.--Any       net proceeds received from the sale under this section shall       be paid into an account in the Federal Buildings Fund       established under section 592 of title 40, United States       Code. Upon deposit, the net proceeds from the sale may be       expended only subject to a specific future appropriation.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  [[Page H6087]]  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and insert extraneous material into the Record on H.R.  4688.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Delegate Holmes Norton and the Economic  Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management Subcommittee  Chairman Perry for their leadership on this bill to shed wasted space  in the Federal Government's real estate portfolio.   H.R. 4688 directs the General Services Administration to sell the  vacant Webster School building in downtown Washington, D.C.   The Webster School was originally purchased by GSA at the request of  the Secret Service in 2003. However, for 20 years, no plans or funding  have been secured for its Federal use and the building sits vacant, in  disrepair in the middle of downtown D.C.   It makes no sense for taxpayers to pay for buildings that have never  been occupied and have no real use or benefit.   I was pleased to see, after the committee's passage of H.R. 4688 in  July, that GSA notified Congress of its intent to dispose of the  Webster School, along with 22 other unneeded properties across the  country.   However, it is important that we pass this bill to ensure that the  property is actually sold and sold for the highest market value.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, in closing, this bill is a small, but necessary step  in the rightsizing of the Federal real estate portfolio.   The Federal real estate portfolio has far too much empty space as it  is, and we should not hold onto known empty buildings at the taxpayers'  expense.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
