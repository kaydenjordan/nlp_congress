 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, my amendment prohibits funds  from being used to remove any monument on land under the jurisdiction  of the Department of the Interior.   For too long, communist Democrats have been hell-bent on erasing our  culture, way of life, and our history, whether we agree with it or not.   As George Orwell wrote in ``Nineteen Eighty-Four,'' they want a  future in which ``every record has been destroyed or falsified, every  book has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue  and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered.  And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History  has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the  Party is always right.''   In 2020, nearly 168 Confederate symbols were removed across the  United States, many of which were violently torn down by radical BLM  antifa activists who burned American cities to the ground.   Most recently, the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, that  stood for nearly a century in Charlottesville, Virginia, was  dismembered and melted down in a 2,250-degree furnace.   The news media was quick to flood social media with video posts of  the statue's head melting down in fire. This was the message: The  communists in our country have made it clear that they will not stop  with Robert E. Lee and will continue to do this until George  Washington's statue is burning in fire.   Whether we agree with the monuments, whether we agree with the  history, our history is our lessons now for this generation and for  future generations to come.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Montana (Mr. Zinke).                                time  1945     Madam Chair, actually, there should be no  funds allocated to remove any monument, and there is no necessary  reason to remove the monuments. This is the Democrats' and the Biden  administration's effort to erase our history just as they have done to  the statue of Robert E. Lee. This is an outrage.   This is exactly what they do in communist countries. The Democrats  want to accuse us of book burning while we try to get pornography books  out of our children's schools. The Democrats will do nothing to stop  their attempts to destroy our Nation's history, and we must protect it.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment, and I  urge its passage. I yield back the balance of my time.
