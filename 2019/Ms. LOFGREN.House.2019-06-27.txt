 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 460, I call  up the bill (H.R. 2722) to protect elections for public office by  providing financial support and enhanced security for the  infrastructure used to carry out such elections, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2722.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2722. The SAFE Act is  critical legislation to invest in and upgrade the machinery of American  democracy. It will help us combat the national emergency facing our  country. It will improve the resilience of election infrastructure used  in Federal elections.   Aging equipment, under-resourced jurisdictions, and interference by  foreign entities or non-state actors leaves the system vulnerable to  exploitation that can undermine confidence in election outcomes.  Ineffective and vulnerable equipment can also discourage participation  in Federal elections.   It comes to the floor after the Committee on House Administration  held three hearings in the first 6 months of this year that addressed  the integrity of our elections. In February the committee held the  ``For the People: Our American Democracy'' hearing, where the integrity  of our democracy--including critical steps to improve the security and  reliability of our election infrastructure--was addressed.   On May 8 the committee held an election security hearing where we  heard testimony about the urgent need to upgrade our election  infrastructure and the lack of ongoing investment in the wake of new  threats.   And on May 21 the committee held an oversight hearing of the Election  Assistance Commission, an agency that plays a central role in  supporting election administration in this country.   I will remind this House that earlier this year, the Director of  National Intelligence published a report stating that our adversaries  and strategic competitors ``probably already are looking to the 2020  U.S. elections as an opportunity to advance their interests.   ``They may also use cyber means to `directly manipulate or disrupt  elections systems--such as by tampering with voter registration or  disrupting the vote tallying process--either to alter data or to call  into question our voting process.'''   Last year he said that ``the warning lights are blinking red''. . . .   Special Counsel Robert Mueller noted in Volume One of his report that  the Russian military ``targeted individuals and entities involved in  the administration of the elections. Victims included U.S. State and  local entities, such as State boards of elections, secretaries of  State, and county governments, as well as individuals who worked for  those entities. The GRU also targeted private technology firms  responsible for manufacturing and administering election-related  software and hardware, such as voter registration software and  electronic polling stations.''   In April, FBI Director Christopher Wray called Russia's interference  efforts a ``significant counterintelligence threat,'' and said that the  2018 midterms were a ``dress rehearsal for the big show'' of the 2020  Presidential elections.   Early voters in Georgia in 2018 saw machines deleting votes and  switching them to other candidates. The machines where voters saw this  occur were purchased in 2002. During early voting in Texas in 2018 some  electronic voting machines deleted votes and switched them between  candidates. The machines were used in 78 of 254 Texas counties.   In June of 2016 the Russian GRU compromised the computer network of  the Illinois State Board of Elections by exploiting a vulnerability in  their website. They gained access to a database with information on  millions of Illinois voters and extracted data on thousands before the  activity was detected.   H.R. 2722 responds to this emergency that we find ourselves in as a  nation. We ought to be doing everything we can to bolster the security  and integrity of our elections from interference and hacking.   The bill's section 102 requires that States transition to voting  systems that use individual, durable, voter-verified paper ballots,  which means a paper ballot marked by the voter by hand or through the  use of a non-tabulating ballot marking device or system. Voter-verified  paper ballots are the best way to ensure that a voter's ballot  accurately reflects their choices and is counted as cast. Paper can be  audited. In the last Presidential election, approximately 20 percent of  registered voters cast their ballot on voting machines that do not have  any kind of paper backup.   The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine  concluded that paperless systems ``should be removed from service as  soon as possible.''   In at least 40 States, elections are carried out using machines that  are at least a decade old. And like any technology, they are  susceptible to increasing failure with age. One witness at our election  security hearing, Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice at  NYU Law School, explained that some State officials have ``had to turn  to eBay to find critical components like dot-matrix printer ribbons,  decades old storage devices, and analog modems.'' Aging systems also  frequently rely on unsupported software like Windows XP and 2000, which  may not receive regular security patches and are thus more vulnerable  to the latest methods of cyberattack.   This bill addresses many other cybersecurity best practices besides  paper-based systems.    The bill in section 111 authorizes a $600 million Election Assistance  Commission grant program to assist States in securing election  infrastructure. States may use the money to replace their aging  equipment with voter-verified paper ballot voting systems, but also  ongoing maintenance of election infrastructure, enhanced cybersecurity  and operations of IT infrastructure, and enhanced cybersecurity of  voter registration systems.   Originally, the bill, as introduced, would have authorized $1 billion  for this initial round of surge funding; however, during the Committee  on House Administration's markup, the committee approved an amendment  in the nature of a substitute that authorized $600 million instead.  Combined with the $380 million that Congress appropriated last year in  election security grants, this funding reaches the $1 billion that  experts have said is necessary to implement these necessary  protections.  [[Page H5215]]    The bill also provides in section 111 $175 million in biennial  maintenance funding. Cybersecurity threats will not dissipate, they  will only evolve. State election officials have told us repeatedly they  need more funding and a sustainable source of funding.   Section 103 of the SAFE Act fosters innovation for voters living with  disabilities. It provides grant funding for the study, development, and  testing of accessible paper ballot voting, verification, and casting  mechanisms. It expressly requires States to ensure that individuals  with disabilities and others are given an equivalent opportunity to  vote, including with privacy and independence, in a manner that  produces voter-verified paper ballots as for other voters.   The bill fosters accountability for election technology vendors. It  would create a qualified election infrastructure vendor designation  where the Election Assistance Commission, in coordination with the  Department of Homeland Security, would craft criteria that vendors  would follow to receive the qualified designation. This would include  reporting any known or suspected cybersecurity incidents involving  election infrastructure to both the EAC and DHS, as well as affected  election agencies.   The bill in sections 201 and 203 also includes open-source  provisions, requiring use of software and hardware for which  information is disclosed by manufacturers. This will allow  cybersecurity experts and the public to vet the security of election  systems regardless of the technology used.   As amended in the committee, the bill in section 121 requires States  to adopt risk-limiting audits. Risk-limiting audits are the gold  standard of post-election audits. They involve hand counting a certain  number of ballots using advanced statistical methods to determine with  a high degree of confidence that the reported election outcome is  accurate. The SAFE Act requires States to implement risk-limiting  audits because they go hand in hand with paper ballots. We need audits  to ensure that ballot marking devices or optical scanners were not  hacked and that the reported results are accurate.   Second, as amended in committee, the bill in section 201 includes  specific cybersecurity standards to apply to optical scanner voting  systems and another set of standards to apply to ballot marking  devices. These will apply equally to current and future technology. For  example, H.R. 2722 prohibits the use of wireless communications devices  and internet connectivity in voting systems upon which ballots are  marked by voters or that otherwise mark and tabulate ballots.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2722 is an essential step forward in shoring up  our election infrastructure and investing in secure elections. I ask  the House to pass this legislation and bolster the trust and confidence  in our system that all Americans expect and deserve.   Every American--no matter what their choice in politics--should know  that their vote will be counted as cast.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Davis), a member of the House Administration  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a member of the House Administration Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath), a new Member of Congress.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Casten).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Wexton).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), my colleague from the House Judiciary  Committee and Homeland Security Committee.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on  each side.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).                                time  1000     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), a valued member of the House  Administration Committee.    Madam Speaker, we have no additional speakers, so if the  gentleman would like to yield back, I will close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I think it is important to address a few of the issues that have been  raised in the course of this debate.   First, we are moving forward with the SAFE Act because of a sense of  urgency that we have about the 2020 election. That sense of urgency was  fueled by the Director of National Intelligence, and it was fueled by  the Director of the FBI who told us that red lights, warning lights  were flashing and that the 2016 election was just a prelude to what the  Russians were going to do in the 2020 election. We feel a sense of  urgency.   As has been mentioned by others, H.R. 1 included provisions about  ballot security. But I introduced this bill, the SAFE Act, on May 14  because it was specifically addressing election security, and, also, we  made some additional enhancements to H.R. 1 relative to cybersecurity  and the like.                                time  1030    We drafted the bill with the assistance of the Parliamentarian so  that it was entirely within the jurisdiction of the House  Administration Committee, with one exception. There was a line on page  11 of the committee mark that authorized a study by the NSF. The  Science, Space, and Technology Committee waived jurisdiction on markup  because it was just a study, and that was very clear.   This bill has proceeded in the regular order. It has been noticed  according to our rules. And it brings us here today to test whether we  are going to meet the challenge that faces us in ballot security:  whether we are going to allow the Russians to attack our country by  trying to steal our election next year or not.   Mention has been made about the need for bipartisanship. I work often  on a bipartisan basis with Members of the other party. I will say that  we have tried in vain to have the Republican Members buy into the need  to require best practices for next year's election, and we couldn't  reach agreement.   We decided that it is our responsibility to move forward, and that is  why we are here today.   Just a mention on unfunded mandates, we are authorizing about $1  billion. $380 million was appropriated last year, and as the Speaker  mentioned, we are appropriating this year an additional $600 million  for ballot security.   This bill authorizes the $600 million that we are appropriating, and  we think it is important that that money flow to the States to harden  our systems so the election cannot be stolen by our enemies. It is  ironic that some on the other side of the aisle have complained about  unfunded mandates at the same time they tried to impose a 25 percent  match requirement on States for receiving these funds that they need to  get to harden our system.   Just a comment on DREs, DREs are not as unsafe as pure electronic  voting, but they are not best practices.   Much has been mentioned about the State of Georgia. It is worth  noting that the Georgia legislature ignored the advice they got from  computer scientists that what they were doing did not meet best  practices for ballot security.   A study published by Georgia Tech indicated that most voters did not  actually look at the receipt when it was printed. They also point out  that even though printed ballots, when voters do look at them, include  the names of candidates, votes will be encoded in barcodes that humans  can't authenticate and that are subject to hacking.   ``There's nothing speculative about these vulnerabilities,'' said a  Georgia Tech computer professor and former chief technology officer for  Hewlett-Packard. ``If exploited, it would affect the result of the  election. It's not a secure system.''   We need to fix these things not because it is partisan but because we  need to protect America.   The idea that we would allow this just to be decided at a local level  is  [[Page H5223]]  wrongheaded. If the Russians launched missiles at the counties of the  United States, we wouldn't say, well, that is just a local issue. We  would say, no, that is an attack on the United States of America.   We need to harden our systems and protect our country.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge the adoption of this measure.   I would like to read from a letter that we received just yesterday  from the NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice. In their last  paragraph, the Catholics say:         In a secular democracy, elections are the closest thing we       have to a sacrament. We know that nefarious foreign and       domestic actors continue to meddle in our democratic systems,       and we have been put on notice that previous efforts were       only trial runs, presumably for our next election in 2020.       The NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice considers our       elections to be sacrosanct and that Congress must pass the       SAFE Act to protect them.    This bill is supported by a broad sector of civil rights groups,  including the NAACP and Common Cause. It deserves all of our support.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2722 to ensure the security of  our Nation's election infrastructure.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order.    Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my point of order.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  motion to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I want to make an important observation.  The gentleman has said that what happened in North Carolina is  perfectly legal in other States. Fraud is not legal in any of the 50  States.   I would like to note that, in our bill, we do have provisions that  vendors must be owned and controlled by citizens or permanent residents  of the United States and certain other provisions relative to security;  but to conflate the allowance in some States--of 27 States and 9 others  that designate allowing your mother or your brother or your neighbor to  take your ballot with fraud is really pretty low.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Aguilar).    Mr. Speaker, I would close by urging every Member to  vote against this motion to recommit and further note that the House  Administration Committee will soon be examining foreign influence on  our elections. We would welcome the participation of the minority in  that important work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
