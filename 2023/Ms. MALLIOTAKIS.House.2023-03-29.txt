 Madam Speaker, I rise today on Vietnam Veterans Day  to first and foremost thank the Vietnam veterans from my district and  around the country who served, but also for a very special person,  First Lieutenant Theodore ``Ted'' Cohen, a Staten Island resident who  sadly passed away this past Saturday.   Ted was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Brooklyn  College where he was a member of the ROTC. Not long after the start of  the Vietnam war, he served his first tour in Spain with the Strategic  Air Command before flying on 26 close air support missions in Vietnam.   Upon his return to the States, Ted spent his nights working with the  Daily News before spending 25 years working for Avon in international  marketing. When Ted's wife fell ill, he retired early. He decided to  care for her and ensure that their last 9 years together were spent  traveling the world.   After his wife passed away, his passion for caring for others,  especially our veterans, became his mission. Ted served as a member of  the United Staten Island Veterans Organization, the Air Force  Association, and The American Legion. He would bring food to homebound  servicemen and -women. He would provide rides to and from their  appointments at the VA if they were unable to drive themselves. He even  went to help them complete their paperwork, which we know can sometimes  be cumbersome.   Not only was Ted a constituent and a champion for our Nation's  veterans, but he was a dear friend to my office, having been a vocal  member of our monthly veterans' roundtable. He always contributed  greatly. He had many recommendations. We worked together to improve VA  access and care.   He also served on our academy nomination board for the past several  years where he provided invaluable assistance and advice to our youth  throughout the entire academy nominations process, and he helped us  select the next generation of servicemembers.   Our office, our local veterans, and our entire community will  sincerely miss Ted and his invaluable service. His willingness to give  back was so appreciated by all.   Ted exemplified the very best of what it means to be an American, to  put your country, to put your community, and to put others first. He  answered every call to serve with honor, integrity, and distinction. We  owe him an immeasurable debt of gratitude, not only for his service to  our country, but for his lifelong service to our community.   Please join me in extending condolences to his family. I thank Ted  for his service.                            ____________________
