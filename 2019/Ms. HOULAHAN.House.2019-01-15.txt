 Madam Speaker, I rise for Jodi Readinger, a tax  preparer in Pennsylvania's Sixth District. She and her organization,  the Berks Community Action Program, provide a range of services to over  2,500 low-income individuals and families in my community. For example,  her team works for free to help people navigate the complicated process  of filing their taxes.   During a weekend town hall in Berks County this weekend, Jodi shared  with me that she has been unable to reach the IRS to access tax  preparation software due to the shutdown. Her work is responsible for  bringing $1 million worth of tax refunds back to my community and for  saving $80,000 for her customers.   I am a third generation veteran. Border protection is imperative and  a real issue. I am certain that there are measures to protect our  borders that we can come to an agreement on in this brand-new Congress,  but a shutdown is not the answer.   Madam Speaker, I rise for the people like Jodi, because shutting down  the government is failed policy.                            ____________________
