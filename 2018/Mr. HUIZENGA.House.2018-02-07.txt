 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1153.   As someone who worked in the housing industry, in fact, for the third  generation, this is a very important issue to me and, more importantly,  to all of our constituents across the country.   The qualified mortgage/ability-to-repay rule, as mandated by the  Dodd-Frank Act, went into effect in January 2014. This QM rule is the  primary means for mortgage lenders to satisfy its ability-to-repay  requirements. Additionally, Dodd-Frank provides that a QM may not have  points and fees in excess of 3 percent of the loan amount.   So far, so good.   As currently defined, however, points and fees include, among other  charges: salaries paid to loan officers; loan level price adjustments,  as the chairman was talking about, which are traditionally known as  points; payments by lenders to correspondent banks, credit unions,  [[Page H909]]  and mortgage brokers in wholesale transactions; and, as has been  discussed, fees paid to affiliated, but not unaffiliated, title  companies; and--this is the one that is most bizarre of all--amounts of  insurance and taxes held in escrow. That counts towards that 3 percent.   As a result of this confusing and problematic definition, many  affiliated loans, particularly those made to low- and moderate-income  borrowers, would not qualify as QMs. Without that designation, it is  unlikely the loan would be made. And if it were, it would only be  available at higher rates, due to the heightened liability risks.  Consumers would lose the ability to take advantage of the convenience  and market efficiencies offered by one-stop shopping.   Hardworking Americans utilize one-stop shopping every day. They  partake in it. For example, in west Michigan, we have the headquarters  of Meijer. It is a great regional supermarket chain, and it is where  families across the Midwest go to buy groceries, pick up clothes for  the kids, and pick up auto parts. It is one-stop shopping that allows  you to get just about everything you need for your home.   Well, purchasing a home is one of the most important decisions a  family makes. Why shouldn't they have the same ability to take  advantage of that same cost-effective convenience of one-stop shopping  when buying a home?   I, along with Representative Gregory Meeks, reintroduced H.R. 1153,  bipartisan legislation to modify and clarify the way points and fees  are calculated and help families across America to one-stop shop.   This legislation is narrowly focused to promote access to affordable  mortgage credit without overturning the important consumer protections  and sound underwriting required under Dodd-Frank's ability-to-repay  provisions. As the chairman pointed out, also. The RESPA provisions  that are Federal law stay in place.   Very similar legislation overwhelmingly passed the House of  Representatives last Congress as well as in the 113th.   I think it is important to note that when we first introduced this  bill in 2012, it looked substantially different. However, working with  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we worked together to  improve the legislation. The result has been a truly bipartisan effort  at every step of the way in the legislative debate.   Specifically, H.R. 1153 would do a couple of things. It would provide  equal treatment for affiliated versus unaffiliated title fees. It  doesn't change the 44 States that have a regulated title insurance cost  structure. It doesn't change any of those costs that a homeowner would  have. It just allows them to actually go lower, rather than higher.   It also clarifies the treatment of insurance held in escrow. These  two simple, commonsense changes will promote access to affordable  mortgage credit for low- and moderate-income families and, indeed, all  families, especially first-time home buyers, by ensuring that safe,  properly underwritten mortgages pass the QM test.   Whether or not you supported Dodd-Frank, it is clear that the law is  going to require some tweaks to ensure qualified borrowers aren't  locked out of home ownership and the beneficial features of a qualified  mortgage.   The QM represents the best mortgage on the market. It is the gold  standard. And it should be the gold standard. We should want more  responsible people getting QMs, not fewer.   Quite frankly, this is something we should all agree on. In fact, we  did last year. Our bill doesn't touch any of the CFPB's strict  underwriting criteria. It doesn't, in any way, suspend a lender's legal  requirement to determine that a borrower has the ability to repay that  loan.   The ranking member points out a real problem that happened in the  industry and that, frankly, many of us in the industry warned of, but  this does nothing that allows State regulated title insurance to be  violated or any of those Federal steps regarding the qualified  mortgage. It, in no way, sidesteps RESPA or QM requirements.   Mr. Speaker, I must admit that I am completely baffled by the ranking  member's new opposition to this bill. This bill was very carefully  negotiated in order to receive bipartisan support, which the ranking  member voted for previously. In fact, she was so supportive that she,  along with 11 other Democrats from the committee, sent a letter, dated  August 1, 2014, to the Senate urging them to ``quickly adopt the  Mortgage Choice Act.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letter of August 1, 2014.                                       House of Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, August 1, 2014.        Dear Majority Leader Reid, Chairman Johnson and Members of       the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs:       On June 9, the House passed the Mortgage Choice Act (H.R.       3211), on the suspension calendar without objection. Senators       Manchin and Johanns introduced a companion bill, S. 1577 in       October, but it has not yet been considered. We support the       Mortgage Choice Act because of our concern about lower-income       consumers' access to credit and their ability to select the       mortgage and title insurance providers of their choice.        Passage of H.R. 3211 represents the fourth time that the       House has approved virtually identical legislation without       objection. In 2007 and 2009, a Democratic House majority       passed essentially the same provision in the Miller-Watt-      Frank anti-predatory lending legislation, and then a third       time as part of the House's version of the Dodd-Frank Wall       Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010.        The Mortgage Choice Act simply excludes the cost of title       insurance from the definition of points and fees under the       Truth in Lending Act regardless of whether a title insurance       agent is affiliated with a mortgage lender or not. It also       clarifies that funds held in escrow for the payment of       property insurance do not count as ``points and fees.'' The       legislation is needed to ensure that smaller loans to       creditworthy low and moderate-income consumers can select the       mortgage lender and title insurance provider of their choice       and obtain a ``qualified mortgage,'' the gold standard for       all mortgages.        The bill authorizes the Consumer Financial Protection       Bureau to implement rules governing the exclusion of       reasonable title insurance charges from ``points and fees.''       It preserves the Bureau's strong enforcement authority to       require transparency and disclosure of affiliations and       charges under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act       (RESPA). In fact, the CFPB has been vigorous in its pursuit       of RESPA violations, ranging from minor disclosure errors to       kick-backs for referrals by an unaffiliated title company.        We urge you and the entire Senate to quickly adopt the       Mortgage Choice Act to improve access to credit, enhance       competition among title insurance providers, and reinforce       the CFPB's authority to define what title insurance costs       qualify as excludable ``points and fees.''            Sincerely,          David Scott; Maxine Waters; Emanuel Cleaver; Henry             Cuellar; Daniel T. Kildee; Jim McDermott; Patrick             Murphy; Gerald E. Connolly; Michael F. Doyle; Betty             McCollum; Gregory W. Meeks; Gary C. Peters.     In the letter, she stated that the bill would ``improve  access to credit'' and ``enhance competition among title insurance  providers.'' Well, I couldn't agree more with the ranking member.   She talks now of kickbacks. I am confused as to how an affiliated  title structure, pricing structure, versus an unaffiliated title  purchase is somehow a kickback.   I am confused at how an escrow, money that is ours that is put into a  holding account to be used later to pay off debt, is a kickback.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Donovan). The time of the gentleman has  expired.    Mr. Speaker, I wish I had time to yield to the  gentlewoman to hear that answer.   She is talking about megabanks. This is, frankly, just a red herring  in this whole thing.   Congress has the opportunity to help more Americans realize a portion  of the American Dream, not by some grandiose law or decree, but by  simply reforming a burdensome regulation. Home ownership has been a  pillar in American life for generations. Today, we can reaffirm that  pillar and reassert that home ownership can and should be an attainable  goal.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Meeks, and many  others who have worked so tirelessly on this to fix this flawed  provision, and I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1153.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct the chairman.  [[Page H910]]    He said that RESPA prohibits kickbacks. While RESPA prohibits paying  kickbacks to third-party title agencies, the law does not prohibit  payments to affiliated title firms. This incentivizes a title agency to  be affiliated so it can gain the payment option without violating  RESPA, including affiliated title insurance fees in the QM defines  points and fees caps, provides important market pressure to control  costs for consumers, and supports access to credits.   By the way, when we talk about RESPA, we are talking about the real  estate settlement procedures that define all of this.   So let's be clear again that, while RESPA prohibits paying kickbacks  to third-party title agents, the law does not prohibit payments to  affiliated title firms.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
