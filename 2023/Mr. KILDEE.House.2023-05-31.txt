 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the ranking member, for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, paying America's bills isn't an option. Defaulting on  our debt would have a consequence for every single American and, in  fact, would have global consequences. It would increase every families'  costs. It would eliminate millions of jobs, and threaten the retirement  security of seniors and families all across this country.   Let me be clear: We shouldn't be in this position. We shouldn't be  close to default. It is a manufactured crisis. The House Republican  majority created this crisis because they didn't have the will to  submit their ideas to the legislative process, rather holding us all  hostage to exact this price, to exact this legislation when we could  have simply gone through the legislative process of making decisions  about the priorities for this country.   They have the majority on the Appropriations Committee, on the Ways  and Means Committee, and on the Budget Committee. They ought not fear  the argument over these issues. We need to make sure that we accept the  fact that we have come to a compromise to protect Medicare and  Medicaid. It protects the American people from catastrophic default. I  urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3746.
