 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in support of H.R.  5142 introduced by my colleague, Lisa McClain from Michigan.   This bill would posthumously award a Congressional Gold Medal to the  U.S. servicemembers killed during the final week of the Afghanistan  evacuation.   On August 26, 2021, 13 American servicemembers were killed in a  brutal suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport, marking  one of the deadliest days for U.S. forces in Afghanistan in the past 20  years.   These selfless and brave Americans were put into an impossible  situation, but their commitment to that mission never wavered.   They epitomized what it means to be a hero. They knew about the  heightened threat that they faced. They knew the risks, but they stayed  at those gates to keep them open, each second buying time for more  lives to be saved.   The chaos of those days in Kabul and the perilous situation our  servicemembers and diplomats faced cannot be overstated. We owe an  extraordinary debt of gratitude for the sacrifice that they should have  never been forced to have made.   Every American should take pride in the heroism that Americans on the  ground displayed in our final days in Afghanistan, but every American  should also demand accountability from those senior officials whose  decisions put our servicemembers in a position that required such  heroic acts.   Today, we honor the 13 lives lost and keep their families and all who  loved them in our prayers. Theirs is the epitome of selfless service,  and a grateful Nation honors them here today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Michigan for introducing this  important legislation, and I urge the support of my colleagues.
