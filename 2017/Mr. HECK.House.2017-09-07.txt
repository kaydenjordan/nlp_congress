 Mr. Chairman, this amendment helps our local communities  preserve and restore important historic sites through a successful  Federal-State partnership.   For more than 40 years, the Historic Preservation Fund has helped our  States and Native Tribes leverage funds to revitalize communities and  create opportunities for economic growth.   In my district, for example, the Historic Preservation Fund was  recently used to rehabilitate Olympia's historic Stoker House, which is  now home to a small clinic that provides much-needed mental health  counseling services.   This year, funds were also used for Washington State's Youth Heritage  Project in Tacoma, which introduced high school students to the  maritime heritage of the Puget Sound region.   This amendment would simply restore Historic Preservation funding to  last year's levels. It is a small but effective Federal program that  deserves continued support.   This is a bipartisan amendment, and I am thankful to have the support  of the co-chairs of the Historic Preservation Caucus, Congressmen  Turner and Blumenauer, along with Congressmen Smith, Courtney, and  Keating.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment.
