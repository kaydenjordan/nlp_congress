 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Child Care  Is Essential Act. This bill is badly needed to clear a massive  roadblock on our Nation's path to economic recovery. The choice is  clear. Without assistance, only 18 percent of existing childcare  programs will remain open a year from today.   Last month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, not known as a strong  supporter of social services, announced its support for emergency aid  for childcare providers, declaring that ``for millions of Americans,  returning to work is not just contingent on the lifting of stay-at-home  orders . . . but on securing care for their children.'' This aid is  critical because childcare providers are small businesses and have been  operating at reduced capacity and much higher costs, if they are open  at all. This situation is not sustainable. Every month more centers are  closing as costs exceed revenues. Some estimates predict that we may  lose as many as 4.5 million slots nationwide unless Congress acts and  acts fast.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation has long undervalued the role that childcare  plays in enabling our workforce, and the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed  that deplorable lack of investment. Making sure the childcare industry  survives, as the Chamber testified, will shorten the recession by  getting parents back to work.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and neighbor, Rosa DeLauro and  Chairman Scott for their work on this bill and I urge a ``yes'' vote.
