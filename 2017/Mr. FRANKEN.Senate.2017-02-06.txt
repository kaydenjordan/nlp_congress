 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I thank the Presiding Officer.  [[Page S729]]    Mr. President, I rise this evening in opposition to the nomination of  Betsy DeVos to be our next Secretary of Education. This is one of the  most important jobs in our government. The Department of Education  bears responsibility for making sure that every child in America has  the opportunity to fulfill his or her potential, which means that the  Secretary of Education has an enormous amount of power to shape our  Nation's future. This is not a job for amateurs.   President Obama's first Secretary of Education was Arne Duncan, who  had spent 7\1/2\ years building a record of accomplishment as CEO of  Chicago's public school system, previous to which he had been director  of a mentoring program and the founder of a charter school.   When Secretary Duncan stepped down, he was replaced by Dr. John King,  Jr., the recipient of a doctorate in education administrative practice.  He had served as Deputy Secretary under Arne Duncan and was previously  the education commissioner for the State of New York. Each brought to  the job a background in public education that informed their  understanding of what students, parents, teachers, and administrators  need in order to succeed, which brings me to Betsy DeVos.   There are reasons to be skeptical about Mrs. DeVos's nomination right  off the bat. As my Republican colleague, Senator Collins of Maine, put  it: ``The mission of the Department of Education is broad, but  supporting public education is at its core.''   Well, in Mrs. DeVos, President Trump sent us a nominee with no  experience in public education. Mrs. DeVos has never been a public  school superintendent or a public school principal or a public  schoolteacher. She has never attended a public school. She has never  sent a child to a public school. Mrs. DeVos has no formal background in  education, no classroom experience, and no demonstrated commitment to  supporting public education whatsoever.   In fact, Mrs. DeVos has a long history of actively undermining public  education. She and her family have spent millions of dollars advocating  for an ideology that would steal funds from public schools in order to  fund private and religious education. Let's take a moment to talk about  what that means.   Mrs. DeVos ran a political action committee called ``All Children  Matter,'' which spent millions in campaign contributions to promote the  use of taxpayer dollars for school vouchers. The argument was that  these vouchers would allow low-income students to leave the public  school system and attend the private or religious school of their  family's choice. Mrs. DeVos has described this as ``school choice,''  claiming that it would give parents a chance to choose the best school  for their children, but that is not how it works. In reality, most  school vouchers don't cover the whole cost of private school tuition,  nor do they cover additional expenses like transportation, school  uniforms, and other supplies, which means the vouchers don't create  more choices for low-income families; they simply subsidize existing  choices for families who could already afford to pay for private  school.   As it happens, we have a real-life test case that we can look at to  determine whether Mrs. DeVos's argument holds water. Mrs. DeVos heads  up a voucher program in the State of Indiana, and guess what happened.  Today, more than half of the students in the Hoosier State who received  vouchers never actually attended Indiana public schools in the first  place, which means that their families were already in a position to  pay for private school. Indeed, vouchers are going to families earning  as much as $150,000 a year.   I am sure these families appreciated the extra help, but as of 2015,  nearly half of Indiana's children relied on free and reduced-price  lunch programs. These are the kids Mrs. DeVos claims would be helped by  school vouchers; instead, taxpayer dollars were taken away from public  schools that remain the only choice for these low-income families and  given to families who could already afford private school, who were  already sending their kids to private school. That is the reality of  school vouchers.   That is why after Mrs. DeVos developed a similar proposal for a  voucher program in Pennsylvania and an analysis projected that, just  like in Indiana, the vouchers would mostly benefit kids already  enrolled in private schools, voters rejected it on multiple occasions.  Yet Mrs. DeVos and her family continued their fight for school  vouchers. In fact, she has been such a fervent advocate that her  political action committee, ``All Children Matter,'' received the  largest fine for violating election law in Ohio's State history--a $5.3  million fine that nearly a decade later she still hasn't paid.   Why do this? The evidence is clear that Mrs. DeVos's voucher  obsession doesn't help low-income families. Quite to the contrary, it  represents a serious threat to the public school system--a system that  as many as 90 percent of the children rely on--but Mrs. DeVos describes  as ``a dead end.''    The truth is that Mrs. DeVos's education advocacy isn't really about  education at all. She describes her goal as follows: to advance God's  kingdom. Now many families choose to send their children to religious  schools, and many children receive an excellent education at religious  schools, but it is the public school system that the Secretary of  Education is supposed to focus on, and that is not the part that Mrs.  DeVos and her family have put at the forefront of her advocacy.   Mrs. DeVos spent a decade serving on the board of the Acton  Institute, which seeks to infuse religion in public life, beginning  with public education. She and her family have devoted millions to  promote the institute's work, including promoting ideas like this:         We must use the doctrine of religious liberty to gain       independence for Christian schools until we train up a       generation of people who know there is no religious       neutrality, no neutral law, no neutral education, and no       neutral civil government. Then they will get busy in       constructing a Bible-based social, political, and religious       order which finally denies the religious liberty of the       enemies of God.    Those are the words of Gary North, a Christian Dominionist for whom  the Acton Institute serves as a forum.   Of course, not everyone who believes in the potential of parochial  schools shares his view, but this is the kind of stuff Mrs. DeVos and  her family have spent millions and millions of dollars promoting. It is  fine for someone to hold strong religious views and to advocate for  those views and to spend their family fortune encouraging others to  adopt, but it is entirely fair to ask whether the mission of building a  Bible-based social, political, and religious order is compatible with  the mission of the Department of Education. So, yes, based on Mrs.  DeVos's radical ideology, I was skeptical when her nomination was sent  to the Senate, but I understand that others in this body may not have  shared my discomfort.   Within this Chamber we have important differences when it comes to  education policy and, for that matter, the appropriateness of using  taxpayer funds to advance God's Kingdom. And do you know what? That is  fine. But we all have the exact same responsibility when it comes to  vetting the President's Cabinet nominees.   Each of us is called upon to determine not just whether we agree with  the nominee's ideology but whether that nominee is free from relevant  conflicts of interest and, critically, whether the nominee is  competent, whether he or she is capable of doing the job. Making that  call is our job, and that is why we have the process that we have. It  is why we ask to see the nominee's financial information. It is why we  ask them to submit written answers to questionnaires about their  experience and their record. And it is why we have them come to the  Senate to sit in front of committees and to answer our questions.   Unfortunately, during her hearing, Mrs. DeVos proved beyond a shadow  of a doubt not only that her ideology is fundamentally incompatible  with the mission of the Department of Education but that she is  fundamentally incompetent to be its leader. Throughout the hearing, she  was unable to answer basic questions about her views on important  issues, she was unfamiliar with basic concepts of education policy, and  she was unwilling to make basic commitments to continue the  Department's work on behalf of our most vulnerable children.   Let me give you one example of what I mean. During my 5 minutes of  questioning, I asked Mrs. DeVos to weigh in  [[Page S730]]  on the debate about measuring growth versus measuring proficiency. I am  going to take a few moments right now to make sure that everyone here  and everyone watching at home understands what this debate is about and  just how central it is to the future of education policy. The  difference between the two approaches, proficiency and growth, is very  easy to explain.   Let's say a fifth grade teacher has a student who comes into the  classroom reading at a second grade level. Over the course of the  school year, the teacher brings the student up to a fourth grade level.  If we are measuring growth, we would say: Well, that teacher brought  that student up two grade levels in 1 year. That teacher is a hero.   If we are measuring for proficiency, we would say: Well, that student  is still reading below grade level. That teacher is a failure.   That is the difference between measuring growth and measuring  proficiency. It took me all of 30 seconds to explain that, but I could  spend all night talking about what this debate means for students,  teachers, school leaders, and our entire education system.   Everyone agrees that there should be accountability in our education  system--accountability for school systems, schools, teachers. We want  to know we are getting results. That was the core idea behind all the  standardized testing in No Child Left Behind. The problem was that No  Child Left Behind set up a system in which we assessed student learning  by measuring proficiency and only proficiency. As the law was  implemented, all sorts of problems emerged from taking this approach.    For example, teachers in Minnesota would tell me how measuring  proficiency would lead to what they called ``a race to the middle.''  See, measuring proficiency only measures whether or not students are  performing at grade level--at this line of proficiency, at grade  level--and a teacher is measured by what percentage of her students or  his students are above proficiency or at proficiency. A teacher does  not get credit for helping kids who were already well above grade level  to perform better, and they don't get credit for helping kids who are  way below grade level start to catch up. So we had this race to the  middle because it is a yes-or-no question: Did this student achieve  proficiency or not? A teacher's entire career could depend on how many  of his or her students met that arbitrary goal.   So under this system, understand this, please. A teacher had a strong  incentive to ignore all of the students at the top who were already  going to meet proficiency. No matter what you did to that kid, that kid  was going to beat proficiency in the No Child Left Behind test at the  end of the year. They had a strong incentive to ignore all the kids at  the bottom because, no matter what you did, that student wouldn't reach  proficiency. The only thing--or one of the only things--I liked about  No Child Left Behind was the name. And we were leaving behind the kids  at the top and the kids at the bottom because of the insistence on  proficiency.   I can't overstate how central this issue is to education, and I can't  tell my colleagues how important it is to educators across America. If  you talk to any State education secretary, any district superintendent,  any local school board member, any principal, any classroom teacher-- and, heck, parents--they will have an opinion on measuring growth  versus measuring proficiency.   So when Mrs. DeVos came before the HELP Committee, I asked for her  opinion on this very basic--this extremely basic--extremely important  question, and she had no idea what I was talking about. Let me be  clear. She wasn't reluctant to declare her opinion. She wasn't trying  to strike a middle ground. She did not know what I was talking about.   We would not accept a Secretary of Defense who couldn't name the  branches of the military. We would not accept a Secretary of State who  couldn't identify Europe on a map. We would not accept a Treasury  Secretary who doesn't understand multiplication. In fact, in nearly any  circumstance, if a candidate for a job is asked a question that basic  and that important and simply whiffs on it the way that Mrs. DeVos did,  there is no second question. There is just a thank you for your time,  and we will let you know, and will you please send in the next  candidate.   Earlier this year, the University of Minnesota hired a new head  football coach. I wasn't there for the interview. But imagine if the  first question for a candidate for football coach of your university  was as follows: How many yards does it take to get a first down? And  imagine if the candidate answers as follows: Thank you for your  question, Mr. Athletic Director; I can pledge to you that I will work  very hard to get as many first downs as possible to make sure, we hope,  that we lead the team to touchdowns.   This wasn't the question. The question was this: How many yards does  it take to get a first down?   Well, thank you again for the question. I can tell you this: I will  look forward to working with you to prevent the other team from getting  first downs also.   Understand, that is how basic my question to Mrs. DeVos was, and that  is how shocking it was that she simply didn't know enough about  education policy to answer it.   This inexplicable failure alone was enough for me to conclude that  Mrs. DeVos lacked the knowledge and understanding that should be a bare  minimum for anyone seeking the position. But the entire hearing--the  entire hearing--was a showcase for her lack of qualifications. I would  urge any of my colleagues who haven't had a chance to watch it. I urge  you to do so before casting a vote for this nominee. It was one of the  most embarrassing scenes I have witnessed during my time in the Senate.  In fact, I believe it may have been one of the most embarrassing  performances by a nominee in the history of the Senate.   Asked about the right of children with disabilities to get a quality  public education, she didn't know that this right is protected by a  Federal law--the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Asked  about guns in schools, she suggested that maybe guns should be kept on  hand in case grizzly bears attacked. This was in answer to a question  from Senator Murphy, who in Congress represents Sandy Hook and who, as  a Senator, represents those parents. That was her answer to him.   Asked about whether she would hold private parochial schools that get  taxpayer funding to the same standard of accountability as public  schools, she couldn't or wouldn't say.   Asked about a family foundation that has donated millions of dollars  to an organization promoting conversion therapy for LGBT youth, she  claimed she had no involvement, which is ridiculous. Even if Mrs.  DeVos's own role as vice president of that foundation was a 13-year  clerical error, as she now claims, she herself has donated  approximately $75,000 to support that anti-LGBT organization's work.   Now, understand that none of these were difficult questions. None of  these were gotchas. All of these failures took place during a single 5- minute-per-Senator round of questioning, because after that first  round, the hearing was cut off and our chairman refused to allow any  further questions.   By the way, I would like to say a word about that move to cut off  questioning. I have great respect for the chairman of the HELP  Committee, Lamar Alexander. We have worked together, and he worked with  Senator Murray on the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind, changing  it to ESSA, the Every Student Succeeds Act. I respect the chairman  tremendously. But his decision to end that hearing was wrong, and his  rationale was simply false. Our chairman insisted that because  Secretary Duncan and Secretary King had been subject to only a single  round of questions, there was a precedent to deny the minority a second  round of questioning of Mrs. DeVos. That simply isn't so.   First of all, as I discussed earlier, both Ernie Duncan and John King  were experienced education professionals with long records of public  service. Even if Republican Members had occasion to disagree with them  on policy matters, there was no question that their backgrounds had  prepared them for the job of Secretary of Education, and that is the  bigger point here. There were no further questions. In both cases,  committee members weren't denied the opportunity for a second  [[Page S731]]  round of questioning. They simply chose not to engage in one. Indeed,  when I asked the Congressional Research Service, they confirmed that  those hearings did not establish the precedent that our chairman  claimed.   Instead of allowing us to question Mrs. DeVos further, the chairman  invited us to submit additional questions in writing, presumably so  that she could get some help from her Trump administration handlers in  answering them. Even so, her written responses only served to further  expose her own lack of understanding of how education policy affects  Americans.   For example, I asked Mrs. DeVos in writing about the effects of  trauma and adverse childhood experiences on education. This is a  subject I have been interested in for a long time. A lot of kids in our  country live in extreme poverty. Some may have a parent in prison or a  parent who has passed away. These kids may also experience physical  abuse or emotional abuse or neglect. There may be some drug or alcohol  abuse taking place in the house. Some have witnessed domestic violence  in their home or street violence in their neighborhood. Some have seen  siblings shot and killed right in front of them. Decades of research  have shown that the trauma that comes from such adverse childhood  experiences actually changes a child's brain chemistry and affects  their behavioral development, their mental and physical health, and  their chances to succeed in school and in society longterm. But  research has also shown that these challenges can be overcome and that  the kids who do overcome them are the most resilient kids you have ever  met.   Our public education system was designed to give these kids a  shot. Teachers and administrators often lack the resources they need to  give these children the chance they deserve. Because Mrs. DeVos's  crusade for school vouchers would further rob our public schools of  these limited funds, I wanted to know her thoughts on this important  issue.    This is take-home. Her written answer was brief and superficial. She  wrote that she had heard that children are impacted by trauma and that  trauma can cause difficulties in a child's education. That was it. Was  she unfamiliar with the literature? Was she unwilling to acknowledge  that poor kids face special challenges? Would she be remotely  interested in addressing these challenges as Secretary of Education? I  guess we may never know.   I also asked Mrs. DeVos in writing about her vision for education in  rural communities. As the Presiding Officer knows--the Governor and now  Senator from South Dakota--many of our children in America attend  school in rural America, 10 million American kids, schools that  struggle with teacher shortages and transportation challenges. I asked  how would her school choice agenda help them. In her response, she  pointed to online schools, which are often run by for-profit companies,  many with questionable records. In fact, one of the country's biggest  online schools recently agreed to a $168.5 million settlement in  California for allegedly defrauding families--a $168.5 million  settlement.   But even online schools that aren't out to rip off students often  wind up failing them. A 2015 Stanford study showed that, on average,  kids in online schools lose the equivalent of 72 days of learning in  reading and 180 days of learning in math, and that is for each 180-day  school year, which means that kids in online schools can fall up to a  year behind in math.   Of course, as the Presiding Officer knows, many rural communities  lack reliable broadband access. I have been on rural education tours  where I find students who go to a McDonald's parking lot so they can  get WiFi to read their public school assignment or get materials to  study. This is another answer that wasn't an answer at all, yet another  piece of evidence that Mrs. DeVos is simply not up to this job.   Like many Americans, I have serious concerns about many aspects of  the Trump administration's agenda. Still, I believe that as a United  States Senator, it is my job to evaluate each nominee on his or her own  merits. That is why I voted for nominees like Secretary Mattis and  Secretary Chao, even though I disagree with them on important issues.  General Mattis, for example, has nearly a half century of military  service under his belt, he has earned the respect of leaders on both  sides of the aisle, and I believe he will be a much needed voice of  reason on the Trump administration's foreign policy. Ms. Chao has a  lengthy background in public service, including as Secretary of Labor  and Deputy Secretary of Transportation. I believe she will bring  significant and valuable experience to her important role. I may well  take issue with the decisions they make and the agenda they implement  as members of President Trump's Cabinet, but at the very least, each  illustrated during their confirmation hearings that they have a basic  understanding of the issues they will be responsible for. Mrs. DeVos is  different.   I have heard from Minnesotans about many of President Trump's  nominees, but the outcry over this nomination far surpasses anything  else. As of a week ago, my office had received 3,000 calls about this  nominee. A grand total of 12 were in favor of her confirmation.  Additionally, we received more than 18,000 letters and emails, and  again the overwhelming majority of them have urged me to oppose this  nomination.   For example, a woman from Brainerd, MN, wrote to say that she never  contacted one of her representatives before and didn't consider herself  very political--in fact, she was neither a Democrat nor a Republican,  but she has a daughter in second grade and a son beginning kindergarten  in the fall, and she wanted me to vote against Betsy DeVos. ``How,''  she asked, ``is someone who has never had any experience in public  education supposed to competently preside over it?''   A mother of two public school students in Faribault, MN, wrote of  Mrs. DeVos: ``As I watched her during the hearing, I was in disbelief  that she would be appointed to such an important position.''   Another constituent from Warren, MN, wrote: ``This woman is so  unqualified, it's scary.''   Last week, I went to dinner with Vice President Walter Mondale at his  favorite restaurant. Afterward, he took me into the kitchen to greet  some of the men and women who worked at the restaurant. One of the guys  in the kitchen--I am a little unclear of whether he was taking dishes  to the dishwasher or he was washing dishes. He is not a teacher, he is  not an education advocate, just a guy who works in the kitchen. He  said: ``Please vote against DeVos.''   There is a reason why this nomination has been met with such  overwhelming resistance on the part of the American people, and I know  I am not the only one who has heard it. In fact, two of my Republican  colleagues and fellow HELP Committee members who sat through that  hearing, Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski, have stepped forward to  announce they cannot vote for this nominee. They don't agree with me on  every aspect of education policy, but, believe me, when we put ESSA-- Every Student Succeeds Act--together, the committee voted unanimously.  There is a lot of agreement on education policy on our committee, but  Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski saw the same hearing I did. Like  me, they saw a nominee who simply does not understand the needs of the  students our Secretary of Education is supposed to serve.   I will let my colleagues speak for themselves as to the reasons why  they will be joining me in voting against this nominee, but I would  like to close by asking a few questions of my colleagues who are still  considering a vote in her favor.   If Mrs. DeVos's performance didn't convince you that she lacks the  qualifications for this job, what would have had to have happened in  that hearing in order to convince you? If you cannot bring yourself to  vote against this nominee, is there anyone President Trump could  nominate for any position that you could vote against? If we cannot set  party loyalty aside long enough to perform the essential duty of  vetting the President's nominees, what are we even doing here?   The Constitution gives us the power to reject Cabinet nominations  specifically so we can prevent fundamentally ill-equipped nominees like  Betsy DeVos from assuming positions of power for which they are not  qualified. Let's do our job. For the sake of our children, let's do our  job.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.  [[Page S732]]     Will Senator Murray yield for a question?    Thank you. As Senators on opposite sides of the aisle,  we have philosophical differences, but one thing I think we all agree  on is that our Cabinet Secretaries must be qualified and up to the  challenge of running an agency.   Betsy DeVos has demonstrated that she is not qualified to run the  Education Department. I would say to my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle, if you watched her confirmation hearing, you would know  that. It was the most embarrassing confirmation hearing I have ever  seen. She could not answer the most basic questions about education. So  I ask my Republican colleagues, if Mrs. DeVos's performance in this  hearing didn't convince you that she lacks qualifications for this job,  what would have had to have happened in that hearing in order to  convince you?   If we cannot set aside party loyalty long enough to perform the  essential duty of vetting the President's nominees, what are we even  doing here?   Let's do our job for the sake of the children and for the sake of our  Nation's future. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. President. I rise in opposition to the  nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions to serve as our Nation's next  Attorney General.   The U.S. Attorney General has a job like none other. Our Nation's top  law enforcement officer doesn't enforce just the laws designed to  protect national security and keep the public safe but also the laws  designed to protect Americans' civil rights and civil liberties, the  laws that guarantee each and every American access to the same  opportunities and to participate fully in our democracy.   I know Senator Sessions. He and I have served on the Judiciary  Committee together since I joined the Senate back in 2009, and I have a  good relationship with Senator Sessions. I respect him as a colleague.  But as anyone who has observed Senator Sessions or me in a Judiciary  Committee hearing could probably tell you, he and I have very different  views about many of the issues that he stands to influence as Attorney  General, particularly matters of equal justice. So once the President  announced his nomination and after Senator Sessions submitted his  material to the committee, I reviewed his background carefully, and I  paid special attention to how he described his work on civil rights. I  noticed some discrepancies in the way he described his involvement in  civil rights cases filed during his time as U.S. attorney. Those  discrepancies stood out to me, and they didn't just stand out because  civil rights is an issue I care about personally or because it is an  issue I know Senator Sessions and I have disagreed about in the past;  the discrepancies caught my attention because the information seemed to  misrepresent the nominee's record, and that is something Senator  Sessions himself promised not to do.   You see, back in 2009 when Senator Sessions became the ranking member  of the Judiciary Committee, he was interviewed about how he would  approach the committee's work in general and nominations in specific.  Senator Specter, who was serving as the ranking Republican at the time,  had just changed his party affiliation to join the Democrats, and so  the gavel passed to Senator Sessions. Some people, particularly on my  side of the aisle, were anxious about how Senator Sessions would lead  the committee's Republicans given his more conservative views, but  during that interview with the National Review, Senator Sessions  indicated that Democrats should expect him to be an honest broker, to  be fair to the Democratic nominee.   Senator Sessions cited his experience before the Judiciary Committee  back in 1986 when President Reagan nominated him to serve on the  Federal bench. The committee rejected his nomination then, and Senator  Sessions felt that in doing so, the committee had distorted his record.  He said: ``What I learned in that process is that we're not going to  misrepresent any nominee's record, and we're not going to lie about  it.''    Senator Sessions said, as ranking member, that nominees before the  committee would be ``entitled to explain the charges against them. That  doesn't mean I'll accept their explanation or agree with it.''   In my view, that seemed like a fair way to conduct the committee's  business. When I set about the task of reviewing Senator Sessions'  record and the materials that he provided to the committee, I expected  that those materials would not misrepresent his record. I took him at  his word.   So when I noticed discrepancies regarding the nominee's record, I  gave Senator Sessions an opportunity to explain them. I asked him about  his claim to have filed 20 or 30 desegregation cases, a claim he made  in that same 2009 National Review interview. In response, in the  committee hearing Senator Sessions said: ``The records do not show that  there were 20 or 30 actually filed cases.'' Of the claim, he said:  ``The record does not justify it.''   I then moved on to question him about four cases he had listed on his  committee questionnaire, which asked him to list the ``10 most  significant litigated matters [he] personally handled.'' Among those 10  cases were three voting rights cases and a desegregation case.   I know Senator Sessions, and I know his record on voting rights. He  is no champion of voting rights. He has called the Voting Rights Act  ``intrusive'' and complained about States with a history of  discrimination being subject to preclearance. But here his  questionnaire seemed to tout his personal involvement in three voting  rights cases and one desegregation case. It seemed to me that, given  his previous experience before this committee and given the concern the  civil rights community had expressed about his nomination, perhaps the  transition team or others managing Senator Sessions' nomination had  attempted to revise some of his history and recast him as a civil  rights champion.   I questioned Senator Sessions about the questionnaire's claim of  personally handling those four civil rights cases. I mentioned that the  Department of Justice attorneys who had worked on three of those four  cases wrote an op-ed stating that Senator Sessions had no substantive  involvement in those cases. Two of those attorneys also submitted  testimony to that effect, explaining that Senator Sessions had no  personal involvement in some of the cases that he had listed among the  top 10 matters that he had personally listed.   I asked Senator Sessions about this. In my view, he deserved an  opportunity to explain himself. I asked him whether these attorneys had  distorted his record by stating that with regard to three of those four  cases: ``We can state categorically that Sessions had no substantive  involvement in any of them.''   Senator Sessions said: Yes, he believed they were distorting his  record. He said that he had supported the attorneys, and he had signed  the complaints they had brought.   Senator Sessions' reply mirrored answers he provided in a supplement  to his initial questionnaire. In that supplement, which he filed 2  weeks after his initial questionnaire, the nominee clarified that his  role was to ``provide support for'' DOJ attorneys. He said he  ``provided assistance and guidance'' and ``cooperated'' with DOJ  lawyers--not quite ``personally handled,'' if you ask me. I suspect  that is why he felt the need to file the supplement.   It is also worth noting that all four of the civil rights cases at  issue--the ones at issue here--had either concluded or were still  active back when Senator Sessions first appeared before the Judiciary  Committee in 1986. But 30 years ago, when he submitted his  questionnaire, which also asked him to list the ``ten most significant  litigated matters which [he] personally handled,'' Senator Sessions did  not list a single one of these four cases--not a single one. I wonder  what changed between 1986 and now that caused these four civil rights  cases to take on new significance for the nominee. Look, the fact of  the matter is that Senator Sessions simply did not personally handle  the civil rights cases that his questionnaire indicates he personally  handled. His questionnaire overstates his involvement in these cases  and the supplement he filed makes that perfectly clear. As I said, in  the Judiciary Committee, Senator Sessions would not have tolerated that  kind of misrepresentation, and no Member of this body should either.  Senator Sessions said in 2009:         We're are not going to misrepresent any nominee's record. .       . . They'll be entitled to  [[Page S919]]       explain the charges against them. That doesn't mean I'll       accept their explanation or agree with it.    And neither do I.   The Senate has an important job to do. It requires that each and  every one of us understand the nominee's record accurately. The duties  and responsibilities of our Nation's top law enforcement officer demand  that the President nominate an individual who puts country before party  and who is willing to pursue justice for the most vulnerable among us.  But I do not have confidence that a nominee whose submissions to the  Judiciary Committee inflate and exaggerate his handling of the critical  issues--issues such as protecting the right to vote--is, frankly,  capable of pursuing equal justice under the law.   I questioned Senator Sessions about voting rights during his hearing.  I asked him about an extraordinary claim by the then President-elect.  In late November, President-Elect Trump tweeted: ``In addition to  winning the electoral college in a landslide, I won the popular vote if  you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.'' Let me repeat  that: ``the millions of people who voted illegally.''   Let's be clear. President Trump lost the popular vote by 2.86 million  votes--the popular vote for the President. He is the President of the  United States, but he lost the popular vote by 2.86 million votes. When  he says, ``I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people  who voted illegally,'' he is saying that at least 2.86 million people  voted illegally.   That is a pretty extraordinary charge. During Senator Sessions'  hearing, I asked, do you agree with the President-elect that millions  of fraudulent votes had been cast?   He responded: ``I don't know what the President-elect meant or was  thinking when he made that comment, or what facts he may have had to  justify his statement.''   Senator Sessions didn't say whether he agreed. I asked him whether he  had talked to the President-elect about that issue. Senator Sessions  said: ``I have not talked to him about that in any depth.''   Under the Attorney General's leadership and direction, the Department  of Justice is tasked with protecting the right to vote and with  prosecuting fraud. It seems unusual to me that the President-elect  would make such an outrageous claim, backed with no evidence, asserting  that a fraud of truly epic proportion had occurred and that he wouldn't  bother to discuss it with the man nominated to lead the Justice  Department nor that the man tasked to head the Justice Department  wouldn't ask him about it and ask what his evidence was so that when he  became Attorney General, he could prosecute this voter fraud.   But, in my questioning, none of this seemed to bother Senator  Sessions. I suppose that shouldn't come as a surprise, because another  thing that didn't seem to bother Senator Sessions was the speed with  which States previously covered by the Voting Rights Act, covered by  preclearance, moved to restrict voting rights after the Supreme Court's  Shelby County decision. He and I discussed this at his hearing. I  pointed out that after Shelby County, States moved quickly to enact new  restrictions, but he didn't seem concerned.   We discussed North Carolina, which enacted restrictions that the  Fourth Circuit eventually described as targeting African Americans with  ``almost surgical precision''--targeting African Americans with almost  surgical precision to make it harder for them to vote, to suppress  their vote, which suppressed African-American votes in the 2014  election. So this had happened.   But it didn't seem to bother Senator Sessions. All he said was  ``every election needs to be managed closely and we need to ensure that  there is integrity in it, and I do believe we regularly have fraudulent  activities occur during election cycles.''   Now, let's be clear. Claims of apocryphal voter fraud are used to  justify voter suppression. Claims of bogus fraud are exactly what  States cite when they enact laws designed to keep certain people from  voting.   So understanding Senator Sessions' views on voting rights and  understanding how he responded to the President-elect's outrageous  claims of fraud--and is there anyone here in this body who doesn't  believe that the President's claims are outrageous and, indeed,  pernicious? Keeping Senator Sessions' views on voting rights in mind  and understanding how he responded to the President's claims is  important to helping us assess whether he is capable of filling one of  the Attorney General's most important duties, protecting the right to  vote.   That is how we all got here. We won elections. That is how the  Presiding Officer won an election in Alaska, fair and square. This is  so basic. The Fourth Circuit ruled that North Carolina had surgically  targeted African Americans, and because of the Shelby decision, the  Justice Department couldn't review that, couldn't do preclearance,  couldn't prevent African Americans from having their votes suppressed.  That should bother us.    That should bother every one of us. It really should. We are here. We  had some arguments over the last evening. The ones having the arguments  were all elected. Protecting the franchise is the most basic duty in a  democracy. And whose job is that? That is the job of the Attorney  General.   Think about how basic and fundamental this is. It is all the words  that are said here on the floor, they are said by people who won  elections. I won an election by 312 votes. Every vote is important. To  suppress votes, to surgically target a race of people, how  fundamentally wrong is that? It should make us shiver. It should, I  would hope, clarify to my colleagues why there is so much fear in this  country, when a man who is President of the United States says there  are 3 million to 5 million votes fraudulently cast. I wonder how he got  3 million. Could it possibly have anything to do with the fact that he  lost the popular vote by 2.86 million? How did he bring that figure out  of the air?   What are the American people supposed to think when the President  makes these laughable claims, faced with no facts whatsoever?   He told the story about a German golfer in line in Florida. Do my  colleagues remember this? He heard this story thirdhand. This is his  proof to the congressional leadership. I believe Senator Cornyn was  actually there. I think he was part of the group who went there as the  leadership of the Senate. The President said that part of his evidence  was this story that this German golfer in line had three Hispanic  people in front of him and three in back. The President then went into  conjecture about what Latin American countries they could be from. Then  he said that none of them were pulled out of the line; only the German  golfer, the famous German golfer. He has won some PGA tournaments. He  is a great golfer. He is not registered to vote in the United States.   The story was apocryphal. Doesn't this send a chill down the spine of  every Member of this Senate who cares about the franchise?   Think about it. This is the fundamental building block of our  democracy--the franchise.   Now, Senator Sessions said during his hearing that he believes we  regularly have fraudulent activities during our election cycles. That  might explain why he didn't talk with the President-elect in any depth  about the now-President's claim that millions of fraudulent votes were  cast. Perhaps Senator Sessions didn't find it alarming because he  believes there is a kernel of truth in the claim. There is not. That  claim has been fact-checked to death. Nearly 138 million votes were  cast in the 2016 election. State officials found virtually no credible  reports of fraud and no sign whatsoever of widespread fraud.   In 2014, a comprehensive study examined elections over 14 years,  during which more than 1 billion ballots were cast, and they found just  31 incidents of in-person fraud, but that didn't stop President Trump.  Never let the truth get in the way of a good story. He again claimed  that he won the popular vote and continued to claim it and asked for an  investigation.   This is so profoundly disturbing. I ask my colleagues, doesn't it  bother you?   The President went on to tweet about this ``major investigation into  VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those  who are illegal, and even, those registered to vote who are dead, and  then (and many for a long time).''  [[Page S920]]    I know on my deathbed, which I hope is many, many years from now,  surrounded by my family, my grandchildren, and hopefully my great- grandchildren, if they say: Grandpa, Great-grandpa, any last wishes, I  would say: Yes, I want to, before I leave this world, ``slip my mortal  coil,'' or whatever Shakespeare said; I want to make sure that I  unregistered to vote because I was a U.S. Senator and I wouldn't want  to commit voter fraud, so, please, somebody, call the county clerk. I  am too weak to do that.   But I want to unregister because clearly anyone who doesn't  unregister to vote before they die is committing some kind of fraud,  and clearly anyone who is registered to vote in two States is  committing fraud--people like Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer, the Press  Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary designee, the President's  daughter Tiffany, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. We really should  investigate them.   The President has said the administration would form a commission led  by Vice President Pence to investigate this voter fraud.   This raises serious concerns, not the least of which is whether such  an order or commission would serve as a pretext for nationwide voter  suppression. Before my colleagues vote on Senator Sessions' nomination,  we deserve to know whether the President intends for the Attorney  General or the Justice Department to lead or participate in these  investigations.   When the President of the United States lies about the existence of  massive, widespread fraud, it is the job of the Attorney General to  call him on it. It is the job of the Attorney General to call him on  it. The Attorney General has an obligation to tell it like it is.  Senator Sessions may have said it best himself. When Sally Yates was  nominated to be the Deputy Attorney General, Senator Sessions  questioned her during her confirmation hearing. He said: ``You have to  watch out because people will be asking you to do things and you will  need to say no.''   Do you think the Attorney General has a responsibility to say no to  the President if he asks for something that is improper? A lot of  people have defended the Lynch nomination, for example, by saying:  Well, he will appoint somebody who is going to execute his views. Well,  what is wrong with that? But if the views the President wants to  execute are unlawful, should the Attorney General or the Deputy  Attorney General say no?   Ms. Yates responded: Senator, I believe the Attorney General or the  Deputy Attorney General has an obligation to follow the law and the  Constitution, to give their independent legal advice to the President.   As everyone here should agree, that is exactly what Ms. Yates did  last week--I think it was last week. These weeks seem long. This Nation  owes her a debt of gratitude. She did exactly what Senator Sessions  asked if she would do, but I fear Senator Sessions has not demonstrated  that he is capable of fulfilling that obligation, and his record, as  demonstrated by the fact that he did not discuss these claims with the  President, suggests that he is simply not willing to speak truth to  power.   Now, Senator Sessions has a long record, not just during his time as  U.S. attorney and as Alabama's attorney general but here in the U.S.  Senate. But regardless of the posts he held, Senator Sessions has not  exhibited what I would characterize as a commitment to equal justice.   In my view, it is the obligation of elected officials, law  enforcement officers to recognize injustice when they see it and stand  in opposition to it, but on far too many occasions, it seems that  Senator Sessions has not followed that obligation.   In 2009, the Senate debated the Matthew Shepard and James Senator  Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the bill that extended Federal  hate crimes protections to people targeted on the basis of their sexual  orientation or gender identity. In the hearing on that bill, Senator  Sessions said, ``I am not sure women or people with different sexual  orientations face that kind of discrimination. I just don't see it.''   Senator Sessions repeatedly opposed a bill to reauthorize the  Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, the landmark law combating  domestic sexual violence. The bill would have expanded the law to  protect LGBT people, Native American women, and immigrant women, but he  voted against it three times. He said that ``there are matters put on  the bill that almost seem to invite opposition.'' I raised this with  Senator Sessions prior to his hearing, and I pointed out that Native  women experience an epidemic of sexual and domestic violence, much of  it at the hands of non-Indians--most of it--a large majority of it.  That is not a new development. But Senator Sessions said to me that at  the time he voted on the issue, he didn't understand the gravity of the  problem. He must not have seen it.    In 2006, when the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on reauthorizing  the Voting Rights Act, Senator Sessions said there is ``little present  day evidence'' of State and local officials restricting access to the  ballot box. He complained that the Voting Rights Act's preclearance  requirement unfairly targeted certain States. He said, ``Alabama is  proud of its accomplishments, but we have the right to ask why other  areas of the country are not covered by it.'' Now, the Voting Rights  Act's preclearance requirement forced States with a history of enacting  discriminatory measures to get Federal approval before changing their  voting practices. That is why Alabama was subject to preclearance, but  he just didn't see it.   During this hearing and in his responses to written questions,  Senator Sessions has said that ``all Americans are entitled to equal  protection under the law, no matter their background.'' He has said  that, if confirmed, he would ``enforce the laws passed by Congress.''  But time and time again, Senator Sessions has demonstrated an inability  to recognize injustice--whether it is discrimination faced by LGBT  people, discriminatory barriers to the ballot box, or violence against  women. If he can't see injustice, what assurance do we have that he  will act to stop it?   The communities we represent should be confident that the Nation's  top law enforcement officer is capable of recognizing the challenges  they face and will help them overcome those challenges. Before the  Senate moves to confirm this nominee, it is important to understand  whether Senator Sessions is able or willing to acknowledge those  challenges and to take steps necessary to address them, not turn a  blind eye. I am not confident that he is, and I will be voting against  him.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
