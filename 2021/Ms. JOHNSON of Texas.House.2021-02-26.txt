 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and in strong support of this rule.   Madam Speaker, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit our shores a year ago,  researchers across the Nation and across many fields of science and  engineering jumped into action. The Nation's STEM talent redirected  brainpower and resources to combatting the pandemic. And thanks in  large part to  [[Page H770]]  these efforts, we now have some positive news about our fight against  COVID.   However, important scientific work remains to be done in this effort.  The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology's provisions included  in this package direct funding through the National Science Foundation  and the National Institute of Standards and Technology for vital  research related to prevention, response, and recovery from COVID-19.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues across the House for their work  on this important rescue package, and I urge its adoption.
