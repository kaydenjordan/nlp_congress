 Mr. Speaker, in their continued relentless  assault on religious freedoms, Democrats are trying today, with this  terrible bill, to make wholesale and damaging changes to our Nation's  civil rights laws with little to no debate or even discussion on how  this legislation will affect the daily lives of Americans and the  institutions we hold dear.   While the Equality Act purports to be an inclusive piece of  legislation, it is actually exclusive of those with a different  viewpoint. It would ultimately put civil rights laws at odds with  longstanding religious beliefs pertaining to sex, sexuality, and other  moral issues.   The result would be that faith-based nonprofits, such as a Christian  shelter for women or an adoption agency or other religiously affiliated  providers of social services, could not minister in good conscience  without suffering consequences under Federal law.   We have past history as a precedent, an ominous precedent, as we saw  the Obama-Biden administration seek to close down the Little Sisters of  the Poor and Catholic nuns who care for the dying simply because they  would not pay for their employees' contraception or drugs inducing  abortion.   A vote for the Equality Act would solidify the Biden-Harris  administration's efforts to enforce the same radical religious and  moral litmus tests that leave no room for faith-based ministries and  organizations to operate without subscribing to the dogma of the left.   The Equality Act essentially weaponizes civil rights laws against  Americans' fundamental liberties, and we must reject this assault on  our most precious of freedoms. I oppose this rule, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
