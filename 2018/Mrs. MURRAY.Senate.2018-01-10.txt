Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.  [[Page S118]]         Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  an issue that is critical to patients and families in my home State of  Washington and across the country. Today, parents are wondering if they  will be able to get the healthcare their kids need, and communities are  wondering if they will be able to provide it.   That is unacceptable.   Congress has to swiftly and fully restore the Children's Health  Insurance Program, or CHIP, and funding for other services families  need, like community health centers, which have been waiting more than  100 days for a long-term solution. They should do so without making  deep cuts to successful prevention programs in the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention that tackle avoidable conditions like heart  disease and diabetes.   Democrats have wanted to get this done for months. By focusing on  pushing through partisan tax reform at the end of the year, Republicans  instead put massive corporations and the wealthiest ahead of making  sure our children and their families have the healthcare they need. I  hope they are now ready to give these issues their full and immediate  attention. In case they aren't, I want to make sure they know exactly  what this is about.   It is about children like Stella. Stella lives in Washington State.  She is 5 years old. She has two brothers. She has a love of the  outdoors, especially swimming and kayaking. She has a typical  kindergartner's boundless energy and excitement. But Stella was born  with spina bifida, an issue with how her spinal cord was formed. In the  past year of dealing with that condition, Stella's family went through  5 catheters a day, almost 2,000 in total. They went on 10 different  occasions to have MRI scans. They went to get her new leg braces. Given  the cost of all that, they went through their $5,000 deductible in the  first 5 weeks of the year. That is right. It took just 5 weeks.  Additionally, this year Stella is also scheduled to have bladder and  kidney surgery.   As one can imagine, the expenses are really adding up. Even with both  parents working, covering Stella's healthcare needs would be an  unimaginable task. Fortunately, Stella does qualify for health  insurance through CHIP. CHIP has helped her family afford the treatment  she needs, including physical therapy.   Stella's story is just one of many examples of families who rely on  this program. There are 60,000 children in Washington State who are now  insured through CHIP. Nine million families nationwide rely on it to  help address the healthcare needs of their children. Yet Congress has  taken over 102 days and counting to restore it. There is no excuse for  this inaction.   Families who rely on the CHIP Program are not alone in needing our  immediate attention. Thanks to CHIP and Medicaid, the uninsured rate  among children is now at an all-time low. Jeopardizing this  accomplishment by letting CHIP twist in the wind is simply  unacceptable. This Republican-controlled Congress has also failed to  renew other investments that our families rely on for the care they  need--programs such as community health centers, which serve 25 million  patients, particularly in our rural and poorer communities; the  National Health Service Corps, which brings doctors and other  healthcare providers to underserved areas through scholarships and loan  repayment; and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education  Program, which brings primary care and dental residencies to  communities in need. Leaving these programs without long-term  extensions a minute longer is utterly irresponsible because this lack  of certainty for them is already bringing a negative impact on our  communities.   For example, the Northeast Washington Health Programs serve some of  most the rural areas in my State, including Ferry County, which has  fewer than four people per square mile. They are struggling to hire  needed medical staff and managers because of this uncertainty that is  now there. Ferry County cannot wait.   The Community Health Association of Spokane runs 12 health center  sites and sees more than 70,000 patients a year. They recently began  offering very much needed opioid addiction treatment. If Congress does  not reauthorize the community health center funding, those efforts will  be jeopardized and expansions will be halted. Spokane cannot wait.   Yakima Neighborhood Health Services served over 22,000 patients in  2016. Almost all of those patients were below 200 percent of the  Federal poverty line.   If Congress does not act soon, three different clinics, including a  clinic in one of the poorest cities in Washington, will be at risk.  Yakima cannot wait.   I have heard additional stories of similar hardships from across my  State. North Olympic Healthcare Network has had to put expansions on  behavioral healthcare on hold. Another health center in Washington may  have to reconsider building a new children's dental residency program.  A center serving Whatcom County may have to cancel a project for  medical, dental, and behavioral healthcare facilities as well.   Across the country there are a lot of examples for community health  centers just like the ones I mentioned. Healthcare that people of all  ages and backgrounds rely on is being put in jeopardy, all because  Republicans prioritized tax cuts for those at the top before the health  needs of millions of people at the end of last year.   It is far past time to show these families that we are willing to  work to get this done. We need to give them the peace of mind that they  can get the healthcare they need. They deserve that.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
