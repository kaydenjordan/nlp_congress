 Mr. Speaker, I am here to discuss a very serious issue,  which are the mounting threats and criticism of Robert Mueller's  investigation into criminality taking place in the course of the  Presidential election with interference by the Russians and possible  collusion with various Americans working with him.   But I want to start by putting this in a general context, Mr.  Speaker. Tom Paine said: ``In the monarchies, the king is law; but in  the democracies, the law is king.''   We place everything on the rule of law here in the United States of  America. It is how we control the people who occupy the highest offices  of government and control vast amounts of resources that belong to the  people of the United States.   In the monarchies and in the dictatorships, the people have no  control over those who occupy government; but in the democracies, in  the constitutional societies, we exercise control over the people who  lead the government to make sure that they don't abuse their power for  improper purposes: for private gain, for the enrichment of particular  classes, or for the perpetuation of their own political power.   Now, when we took office at the beginning of this year, Mr. Speaker,  we received an Intelligence Committee report, signed by 18 intelligence  agencies: the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, the Defense Intelligence Agency,  and on and on.   They all told us the same thing, which is that Vladimir Putin had  attempted to interfere and had interfered in the American election  through cyber espionage and cyber sabotage in an effort to determine  the outcome of our election. That took place. We knew that way back  when we first took office.   Now, in the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which  I serve on, and in the House Judiciary Committee, which I serve on, we  were told--and we have been told for months going all the way back to  the beginning of the year--that we don't need to investigate this  assault on the sovereignty of the American people in our own election  because there is an excellent lawyer and law enforcement official in  charge of the special counsel investigation: Robert Mueller.   Indeed, Robert Mueller is a man of extraordinary and, perhaps,  singular qualification. He is a decorated war hero from the Vietnam  war; a U.S. attorney, who had been the U.S. attorney for both the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of California; a former  Director of the FBI.   And do you know what?   Robert Mueller is a registered Republican. He was named as special  counsel by another registered Republican and another widely heralded  and highly-qualified law enforcement official: Rod Rosenstein, who had  been a career attorney in the Department of Justice, and then the U.S.  attorney appointed by President Bush in the great State of Maryland, my  home State; and who is presently the Deputy Attorney General of the  United States, appointed by another Republican: Attorney General  Sessions.   So Attorney General Sessions appointed Rod Rosenstein, who is the  Deputy Attorney General, a Republican; and Rod Rosenstein appointed  another Republican and a widely admired and highly-qualified law  enforcement official, Robert Mueller, to take over as the special  counsel.                                time  1315    Now, with all these Republicans in charge of the investigation and  with the Republicans here in Congress saying, ``no, we won't do any  investigations of our own,'' despite past practice, we have to ask why  Special Counsel Robert Mueller this week has suddenly come under  withering fire by our GOP colleagues in the most ferocious organized  attack on a Federal prosecution and prosecutor I have ever seen.   Well, the answer, alas, is obvious. They are attacking Special  Counsel Robert Mueller and his fine team of lawyers and investigators  because Mueller and his team are doing their jobs and justice is being  done. There have already been two guilty pleas arising from this  investigation: one from President Trump's former National Security  Advisor, General Flynn, who pled guilty to lying to the FBI about  Trump-Russia; and another criminal confession and guilty plea from the  former foreign policy assistant, George Papadopoulos, who also took  full responsibility for his criminal conduct in lying about Trump- Russia to the FBI.   And there have been sweeping criminal indictments handed down by the  Mueller team, the special counsel, against Paul Manafort, Trump's  former campaign manager, and his associate, Rick Gates.   Now, for all we know, this might be the end of it. The special  counsel isn't talking. He is not leaking. He is doing his job. But it  is also possible that the investigation is just getting started and  that they are closing in on even higher targets: perhaps Jared Kushner,  the all-purpose Trump aide and the  [[Page H9931]]  President's son-in-law, perhaps he is within the scopes of this  investigation; perhaps Donald Trump, Jr.; and perhaps the President of  the United States himself, Donald Trump.   And so the White House has issued its apparently desperate and  cornered animal orders. The President cries chaos and let's slip the  dogs of war against Special Counsel Mueller and the rule of law. This  week, Trump has called the Mueller investigation--an investigation led  by a Republican, who is named by a Republican, who is named by a  Republican--he calls this investigation ``the single greatest witch  hunt of a politician in American history.''   And I don't want to hear from any of my colleagues, either, GOP on  the other side, Well, you can't take seriously what the President says  because he is disconnecting from reality or he is paranoid or he is  delusional, unless you are willing to try to activate the provisions of  the 25th Amendment. We must take the President's word seriously.   And, in the meantime, of course, our friends across the aisle, Mr.  Speaker, are going along with everything the President says and  everything that he does, and they are enabling his attempt to defame  the special counsel, Mr. Mueller, and to attack the work of the FBI.   The President calls the FBI an agency in tatters, and an onslaught  has followed in the media. On FOX News, a full-scale campaign against  the FBI has arisen with lots of people comparing the FBI to the KGB,  which is amusing because, if that were true, they would like the FBI-- because Donald Trump's best buddy in foreign relations and FOX News'  beloved kleptocrat authoritarian dictator abroad is Vladimir Putin, the  former chief of the KGB. But they compare our FBI, the tens of  thousands of men and women who have given their lives to law  enforcement in our country, they compare the FBI to the KGB under a  totalitarian government.   Newt Gingrich calls Mueller corrupt, Newt Gingrich who was officially  reprimanded right here, Mr. Speaker, right where we stand today, by  this body. In a vote of 395-28, he was reprimanded and disciplined for  violating the rules of this body, and he calls the former FBI Director,  Special Counsel Mueller corrupt in an effort to undermine and discredit  the special counsel investigation.   And now this propaganda campaign comes to the official channels of  the House of Representatives. Yesterday, Deputy Attorney General Rod  Rosenstein appeared before the House Judiciary Committee for an  oversight hearing, and I was appalled and I was amazed at the way our  GOP colleagues attacked him with a series of completely phony,  overblown, and misleading accusations.   They are in full-scale assault mode now. They are in a frenzied wild  goose chase to find anything possible to discredit Special Counsel  Mueller and his investigators in his team.   And guess what, they finally found their villain. This week they  found their villain, and they pounced on him. It is an FBI agent named  Peter Strzok, who was working on the Mueller investigation but was  removed from it this summer when it was discovered that he had sent a  bunch of text messages to his apparent girlfriend criticizing a number  of politicians, including Donald Trump, whom he called an idiot, Mr.  Speaker. I think he was watching one of the Presidential debates where  he sent a text message to his girlfriend, writing: ``OMG, he is an  idiot.'' That is the way I am reading the texts that were revealed to  us yesterday.   Now, he was probably one of millions of people to send that exact  same text across the country. It wasn't a very nice thing to say, but  he said it. He also called Bernie Sanders, the Democratic candidate for  President, the Vermont U.S. Senator, an idiot. He called Trump an  idiot; he called Sanders an idiot; and he had even more choice,  unspeakable words for my friend, the former Governor of Maryland,  Martin O'Malley, which I don't think I can repeat on the floor, Mr.  Speaker.   All right. Mr. Strzok was speaking his mind in these private texts,  but it raised the potentiality of bias in one of the agents working on  the team. And so what did Mr. Mueller do when he learned of it? He  fired him immediately. He got him off of the investigation, removed him  from the investigation, and put him into a different part of the FBI.  He removed him immediately from the investigation.   Unlike President Trump, for example, who took 18 days to fire General  Flynn after learning that Flynn was a serial liar about his connections  with Russia.   So it took President Trump 18 days. Mr. Mueller fired the guy  immediately because people make mistakes, they do the wrong thing, and  Mueller said: I don't want him on my team. He removed him, and they put  him somewhere else.    Now, that should have been the end of the matter; right? It sounds  like the end of the story is not a big deal. But, on the eve of our  hearing yesterday, we received a dump of hundreds of these private text  messages between Mr. Strzok and his friend, Ms. Page, and they make, no  doubt, for titillating, fascinating, engrossing reading as these two  people make their observations about the Presidential campaign. It's  like ``Anna Karenina'' or ``House of Cards.'' It is fascinating. It is  the kind of trivial gossip that people get into sometimes in this town.   I was amazed to learn that the Department of Justice itself--not  Mueller, not his team, but the Department of Justice--the formal public  affairs channel had actually orchestrated this dump of text messages  that were revealed in the course of an ongoing Department of Justice  investigation, inspector general investigation. They took this material  from the middle of an investigation, called up a whole bunch of  reporters and brought them in to show them these texts.   Why?   Well, nobody could really explain it. I asked Mr. Rosenstein  yesterday, and he couldn't explain what really--he said: Well, it had  been approved.   I said: ``Was there any precedent for it? Was there any precedent for  the Department of Justice revealing material that turned up in the  middle of an ongoing investigation to reporters?   He couldn't name any. It wasn't even in the press conference.   So that took place. That strikes me as very odd that there are people  in the Department of Justice who apparently are cooperating with this  effort to undermine the integrity and the strength of the special  counsel investigation.   Well, the key thing to understand is that all of those text messages  are totally irrelevant. The great text message love story saga, which  was dumped on us, is an irrelevant distraction. Mr. Mueller got rid of  Mr. Strzok, removed him from the team, end of story.   Of course, FBI agents, prosecutors are allowed to have a political  party. Mueller's got one; it is Republican. Rosenstein's got one; he is  a Republican. That is fine. You can be Republican. You can be Democrat.  You are not allowed to have your political ideas affect your work to  the point that you are biased.   So I take it Mr. Mueller figured that those text messages suggested  the possibility of bias, not just against Bernie Sanders and Martin  O'Malley, but also against Donald Trump, and they said: Okay. We will  remove him from the team. He is gone.   But yesterday, that is all the Republicans wanted to talk about, this  great trumped up, fake text message scandal--totally irrelevant.   The only one who, to his credit, tried to make it relevant was a  Republican colleague who said this is fruit of the poisonous tree, and  he repeated it numerous times. He intoned the words, ``fruit of the  poisonous tree.''   Well, I am a law professor, so I know what ``fruit of the poisonous  tree'' means. It is a Fourth Amendment doctrine which says that, if you  have got an illegal search or seizure by the government, you cannot use  evidence that is obtained by virtue of an illegal search or an illegal  seizure against someone in court. If the government tries to use it,  then the so-called exclusionary rule is activated, and you exclude  evidence that is derived from an illegal search or seizure.   But there is no illegal search or seizure, and there is not even an  allegation of an illegal search or seizure. All they have got is text  messages between two lovebirds, and that is it.   I asked Mr. Rosenstein yesterday, I said: Was there an illegal search  or seizure? Is there an allegation of an illegal search or seizure?  [[Page H9932]]    No, none at all.   So what is the relevance of all that stuff? Nothing. They found one  FBI agent who is removed during the summertime for trashing a bunch of  politicians on both sides of the aisle. They find that guy. They talk  only about the fact that he called the President of the United States  an idiot, which we must concede hardly makes him an original critic of  the President. Okay. They find that one guy, and then suddenly they  want to use that to claim that bias infects the whole operation, the  whole investigation.   And why are they doing that? Well, look, if they just want to put up  a propaganda smoke screen, that is within their First Amendment rights  to do so and within their rights under the Speech or Debate Clause. The  problem is that there is mounting fear and anxiety that this is trying  to set the stage for President Trump to fire Robert Mueller, perhaps  the most admired law enforcement official and prosecutor in the  country, that they are setting the stage to fire him with all this  trumped-up stuff about a bunch of texts between some lovebirds. That is  it. That is all they have got.   After all this time, that is what they are using to try to discredit  Robert Mueller and his team, who, at the time of his appointment, they  described as unimpeachable, beyond reproach, and so on. But now that he  is doing his job and it looks like the momentum of the investigation is  leading to the very top of the U.S. Government, they may be looking for  a reason to fire him.   Well, this is an emergency, a constitutional emergency if this is  going to happen. This is why we are blowing the whistle on it.   I am delighted to be joined by a great legislator, someone whose  career is woven into the fabric of the U.S. House of Representatives.  He is the minority whip of this body, and I am just delighted to yield  now to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer) very much for his kind words and for his patriotism. I thank him  for also pointing out the critical importance of civic equality to this  discussion because civic equality implies that none of us is above the  law.   Of the many dangerous things I have heard uttered over the last  couple of weeks with respect to this investigation, perhaps none is  more sinister or disturbing than the suggestion that the President  cannot be guilty of obstruction of justice because the President  himself oversees the whole government.   Well, at that point, we may as well hang it all up and go back to  monarchy because the governing principle of our Constitution is we have  no kings here. We have no kings here. So I thank Mr. Hoyer for that.   James Madison wrote that the very definition of ``tyranny'' is the  collapse of all powers into one. We are trying to defend the separation  of powers and we are trying to defend the rule of law against all of it  being drowned in a political agenda.   Mr. Speaker, I am joined now by my very distinguished colleague on  the House Judiciary Committee. I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership. I  thank him for invoking the critical Watergate analogy, the Saturday  Night Massacre with the firing of Archibald Cox and other Department of  Justice officials who refused to cover up for the President's crimes  and misdeeds. I thank him for his legislation that would try to empower  the special counsel not to be fired without a court's say-so at least,  to build another check and balance.   I thank him, also, for invoking what is also taking place in  Washington right now, which is this massive assault on the American  middle class through this so-called tax cut bill, this tax scam, which  would actually raise taxes for tens of millions of Americans while  transmitting billions of dollars up the income and wealth ladder.   Ever since we have arrived here, the whole government has felt like a  money-making operation for a person, a family, a small group of  billionaires in the Cabinet, a handful of people in the country like  the Koch brothers and the Mercers. We cannot allow either this assault  on the basic middle class economics of the country to go through or  this assault on the Constitution and the rule of law, which we  witnessed so vividly yesterday in the House Judiciary Committee.   I want to thank the gentleman for his service and for being one of  the first to blow the whistle about what is taking place here.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
