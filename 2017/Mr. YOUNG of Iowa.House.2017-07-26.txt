 Mr. Chair, I wanted to briefly discuss eating  disorders and how it affects our servicemembers and their families.  Eating disorders affects over 30 million Americans during their  lifetimes, and have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric  illness. Studies show that eating disorders affect our servicemembers  and their families at a higher rate than the civilian population, with  34 percent of female active duty servicemembers and 20 percent of  children of sevicemembers scoring at risk for an eating disorder.   Additionally, a Military Medicine study of female military members  and veterans found significant relationships between eating disorders,  PTSD and sexual trauma. As we have much to learn on how eating  disorders affect our military members and their families, I would  encourage the House to start considering how we can address this issue  within our military.
