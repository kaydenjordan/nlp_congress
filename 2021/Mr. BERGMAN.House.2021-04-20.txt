 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Captain  Jonathan Turnbull on his promotion to major in the United States Army.   Captain Turnbull of Gaylord, Michigan, was deployed in Syria where he  worked with local forces and nongovernmental organizations to stabilize  the area and provide humanitarian assistance.   On January 16, 2019, an ISIS suicide bomber forever changed the  course of his life and the life of his brothers. Four Americans were  killed on that day, and Jonathan received life-threatening injuries.  His courage and bravery on that day and each day since has inspired  countless Americans as he recovered and continued his service.   Jonathan is the epitome of an American patriot and embodies the  fighting spirit of our Nation's Armed Forces. He has fought for his  life and his country and has truly earned this promotion to major.   I speak for the entire First District when I say how proud we are of  Jonathan, his service, and his commitment.   I wish him, Samantha, Ian, and baby Scotty all the best in the many  years to come.                            ____________________
