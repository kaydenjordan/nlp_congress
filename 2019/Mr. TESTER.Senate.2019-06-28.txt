 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Bruce  Edward McNabb, a lifelong Montanan and decorated veteran of Vietnam.   While Bruce is no longer with us, his legacy lives on. On behalf of  myself, my fellow Montanans, and my fellow Americans, I would like  extend our deepest gratitude for his service to this Nation.   Bruce was born on August 23, 1947, in Butte, MT, to Dallas and  Catherine McNabb. His father was a World War II veteran who fought with  General George Patton in the Mediterranean theatre. His mother worked  for the National Forest Service. In addition to their son, the couple  had a daughter, Bruce's younger sister, Kathi.   After graduating from Butte Central High School in 1965, Bruce moved  to Seattle, WA, where he worked for Boeing. However, his plans quickly  changed at the age of 19 when he received a draft letter from the U.S.  Army. He started basic training shortly thereafter.   Bruce served our country in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968. In March of  1968, during a search and clear mission, his unit became heavily  engaged with the enemy. In an act of great bravery, Bruce rushed to the  aid of his fallen platoon leader, helping him back to safety. Without a  moment's pause, he immediately rushed back out and pulled an additional  comrade out of harm's way, saving both men's lives.   Upon his return home to Montana, Bruce attended Carroll College in  Helena. It was during this time he met the love of his life, Linda  Skiles, whom he married on June 30, 1973. Together, they raised two  wonderful children, their daughter, Kimberly, a certified patient care  technician in Billings, MT, and their son, Rick, a teacher in  Beaverton, OR.   Like many Vietnam veterans who returned home from service, Bruce fell  victim to the sinister effects of Agent Orange, but he never let it  slow him down.   Known by many for his hard work and determination, Bruce led a long  career as a store/plans coordinator for Buttrey Food Stores, Super  Yalu, and Associated Food Stores. After many years, he started a new  career at ExxonMobil, retiring in 2015.   Bruce and his wife Linda were married for almost 46 years before he  passed away in November 2018. He was a devoted family man and caring  grandfather to his two granddaughters, Mariah and Ashlee.   He was passionate about a number of sports teams, including the Green  Bay Packers, Notre Dame, Portland Trail Blazers, the Cubbies, and took  great care of his truck ``Sweetness.''   I now have the profound honor of presenting Bruce with his own set of  military honors. For his bravery in the line of duty, Bruce Edward  McNabb received the: Bronze Star Medal with bronze oakleaf cluster,  Purple Heart Medal, Air Medal, Good Conduct Medal, National Defense  Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with two Bronze Service Stars,  Republic of Vietnam Campaign Ribbon with 1960 Device, Expert Badge with  Machine Gun Bar, and Marksman Badge with Rifle Bar.  [[Page S4676]]    These medals serve as a small token of our country's appreciation for  Bruce's incredible service and profound sacrifice.   He is an American hero who has made Montana proud, and we are  eternally grateful for his service.                            ____________________
