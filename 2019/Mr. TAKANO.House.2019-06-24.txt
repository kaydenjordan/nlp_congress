 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2109) to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in awarding a contract for the  procurement of goods or services, to give a preference to offerors that  employ veterans.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2109         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Boosting Rates of American       Veteran Employment Act'' or the ``BRAVE Act''.       SEC. 2. PREFERENCE FOR OFFERORS EMPLOYING VETERANS.         (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 81 of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by adding after section 8128       the following new section:       ``Sec. 8129. Preference for offerors employing veterans         ``(a) Preference.--In awarding a contract for the       procurement of goods or services, the Secretary may give a       preference to offerors that employ veterans on a full-time       basis. The Secretary shall determine such preference based on       the percentage of the full-time employees of the offeror who       are veterans.        ``(b) Enforcement Penalties for Misrepresentation.--(1) Any       offeror that is determined by the Secretary to have willfully       and intentionally misrepresented the veteran status of the       employees of the offeror for purposes of subsection (a) may       be debarred from contracting with the Department for a period       of not less than five years.        ``(2) If the Secretary carries out a debarment under       paragraph (1), the Secretary shall commence debarment action       against the offeror by not later than 30 days after       determining that the offeror willfully and intentionally       misrepresented the veteran status of the employees of the       offeror as described in paragraph (1) and shall complete       debarment actions against such offeror by not later than 90       days after such determination.        ``(3) The debarment of an offeror under paragraph (1)       includes the debarment of all principals in the offeror for a       period of not less than five years.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the       item relating to section 8128 the following new item:  ``8129. Preference for offerors employing veterans.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2109.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2109, the Boosting Rates of  American Veteran Employment Act, or BRAVE Act.   We know that overall veterans' unemployment rates are below the  national average, and that includes a 3.5 percent rate for our younger  post-9/11 veterans. However, this hides an alarming statistic: nearly  one-third of veteran jobseekers are underemployed at a rate 15.6  percent higher than nonveteran jobseekers.   Both parties agree that men and women returning from our most recent  conflicts deserve to come home to a reliable, good paying job. We owe  them that.   We can start right here in the Federal Government. The VA establishes  long-term contracts with private companies for medical equipment,  construction supplies, services, and more.   Currently, the VA gives a preference for these contracts to veteran- owned small businesses.   The BRAVE Act would expand this contracting preference to allow the  VA Secretary to give a preference to companies that actively employ  veterans, a policy that would incentivize companies to hire more  veterans, already a smart approach for companies, because veterans  bring to a job the skills they earned and learned in their years of  invaluable military training.   This bipartisan bill would not add any additional costs or burdens to  the taxpayers. It allows for the debarment of any company that  knowingly misrepresents its proportion of veteran employees in order to  receive a contracting preference.   The BRAVE Act represents a win-win for the private sector, the  Federal Government, and most importantly, veterans themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Rice for her hard work on  this excellent bill, and Ranking Member Roe for beginning work on this  bill last Congress. I urge my colleagues to support it today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Miss Rice), my good friend, who is a member of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee and a member of the Subcommittee on Economic  Opportunity, and the sponsor of H.R. 2109.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  2109, the Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment Act, which I  introduced along with Paul Cook from California.   The BRAVE Act is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will  authorize the VA Secretary to give preference to contractors with high  concentrations of full-time veteran employees when awarding Federal  contracts.   First, this bill will reward companies that actively hire and invest  in veterans, companies that seek out veterans and give them  opportunities to bring their unique skills and training  [[Page H5046]]  and experience to the civilian workforce.   Second, it will create an incentive for other companies to do the  same, which in turn will help bring more veterans into the workforce,  and with good-paying jobs at that, the types of opportunities that give  veterans and their families the stability they need as they transition  to civilian life.   Most importantly, as more and more companies hire more and more  veterans, they will ultimately see that investing in veterans is just  good for business. That is what the real incentive should be, not just  an advantage in securing Federal contracts, but getting the benefit of  employees who have worn the uniform, who have been trained by the  greatest military in the world, and who have learned to get the job  done no matter what the job is or how tough it may be.   What business wouldn't want to have employees like that?   Lastly, it bears emphasizing that this bill will cost taxpayers  absolutely nothing.   We need more businesses in the private sector to recognize the value  of investing in the men and women who have served our country.   To be clear, this isn't an act of charity. Veterans are not looking  for a handout. They just need an opportunity to show what they can do.  That is what this bill will help accomplish.   The BRAVE Act will help ensure that more veterans have those  opportunities.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Roe  for supporting this bill and for helping to bring it to the floor  today.   This legislation passed unanimously in the last Congress, and I urge  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to once again give it the  bipartisan support it deserves.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the  legislation sponsored by Miss Rice, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2196) to amend title 38, United States Code, to reduce the  credit hour requirement for the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship  program of the Department of Veterans Affairs.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2196         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REDUCTION IN CREDIT HOUR REQUIREMENT FOR EDITH                     NOURSE ROGERS STEM SCHOLARSHIP.         Section 3320(b)(4)(A)(i) of title 38, United States Code,       is amended by striking ``more than the standard 128 semester       (or 192 quarter) credit hours'' and inserting ``at least the       standard 120 semester (or 180 quarter) credit hours''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2196.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2196, a bill to reduce the  credit hour requirement for the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship  program.   H.R. 2196 is a technical correction to the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM  Scholarship, which was codified into law with the passage of the Harry  W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, also known as  the Forever GI Bill.   This STEM scholarship program, named after the former chairwoman of  the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Edith Nourse Rogers, provides  veterans who are enrolled in STEM programs with additional support if  their GI benefits are exhausted before they complete an undergraduate  degree.   Unfortunately, this much needed scholarship program is crippled by  the qualification criteria, which necessitates that veterans must be  enrolled in STEM programs that require more than 128 semester credit  hours to graduate.   According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, these criteria only  allow veterans enrolled in three programs at higher learning  institutions to participate in this great scholarship program.   Now, this was not the intent of the Congress. H.R. 2196 would correct  this oversight by reducing the required semester credit hours of a  degree program from 128 to 120, to allow more programs at a wider array  of institutions of higher learning to qualify for the program.   Now, veterans across the country are enrolling in Science,  Technology, Engineering, and Math based degree programs at rapid rates,  and we should continue to encourage veterans to pursue STEM programs  and employment in STEM fields.   By continuing to invest in our veterans, we are investing in the  American economy and our great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Barr, Representative  Levin, and Ranking Member Roe for their hard work on this excellent  bill. I would especially like to thank Chairman Levin and the rest of  the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee for their bipartisan work to get  this bill to the floor in a timely fashion.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the rest of my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2196, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of En Bloc Amendment  number eight, which includes my amendment to reaffirm Amtrak's legal  obligations under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification  (WARN) Act.   The WARN Act was created to protect workers and their families by  requiring certain employers to provide notice 60 days in advance of  mass layoffs. As many of my constituents learned first-hand, having  advance notice of a major staffing decision is essential for employees  so they can make thoughtful and deliberate decisions about their future  and the future of their families.   Last year, Amtrak shuttered a reservation call center in my district.  Hundreds of my constituents and their families had just 60 days' notice  before having to decide whether to uproot their lives and accept  another Amtrak job across the country--or accept a meager severance  package and keep their families rooted in the community they grew up in  and love. It was part of Amtrak's tactic to only meet the statutory  requirement of providing 60 days' notice under the WARN Act and force  attrition by applying pressure on its employees. Today, we must go  further to protect these workers.   Congress must reaffirm the legal requirements under the WARN Act, but  also strengthen these protections to ensure that workers have more  advance notice of executive decisions that will impact their lives.  Congress must also ensure that the penalties for violating this law  will send a clear message to employers that this anti-worker behavior  will not be tolerated.   Mr. Chair, I thank Representatives Ken Calvert, Brendan Boyle, and  Paul Cook for joining me in putting forth this bipartisan amendment and  I look forward to building on these protections for workers all across  the United States.
