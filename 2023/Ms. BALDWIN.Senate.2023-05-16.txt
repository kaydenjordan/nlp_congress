 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the exceptional  life of Lawrence Eckstein, on the occasion of his 99th birthday.   Mr. Eckstein was born on June 30, 1924, in Wisconsin. He attended  Winneconne High School before heading into the workforce at age 14. At  age 20, Mr. Eckstein entered the U.S. Army and served as a private in  both the 85th Infantry Division and 10th Mt. Division from 1944 through  1947. During his time in the U.S Army, he was stationed throughout  Italy and Austria. He was a recipient of the Bronze Star Medal and  received a Quilt of Valor in 2022.   In 1952, Mr. Eckstein married his wife Darlene. Together, they raised  six children and celebrated 61 years of marriage before her passing in  2013. After the military, Mr. Eckstein worked within the Kimberly-Clark  Corporation for 26 years. Retirement didn't stop Mr. Eckstein from  keeping busy. He drove semi-trucks up until the age of 86 and often  could be seen riding his bike on the Wiouwash trail in Winneconne up  until the age of 95.   Mr. Eckstein is also incredibly active with the Winneconne Legion,  marching in local parades up until the age of 91. He also had the  opportunity to go on the Old Glory Honor Flight back in 2012.   I am privileged to acknowledge the life and work of Lawrence  Eckstein, and on the occasion of his 99th birthday, I wish him a happy  birthday and thank him for his lifetime of service to our country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the sacrifice of  S2C David Joseph Riley who lost his life, along with 428 of his fellow  crewmen, on December 7, 1941, while serving on the USS Oklahoma during  the attack on Pearl Harbor. After over 80 years, S2C Riley's remains  will finally come to Juda in Green County, WI, on May 27, 2023.   Seaman Second Class Riley was born on February 18, 1916, and at the  age of 11 years old became the foster son of Elmer and Della (Matzke)  Asmus of Juda, WI. He attended the Juda elementary and high schools and  was known for his cheerful and likable manner. In 1939, he joined the  Wisconsin National Guard, and in May 1940, he enlisted in the U.S.  Navy. After training, he was assigned to the battleship USS Oklahoma.   On December 7, 1941, Seaman Second Class Riley was onboard the USS  Oklahoma, docked at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, when it was attacked by  Japanese forces. This ship was hit by multiple torpedoes, causing it to  quickly flip and capsize.   On December 21, 1941, Mr. and Mrs. Asmus received a telegram from the  Navy, stating that Seaman Second Class Riley was missing. On February  17, 1942, 1 day before what would have been his 26th birthday, they  received another telegram declaring that Seaman Second Class Riley had  lost his life in service of his country. Unfortunately, his remains  could not be identified at this time. Eventually, the remains of the  men lost aboard the Oklahoma were recovered and buried at the National  Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific--NMCP--and listed as ``Unknowns.''   The loss of Seaman Second Class Riley was devastating to the tight- knit community of Green County, and over 80 years later, his legacy is  still known and honored. The American Legion Post 84 in Monroe is the  Zilmer-Riley post, named in part for Seaman Second Class Riley. A  plaque in Juda High School commemorates the sacrifice made by Seaman  Second Class Riley and two other men from Juda during World War II.   In 2015, the Department of Defense authorized the exhumation of the  USS Oklahoma ``Unknowns,'' interred at the National Memorial Cemetery  of the Pacific, NMCP. Seaman Second Class Riley's remains were exhumed  and identified through the painstaking efforts of the Defense POW/MIA  Accounting Agency--DPAA--the Armed Forces DNA Identification  Laboratory--AFDIL--and the Navy Casualty POW-MIA Branch.  [[Page S1677]]    Deborah Krauss Smith, great-grandniece of Seaman Second Class Riley's  foster parents, worked diligently to gain approval from the Navy  Casualty POW/MIA branch to return Seaman Second Class Riley's remains  to Juda, where they will be interred with those of his foster parents,  fittingly over Memorial Day weekend 2023.   It is our duty to honor Seaman Second Class Riley and his fellow  servicemembers who lost their lives on that fateful day. I ask that we  all take a moment to remember S2C David Joseph Riley and to pay tribute  to his service and sacrifice.                            ____________________
