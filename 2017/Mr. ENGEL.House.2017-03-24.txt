 Mr. Speaker, when people look at these bills, they want to  know what they are going to pay. What this bill does is simple--you pay  more and you get less. That is the bottom line--pay more and get less.   The President promised better health care for more people at a lesser  cost. But my Republican colleagues can no longer claim with any  credibility that their plan achieves these goals.   Twenty-four million people will lose coverage. People 50 to 64 will  be hit with an age tax and pay premiums five times higher than  everybody else. Deductibles will go up. And protections that make sure  insurance companies offer minimum value will be thrown out.   Again, the Republican bill, TrumpCare--pay more, get less--but it  gives billionaires a tax break. That is really important; isn't it?  With the Affordable Care Act, we set out to give Americans more  affordable, higher quality health care.   Is the law perfect? No. We should be working together to tweak the  law. We should be working together to improve the law, not putting in a  clunker like this bill, which will roll back the time on people's  coverage. Roll back the time, give people less coverage, and let them  pay more. That is not what the American people want. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no.''
