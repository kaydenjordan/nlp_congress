 Mr. Speaker, last week The Post and  Courier of Charleston announced that South Carolina is the fifth most  popular State for new residents. In an annual study conducted by United  Van Lines, South Carolina achieved being in a top place for people  looking to relocate, whether for a job, retirement, or temperate  climate.   The Post and Courier detailed that the moving company this week said  60 percent of the trucks in South Carolina dropped off household goods  for newcomers, placing it among the top destinations for those seeking  a new home. The article also reveals that recent data from the Census  Bureau confirms the Palmetto State is gaining significantly.   I am grateful to Governor Nikki Haley, incoming Governor Henry  McMaster, Secretary of Commerce Bobby Hitt, and everyone who works each  day to promote South Carolina as a great place to live, work, and raise  a family. We have a probusiness mindset. We are military friendly. We  have communities that promote job creation. We have a State that is  ready to welcome transplants.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his  actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on  terrorism.                            ____________________
