 Mr. Speaker, Michigan's 12th Congressional District mourns  the loss of Pastor Charles Gilchrist Adams, a beloved spiritual and  community leader. He was an activist in our district whose influence  impacted so many of our lives across the State and the world. He was  loved and respected by so many.   Pastor Adams served as a lead pastor for the historic Hartford  Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit, a role that he held for more than  50 years.   As a pastor, he dedicated his life and mission to service, fighting  for justice for our communities and improving the lives of our  residents in northwest Detroit. He was a tireless advocate for safe and  affordable housing for all and childcare for our working families.   He served as president of the Detroit Branch of the NAACP in 1984,  and he also served on the executive board until 1992.   Please join me, Mr. Speaker, in remembering Pastor Charles Gilchrist  Adams for his incredible advocacy, leadership, and impact on our  district.   May he rest in love, and may his legacy live on in our community.                                time  1045                      Recognizing Dearborn Firefighters     Mr. Speaker, the 12th Congressional District recognizes  two outstanding members of Dearborn's fire department: Battalion Chief  Kenneth Murray, for his 26 years of service, and EMS Coordinator Glenn  Owens, for his 25 years of service to our communities.   Battalion Chief Murray started with the Dearborn Fire Department in  1997 as a firefighter. He steadily rose through the ranks, serving as  an engineer, lieutenant, and captain before he was promoted to  battalion chief in 2020.   Over the course of his career, Battalion Chief Murray has garnered  numerous awards and was recognized as Dearborn Exchange Club's Fire  Officer of the Year in 2016. Battalion Chief Murray has been an  outstanding public servant to the communities served by the Dearborn  Fire Department.   EMS Coordinator Owens began his career as a firefighter in the  Dearborn Fire Department in 1998. Over the past 25 years, Owens has  served in numerous roles, and he remains steadfast in his commitment to  service and keeping our community safe.   EMS Coordinator Owens has been recognized many times over the course  of his career in Dearborn for his incredible record, including saving  lives and safe driving.   Please join me in recognizing Battalion Chief Kenneth Murray and EMS  Coordinator Glenn Owens for their many years of outstanding service to  the people of Dearborn in Michigan's 12th District Strong as we wish  them well in their retirement.                       Acknowledging My Incredible Team     Mr. Speaker, I want to take time to acknowledge my  incredible team and our accomplishments these past few years for our  community. I lovingly call our congressional district 12th District  Strong.   At the beginning of this year, we opened three new Neighborhood  Service Organizations in Detroit, Inkster, and Southfield.   Throughout the district, our Neighborhood Service Organizations have  returned over $5.5 million in constituent services dollars directly to  over 8,000 residents, returning alone just this year over $306,000 for  our communities.   We served and responded to over 164,069 letters from our neighbors  who advocate for clean water, clean air, utilities for all, and so much  more. We have hosted and participated in over 120 events, including  coffee hours, townhalls, resource fairs, and more to ensure that I  remain accessible to my residents.   In Congress, in our legislative advocacy work from affordable housing  to medical debt cancellation and auto insurance discrimination, we have  introduced 160 bills, and 39 bills and amendments have actually passed  since 2019.   This year, we celebrated the 1-year anniversary of the Congressional  Mamas' Caucus, where we are committed to advocating for working moms  and their families on issues of affordable childcare, paid leave, and  ending poverty policies that are incredibly important, as well as  something dear to me, combating Black maternal health, and so much  more.   We also started the Get the Lead Out Caucus, where we know that no  amount of lead is safe for our children or our families.   These accomplishments would not have been possible without our  residents' faith in me and sending me here to the United States  Congress to do the people's work. It has been an honor to serve as the  Congresswoman for the 12th Congressional District, 12th District  Strong.   I thank all of my team for all of their hard work and tenacity. This  is just the beginning of what we will be able to accomplish.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, they are so desperate. You all are so  desperate to distract from the fact that you all have nothing to  improve the lives of the American people or end the ongoing genocide.   Now, you are trying to shift the focus by baselessly attacking  Representative Bowman to score cheap political points, comparing him to  the white supremacists on January 6 who were smashing windows in the  Capitol and screaming: ``Hang Mike Pence.'' Give me a break.   Your inability to govern is so obvious to the American people. You  all can't even find enough Republicans to pass a budget or even keep a  Speaker. This is yet another attempt to silence a person of color in  this Chamber. We all see it.   This is all about the fact that Representative Bowman calls out your  hypocrisy. The Republicans need to leave him alone and get a grip. The  Republicans should do something that will actually improve the lives of  the American people that you all represent. Vote ``no'' on this cheap  political stunt.
