 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the  James N. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year  2023.   As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, there  are several provisions I am excited about. The bill directs the  establishment of a national hypersonic initiative and requires a  strategy to use unconventional capabilities to defeat hypersonic  threats.   The bill also fully funds nuclear triad modernization, restores  funding for the nuclear sea-launched cruise missile, and prohibits  retirement of the B-83 gravity bomb.   It funds two additional Patriot batteries in the Guam defense system,  and it advances planning for an East Coast missile defense site.   The NDAA also requires a public strategy for the protection of  satellites and directs the establishment of resilient and responsive  space capabilities. Additionally, it replenishes American stocks of  munitions that have been provided to Ukraine and have begun to be  depleted.   Finally, I am very supportive of the provision to rescind the COVID- 19 vaccine mandate and end separations, protecting the rights of our  servicemembers.   I conclude with one final public thank you to my good friend and  colleague,   Jim Cooper, for his service and steadfast partnership.
