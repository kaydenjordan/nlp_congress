It provides the warfighter key theater       functions such as surveillance, identification, air control,       weapons engagement coordination, and direction for all       services and allied forces. Link-16 equipment allows the F-35       to communicate with battlespace participants using widely-      distributed J-series message protocols.        h. The F-35 Autonomic Logistics Global Sustainment (ALGS)       provides a fully integrated logistics management solution.       ALGS integrates a number of functional areas, including       supply chain management, repair, support equipment, engine       support and training. The ALGS infrastructure employs a       state-of-the-art information system that provides real-time,       decision-worthy information for sustainment decisions by       flight line personnel. Prognostic health monitoring       technology is integrated with the air system and is crucial       to predictive maintenance of vital components.        i. The F-35 Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN)       provides an intelligent information infrastructure that binds       all the key concepts of ALGS into an effective support       system. ALIS establishes the appropriate interfaces among the       F-35 Air Vehicle, the warfighter, the training system,       government information technology (IT) systems, and       supporting commercial enterprise systems. Additionally, ALIS       provides a comprehensive tool for data collection and       analysis, decision support and action tracking.        j. The F-35 Training System includes several training       devices to provide integrated training for pilots and       maintainers.

The original       FMS case, valued at $82 million, included articles and       services in support of F-16 aircraft sustainment. This       notification is for the combined non-MDE F-16 sustainment       articles and services, which includes Electronic Warfare       database reprogramming support; classified and unclassified       software delivery and support; classified and unclassified       publications and technical documentation; spare parts,       consumables, accessories, and repair and return support;       computer program identification numbers; engine Component       Improvement Program support; minor modifications; maintenance       and maintenance support; studies and surveys; U.S. Government       and contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support       services; and other related elements of logistics and program       support.

This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a North Atlantic Treaty       Organization Ally that is a force for political stability and       economic progress in Europe.        The proposed sale will improve Poland's capability to meet       current and future threats by increasing the reliability of       their F-16 fleet. Poland has purchased sustainment support       for the F-16s in its inventory for many years, and will have       no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin, Fort       Worth, TX. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Poland.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.
