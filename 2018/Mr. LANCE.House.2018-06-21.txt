 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Alzheimer's Awareness  Month.   Every June, this Nation is reminded of the great public health  challenge of Alzheimer's, and we redouble our efforts to combat this  terrible disease.   The numbers are sobering. The lives lost to this grave illness have  increased 123 percent over the last decade. Many families have lost  loved ones, and many more struggle with family or friends who fight  this awful disease.   The work of loved ones to provide high-quality healthcare and comfort  is extraordinary. Advocates on the front lines deserve our deepest  gratitude, and they include Jeanee Castilles of Lambertville, New  Jersey, and Dali Serrano of Wharton, New Jersey, in the district I  serve, who work every day in the cause of research, of treatment, and  of support.   There is new hope, thanks to the work of people like Jeanee and Dali  and those of us who serve in Congress. Together, we are committed to  more research funds and knocking down barriers to 21st century  innovation.   Together, during this awareness month, and, indeed, throughout the  entire year, we must continue to raise our voices about Alzheimer's and  ensure that the fight to find a cure is a national priority of the  highest order.   It will take a united effort across this great country, and I believe  that we are up to the task.                            ____________________
