 Mr. Speaker, it has become quite apparent  over the past few months that House Democrats just don't want to show  up for work. They rallied behind proxy voting the moment the idea was  conjured up, and ever since, they have become complacent in their  duties.   The American people are showing up to work because their livelihoods  depend on it. But when it comes to Democrat Members of Congress, it is  the exact opposite. What a stark contrast.   For months, my Republican colleagues and I have made the trip from  our districts to Washington to conduct the business of the people's  House in the open. We have been present at committee hearings, votes,  and other important functions, but it certainly seems that our Democrat  colleagues don't share that same level of commitment.   What does that tell you about them?   Mr. Speaker, we can't ignore the fact that we are in the middle of a  global pandemic, but that does not mean that we get to abdicate our  duties as Members of Congress. Members of the United States Senate have  shown up to conduct their business.   So why isn't the House doing the same?   What is concerning most of all is that the initial endeavor to  implement proxy voting has now evolved into something more asinine:  vote by text.   This attempt to consolidate power by Speaker Pelosi is just another  feeble move, and one that runs counter to the operation of this  deliberative body that has stood for hundreds of years, yet House  Democrats seem perfectly content with this idea.   The American notion of showing up to work and fulfilling your duties  seems to be a foreign concept to them. If they spent their time  working, and less time looking for ways to get out of work, we would be  making progress.   This is not an effective way to legislate and, in the end, the  American people are the ones who will bear the brunt of this imprudent  course of action.   The people's House must return to regular order, and if we keep  kicking the can down the road on conducting business in the open, this  institution will become rife with complacency. It is time we get back  to work. Stop the delays. Stop the political ploys. The American people  are counting on us.                            ____________________
