 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Thompson, and, indeed, it is my  pleasure to join him in cosponsoring the reauthorization of the Family  Violence Prevention and Services Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, I am so very, very pleased that this is a piece of  bipartisan legislation introduced by Glenn Thompson, Elise Stefanik,  and Lisa Blunt Rochester.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, we have found the need to stick together  in a bipartisan manner because violence against women and children,  unfortunately, is not a partisan issue. It is not an issue that is  relegated to one race of people and to one economic class. It is  pervasive, and it is a detriment to our entire American community.   But fortunately, Mr. Speaker, since 1984, Congress has passed the  Family Violence Prevention and Services Act as the primary Federal  funding source to support emergency shelters and related assistance for  victims of domestic violence and their families. We have updated it  based on best practices that we have seen, and the monies are available  to community-driven solutions and a network of programs and services  dedicated to responding to domestic violence across the country.   This reauthorization would follow current authorization levels for  fiscal years 2019 through 2023. FVPSA, is, of course, at the heart of  the Nation's response to domestic violence, ensuring, Mr. Speaker, that  these shelters and programs are able to keep their lights on and their  doors open to serve more than 1.3 million victims of domestic violence  and their children every year.   Again, it serves nearly 1,600 community-based programs through State- formula grants.   Not only do they serve shelters, the hotline, and crisis  intervention, but they also provide legal assistance and police  services as well. It is a multistate strategy, and we are very proud of  its effectiveness.   In fact, the National Institute of Justice funded a multistate study,  and it shows conclusively that the Nation's domestic violence programs  address not only the most urgent safety needs of victims to protect  themselves and their children, but it also asserts that, if this  funding did not exist, the consequences for the victims would be dire,  including homelessness; serious losses, as in mothers losing custody of  their children; and continued abuse.   As Mr. Thompson has pointed out, the abuse is not simply confined to  physical abuse, but the emotional abuse and economic abuse as well, and  even, sadly, death of some of these women.   Each year, the National Network to End Domestic Violence releases a  report called ``Domestic Violence Counts: A 24-hour National Census of  Domestic Violence Services.'' Sadly, it reports that in just 1 day last  year, 2017, 72,245 victims of domestic violence were happily receiving  services.   But you know what, Mr. Speaker? Another 11,441 requests for services  were left unmet because of the lack of funding and resources.                                time  1815    So we do a pretty good job with this program, but there are always,  always, always a dearth of resources.   I appreciate Mr. Thompson providing me with the time, and I have  examples, if time will allow, for me to just share some of the stories,  just to give some face, Mr. Thompson, to some of the people who are  served by the local shelters, programs, coalition, funding for Tribal  governments to provide essential services to survivors.   In the State of Washington, we have Inez, who was 14 years old and  the only survivor of a fire that killed her entire family. She was  taken in by relatives, only to be raped by her uncle at age 15, as so- called ``payment for her care.''   She gave birth to a son, Manuel, who was never allowed to call her  ``Mother.'' At 16, she met Tomas, thinking this would be an escape for  her and Manuel. He promised her a life of love and security but, in  reality, that security meant a locked closet where she and Manuel were  routinely starved and sexually assaulted. When her second son, Miguel,  was born, Inez decided that she just had to get a way before she and  her two sons were further victimized.   Inez learned of the domestic violence hotline from women she had  worked with in the orchards, and a coworker called and helped Inez and  her children go to a local YWCA shelter. She lived there for 2 years to  get back on her feet while she gained her U visa and rebuilt her life.  Inez now has her green card and a home of her own, and her boys are  thriving in school and preschool.   You know, there are many, many stories that I can go on with. I just  want to say that the #MeToo movement has given all of these survivors a  renewed hope and courage to come forward to tell their stories.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Thompson so much for his time, for his  stewardship over this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues  to stand with these survivors by cosponsoring H.R. 6014, the FVPSA  Reauthorization Act, and to push for the passage of this bipartisan  legislation in this 115th Congress.    Mr. Speaker, if I just might add, Mr. Thompson, it is  because of us. I mean, as legislators, we get a bum rap sometimes. We  don't know Inez necessarily, but it is because of us and this funding  that there is someone on the other end of that telephone who can answer  the call. It is because of the work and this authorization that there  is a place for Inez to go.   This did not always exist before 1984. And while we can't end every  single act of violence, we do deserve the credit for creating the space  and the opportunity for these victims to be able to come  [[Page H7867]]  forward and, when they gain the courage, to leave these domestically  violent situations.   The most dangerous moment for any of these women is that point in  time when they decide to do something about their situation, and that  is the point in which there has just got to be a resource there.
