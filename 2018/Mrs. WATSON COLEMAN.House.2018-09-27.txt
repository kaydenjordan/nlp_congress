 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay respect to the  remarkable life of Airman Apprentice Joseph Min Naglak of Navy Station  Norfolk.   Airman Apprentice Naglak was born in South Korea and adopted by  Kenneth M. and Jeanne Rand Naglak of West Windsor, New Jersey. He  graduated from West Windsor Plainsboro High School in 2015 where he  lettered in varsity football and took time to learn automotive  restoration.   Airman Apprentice Naglak studied homeland security at Monmouth  University before enlisting in April of 2017. He lived with his  fiancee, Nicole Weber, and was an active and energetic volunteer with  the Special Olympics.   His life was cut short in an accident last week aboard the USS George  H.W. Bush. In speaking of his courage and patriotism, his sister said:  ``He wanted to join the Navy to give back to a country who gave him so  much. He was everything that I hoped to be one day, and he should  always be remembered as a hero with a big heart.''   I send my condolences to the family and the friends of Airman  Apprentice Naglak. I express my sincere gratitude for his service and  his sacrifice, and I ask that my colleagues join me in a moment of  silence recognizing his heroism and his sacrifice to our country.   Rest in peace, Airman Naglak.                            ____________________
