 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I rise in support of H. Res. 503, a measure Establishing the Select  Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States  Capitol.   Next week will mark 6 months since the world watched in horror as  Americans violently stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress  from carrying out its constitutional duty to certify a Presidential  election.   Like many of my colleagues, I had hoped that the Republican Senators  would put country over politics and support legislation to establish a  bipartisan, independent commission just as 35 House Republicans did in  May.   I had hoped they would do so, just as a previous generation of  Senators did in response to the 9/11 terrorist attack.   Instead, our bipartisan, good faith proposal was met with a  filibuster. Now that Senate Republicans have chosen to block the  formation of an independent commission, it falls to the House to stay  the course and get the American people the answers they deserve.   I commend the Speaker for introducing this measure and offering us a  way forward.   I believe that with the right Members, staff and resources, and  cooperation from Federal, State, and local partners and the private  sector, this select committee will be well-positioned to do vital  oversight work into why our information-sharing, counterterrorism, and  coordination efforts failed so catastrophically on January 6.   In addition to that, I salute the men and women who protected us on  that day. Some of us were in this very building at the time, some of us  in the gallery. I find it incomprehensible that people would deny what  occurred and now try to deflect by talking about other issues.   This is the citadel of democracy we are standing in right now. We  have to protect it. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to  protect this temple of democracy by voting in favor of H. Res. 503.
