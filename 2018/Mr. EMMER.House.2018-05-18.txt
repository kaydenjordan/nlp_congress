 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of an amendment that  I was pleased to coauthor with my colleague, Representative Costello  from Pennsylvania.                                time  1000    Our amendment directs the Secretary of Agriculture to designate a  beginning farmer and rancher coordinator in each of the 50 States at no  cost to the taxpayer. According to the 2017 National Young Farmers  survey, a lack of familiarity with Federal programs was among the top  reasons young farmers don't access those programs.   At a time when there are six times as many farmers over the age of 65  as there are under the age of 35, now more than ever, we need to help  grow the next generation of farmers. Minnesotans who farm have made our  State a top producer for sugar, beets, and turkeys.   Meanwhile, in my colleague's home State of Pennsylvania, dairy and  mushrooms top the list. Each State is different, and so are the  challenges facing their farmers. Having a State-specific coordinator  will ensure outreach efforts that are tailored to every State's need.   The Costello amendment is supported by the National Young Farmers  Coalition as well. I thank the chairman for his work on the farm bill  and his support of this amendment, and urge my colleagues to do the  same. Support America's young farmers by supporting this amendment.
