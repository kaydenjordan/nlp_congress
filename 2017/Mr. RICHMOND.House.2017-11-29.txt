 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with extreme joy and  excitement. My hometown, which is New Orleans, a part of my  congressional district, next year, will celebrate our 300th  anniversary. Over the years, we were under French control, we were  under Spanish control, we were back under French control, and then we  had the Louisiana Purchase. But as we walk into our 300th year, we have  an elected--and we will be under the control of--female mayor for the  first time in New Orleans history. That female is LaToya Cantrell.   She is a community activist and she is very focused on the future. I  just want to congratulate LaToya on being elected to be the mayor of  the city of New Orleans, and just to assure the people of New Orleans  that we are going to go forward in our 300th year together and continue  to improve the greatest city in the world, and that is New Orleans,  Louisiana.   Mr. Speaker, I, once again, congratulate LaToya Cantrell on her  election to be mayor of the city of New Orleans.                            ____________________
