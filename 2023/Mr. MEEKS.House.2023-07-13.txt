 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment.  [[Page H3548]]  This is a poorly conceived and ill-intentioned attempt to kill the  United States' support for the Defence Innovation Accelerator of the  North Atlantic program, otherwise known as DIANA, which is a  cooperative NATO effort to outsmart and out-innovate our adversaries.   The DIANA program was set up by NATO as an effort to spur increased  defense research and development funding to rapidly adapt to a new era  of strategic competition by bringing key defensive experts together  with the NATO alliances, leading entrepreneurs, and academic  researchers.   The DIANA initiative is specifically designed to leverage breaking  developments and critical advances and next-generation defense  capabilities such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing,  hypersonics, space domain, as well as advanced materials and  manufacturing sciences for the benefit of all NATO allies.   With U.S. adversaries such as Russia in its brutal, unprovoked war of  aggression in Ukraine and our global competition with China where China  in its efforts to outpace the United States in technological  superiority and undermine international norms and freedoms continue  their malign efforts, it is more important than ever that we work  closely with our NATO allies to out-innovate and out-compete at the  leading edge of defense technology.   Eliminating funding from the DIANA program is precisely the opposite  of what we should be doing--the opposite. We should be working together  with our NATO allies in a collective way. Therefore, I encourage all  Members to oppose this amendment.                                time  2015     Mr. Chairman, this week, NATO leaders held a summit in  Lithuania to discuss, address, and prepare for the alliance's future.  It was done with the United States at the table, leading the efforts to  galvanize ambitions in the face of multiple threats, most notably those  related to Russia's unjust and tragic war against Ukraine.   In Lithuania, allies agreed to continue to ramp up support for  Ukraine and use the 2 percent of GDP amount as a floor. Some of our  strongest allies in the alliance are set to move even beyond that  threshold in the coming years. We have not seen NATO stronger, NATO  working closer together, NATO speaking together.   Now, I know that the former President thought that NATO had outlived  its usefulness and that we should not be a part of it. This amendment  would lend itself to that type of mentality. We know that the strength  of NATO is its unity. We know that what Mr. Putin was after was to  divide NATO. We don't need to utilize any language or have any language  that would accelerate that thought.   What we need to do is to make sure that we continue with the spirit  of what took place at the NATO summit. The language of this amendment  seeks to create disunity at a time when NATO's unity is being actively  tested by Vladimir Putin. So, no, we should not agree to denounce our  allies in the NDAA, as this amendment does. We should not look to  reignite some of the disunity and disruption that previous America  First policies promoted.    As I said, we should not look to reignite some of the  disunity and disruption that America First or America only promoted. We  don't need to call out in an amendment our strongest of allies. This  amendment calls out and criticizes and denounces Canada, Italy, the  Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Denmark, France, and many others in the  middle of war.   I surely would not want to be fighting a war in a bunker saying we  are allies and then someone is denouncing me. That is not the way  allies stick together and fight an unjust war that is currently taking  place in Ukraine where you have Russia taking land from a sovereign  country.    Mr. Chair, what NATO has done when they have seen the  taking of property from a sovereign country is stick together. The one  thing that Mr. Putin did think would happen was that we would be  divided. That has not happened, and NATO has been stronger because they  see the inhumanity and the criminal activity that is now taking place  by Vladimir Putin. One voice, standing together, to stop that.   While it is the Ukrainian people who are fighting, it is the allies  in NATO who are giving the ammunition that is necessary to win. But for  that, this war would have been over in 2 weeks or less. It is that  unity that has continued until Ukraine will win this fight. We must  stand together, not giving any weakness of disunity.
