 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of H.R. 3972, and I am very thankful to gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Hensarling), the chairman, and the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member, for their support and  assistance on this legislation.   This bill is very simple. It makes what I consider to be a technical  fix to the rules for family offices.   Family offices are entities that are established by wealthy families  to manage their own money and to provide financial services to their  family members.   The original family office was created by John D. Rockefeller 135  years ago and still exists in the district that I represent. So family  offices have a long and storied history in this country and have become  important sources of liquidity for our markets.   It is also important to note that family offices do not pose a  systemic risk and did not cause any problems in the financial crisis,  so they don't pose any safety and soundness risk to the financial  system.   Family offices aren't regulated by the SEC as investment advisers  because they don't have traditiona clients or outside investors. They  invest money in their funds like most investment advisers.    A family office is just that: a family office managing its own family  money. Their clients are primarily family members, and disputes between  family members are better handled either internally by the family or  through State courts, which have laws to govern disputes between family  members.   Prior to Dodd-Frank, the SEC had been exempting family officers and  offices from the Advisers Act for decades on a case-by-case basis. In  Dodd-Frank, we codified the exemption for family offices and required  the SEC to write a rule formally defining ``family offices.'' The SEC  finalized that rule in 2011, so family offices, to meet the SEC's  definition, do not have to register with the SEC or as investment  advisers.   However, a problem has now come up that we did not anticipate. We  assumed that every family client or a member of the family would  qualify as a sophisticated accredited investor under the SEC rules. But  it turns out that there are very limited circumstances in which a  family client of a family office may not actually qualify as an  individual accredited investor.   For example, a 19- or 20-year-old member of a wealthy family may be  in his or her first job after school and may not be making enough money  to qualify as an accredited investor, which is over $200,000, annually.   The real problem is, under the rules we have now, if just one of  these family clients--a young person, in most cases--in a family office  is not an accredited investor, then the entire family office is not  considered an accredited investor and, thus, cannot buy any securities  that are limited to accredited investors, like privately issued stocks  or bonds. My bill would fix this by just clarifying that all family  offices and family clients are, in fact, accredited investors.   The bill does not allow that any 19- or 20-year-old can go out on  their own and buy securities. It is limited to accredited investors  that can only be done through the family office.   The bill also includes some important limitations: The family office  has to have at least $5 million in assets, which is the same limitation  that applies to trusts in the current accredited investor rule. The  family office also has to have its investments directed by a  sophisticated investment professional, which provides yet another layer  of protection.   So, really, this bill is very narrowly tailored and provides what I  consider to be a technical fix that will allow family offices to better  serve their own family members.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking  member for yielding and for her leadership on this committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3898.   In August, I was part of a congressional delegation led by Senator  Markey that visited South Korea, Japan, and the border between China  and North Korea. It is just a short drive from Seoul, a city of about  10 million people, to the DMZ, which is the border line with North  Korea. Standing there, you understand and see firsthand that even  though the United States would prevail unquestionably in any armed  conflict, the casualties suffered by South Korea would be horrendous.   Later, I hosted a meeting with Congresswoman Wagner with South Korean  Foreign Minister Kang here in the Congress. From these two meetings, I  came back more convinced than ever that we have to leave no stone  unturned to solve the most dangerous problem of our times peacefully  through negotiations.   I firmly believe that the only way to drive North Korea to the  negotiation table is to increase the financial pressure on this  reckless rogue regime, which is what this bill does. It is one of the  toughest sanction bills financially we have ever considered, and may be  the toughest.   The fact that the dollar is the world's Reserve currency gives our  country a very important bit of leverage. Companies doing business all  over the world want to be paid, need to be paid, in dollars, not in any  other currency. So if we restrict international and U.S. financial  institutions from doing business with North Korea, then no matter how  determined they might be to continue their destabilizing reckless  course, they simply will not be able to get the dollars to buy the  tools of terror that they need on the international market.                                time  1430    This is not the kind of action we should ever take lightly. This is  not a tool to use, an action to take indiscriminately. But in this rare  case, in the case of North Korea, such action is not only justified, it  is necessary for the defense of our Nation and the defense of other  nations.   If North Korea cannot buy the materials necessary to build long- range, nuclear-tipped missiles because they just don't have the  dollars, then every country, every person on this globe can breathe a  little easier and be a little safer.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, this is really an  urgently needed bill that not only directly addresses our own security  needs, but also does a great service to the community of nations.   I would like to thank my friend, Mr. Barr, for all of his creative  and hard work on this bill. I thank Chairman Hensarling and Ranking  Member Waters for their leadership and support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.
