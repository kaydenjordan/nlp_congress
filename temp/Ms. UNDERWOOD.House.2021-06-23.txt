 Madam Speaker, on Monday, I had the privilege of  joining my colleagues, Representatives Bill Foster and Sean Casten, and  three incredible working mothers from my community, to speak about the  importance of the expanded child tax credit.   We heard from these working moms how the child tax credit will  deliver much-needed relief for their families after an incredibly  difficult year. They will no longer have to worry about how they will  afford their mortgage, childcare, and putting food on the table for  themselves and their kids.   It is estimated that the expanded credit will cut child poverty in  half, lifting 5,400 kids in my district out of poverty and benefiting  thousands more.   We must sustain this investment in our kids and working families by  making the child tax credit permanent to ensure millions of children  have the resources they need for a brighter future.                            ____________________
