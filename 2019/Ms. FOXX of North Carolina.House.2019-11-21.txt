 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1309, the Workplace  Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act.   American workers deserve to be kept out of harm's way while on the  job, allowing them to return home to their families and loved ones  healthy and safe.   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, healthcare and social  service workplaces experience the highest rate of workplace violence,  totaling 71 percent of all workplace violence injuries in 2017, and  these workers are more than four times as likely to suffer a workplace  violence injury.   There is no question that these caregivers deserve meaningful and  effective protections, but H.R. 1309 is shortsighted and partisan, and  it fails to address the important issue in an effective, feasible  manner.   In the Education and Labor Committee's single hearing on this issue  back in February, Members on both sides of the aisle expressed a desire  to work together to produce real policy solutions.   Committee Republicans believe there can be a bipartisan response to  this issue that would aid in the rulemaking process and provide  protection to healthcare and social service workers.   Instead, committee Democrats have decided to advance legislation that  circumvents the long-established rulemaking process and blocks valuable  input from workers and other stakeholders who know better than we do  how to prevent workplace violence in these unique circumstances.   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, the  Federal agency that helps ensure safe and healthful working conditions,  is currently working on a workplace violence prevention rule for  healthcare and social assistance workplaces, which includes gathering  important stakeholder input to create the most feasible and effective  Federal safety and health standards possible.   However, by requiring OSHA to circumvent established rulemaking  procedures under the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the  Administrative Procedure Act, H.R. 1309 would undermine and threaten  this ongoing collaborative and evidence-based process by denying OSHA  the ability to be responsive to important feedback from the public and  impacted stakeholders.   H.R. 1309 severely limits the participation of industry, worker  representatives, the scientific community, and the public from having a  say in the development of a new comprehensive standard. Democrats are  rejecting a thorough response to this complex and highly technical  issue that is backed by meaningful input.   Furthermore, this legislation turns a blind eye to comprehensive  research and data. Currently, there is no agreed-upon set of policies  to prevent and mitigate workplace violence for healthcare and social  service workers, and researchers in the field have pointed out the need  for additional studies to determine the most effective response.   In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said further  research was needed to identify effective strategies that prevent  workplace violence in healthcare and social service settings.   Additionally, in 2016, the Government Accountability Office, GAO,  noted there have been a limited number of studies done on the  effectiveness of workplace violence prevention programs, and GAO chose  not to call on OSHA to establish a standard without further study.   Continuing with their record of rushed and haphazard legislation,  Democrats are pushing a false sense of urgency with H.R. 1309. This  bill wrongly implies that Congress should impose a swift and sweeping  standard immediately, ignoring that OSHA is already enforcing workplace  violence prevention. In 2019, the Occupational Safety and Health Review  Commission upheld penalties issued by OSHA under the general duty  clause against healthcare facilities for not adequately addressing  workplace violence.   I will remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that,  according to a 2018 American Hospital Association survey, 97 percent of  respondents indicated they already have workplace violence policies in  place.   To make matters even worse, H.R. 1309 mandates yet another costly and  burdensome regulation. Simply put, financially struggling healthcare  facilities such as rural hospitals and small businesses cannot afford  another costly, congressionally imposed mandate from Washington.   Democrats will argue they didn't intend for the bill to have such a  large scope and to cost so much. What else didn't they intend to happen  when they rushed through this process, forcing an overly prescriptive  mandate on the public?   Madam Chair, Republicans are committed to ensuring that healthcare  and social service workers are protected from workplace violence. There  is bipartisan support for OSHA's current efforts to create a standard  on workplace violence prevention. However, Congress should aid in the  rulemaking process, not circumvent it, as H.R. 1309 does.    H.R. 1309 will likely have many unintended consequences which  negatively impact healthcare and social services workplaces, in  addition to imposing a costly mandate on healthcare providers. I urge  my colleagues to join me in opposing this unnecessary legislation so we  can get to work on a bipartisan solution.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Madam Chair, let me be clear, the safety  of our Nation's healthcare and social service workers is not a partisan  issue. Regardless of political beliefs, all of us in this Chamber can  appreciate the hard work and empathy that healthcare workers and  community caregivers demonstrate every single day on the job.   Their dedication to caring for the most vulnerable members of our  communities is extraordinary, and these workers deserve our gratitude,  our respect, and our commitment to ensuring they are safe on the job.   The nature of the work in these industries requires healthcare and  social services workers to interact directly with individuals who are  experiencing tremendous stress, trauma, and grief, which can cause  situations to devolve and put workers' safety at risk.   American workers should be kept out of harm's way on the job, so they  can return home to their families every day healthy and safe. These  caregivers deserve protections, but H.R. 1309 is not the right way to  address this important issue. Our healthcare workers and caregivers  deserve a thoroughly vetted and researched solution that protects them  in the workplace. I think we can do better by working together.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Chair, yesterday the Department of Labor issued its fall 2019  regulatory agenda. The department announced plans to initiate a Small  Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act panel for the prevention  of workplace violence in healthcare and social assistance in January.  This is a very positive and important development.    Unfortunately, H.R. 1309 encourages and allows OSHA to skip this  important step of gathering feedback and advice from small businesses,  all to satisfy the arbitrary 1-year deadline for issuing an interim  final standard. Shortchanging the views of small businesses at the  expense of a rushed, sweeping, and overly proscriptive standard is not  an appropriate trade-off.   Additionally, the legislative text and scope of H.R. 1309 are so  proscriptive that OSHA wouldn't be able to deviate from the mandates in  the bill even if the recommendation from the small business panel are  contrary to that of H.R. 1309.   The Trump administration is moving forward with the rule-making  process. Rather than pass H.R. 1309, we should be allowing OSHA to do  its work on a comprehensive standard, including soliciting necessary  input from small businesses.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close and  yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, as we debate the impact of H.R. 1309 on healthcare  providers, I note that this bill is in violation of the House's pay-as- you-go, or paygo, rule.   The paygo rule requires that legislation affecting direct spending  not increase the deficit. Any legislation projected to increase direct  spending must be offset by equivalent amounts of direct spending cuts,  revenue increases, or a combination of both.   According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, H.R. 1309  will increase the deficit by $60 million between 2020 and 2029. In  addition, CBO estimates the cost of H.R. 1309 to private entities will  be at least $1.8 billion in the first 2 years and at least $750 million  annually thereafter.   Democrats wrote this particular paygo rule months ago, and they are  already abandoning it. It is not hard to find $60 million in savings  for the taxpayers, and the Democrats' failure to do so speaks volumes  about their regard for fiscal discipline. This significant violation of  the budget rules is yet another reason to oppose this bill.   Madam Chair, protecting the safety of healthcare and social service  workers is not a partisan issue. I reiterate that statement. All of us  here today, regardless of our political beliefs, appreciate the hard  work and empathy that healthcare workers and community caregivers  demonstrate every single day on the job.   There is much agreement on both sides of the aisle that these workers  deserve protections in the workplace. Given this bipartisan interest,  it is frustrating that the Democrats have moved forward with the rushed  and ill-conceived legislation we are debating today.   H.R. 1309 ignores expert and practical input; imposes mandates that  may ultimately harm the very people this legislation intends to  protect; forecloses better, more protective and feasible solutions that  would result from the established rulemaking process; fails to allow  meaningful public input; and imposes costly requirements on regulated  entities.   Our healthcare workers and caregivers deserve a thoroughly vetted and  researched solution that protects them in the workplace, but H.R. 1309  badly fails to deliver on that front.   Madam Chair, I strongly urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment is  unnecessary. The underlying bill already mandates that each workplace  violation prevention plan required by the bill ``be made available at  all times'' to covered employees. This amendment adds yet another  overly prescriptive requirement on healthcare establishments.   OSHA, as it proceeds with its rulemaking, should have the ability to  determine the specific elements required of each employer after  analyzing their effectiveness and potential cost.   Ultimately, H.R. 1309 circumvents the longstanding, established OSHA  rulemaking process, which is intended to research thoroughly the  underlying circumstances that may merit a health and safety regulation  and gather meaningful stakeholder input in order to create the most  feasible and protective safety and health standard possible.                                time  1015    By dodging the established regulatory process, H.R. 1309 is  foreclosing other potential solutions. H.R. 1309 will require OSHA to  enforce an interim final standard in healthcare and social service  settings within a year. The legislation does not allow OSHA to consider  important information, such as the experience of California which has a  brand-new standard in place, the views of experts in the field, and the  input of workers who have invaluable workplace experience.   H.R. 1309 discounts the complexity of the underlying issue and the  importance of the knowledge and experience stakeholders can offer that  will help create a workable and effective solution.  [[Page H9139]]    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Chair, this amendment adds yet another overly prescriptive  regulatory requirement on healthcare providers, small and large,  without going through the established rulemaking process.   This amendment provides no opportunity for OSHA to examine whether  the requirements listed in the amendment would be beneficial and  useful. The provision in this amendment could be examined during a  small business stakeholder panel and a public comment period if OSHA  were permitted to engage in these important steps before issuing an  interim final rule.   We still need additional research and data to identify the best ways  to mitigate and prevent workplace violence in healthcare and social  service settings. There have been calls for additional research on the  project, including from the Government Accountability Office and the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   Democrat amendments to the bill, such as the one we are debating, do  not change these basic facts. Democrat window-dressing amendments that  add more red tape don't change the fact that H.R. 1309 fails to allow  for the development of a workable, effective, and feasible workplace  violence prevention standard.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment underscores  two obvious points: first, that healthcare and social service workers  should be free to report workplace violence incidents to law  enforcement; and second, that this bill was drafted poorly.   Such a commonsense provision should not need to be added to the  underlying legislation. But in the Democrats' rush to force OSHA to  promulgate workplace violence prevention standards, they are bypassing  key elements of the established rulemaking process that would ensure a  provision such as this amendment, if needed, is in the regulatory text.   H.R. 1309 circumvents the longstanding, established OSHA rulemaking  process, which is intended to gather information on the underlying  circumstances that may merit a health and safety regulation and to  receive meaningful stakeholder input in order to create the most  feasible and protective safety and health standard possible.   By dodging the established regulatory process, the Democrats are  ignoring or unaware of many key issues like the ones addressed in this  amendment.   Madam Chair, I will support the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment is yet  another example of Democrats assuming bad motives on the part of  American employers and handcuffing them with additional, overly  prescriptive micromanagement from Washington.   The vast majority of employers in America follow the laws, take good  care of their employees, respect their rights in the workplace, and do  not need more red tape imposed on them. Yet this amendment adds  additional requirements on America's small businesses without receiving  any meaningful input from them or other stakeholders.   Democratic amendments, such as the one we are debating, do not change  the basic fact that H.R. 1309 is already overly prescriptive and  forecloses important input from knowledgeable stakeholders.   H.R. 1309 will require OSHA to enforce an interim final standard in  healthcare and social service settings within a year. This legislation  does not allow OSHA to consider important information, including the  experience of California, which has a brand-new standard in place; the  views of experts in the field; and the input of workers who have  invaluable workplace experience. This data and evidence and the  [[Page H9145]]  views of stakeholders may very well not align with the bill's  requirements.   Adopting H.R. 1309 discounts the complexity of the underlying issue  and the importance of the knowledge and experience stakeholders can  offer.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    I claim the time in opposition, Madam  Chair.    Madam Chair, it is very disturbing to me  as a citizen of this country, to hear the talk about increasing  incidents of violence. We know that is occurring all over our country,  everywhere. However, this bill is not going to respond to the  underlying causes of that increased violence, and neither will this  amendment.   This amendment ignores the fundamental reason that employers maintain  good recordkeeping. It allows employers to review their internal  procedures and determine how to improve their safety culture. While it  is very important for facilities to keep accurate records of incidents,  responses to incidents, and annual data, providing this information  annually to OSHA will not result in greater safety benefits.   Requiring the Secretary of Labor to provide this data to Congress  goes yet another ill-advised step further. Employers utilize these  records to improve internal management processes in order to protect  their workplace. However, if they must submit these reports to OSHA,  which will, in turn, provide them to Congress, this will discourage the  use of these records to make improvements, as the employer has no  guarantee the records will not be released by OSHA either intentionally  or unintentionally.   Workplace violence records must be maintained and protected onsite as  they contain personal employee information as well as patient-client  information. An OSHA inspector would still have the right to review the  records upon inspection of the facility.   Again, this amendment's provisions and the underlying recordkeeping  and  [[Page H9146]]  reporting provisions in H.R. 1309 should be thoroughly vetted and  discussed during a true rulemaking process and should not be mandated  by Congress. We definitely should be looking at the underlying reasons  that workplace violence is increasing, and neither this bill nor this  amendment will have any impact on that.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I seek time in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Chair, while the amendment is well- intentioned, there are Federal agencies other than OSHA that would be  better equipped to handle this type of regulatory requirement for the  education of healthcare workers who work with the individuals  identified in the amendment.   The question of whether employer education programs governed by OSHA  are appropriate to address the objectives of the amendment should be  thoroughly vetted and discussed during the rulemaking process before  decisions impacting employers are made.   Unfortunately, H.R. 1309 bypasses the opportunities for that  conversation to take place, such as a small business panel and public  hearings, and this amendment does nothing to change that.   A question of additional education for specific employees is exactly  the kind of issue that should be addressed by receiving feedback from  affected stakeholders in the rulemaking process, but this opportunity  is foreclosed by H.R. 1309.   Amendments like the one we are debating don't change the fact that  H.R. 1309 fails to allow for the development of a feasible and  effective workplace violence prevention standard.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    First, Madam Chair, I would like to  express my condolences to our colleague for the situation that she  found herself in with the person she was trying to help. No one wants  to be in that kind of situation, and I am very sorry that it has  happened.   But this amendment is just another example that H.R. 1309 was poorly  drafted, rushed, and not well thought out. The provisions and  requirements relating to the details of maintaining a workplace  violence prevention plan should be thoroughly vetted during the  rulemaking process.   In the established rulemaking process, stakeholders can comment on  what provisions should be included in the final standard. This allows  for robust evaluation of what provisions ultimately help create the  most feasible and protective safety and health standard possible.   We all share in the common goal of preventing workplace violence in  healthcare and social service settings. We need to trust that the  rulemaking process will result in the most protective standard  possible.   Healthcare professionals deserve the right to comment on a highly  complex and new standard. This amendment does not address the  underlying concerns with the bill.   Democrat amendments to the bill, such as the one we are debating, do  not change these basic facts. This bill is unworkable in its current  form, and this amendment doesn't change the fact that H.R. 1309 fails  to allow for the development of a workable, effective, and feasible  workplace violence prevention standard.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    Madam Chair, this amendment is yet  another well-intentioned addition to a flawed bill. A provision this  obvious should have been included in the underlying text, but Democrats  are unnecessarily rushing through this legislation even though OSHA is  working on a rulemaking.   What other seemingly obvious provisions or considerations are left  out of the bill that are not being offered as amendments today? And  which mandates included in the bill are unworkable, costly and ill- advised? These questions are exactly why the established regulatory  process solicits necessary feedback from stakeholders and the public.   H.R. 1309 circumvents a longstanding established OSHA rulemaking  process, which is intended to research thoroughly the underlying  circumstances and gather meaningful stakeholder input in order to  create the most feasible and protective safety and health standards  possible.   By dodging the established regulatory process, H.R. 1309 will miss  key issues like the ones addressed in this amendment. This bill is  unworkable in its current form, and Democrat amendments don't change  the fact that H.R. 1309 fails to allow for the development of a  workable, effective, and feasible workplace violence prevention  standard.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment is simply  more window dressing on a flawed bill.   While technical assistance is welcome and appropriate, this amendment  places an arbitrary time limit that is woefully insufficient to cope  with the flawed rule, and there is no telling how short an unfriendly  administration might allow this needed advice period to last.   Moreover, technical assistance after employers are subject to a rule  in which they had no input is too little too late. Rather than amend a  flawed bill by allowing the Department of Labor to help businesses  after they are subject to a flawed rule, we should reject this bill and  instead allow OSHA to pursue its established rulemaking process that  provides ample opportunity for feedback from stakeholders and the  public before they are subject to another Washington regulation.   Democrat amendments to the bill, such as the one we are debating, do  not change the basic fact that H.R. 1309 is overly prescriptive and  circumvents the established rulemaking process, failing to allow for  the development of a workable, effective, and feasible workplace  violence prevention standard.   This amendment should be defeated. Madam Chair, I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
