 Madam Speaker, today, we found out that weekly jobless  claims are the lowest since 1968 and, in fact, if you look at this  month, their unemployment claims are the lowest in recorded history.   President Joe Biden and Congressional Democrats have done an amazing  job on job creation. For the last 14 months, 7.4 million jobs were  created, the most in U.S. history; jobs are up, wages are up, growth is  up, and unemployment is down.   What are Republicans doing? I don't know. But last month, two  Republicans spoke at a white nationalist conference. And today, we  learned that Republican Congressman Paul Gosar is going to attend a  white nationalist bash to celebrate Hitler's birthday, and he is listed  as a guest speaker on April 20 at this bash.                            ____________________
