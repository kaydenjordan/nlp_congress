 Mr. President, I join today with people across New  Hampshire to pay tribute to and honor the life of Staff Sergeant Jesse  Sherrill of the New Hampshire State Police. Sergeant Sherrill dedicated  19 years to serving the people of the Granite State with the New  Hampshire State Police, before he tragically lost his life while on  duty on October 28, 2021.   Raised in Barrington, NH, Sergeant Sherrill began his career in law  enforcement with the Hooksett Police Department in 2001. In December  2002, he was hired by the New Hampshire State Police, assigned to  patrol in New Hampshire's North Country. He later worked with the  Attorney General's Drug Task Force and was promoted to sergeant and  then staff sergeant for Troop A, which serves Rockingham and Strafford  Counties.   Sergeant Sherrill excelled in each of his roles and was known for his  incredible work ethic. He was a mentor to his fellow troopers and was  revered for his leadership and his commitment to the success of his  peers.   Beyond his career, Sergeant Sherrill always put family first; his  family was at the core of everything that he did. He was a loving and  supportive husband to Nicole and an incredible father to Peyton and  Quinn, transitioning from a pressure-packed day at work to a very  present husband and father with surprising ease. Nicole's nickname for  Jesse--``Superman''--reflected how much she, his family, and his  colleagues respected and admired his ability to do so many things so  well.   Sergeant Sherrill was a Granite State hero. He represented the very  best of New Hampshire's law enforcement community, serving valiantly to  [[Page S704]]  keep our communities safe, while also going the extra mile to help his  family and community with humility and kindness.   Sergeant Sherrill made New Hampshire a better, safer place. I join  Granite Staters in offering our deepest support and condolences to his  family and to all those who knew him. Sergeant Sherrill is greatly  missed, but his legacy is not and will not be forgotten.                            ____________________
