 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Buck) for the time, and I appreciate consideration of the  rule here today.   Mr. Speaker, both of the bills being considered under this rule  amount to real relief for our Nation's community banks and credit  unions.   H.R. 1116, the TAILOR Act, which passed out of committee with  bipartisan support, will direct Federal financial regulators to tailor  their regulations to the risk profile and business model of our  institutions, meaning that regulation intended for the largest  financial institutions will no longer burden the smallest of our  institutions.   Our community banks and credit unions have long suffered the  consequences and costs of complying with extensive heavyhanded and  onerous regulations. They were created after the 2008 financial crisis.  While many of these regulations are necessary for financial  institutions of all sizes, many are not.   Complying with manifold regulations has significantly hampered the  ability of our community institutions to offer credit to small  businesses, help families get a mortgage, and extend loans to retirees  and the recently employed. As one community banker wrote to me: ``We  have seen time and again the impact of this regulatory environment  consume many hours and resources of our compliance, credit, and audit  teams despite the relatively simple business model we follow.''   By requiring financial regulators to consider the cost of compliance  on smaller institutions as well as whether or not a regulation is  necessary for an institution based on the size and risk profile of that  institution, the TAILOR Act will go a long way to alleviate the burden  of heavy regulation on our community banks. In turn, this will lead to  renewed economic growth for our local communities that rely heavily on  the presence of community banks and credit unions in their own  hometowns.   The other bill being considered under this rule, H.R. 4545, which  also came out of committee with bipartisan support, the Financial  Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act, will provide  certainty for community banks and credit unions that they will have  independent recourse should a bank examination result in a  determination that they disagree with.   If a bank or a credit union receives an examination decision that it  finds unfavorable, the only recourse it has under the current structure  is to appeal that decision directly to the same regulator that arrived  at that decision in the first place. The Exam Fairness bill included in  this rule will change that reality by creating a new Office of  Independent Examination Review that will serve as an independent  appeals office, providing banks and credit unions with uniform and  predictable avenues to appeal examination determinations of significant  consequence.   At this independent office, sober review of the agency's  determination, transparency, and timeliness will be paramount, meaning  that financial institutions will no longer have to wade through long  delays in their appeals process and will no longer have to fear  retaliation from a financial regulator because they appealed the  examination results. Mr. Speaker, this amounts to new assurances to  community banks and credit unions that they will have fair recourse in  the examination process should they disagree with an examiner's  findings.    I would like to thank the Speaker for advancing this rule.   I urge my colleagues to support the rule so that our community banks  and credit unions can realize real relief.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for his  leadership on this issue, as well, and for considering this bipartisan  legislation today.   Mr. Speaker, the ever-growing burden and complexity of financial  regulations is creating an environment of difficult choices for  community banks and credit unions. Often, they must choose to incur the  costs of complying with a regulation or cease to offer the financial  product the regulation modifies. Whatever choice these community  institutions make, it is the local consumer and the local economy that  loses.   Burdensome regulations drive up the costs of financial products and  limit choices for consumers, which decreases a community's access to  financial products and services that help their families to be able to  buy their first home, to help small businesses grow.   In districts like mine in Colorado, that amounts to real economic  impact, especially in towns where the community bank or credit union on  the corner is the only true access to credit that the community has.                                time  1615    When smaller institutions are unable to absorb the costs of  additional compliance, it is the small towns across America that are  disproportionately affected.   As one banker from Colorado recently wrote me: We have seen time and  again the impact of this regulatory environment consume many hours and  resources of our compliance, credit, and audit teams despite the  relatively simple business model that we follow.   Mr. Speaker, that is why the bipartisan TAILOR Act's consideration on  the floor today is so important. The TAILOR Act directs the Federal  financial regulators to take into account the risk profile and business  model of institutions as they develop new regulations, making them more  targeted, more deliberate. The TAILOR Act also instructs regulators to  weigh the impact that new regulatory burdens will have on smaller  institutions, meaning real relief from compliance burdens for banks and  credit unions.   To put the impact of regulations into perspective, the Dodd-Frank Act  alone created 400 new rules and came with 30,000 pages of explanation.  In my travels across Colorado, I have heard far too often that  community institutions have been forced to stop making home loans or  loans to small businesses because they can't afford to hire more  employees to manage the added compliance paperwork.   The TAILOR Act would make sure that the compliance burdens are  considered when new regulations are made so that community financial  institutions won't have to choose between the needs of their  communities and complying with regulations out of Washington, D.C.  Community banks and credit unions need to be able to prioritize their  customers and the needs of their communities instead of prioritizing  compliance with heavy-handed regulations.   One community banker from Colorado brought this into focus when he  wrote me saying: Providing a real-time view of risk and continual  review of such a risk applicable to each financial institution allows  regulators to direct their attention to developing issues that could  have the most damaging effect. With the number of financial  institutions declining to historically low levels, the redeployment of  focus based on complexity makes sense.   Mr. Speaker, in Colorado, mortgages haven't been made, loans to  expand small businesses have been denied, retirees and recently  employed workers have been turned away, and relationships between  community bankers and their neighbors have been discarded. The one- size-fits-all approach to regulating the financial services industry  has resulted in decreased access to much-needed credit.   America is now in a position to be able to address this. The trickle- down effect of regulation intended to respond to the culpable actions  of the big banks after the 2008 financial crisis is harming Main Street  and the ability of everyday Americans to be able to realize their  financial goals. Directing the regulators to refocus their regulations  will help Americans start achieving their goals once again.   Once more, the regulators themselves have acknowledged the need for  tailored regulations. Both Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Federal  Reserve Chairman Powell have acknowledged the significant need for a  return to common sense in the financial regulatory landscape. Mr.  Speaker, the TAILOR Act, which passed out of the Financial Services  Committee with broad bipartisan support, does just that.   Mr. Speaker, I would again like to thank Chairman Hensarling for  considering this measure here today.
