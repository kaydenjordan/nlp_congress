 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation right  now?    Mr. President, I understand that we will be voting in  about 10 minutes; is that correct?    Mr. President, I have had the great honor and privilege  of knowing the nominee to be our Director of National Intelligence for  many years. In fact, I came to the House of Representatives in the  election of 1984, and I had the honor of knowing Dan Coats beginning at  that time.   As is well known, Dan Coats left the Senate and became our Ambassador  to Germany, where he did an outstanding job. He came back to the U.S.  Senate and served in this body with distinction and honor. Now he goes  on to serve as the Director of National Intelligence.   I could argue that a dedicated, experienced, knowledgeable, and  courageous Director of National Intelligence  [[Page S1824]]  is now needed more than at any time that I can remember in the last  many years.   With divisions within the intelligence community, there are  challenges to the credibility of the intelligence community along the  lines that I have never seen. There are questions about the activities  of the intelligence community. For example, the President of the United  States alleges that Trump Tower was ``wiretapped,'' in his words, by  the previous administration, and we see the former Director of National  Intelligence both before the Congress and on national television  stating that those allegations are not true.   There are probably more questions and more controversy surrounding  our intelligence services than at any time since anyone can remember,  since Watergate. So this is a perfect time, in my view, for Dan Coats  to assume the highest responsibilities of our Director of National  Intelligence. He has the respect and indeed affection of Members on  both sides of the aisle because of his successful efforts at working in  a bipartisan fashion. He served on the Intelligence Committee. He  served on that committee in a very dedicated and knowledgeable fashion.   I hope my colleagues will unanimously vote in favor of our former  colleague. Both sides of the aisle know him, and we know him well. I  wish I had some of his qualities of congeniality and pleasantry. He has  always been respectful of other views. Even in the fiercest debates  that we might have, he has always been respectful of those who  disagree. So he comes to the job with the much needed credibility that  will make him immediately effective.   Let's be frank. The intelligence communities are probably under  greater attack in a whole variety of ways, both on whether the American  people trust them to do the job that they are doing or whether they  have become a partisan organization. I think that with the respect and  appreciation and affection that those of us who had the privilege of  knowing him--on both sides of the aisle--and knowing what an honorable  and decent person he is, he will not only serve as an effective  Director of National Intelligence, but he will serve to restore  credibility.   God knows we need credibility at this time, as we see the Russians  trying to affect the outcome of our election, as we see today the  Russians trying to affect the French election and possibly the German  election, as we see unprecedented cyber attacks--more than at any time  in the past. With the challenge of cyber alone, where our adversaries  or our potential adversaries are equal to or even, in some cases, more  capable of exercising their abilities and capabilities in the cyber  realm, then we are in a very difficult and challenging struggle.   That is why I think that many times in history, not only does the man  make the job but the job makes the man. I am confident, in the case of  Senator Dan Coats, that will be the case.   I thank the Democratic leader for allowing this vote to take place so  Dan Coats can get to work immediately.   I urge my colleagues to offer their support with their vote for this  nomination of a great and good and gentle man who has again volunteered  to serve his Nation, for which all of us should be appreciative, and I  am sure we are.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move  to table the motion to reconsider.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute.    Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to render an ``aye''  vote for the nomination of Herbert McMaster to remain in active duty at  the three-star level. He is experienced. He is talented. He knows what  it is like to be in combat with the enemy, and I believe he is badly  needed in this important position.   I urge my colleagues to render an ``aye'' vote.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to speak as in morning business for as long as I want.    Mr. President, I am pleased to be in the company of the  distinguished Senator from Maryland, Mr. Cardin, the ranking member on  the Foreign Relations Committee and one who is most knowledgeable on  issues of national security and foreign policy. I believe that Senator  Shaheen from New Hampshire will be joining us.   This is an issue that I am sorry has to be brought up in this  fashion. It concerns a little country that wants to be a part of the  European Union, that wants to be a part of the values, customs, and  ideals of the West and has been under significant pressure and even  assault from Russia.   In fact, although it wasn't as recognized as it should have been at  the time, Russia has sought to keep Montenegro from becoming a NATO  member, launching an anti-NATO campaign that has been both brazen and  unscrupulous. Russia has exerted outsized influence to stop  Montenegro's membership, calling further NATO enlargement a  ``provocation.'' Russia went so far as to plot a coup d'etat in which  they planned to assassinate the Montenegrin Prime Minister and seize  control of government buildings in the capital. I repeat: The Russians  tried a coup in Montenegro. They wanted to kill the Prime Minister and  overthrow the government in order to keep Montenegro from becoming a  part of NATO.   If we send this clear message to Russia that it won't have veto power  over NATO enlargement decisions--and, frankly, I am puzzled that there  is any objection to this, considering the fact that Montenegro has  spent the last 7 years preparing for NATO eligibility. This has  strengthened the country's defense and intelligence forces and  transformed the country into a strong Western ally.   It is a small country and a beautiful country, but it is an important  Balkan nation. Its membership in NATO would improve the stability in  the region, where, I know my colleagues would agree, there is great  instability.   Stopping Montenegro's NATO candidacy would represent a significant  shift in U.S. policy and signify an acquiescence to Moscow's growing  influence in the Balkans, producing a ripple effect throughout the  region that would have profound ramifications on our shared security  interests.   The United States has benefited tremendously from peace and stability  in Europe, and the foundation of that  [[Page S1828]]  peace and stability is NATO. That is why we should stand with  Montenegro or risk undermining our vision of a Europe that is whole,  free, and at peace.   I see my two colleagues here, Senator Cardin and Senator Shaheen. So  I will conclude by saying this. This is a small country. This is a  small country that has been the scene of conflict for centuries. This  is a small country with a freely elected democratic government. This is  a small country whose population wants to be part of NATO. They want to  be part of the West. If we keep turning this down after 25 of the 28  governments in NATO have voted in favor of Montenegro's accession to  NATO, my friends, we would be sending a terrible, terrible message.   So in a few minutes, I will ask unanimous consent for us, as the U.S.  Senate, to move forward with treaty consent.   First, I would like to yield to my colleague from Maryland, Senator  Cardin.    Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from New  Hampshire and the Senator from Maryland. This issue probably doesn't  matter a lot to many of our voters. It probably is not something that  is uppermost in their minds. But because of your hard work here in the  Senate and your indepth knowledge of the issues and challenges that  face this country, in what is arguably the most uncertain and turbulent  time in the last 70 years, you have taken the time and the effort to  learn about this small country, this small beautiful country whose only  wish, whose only desire is to be a part of our community of NATO so  that they can come under the umbrella of protection and move forward  with a thriving democracy in a very volatile part of Europe.   I want to especially thank Senator Shaheen and Senator Cardin for  their advocacy, affection, and appreciation  [[Page S1830]]  of the citizens of the small country who are only seeking what we  sometimes take so much for granted. So I especially want to thank them.   I also want to thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee,  Senator Corker, who also was very involved in getting this through.   So, Mr. President, if there is objection--and I note that the Senator  from Kentucky is on the floor, and I will say before I read this, if  there is objection, you are achieving the objectives of Vladimir Putin.  You are achieving the objectives of trying to dismember this small  country that has already been the subject of an attempted coup.   I have no idea why anyone would object to this, except that I will  say, if they object, they are now carrying out the desires and  ambitions of Vladimir Putin, and I do not say that lightly.                unanimous consent request--executive calendar    So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be  determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic  leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar  No. 1, Montenegro, Treaty Document No. 114-12; that the treaty be  considered as having advanced through the various parliamentary stages  up to and including the presentation of the resolution of ratification;  that any committee declarations be agreed to as applicable; that there  be no amendments in order to the treaty or the resolution of  ratification; that there be 2 hours for debate, equally divided in the  usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate  proceed to vote on the resolution; that any statements be printed in  the Record; that if the resolution of ratification is agreed to, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that if  the resolution is not agreed to, the treaty be returned to the  calendar, and that there be no motions or points of order in order  other than a motion to reconsider; and the Senate then resume  legislative session.    Mr. President, I note the Senator from Kentucky is  leaving the floor without justification or any rationale for the action  he has just taken. It is really remarkable that a Senator is blocking a  treaty that is supported by an overwhelming number--perhaps 98, at  least, of his colleagues. To come to the floor and object and walk  away--walk away--the only conclusion that can be drawn when he walks  away is that he has no argument to be made. He has no justification for  his objection to having a small nation that is under assault from the  Russians be part of NATO.   So I repeat again: The Senator from Kentucky is now working for  Vladimir Putin.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, and I know I speak  for 90-some U.S. Senators with a message to the brave people of  Montenegro who are upholding democracy, who have fought against a coup  that would have overthrown their government, who cherish freedom, who  cherish the alliance that it has held so long for so many years.   We will not stop until we ratify your entrance into the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization. I pledge to the people of Montenegro that  Senator Shaheen, Senator Cardin, and I, and many other Senators, will  not stop until this resolution is passed and we can strengthen not only  Montenegro the nation and NATO, but the region.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
