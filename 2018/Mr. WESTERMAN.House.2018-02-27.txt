 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  ministry of Billy Graham. Billy Graham shared a simple message of the  good news of salvation through Jesus. He never tired nor wavered from  the story of how, as humans, we all have a relationship problem with  God because of sin in our lives. But God loves us so much that He  doesn't give up on us. In fact, God has offered us an escape from the  punishment due for our sin through the free gift of salvation, a gift  that we can receive but we cannot earn because Jesus paid the price for  our sins when He gave his life on the cross. Jesus overcame death; and  through faith in Christ, we can, too.   Billy Graham shared this message out of a deep love for God and his  fellow man. Not for fame. Not for fortune.   I thank God for the ministry of Billy Graham and the example he  lived. May God comfort his family and a grateful nation as we mourn his  loss, and may we never tire of sharing the good news of Christ.                            ____________________
