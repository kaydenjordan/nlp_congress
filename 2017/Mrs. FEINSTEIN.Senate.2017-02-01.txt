 Madam President, I rise today in opposition to Rex  Tillerson's nomination to be our next Secretary of State. I don't  believe Mr. Tillerson is an appropriate selection to be our Nation's  chief diplomat.   During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Tillerson repeatedly evaded  questions related to transparency and corporate responsibility. For  instance, on multiple occasions Mr. Tillerson stated that he was  unaware of Exxon's history of lobbying Congress; yet, according to  lobbying disclosure forms, Exxon lobbied against a variety of Iran and  Russia-related sanctions since at least 2010. When pressed on the  matter, Mr. Tillerson even claimed he didn't know if Exxon lobbied for  or against these energy-related sanctions bills.   Additionally, I am troubled by Mr. Tillerson's response to questions  about Exxon's dealings with Iran, Syria, and Sudan. According to public  documents, Exxon established a joint venture with Shell to conduct  business with state sponsors of terror. That joint venture--Infineum-- sold petroleum products to Iran, Sudan, and Syria, when those nations  were being sanctioned by the United States.   During that time, Mr. Tillerson rose from senior vice president to  president and director and eventually to chairman and CEO of Exxon;  yet, during his testimony, Mr. Tillerson claimed to be unaware of  Infineum's purposeful evasion of sanctions. Instead of recognizing the  larger national interest, Mr. Tillerson suggested that American  companies could legally avoid sanctions by setting up shell companies  outside of the United States.  [[Page S548]]    Infineum is not the only example of Exxon's history of undermining  American policy. Under Mr. Tillerson's leadership, Exxon signed oil  exploration contracts with the Kurds in Iraq. Doing so undermined the  United States ``one Iraq'' policy and exacerbated the long-simmering  conflict between the central government and the Kurds. That is because  Exxon signed contracts to explore oil at six sites. Three of those  sites were on disputed land claimed by both the Kurds and the Iraqi  central government.   By agreeing to explore in disputed territory on behalf of the Kurds,  Exxon changed the facts on the ground in favor of the Kurds. Exxon's  decision may have been good for Exxon, but it certainly did not benefit  a stable, unified Iraq.   I am also concerned by Mr. Tillerson's response to questions about  Russia. Russia has invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, intervened in  Syria, and meddled in our own elections; yet Mr. Tillerson refuses to  offer support for international sanctions against Russia.   He refuses to describe Russia's bombing of Syrian hospitals and  schools--and a U.N. humanitarian aid convoy--as war crimes.   Russia remains in violation of the Minsk agreement and continues to  occupy Crimea, indiscriminately bomb in Syria, and hack American think  tanks.   Now is not the time to remove sanctions against Russia, and I have  little confidence Mr. Tillerson is committed to pushing back against  Russian aggression.   Finally, Mr. Tillerson's indifference to the two-state solution  between Israel and the Palestinians is unacceptable. Specifically, Mr.  Tillerson said that a two-state solution is a ``dream'' and openly  questioned whether or not it could ever become a reality. The reality  is that, without a two-state solution, Israel cannot be both a  democracy and a majority-Jewish state.   Today Israel is constructing settlements throughout the West Bank.  Palestinian terror and incitement continue. Mr. Tillerson's almost  casual dismissal of the two-state solution is disqualifying for a  Secretary of State. Our chief diplomat must understand the urgency of  the situation and must be willing to engage both sides in the pursuit  of peace.   I simply do not believe Mr. Tillerson is interested in doing so.   Mr. Tillerson's lack of transparency, history of working against our  national interests, close ties to Russia, and indifference to Israel's  future make him unfit to serve as the Secretary of State.   I intend to oppose Mr. Tillerson, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an  extraordinary public servant and a dedicated leader of the U.S.  intelligence community, Brig. Gen. Francis Xavier Taylor, the Under  Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, I&A, at the Department of  Homeland Security.   I had the pleasure of presiding as chairman of the Intelligence  Committee for the confirmation hearing for General Taylor in 2014 and  have witnessed his leadership over the past 2 and a half years as I&A  has made perhaps the most impressive progress of any intelligence  agency over this time.   After nearly 40 years of honorable service to our Nation, Under  Secretary Taylor retired on the last day of the Obama administration.   Prior to his work at DHS, Frank Taylor served for 31 years in the  U.S. Air Force and at the U.S. Department of State as an ambassador for  counterterrorism and head of diplomatic security. He also served as  vice president of security at General Electric. For the past 2 years,  he has applied the leadership skills, understanding of security at home  and abroad, and his close personal friendship with Secretary Jeh  Johnson to transform the Office of Intelligence and Analysis.   I&A's mission is to equip the Homeland Security Enterprise with  timely intelligence and information it needs to keep the homeland safe,  secure, and resilient. It provides critical intelligence to the  leadership of the DHS and its components; State, local, tribal, and  territorial governments, and private sector partners. The office itself  was formed after the creation of DHS through the Homeland Security Act  of 2002 and has seen significant change and disruption in its short  lifetime. Due to Under Secretary Taylor's leadership, I&A is much  further along on its vision of becoming a premier element of the IC,  driving information sharing and delivering unique predictive  intelligence and analysis to operators and decisionmakers at all  levels.   During his confirmation hearing, General Taylor was asked why I&A  needed to exist, given the domestic mission of the FBI and the analytic  work of the National Counterterrorism Center. He was asked to justify  the office's existence if it produced one analytic product per employee  per year. Members questioned him on the need for State and local fusion  centers and the support provided to them by the Federal Government. I  focused my questions on why an intelligence agency should have more  than 60 percent of its staffing come from a contractor workforce.   As we begin 2017, those questions are no longer applicable. Under  Secretary Taylor has transformed the organization. He removed internal  I&A stovepipes and realigned the organization to more closely reflect  the intelligence cycle. Where homeland intelligence analysis had too  often relied on repackaging products from other members of the IC, DHS  collection now forms the basis of I&A production. Under Secretary  Taylor also ordered that finished intelligence include DHS and State- local-tribal Partner data. Within 1 year, the organization achieved  great success on this front, ensuring 80 percent of finished  intelligence in fiscal year 2016 included unique homeland-derived data.  Under his leadership, I&A is fulfilling the unique homeland-focused  role that Congress intended. The contract workforce is below 25 percent  and the office is producing valuable intelligence analysis, tips to law  enforcement, compiling and improving the quality of DHS data for  intelligence purposes, strengthening our watch listing capability, and  lending expertise to decision makers from the President down to the cop  on the beat.   Under Secretary Taylor has worked tirelessly to mature and strengthen  the Department's relationship with the State and local fusion centers  and make information sharing a priority, changing the way the IC  analyzes the domestic threat picture. When I have visited my local  fusion center in San  [[Page S590]]  Francisco, I receive nothing but praise for the support that I&A  provides and the importance of local, State, and Federal information  sharing. The most recent example of this partnership is the Field  Analysis Report, FAR, an intelligence report written by State and local  intelligence analysts in coordination with I&A for the State and local  audience. This is an important development from intelligence handed  down from intelligence agencies inside the Federal beltway that, at  times, misses the mark of what the local customer needs. FARs are among  the most highly rated finished intelligence products coming out of I&A  and are a direct result of General Taylor's vision.   Under Secretary Taylor also took to heart the need to invest in the  workforce and address extremely low employee morale. He has  restructured the workforce, drastically reducing the ratio of  supervisors to workers, streamlining management and developing what he  calls ``seed corn''--young, junior intelligence professionals brought  in to rejuvenate the organization and help develop a truly homeland- focused workforce. Besides shifting the balance of the staff, Under  Secretary Taylor focused on hiring, growing, and investing in the  workforce and ensuring that inherently governmental work is done by  governmental employees and clear communication between the workforce  and the leadership.   Members of the Intelligence Committee spend most of our time on  international events and the often controversial practices of the CIA,  NSA, and FBI. We have had the luxury in the recent past not to have to  worry on the intelligence coming from and provided to our homeland  security professionals because of the leadership and uncommon skill of  Under Secretary Frank Taylor. We owe him a tremendous debt of  gratitude. I wish to thank Under Secretary Taylor for his decades of  exceptional service to our country and to wish him and his wife,  Connie, the very best in the days and years ahead as he retires for the  fourth time.   Thank you.                            ____________________
