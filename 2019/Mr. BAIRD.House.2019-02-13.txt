 Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank the gentlewoman, and I  appreciate all her efforts regarding this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise here today to voice a concern over the actions  taking place in New York, Virginia, and across the country that  directly threaten the sanctity of life. These proposals are far beyond  what Hoosiers in my community, and most folks around the country,  believe is right.    That is why I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act. This legislation will make it illegal to kill  babies that are born alive after surviving an attempted abortion.   The degradation of life in this country is deeply concerning.  Congress needs to step up and do what is right. The extreme views of  some should not overwhelm the commonsense majority of millions of  Americans.   Protecting the sanctity of life is something I will continue to fight  for, to ensure that those without a voice can be heard and their lives  spared.
