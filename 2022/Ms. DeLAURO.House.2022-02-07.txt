 Madam Speaker, the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual  Assault and Sexual Harassment Act is bipartisan. It is legislation that  provides survivors with the resources they need to seek the justice  that they deserve and empower them by giving them a choice to go to  court instead of being forced into arbitration.   Survivors like Susan Fowler who, in 2015, was working with Uber when  her manager started sexually harassing her. She immediately reported  this to human resources, but when she did, her manager threatened to  fire her. And since Uber employees are forced to sign arbitration  agreements when they are hired, preventing them from bringing sexual  harassment claims to court, Susan was forced into a confidential  dispute forum without the right to appeal.   Three years later, Susan had had enough and she spoke out, writing in  an op-ed for the New York Times: ``From the systemic culture of  harassment and discrimination at Uber . . . to the ubiquitous stories  of women taken advantage of in industries ranging from professional  football to restaurants, we have seen one company after another  publicly outed and shamed for illegal treatment of employees.''   And Susan rightly asks, ``The question is no longer whether  mistreatment actually occurs . . . but what can we do to ensure that it  never happens again.''   The answer is simple. We can pass this bipartisan legislation, end  the practice of forced arbitration, and I urge my colleagues to vote in  favor of this bill.                                time  1745
