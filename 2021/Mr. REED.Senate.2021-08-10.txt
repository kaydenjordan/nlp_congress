 Mr. President, this is well-intended because there are  always needs for national defense, but I would like to point out that  the Armed Services Committee, on a bipartisan basis, raised the top  line of the Defense bill this year by $25 billion, allowing us to cover  the unfunded requirements of the Department of Defense. This was not  only a bipartisan effort; it was overwhelmingly approved by the  committee. So we are not reneging on a commitment to fully fund the  Department of Defense.   I know this amendment originated as an attempt to amend the  infrastructure bill, but as it is written, this amendment would provide  over $50 billion in funding for unspecified uses--it could be  infrastructure; it could be military platforms; it could be a host of  things--and the fund would extend from 2022 to 2031, which is beyond  this Congress and beyond the current administration.   I think we should adhere to the rules, the regular order, which has  been conducted in the Armed Services Committee. I think we have well- positioned ourselves for an adequate budget and determination of  spending this year.   For that reason, I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3293     Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the  Strengthening the Vaccines for Children Program Act of 2021 with  Senator Shelley Moore Capito. This bill seeks to protect children and  their communities from preventable illness during the pandemic and for  the long term by making vaccines more accessible. Similar bipartisan  legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by  Representatives Kim Schrier, John Joyce, G.K. Butterfield, and David  McKinley.   Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, routine childhood vaccination rates are  down, as parents have sought to avoid visits to the doctor and other  medical care for their children for fear of catching or spreading  COVID-19. These lower immunizations rates raise the very real  possibility of a secondary outbreak of an infectious disease such as  measles, mumps, or whooping cough. The Vaccines for Children (VFC)  program provides federally purchased vaccines to approximately half of  all children in the United States, including children who are enrolled  in Medicaid or who are uninsured or underinsured, and plays a critical  role in ensuring high rates of childhood vaccination. As children  return to school in person this fall, the VFC program will be critical  to helping children catch up on their routine immunizations to prevent  outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. However, much more must be  done to update and improve the VFC program to better reflect the  challenges of administering vaccines today.   Our bipartisan legislation would modernize the VFC program,  addressing barriers to participation among families and their  pediatricians. As such, this bill would extend eligibility to children  enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program, streamlining and  filling a gap in program administration. The bill would also ensure  that Medicaid can pay appropriately for the administration and  counseling of modern, multicomponent vaccines, helping to address  vaccine hesitancy. Lastly, the bill includes new reporting requirements  to identify disparities and pockets of low vaccination rates.   This legislation has already passed unanimously in the House Energy  and Commerce Committee, demonstrating broad, bipartisan support for  improving the VFC program and addressing lagging childhood vaccination  rates. I look forward to working with Sen. Capito, as well as  Representatives Schrier, Joyce, Butterfield, and McKinley towards  passage of this legislation in both chambers in the near future.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):   S. 2693. A bill to amend the Reclamation Projects Authorization and  Adjustment Act of 1992 to authorize additional projects related to the  Salton Sea, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources.
