 Mr. Speaker, just last weekend, a 31-year- old mother and a 24-year-old man in Los Angeles were ambushed. They  were shot at pointblank range by a coward who targeted them for no  reason except for the uniform that they wear.   These two police officers were attacked in the very community where  they serve, the community that they have sworn to protect.  [[Page H4389]]    It is hard to believe, but this story gets worse. As these two police  officers were in the hospital fighting for their lives, protestors  stood outside, blocking ambulance entrances and chanting: ``We hope  they die.''   What has become of American cities? When did this behavior become  acceptable or even fathomable?   This ambush demonstrates total disregard for human life. It is an  affront to American values.   Thankfully, by the grace of God and the skill of first responders and  trauma medical teams, these brave police officers are expected to  recover from their injuries. We are fortunate that they are on the  mend, and my prayers are with them on their road to recovery.   Frankly, this time, we truly were fortunate. This time, we expect  that a mother will return home to her family. We expect that a young  police officer will return to his normal life.   Indeed, this time, we are fortunate. But what about the next time?  Will we let this happen again?   Mr. Speaker, as a Nation, we cannot allow this malicious and wicked  behavior to continue. We cannot stand by as police officers are shot at  pointblank range. We cannot stand by while protestors scream ``We hope  they die'' at critically injured public servants. We must restore law  and order to all American cities.   In this Chamber, we should dispense with the Democrats' political  games and enact commonsense, bipartisan solutions such as the JUSTICE  Act, which was introduced by Senator Tim Scott and Congressman Pete  Stauber, to increase police transparency and accountability while  supporting our law enforcement community and equipping them with the  resources that they need to safely protect our communities.   We cannot stand on the sidelines and leave our law enforcement  officers vulnerable to attacks. This is not the time to turn our backs  on the police; this is not the time to dismantle the police; and this  is definitely not the time to defund the police. We must protect the  American people; we must restore law and order; and we must back the  blue.                            ____________________
