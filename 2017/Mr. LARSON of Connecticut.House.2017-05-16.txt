 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished  Member from Maryland and our distinguished chairman from Virginia for  taking up this legislation.   Let me start by thanking so many cosponsors, starting with Peter King  and Bill Pascrell, the co-chairs of our Congressional Fire Services  Caucus, for their extraordinary work; the sheriff, as I like to refer  to David Reichert, who I serve with on the Committee on Ways and Means;  and Tim Walz, the chairman of the Congressional Emergency Medical  Services (EMS) Caucus and ranking member of the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs.    Amongst the Members who are cosponsors of the bill, many are former  first responders as well: Dutch Ruppersberger, former police officer;  John Rutherford, former sheriff of Duval County, Florida; Brian  Fitzpatrick, former FBI special agent; Jim Renacci, former volunteer  firefighter from Ohio.   Special thanks to the Committee on the Judiciary for recognizing,  however simple a solution, how powerful the meaning for those who have  lost a member of their community and their family who, as Lincoln would  say, have given the full measure of their devotion. I thank Chairman  Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers, Steve King, and Steve Cohen also  for their work on this. I deeply appreciate it.   I especially thank and single out Jim McLoughlin, a veteran  firefighter from Connecticut. He is the founder of the National Honor  Guard Commanders Association, and it was he who first came to me with  endorsing this concept.   I also thank the strong support of Harold Schaitberger of the  International Association of Firefighters, the Fraternal Order of  Police, Sergeants Benevolent Association, International Association of  Fire Chiefs, and the National Volunteer Fire Council, among others.   As has been said on the floor already today, a number of people have  mentioned that this week we come together during National Police Week  to recognize first responders. In fact, the White House was lit in blue  last night. It is those who put their lives on the line every day to  protect us and our communities, as the chairman noted, who often get  forgotten in terms of their line of duty.   I am the son of a proud firefighter. I think in every firefighter's  memory and every memory of the Nation will be permanently seared that  vision of firefighters rushing up the steps of the World Trade Center  as people were coming down.                                time  1645    Whether it is a national emergency or a medical emergency, these  brave men and women are the first to answer the call, and they deserve  our respect.   Scripture tells us to love our neighbors as we love ourselves, but  only a few are willing to step into harm's way for others. When  everyone else flees from danger, our law enforcement officers,  firefighters, and EMTs heroically place their lives in jeopardy to help  people that they have never met.   These jobs are inherently dangerous. The reminders are too common.  And as any family of a first responder can tell you, they oftentimes do  not return home to their families. Joe Crowley has spoken eloquently of  that on this very floor.   This bill has been reviewed by the chairman, and I thank Mr. Raskin  for his comments as well. But I think we can all agree that these  courageous men and women deserve what is a simple tribute but a very  powerful message when the American flag and all that it stands for is  lowered to halfstaff when they have given the full measure of their  devotion to their community, their State, and this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage and am thankful for the bipartisan  support that we have received on this very important week for these  incredibly remarkable and important people who serve their country.
