 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials in the Record on the subject of my Special  Order.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Madam Speaker, I yield to my colleague from California  (Mr. Vargas).    Madam Speaker, I yield to my colleague from California  (Mr. Correa).    Madam Speaker, as the whip of the Congressional  Hispanic Caucus, I am pleased to lead this monthly Special Order hour.  It comes at a critical time in America, a critical time for our Nation  and for the communities that we represent.   Yesterday morning, Madam Speaker, you may know that the Supreme Court  heard a case. They heard arguments on Dreamers. This decision will  determine the lives of nearly 1 million young Americans in the Supreme  Court of the United States, a million people who were brought here at a  very early age, at a very young age, and have known no other country  but the United States of America.   We have come to call them Dreamers because they symbolize, in a  quintessential way, what the American Dream stands for. They derived  the name from bipartisan legislation introduced in 2001 by none other  than the former Republican president pro tempore of the Senate, Orrin  Hatch of the State of Utah and Dick Durbin of the State of Illinois.   That legislation, which was reintroduced multiple times, would have  granted residency status to immigrants who came here as minors,  assuming they had no criminal record and had a high school diploma; and  they could become permanent residents if they got a college degree or  served honorably in the U.S. military.   This proposal was seen as a critical component of any comprehensive  immigration reform and for many was considered a low-hanging fruit, the  easiest thing we could all agree on, both sides of the aisle. Opinion  polling of the American people bore that out. In fact, we have seen  poll after poll after poll indicate that over 80 percent of the  American people, whether in red States or blue States, support  Dreamers.   In 2013, after the House Republican majority flat-out refused to even  consider an overwhelmingly bipartisan comprehensive immigration package  painstakingly negotiated, amended, and, finally, approved by the Senate  on a healthy bipartisan vote, President Obama looked at what his  options were, and he saw the very last deal was this low-hanging fruit.   He used his administrative discretion in enforcing immigration laws,  a longstanding authority used by Presidents on both sides of the aisle,  to create the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or the  DACA program.   While the program couldn't provide permanent legal certainty, it did,  essentially, tell those who have been eligible under the DREAM Act  that, if they came forward and followed various steps to ensure they  met conditions similar to those in the DREAM Act, they would be granted  relief from deportation and issued documents allowing them to remain  and work legally in the United States.   In essence, the Dreamers came forward and shared their personal  information--their address, their date of birth--they shared that with  us, the government. They were forward. They were transparent in their  approach to share vital, personal, and confidential information with  the government.   The DACA program and the DREAM Act were so popular and so important  because they are an example of who we are and aspire to be as a nation,  a nation of immigrants, and it honors our core principles such as basic  fairness, compassion, and common sense.   What is more, it is in our national interest to keep DACA recipients  here.   Between 2017 and 2027, DACA beneficiaries are projected to contribute  $460 billion to the national GDP. They pay $5.7 billion in Federal  taxes and $3.1 billion in State and local taxes, annually.   Researchers estimate ending DACA will cost the United States economy  anywhere from $283 billion to $460 billion over the next 10 years.   Our Nation also sees benefits from the fact that many DACA recipients  are highly educated and skilled workers. Ninety-six percent of DACA  recipients are enrolled in school, and 75 percent are pursuing a  bachelor's degree or higher.  [[Page H8818]]    27,000 DACA recipients are currently employed as healthcare workers  and support staff. They are an integral part of the healthcare industry  across America.   So it stands to reason that rescinding DACA would do nothing but hurt  the economy, drain our businesses of skilled and educated workers, and  threaten our public health system.   The reason the current case is making its way through the courts is  precisely because the Trump administration has been unable to  substantiate their reasoning for terminating the program.   President Trump, himself, has said on numerous occasions that he does  not want to deport DACA recipients or so he says. In fact, two lower  Federal courts have placed injunctions in the efforts to eliminate the  DACA program.   So there are a few things I believe we must do. Most obviously-- though, admittedly, unlikely--if the administration really does not  want to send DACA recipients to their place, a place that they have  never known, it should rescind its order or find other administrative  means to give them certainty.   But even more importantly, Madam Speaker, is that we change the law  to provide permanent certainty for these young Americans.   And they are truly Americans: They feel American; they have been here  for many years; and many of them, with the exception of having their  green card, are very much part of the American fabric.                                time  1800    I was proud to vote for the Dream and Promise Act not too long ago  when it passed here in the House. And as the only formerly undocumented  immigrant in Congress, I was honored, deeply honored to preside over  its passage. It is now on the Senate to act.   We heard the arguments yesterday in the Supreme Court. We are hopeful  that the Court will be reasonable and understand that these young  people have nothing but to give their sweat and their work, their  abilities to our Nation.   Based on the vote just 6 years ago, it is clear that H.R. 6 would  pass if the majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, brought it  to a vote.   This legislation, a similar legislation, a lot more complex, more  comprehensive in scope, was passed not too long ago in the Senate in a  bipartisan way.   In the meantime, Democrats in the House, we must continue to consider  other legislation that will help Dreamers. For example, the Education  and Labor Committee recently passed a sweeping reform of our higher  education programs, the College Affordability Act. That bill would make  college more affordable and accessible to Dreamers by making them  eligible for financial aid, Pell Grants, and other kinds of financial  assistance.   Besides, if we are encouraging Dreamers to complete their education  in order to grant them legal status, the least we can do is help them  afford the education.   There are numerous reasons to keep Dreamers here and give them the  certainty they need to succeed, the most basic being that we have  always been, and will continue to be, a Nation of immigrants.   For the rest of this special hour, you will hear from other  colleagues in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who will share their  stories about why this is critically important for the future of  America. In fact, I am compelled to tell you that this is a fight for  the soul of America. But here I yield to them.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the many groups who continue to serve  our constituents through their advocacy, their legal assistance, their  organizational skills, and their moral support, groups like UnidosUS,  United We Dream, the Hispanic Federation, Make the Road New York,  faith-based groups, labor unions, and countless others. They are all  shining examples of what America stands for, and we could not be  successful in our work inside the Capitol without the work that they do  outside of the Capitol.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto), my  colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan), the second vice chair of the Congressional  Hispanic Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for joining me  here today. I would like to reiterate the important message that we are  here to support Dreamers.  [[Page H8820]]    This is not impossible, Madam Speaker. In 2002, while I was a Member  of the New York State Assembly, the lower house of the New York State  Legislature, we passed instate tuition allowing undocumented college  students the ability to pay instate tuition. We did that with a  Republican Governor and with a Republican-led Senate. Just last year,  New York State again passed the Jose Peralta Dream Act.   So it could be done, Madam Speaker.   Just recently, I was speaking to a group of Dreamers and advocates in  Battery Park, New York, having the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop to  our rally. I told them to be cognizant of what they are doing because,  very often, those who write history, those who write the chapters and  the annals of history, are not aware that they are doing it.   I asked them to pay close attention to what they were doing because  they are, in fact, the protagonists. They are the leaders of this  movement. When you see their faces, and you see what they want to do  for our country, it is almost impossible to say no to them. I told them  to be very cognizant of their effort because, in fact, they are an army  of goodwill.   They may not have weapons in their hands, and they may not wear  military gear, but they are an army of goodwill that I think is  fighting every day for the soul of America. And 20 or 30 years from  now, they will be able to tell their children and grandchildren that  they were successful, that they were critical. They were the  protagonists, the leaders of a movement led by an army of goodwill that  saved America and what it stands for.   Madam Speaker, we will continue to call on our colleagues in the  Senate to take up and pass the American Dream and Promise Act so that  the lives of over 800,000 Dreamers no longer hang in the balance.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
