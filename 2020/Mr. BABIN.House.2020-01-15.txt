 Mr. Speaker, I thank very, very much my friend and  colleague from New Jersey, Chris Smith, for having this Special Order,  which is so very important. There is no greater champion for life than  our colleague Chris Smith.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank every one of my colleagues who are  surrounding me tonight or are here speaking for those who are  voiceless.   I rise solemnly today, Mr. Speaker, in memory of the Supreme Court's  tragic decision in Roe v. Wade 47 years ago, this appalling decision.  Since that time, more than 60 million innocent human beings have been  killed in the name of abortion and convenience.   Throughout our history, Americans have been the very first to protect  the defenseless around the world repeatedly through the centuries, yet  here at home, we have allowed our very most vulnerable to come under  vicious attack.   As the father of five children and the grandfather of 16 beautiful  grandchildren, I have no more important duty personally than to protect  the lives of all Americans.   As Members of Congress, we have that same duty to protect all  Americans, especially the ones who have no voice.   I have been very proud to support the steps taken by President Trump  and his administration, who is the most pro-life President in the  history of this country, in his fight to save innocent lives from  abortion. We are so very grateful for his bold executive efforts to  protect the lives of the unborn, which have been so very, very  effective.   As thousands of Americans gather once again here in Washington, D.C.,  next week to stand up for life, let us be renewed in our purpose to end  abortion.
