 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  8265 to extend the Paycheck Protection Program to keep millions of  employees on the payroll of America's small businesses.    Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 hit Fort Bend County hard in March.  Our local concert venue, the Smart Financial Centre, has not rocked  since, yet Fort Bend County has rocked on.   The Fort Bend Hope Clubhouse kept rocking--proof: ROCKS I received  from the director, Kerry Beth Cottingham. We met Monday back home. She  gave me these two rocks with a common message, #clubhouserocksTexas.   They rock because they are giving people with mental conditions the  skills they need to build confidence and independence. Members choose  every day where they want to work: work in the kitchen, go to class,  clerical work, technical work, or just outreach about the magic  happening at the clubhouse.   Keep rocking, Fort Bend Hope Clubhouse. Let's rock into Mental Health  Awareness Week that starts next week.   Mahalo.                            ____________________
