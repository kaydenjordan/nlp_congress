 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of  preventive cancer care, especially colorectal cancer.   Colorectal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, but it has one of  the highest survival rates if detected and treated early. Too many  Americans put off routine screenings and colonoscopies because they  worry about coverage.   Now, UnitedHealthcare has made the disastrous decision to require  patients to get prior authorization before they get colonoscopies.  Their new policy comes at a time when colorectal cancer rates are  rising nationwide, particularly in young Americans.   This policy encourages more Americans not to get screenings and  colonoscopies, and it will cause curable cancer issues to become life- threatening ones.   I lost my father, Congressman   Donald Payne, Sr., to colorectal  cancer in 2012. I do not want other families to lose their fathers and  loved ones from a lack of preventive cancer care.
