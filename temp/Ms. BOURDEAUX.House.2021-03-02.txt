 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lofgren for  yielding.   After an election with record-breaking turnout in November, the  Georgia General Assembly has recently introduced a number of partisan  bills to restrict voter registration and make it more difficult for  Georgians to vote. Similar efforts are being made in States across the  country.   H.R. 1 would codify into law provisions to protect voters from the  systemic efforts to suppress the vote, and I rise in strong support.  Every voice must be heard and every vote must be counted.   I would like to highlight my amendment, cosponsored by a number of my  Georgia colleagues. It would directly counter the threats posed by  partisan voter suppression efforts across the country by ensuring that  drop boxes are easily accessible to all Americans, no matter where they  live.   It would safeguard access to absentee ballots and promote voter  registration efforts rather than trying to limit them. I urge my  colleagues to pass H.R. 1 to protect the sacred right to vote.   H.R. 1 will also end partisan gerrymandering, place people over  special interests, and enable free and fair elections. I resolutely  urge my colleagues to support the adoption of H.R. 1.
