 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of one of the most  fundamental rights imaginable in a free society, the right to bodily  autonomy and the freedom to choose when and how to begin a family.   As I stand here today, Texas women do not have that right. In Texas  right now, a woman is required, by law, to either carry to term the  offspring of their rapist or their abuser or drive 5 hours or more to  Kansas, New Mexico, Colorado, or anywhere they can get access to  abortion services.   Now, some extremist Republicans in Texas want to prevent Texans from  leaving the State to obtain an abortion. The same so-called  conservatives who talk about Big Government want to tell Texas women  where they can travel or are threatening the employers of those women  who offer to pay for their travel.   What is next, Madam Speaker? Will they place checkpoints on our  interstate highways, or question women boarding a plane or a train  about the nature of their travel?   Does this sound like freedom to anyone?   I will not stand for it. My colleagues and I will not stand for it.  The Ensuring Access to Abortion Act ensures that all American women  have the right to travel within the United States, a right that we  should not have to be affirming today but one that we will.
