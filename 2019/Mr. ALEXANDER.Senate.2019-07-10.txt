 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia  for working to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. That is the  question I hear most often in Tennessee: How can I reduce what I pay  for out of my own pocket for healthcare costs? The most obvious way to  reduce what you pay out of your own pocket for healthcare costs is to  reduce the cost of prescription drugs.   Shirley, from Franklin, TN, is one of those Americans who asked me  that question. This is what she said:         As a 71 year old senior with arthritis, I rely on Enbrel to       keep my symptoms in check. My copay has just been increased       from $95.00 to $170.00 every ninety days. At this rate I will       have to begin limiting my usage in order to balance the       monthly budget.    There has never been a more exciting time in biomedical research, but  that progress is meaningless if patients can't afford these new  lifesaving drugs.   Last month, as Senator Capito mentioned, our Senate Health Committee  passed legislation by a vote of 20 to 3 that included 14 bipartisan  provisions to increase prescription drug competition as a way of  lowering generic drug costs and biosimilar drugs that reach patients.   Here is what that includes: The CREATES Act--the Senator from Iowa,  Mr. Grassley, is on the floor. He, Senator Leahy, and many others have  proposed the CREATES Act, which will help bring more lower cost generic  drugs to patients by eliminating anticompetitive practices by brand  drugmakers. That is in the bill we approved. It also includes helping  biosimilar companies speed drug development through a transparent,  modernized, and searchable patent database. That was proposed by  Senators Collins, Kaine, Braun, Hawley, Murkowski, Paul, Portman,  Shaheen, and Stabenow. This legislation we have was approved 20 to 3.  There are 55 different proposals by 65 different U.S. Senators--about  the same number of Republicans and Democrats--all to reduce healthcare  costs.   Here are some other examples. The bill improves the Food and Drug  Administration's drug patent database by keeping it more up to date to  help generic drug companies speed product development, a proposal  offered by Senator Cassidy and Senator Durbin.   Another provision is it prevents the abuse of citizens' petitions.  These are used to unnecessarily delay drug approvals. This was proposed  by Senators Gardner, Shaheen, Cassidy, Bennet, Cramer, and Braun.  President Trump included that in his 2020 budget.   Another provision is it clarifies that the makers of brand biological  products, such as insulin, are not gaming the system to delay new,  lower cost biosimilars. That came from Senators Smith, Cassidy, and  Cramer.   Another provision is it eliminates exclusivity loopholes. These allow  drug companies to get exclusivity and delay patient access to less  costly generic drugs by just making small tweaks to an old drug. That  came from Senators Roberts, Cassidy, and Smith, which President Trump  also proposed in his budget.   Another provision prevents the blocking of generic drugs. This is  done by eliminating a loophole that allows a first generic to submit an  application to FDA and block other generics from the market. Again, the  President included this in his budget.   Another provision in our bill prevents delays of biosimilar drugs by  excluding biological products from compliance with U.S. Pharmacopeia  standards. That sounds pretty complicated, but what it means is that it  could delay patient access and lower the cost of drugs. Again, that is  another proposal by President Trump.   Another provision is it increases transparency on price and quality  information by banning the kind of gag clauses Senator Capito talked  about. These are gag clauses in contracts between providers and health  plans that prevent patients, plan sponsors, or referring physicians  from seeing price and quality information.   Another provision bans pharmacy benefit managers from charging more  for a drug than it paid for the same drug.   Instead of remaining stuck in a perpetual partisan argument over  ObamaCare and health insurance--and I can guarantee you that is going  to continue to go on for a while--we have Senators on that side of the  aisle and Senators on this side of the aisle working together to lower  the cost of what Americans pay for healthcare out of their own pockets.   Since January, Senator Murray and I have been working in parallel  with Senator Grassley and Senator Wyden of the Finance Committee. They  are continuing to work on their own bipartisan bill. Last month, the  Senate Judiciary Committee also voted to lower the cost of prescription  drugs. In the House, the Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and  Judiciary Committees have all reported out bipartisan bills on the cost  of prescription drugs.   As I have mentioned, President Trump and Secretary Azar have been  focused on this. Last year, the administration released a blueprint on  steps the President would take to lower prescription drugs. Last year,  the Food and Drug Administration set a new record for generic drug  approvals. Generic drugs can be up to 85 percent less expensive than  brand drugs.   So I believe the cost of prescription drugs is an area where  Democrats and Republicans in Congress and the administration can find  common ground to help Americans reduce the cost of healthcare that they  pay for out of their own pockets.   I am very hopeful that our bill, with 55 proposals from 65 Senators,  which has been reported to the Senate floor, will be placed by the  majority and minority leaders on the Senate floor before the end of the  month. We can pass it, the House will do their job, and we can send it  to the President to lower prescription drug costs.   I yield the floor.
