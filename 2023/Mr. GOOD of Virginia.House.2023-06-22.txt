 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the tragic  loss of Wintergreen Police Officer Mark Christopher Wagner, II, and to  honor the legacy that he has left behind.   On June 16, 2023, Officer Wagner responded to a call for help  following an assault in the Wintergreen community of Nelson County,  Virginia. He was the first officer to arrive at the scene when he  bravely ran into harm's way, as these officers do every day, to  apprehend the suspect who would fatally attack him.   My prayers are with the family, friends, and loved ones of Officer  Wagner as they grieve the loss of his life and begin to process life in  his absence.   Psalm 34 reads: ``The Lord is close to the brokenhearted . . .''   We grieve this tragic loss and we pray for the peace and comfort that  only the Lord can provide to Officer Wagner's family.   Every day, Officer Wagner was committed to bravely protecting the  Wintergreen community. He was an exceptional example of sacrificial  service, giving his life to secure and defend the lives of others. I am  humbled to recognize the valor of Officer Wagner and the courage and  dedication he demonstrated to his community.   May God bless his family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is refreshing to hear my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to be so sober about the  issue of impeachment coming after being in the majority for 2 years  when, for the first time in the history of the country, there were two  impeachment charges brought in this very House.   Impeachment should not be political. It should not be cavalier. It  should not be flippant. That would be bringing impeachment charges  based on a phone call, where there was questionable content to a phone  call, something that this current President is actually being  investigated for by the House Oversight Committee as we speak.   It would be a cavalier, flippant impeachment investigation with just  1 week left in someone's term just to tarnish or attack their personal  legacy with no opportunity for that to move forward other than just the  charges.   It would be cavalier to announce right after an election that: We are  going to impeach the MFer.   That is what happened with our friends on the other side of the  aisle.   There does need to be more consideration about whether or not  impeachment is justified for depleting our Strategic Petroleum Reserve  on the eve of an election for political reasons.   There should be more consideration as to whether or not a President  should be impeached for taking authority that he says he doesn't  constitutionally have the power to do, such as the eviction moratorium  or the student loan transfer scheme.   More consideration might be warranted for the very things that are  being investigated by the current Committee on Oversight relative to  bribery allegations and influence peddling allegations.   What more investigation is needed for the border invasion? What more  investigation is needed for the violation of Article IV, Section 4,  responsibility to protect the States from invasion?   How long will we let this border invasion continue? Are we to let it  go on for another year and a half? How many is too many after 7 million  illegals have invaded this country?   There are 1.5 million got-aways. Of those criminal got-aways, if only  1 percent are dangerous individuals, that is 15,000 reckless, dangerous  individuals intending harm on this country. Would anyone take those  odds that only 1 percent of those 1.5 million got-aways are, indeed,  bad actors?
