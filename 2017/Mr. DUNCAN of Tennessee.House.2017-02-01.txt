 Mr. Speaker, approximately 58 percent of the  people in this world have to get by on $4 or less a day. This means  roughly 4 billion of the 7 billion in the world are living in extreme  or very great poverty.   If we simply opened our borders, probably several hundred million  would come here over the next 2 or 3 years. Our entire infrastructure-- our schools, hospitals, jails, sewers, roads--in fact, our entire  economy could not handle a massive, rapid influx like that.   The American people are the kindest, most generous people in the  world. We have allowed far more immigration than any other country over  the last 50 years--many millions. No other country has even come close.  But we must enforce our immigration laws.   The great majority of the American people want border security.  President Trump's immigration order was not a Muslim ban. It did not  even apply to 9 of the 10 largest population Muslim countries.   The President's efforts are being completely distorted. He is simply  trying to do what the people want.                            ____________________
