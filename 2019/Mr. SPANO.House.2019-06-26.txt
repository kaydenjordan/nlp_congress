 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a local legend who  recently passed away in Lakeland, Florida.   Mr. Billy Henderson had a passion for flying planes since he was a  young man. As a matter of fact, he used to fondly say he started flying  in 1946 when he was 16 years old and began legally flying 20 years  later in 1968.   Billy turned his passion into a life purpose, and in 1974, he and  four others created SUN n' FUN, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting  aviation education in central Florida.   SUN n' FUN has grown from hosting a small fly-in, which attracted 900  attendees, to the largest annual convention in Florida.   Every year, more than 100,000 visitors come to Lakeland to watch  pilots, such as the Blue Angels, show off the best that aviation has to  offer.   SUN n' FUN not only brings in $60 million to central Florida every  year, but also has an impact beyond the convention.   The organization operates the Florida Air Museum, which houses over  100 aircraft, and sponsors over $2 million per year in scholarships for  aviation education.   Madam Speaker, the skies over Lakeland will never be the same without  Billy Henderson, but they will be marked by his legacy for years to  come.                            ____________________
