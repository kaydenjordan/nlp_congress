 Madam President, earlier this week the Trump  administration and Speaker Pelosi reached an agreement to avoid a  government funding crisis and provide for our Armed Forces. In the  tough circumstances of divided government, they achieved the kind of  deal that our national defense actually needs. The 2-year funding  agreement will secure the resources we need to continue restoring the  readiness of our Armed Forces and modernizing them to meet the 21st- century challenges that face our country.   As I mentioned yesterday, I always find it curious when our  Democratic colleagues take the negotiating position that funding  critical Pentagon missions and providing for the common defense are  partisan Republican priorities. They act like only Republicans want a  modern, ready military, such that our spending on national defense  needs to be matched up with other spending in order to make it  palatable to Democrats.   In one sense, my Republican colleagues and I will probably say,  ``guilty as charged.'' Yes, we absolutely prioritize the national  defense and the U.S. military. Yes, we prioritize keeping Americans  safe. This is the fundamental obligation of the U.S. government.   Over the past 2\1/2\ years, it has been a Republican President who  has sought to reverse the previous 8 years of decline in defense. It  has been Republicans in Congress who prioritized rebuilding our  national defense after the Obama administration's neglect and atrophy.  Thanks to the Trump administration's tough negotiating, this deal will  secure a larger increase in defense funding than in nondefense programs  relative to current law. Better than parity for defense.   I doubt Members need any reminding about why these investments are so  critical, but if they do, every day's newspapers make the case loud and  clear. For years, our adversaries have methodically stepped up their  incursions and their aggressions. They want to chip away at the  peaceful, rules-based international order that American leadership has  helped to establish and preserve.   Between 2009 and 2018, the Chinese Communist Party increased its  military spending--listen to this--by 83  [[Page S5028]]  percent--83 percent. Talk about a buildup. The Chinese nearly doubled  their military spending in less than a decade. This is just the PRC's  publicly acknowledged funding.   These numbers have very real implications. When China gets a leg up  in terms of readiness or technology, they are able to hold a greater  number of U.S. and allied forces at risk. They are able to push their  air and maritime control further into the Indo-Pacific region,  increasing hegemonic control and effectively pushing the United States  and our allies back.   So the importance of this funding agreement is not simply our ability  to provide for the upkeep and regular maintenance on our military as it  currently exists. We are also talking about building the U.S. military  of the future--research, development, and modernization--so that our  Nation and our servicemembers are equipped to keep Americans safe and  project power as necessary for years and decades to come.    In my view, this grave responsibility should be a top, top priority  on both sides of the aisle, and this funding agreement will allow us to  get it done. I am proud that it will meet the pressing needs of  servicemembers stationed at installations around the country, like Ft.  Campbell, Ft. Knox, and the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky. The deal  will secure sorely needed investment in the national defense, and it  contains none of the far-left poison pills that House Democrats had  sought, like going backward on the issue of life or stripping away  rightful Presidential authorities. In divided government, that is what  we call a good deal. The Senate will vote on it before the end of next  week.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, first, the Senate  will confirm several more impressive nominations. We are currently  considering Stephen Dickson, of Georgia, to lead the Federal Aviation  Administration. After him, we will turn our attention to two district  court nominees. Wendy Williams Berger is the President's choice for the  U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. She is a two- time graduate of Florida State University, with nearly three decades of  courtroom experience, half of which has come on the bench.   Brian Buescher has been tapped for a vacancy in the District of  Nebraska, where he has spent nearly two decades practicing law.  Throughout his career, he has gained expertise in a wide array of legal  areas and has earned admiration within the Nebraska legal community and  beyond.   Those who know Mr. Buescher praise his ``intelligence, integrity,  professionalism, attentiveness, [and] character.'' The mayor of Omaha,  where he has spent his entire legal career said: ``Mr. Buescher would  be an impartial judge capable of setting aside personal opinion.''   Despite his objective qualifications and all this praise, our Senate  Democratic colleagues were not satisfied. Here was the bombshell that  offended some of our colleagues with respect to this nominee. Listen to  this. The nominee is a practicing Catholic.   My goodness, imagine that--in the United States of America, a person  of faith, serving in government. Really?   In particular, some of our Democratic colleagues raked him over the  coals in committee for his membership in the Knights of Columbus. It is  shocking that a nominee for Federal district court would be a member of  the Knights of Columbus.   Of course, we all know the Knights--a noted worldwide ``extremist  sect'' of Catholics, which is about 2 million men strong, known among  other things for their love of their Catholic faith, their unparalleled  commitment to charitable work, and for hosting barbecues and pancake  breakfasts.   Outrageous. I can't believe I need to repeat it in the U.S. Capitol,  but there is nothing about living out one's faith that is disqualifying  for public service--nothing. To the contrary, what the Constitution  does forbid is imposing any kind of religious test for public office.   It is the Democrats' opposition to this nominee's faith, not his  faith itself, that rubs against the grain of our Constitution.  Fortunately, this tactic didn't fly. Our colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee saw this tactic for what it is and voted to report Mr.  Buescher favorably to the floor. I will be proud to vote to confirm him  later today.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, the epidemic of  opioid and substance abuse has wreaked havoc throughout our country.  More than 2 million Americans suffer from opioid addiction. For years,  the situation only seemed to get worse and worse. Unfortunately, my  home State of Kentucky saw the pain firsthand. We are among the hardest  hit States by this crisis.   Last week, both Kentucky and the entire Nation received a glimmer of  long-awaited good news. Preliminary figures from the National Center  for Health Statistics show that last year, 2018, saw the first--the  first--nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths since 1990. For 28  straight years, overdose deaths climbed. But in 2018, that tragic  number finally dropped. It was approximately a 5-percent decline  nationwide.   In Kentucky, the Bluegrass State saw overdose deaths fall by nearly  15 percent last year, the largest drop in our State in more than a  decade. After years of working and waiting, we are finally seeing  progress in the fight to save lives. These numbers didn't happen on  their own. Our comprehensive response involves countless law  enforcement officers, medical professionals, educators, community  leaders, and family members and friends of those affected.   I am proud of that. Several times in recent years, this Senate has  done our part to bolster this fight with sweeping--sweeping--bipartisan  action. We passed wide-ranging legislation to backstop the work on the  frontlines with new programs, new funding for research, and new Federal  resources for the communities most in need.   Just last year, we passed another landmark bill to attack the crisis  of abuse from every single angle. Among its many features, the  legislation makes it harder to traffic illegal drugs across the border;  it supports mothers and babies struggling with opioid withdrawal; and  it even includes one of my provisions to help those in recovery find a  good job and stable housing as they work toward long-term recovery.   I am particularly proud of Kentucky's own role in leading in this  recovery. Researchers at the University of Kentucky received the  largest Federal grant in the school's history to fight opioid abuse all  across our State. I was pleased to help them secure these resources as  they aim to achieve a 40-percent reduction of opioid overdose deaths in  3 years.   In my hometown of Louisville, a private sector research facility  received FDA approval for a medicine to ease withdrawal symptoms. I  have worked to secure the inclusion of more Kentucky counties under the  High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program and increase coordination  among local, State, and Federal law enforcement on drug interdiction.   This tireless work by Kentuckians has helped write the headlines we  are celebrating today, but, of course, there is still much more to do.  We know this is not the end of the battle against addiction--not even  close--but it is encouraging to see the reduction in overdose deaths  across the country.   As majority leader, I will continue to fight to ensure Kentucky and  the Nation have the resources to build on this progress, prevent and  treat addiction, and ultimately save lives.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, yesterday, the  Democratic House of Representatives took a small step--small--to  denounce the scourge of anti-Semitism. They passed a symbolic  resolution opposing efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel and  condemn the BDS movement.   It is too bad all of this, of all things, couldn't have been a  unanimous vote. It is too bad that 16 Democrats voted against  condemning BDS. Sixteen Democrats voted against condemning BDS over in  the House yesterday.   It is regrettable that some of the Democrats who claim to represent  the  [[Page S5029]]  future of their party lobbied against the measure that should be  completely without controversy.   Even more broadly, I am sorry the bipartisan Senate-passed bill that  would actually do something about BDS--in other words, action, not mere  rhetoric--is still languishing over in the House without a vote,  bipartisan legislation that passed with the support of 77 Senators,  including my friend the Democratic leader--77 votes in the Senate,  thoroughly bipartisan, but the Democratic House has found a way to  fumble the ball.   Several months back, it took days of throat-clearing and a whole lot  of watering down before they could even halfway condemn anti-Semitic  remarks by one of their own Members. Now this symbolic BDS resolution  is held up as a major victory, while Senate-passed legislation that  would actually take action--actually do something against BDS--doesn't  even get a vote. They will not even give it a vote over there in the  House.   House Republicans have called for a vote on S. 1 over and over and  over again, but the Speaker of the House doesn't seem interested.   I understand that picking fights with the President seems to be a  higher priority across the Capitol than joining with the Senate to get  bipartisan legislation actually made into law, but surely taking action  to combat anti-Semitic efforts to delegitimize Israel shouldn't be too  much to ask.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr President, I ask unanimous consent that the veto  messages on S. J. Res. 36, 37, and 38 be considered as having been read  en bloc, that they be printed in the Record and spread in full upon the  Journal en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the veto  message with respect to S. J. Res. 36, S. J. Res. 37, and S. J. Res. 38  be considered at a time to be determined by the majority leader in  consultation with the Democratic leader prior to August 2; that they be  debated concurrently for up to 2 hours, with 15 minutes reserved for  the chairman and ranking member, respectively; that the Senate vote on  passage of the joint resolutions, the objections of the President to  the contrary notwithstanding, in the order listed; and, finally, that  the unanimous consent order of June 19 for the remaining joint  resolutions of disapproval of arms sales remain in effect.    Mr. President, I am sorry to note today the recent  passing of a dear friend to many and the ending of her quintessentially  American story.   On July 13, Mrs. Eva Yeh Chang of San Francisco died peacefully at  the age of 100. Eva was born in 1919 in Shanghai during a different era  for China. Though she was born into a well-to-do banking family, her  first three decades involved significant hardship: the Chinese Civil  War, the Japanese occupation in the late 1930s, the Second World War,  and the beginning of the Communist Revolution. That final event led Eva  and her husband, Fu-Yun Chang, a Harvard-educated diplomat, statesman,  and scholar, to leave their lives behind and depart for American  shores. They essentially started over in a new country with three young  children under the age of 10.   What followed was the kind of entrepreneurial ``start-up life'' that  would sound impossible in many other lands but has been the building  block of our Nation from the beginning. Eva worked multiple jobs, from  retail to waiting tables. Eventually, she saved enough to strike out on  her own. First she opened a diner. Then she started one of San  Francisco's early Northern Chinese restaurants--a big success--and then  came more investments in enterprise and real estate in the city.   Eva didn't just keep what she had built for herself. She put it into  service for others. Eva built a new life for her children. She became a  pillar of her community, and she used her resources to help a number of  her relatives back in China complete the same journey she had made and  follow in her footsteps to America.   This remarkable woman may have left us, but the positive effects of  her life continue to ripple out. For example, she lived to see her  daughter, Ambassador Julia Chang Bloch, become the first-ever Asian- American to serve as a U.S. Ambassador and continue the family legacy  of giving back to this Nation.   The Senate stands with the entire Chang family and all who mourn Eva  in this time of grief, and we stand with them in celebrating 100 years  so well lived.
