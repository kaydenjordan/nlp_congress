 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able  to complete my remarks in full before the vote.    Mr. President, 20 years ago, in the early, overcast  hours  [[Page S847]]  of March 19, 2003, American stealth bombers and Navy cruise missiles  hit Baghdad in the first strikes of the Iraq war.   When I think about that war today, I think about the costs--the costs  to the Iraqi people, who suffered so terribly, including the families  of the hundreds of thousands killed in the insurgency, and the  sectarian and ethnic violence that followed the U.S. invasion.   I think of the costs to the brave American servicemembers who  answered the call, who didn't ask whether it was right or wrong but  just answered the call--almost 5,000 who made the ultimate sacrifice-- and to the tens of thousands more who were wounded; to the countless  sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, friends and loved ones who had  to grieve those they lost and care for those who came home wounded,  with scars both visible and invisible, changed by combat forever.   I think about the financial costs--almost $2 trillion that could have  gone to rebuilding America's infrastructure, caring for America's sick  and aging, and educating our next generation.   I also think about the costs of something very close to my heart,  which is the cause of freedom and the fight for democratic values.   Our Nation's democracy, as Ronald Reagan said, was a shining city on  a hill, an example to the world of something to aspire to; but the Iraq  war undermined our credibility with our partners and allies, with our  enemies, and with millions of American citizens who were against it.  For too many around the world, the Iraq war made a mockery of U.S.  support for democracy and freedom.   Today, I proudly remember my vote on the floor of the House of  Representatives back in 2002. Life in America was tense in the wake of  9/11. Everything we stood for had been attacked on our own soil--just  miles from where I still live. Those of us who resisted the march to  war were called naive or worse, but some of us knew what we had to do.  We felt the weight of history on our shoulders, and we voted against  the war.   I spent a lot of time in reviewing the documents that were available  to Members of the House. I saw no clear and present danger, no imminent  threat, and, above all, no evidence of weapons of mass destruction. And  I understand. If the cause is right and America needs it, I will send  my son and daughter; but if the cause is not right, I won't send my son  and daughter nor will I vote to send anyone else's sons and daughters  into harm's way.   Two decades later, we have the chance to make history again but, this  time, for the better. We have the chance to repeal the 1991 and 2002  AUMFs and honor the legacy of those who fought and those we lost--to  end a war we are no longer waging; to exercise Congress's war powers-- the most solemn duty of this body--because Saddam Hussein has been dead  for 20 years and his regime is gone; because the Iraq of 2023 is,  obviously, not the Iraq of 2003; because Kuwait has been a secure,  sovereign, and committed U.S. partner for over three decades; and  because the threats that these authorizations address no longer exist.   The United States is no longer an occupying force. Iraq is now a  strategic partner. It is time to confront the challenges of the region  and of the world together. Repealing these authorizations is an  important step forward. It removes an irritant in the bilateral  relationship, and it cements our partnership. It helps Iraq move  forward, independent and more integrated with its Arab neighbors.   So, Mr. President, I come to the floor today to support, in the  strongest terms possible, the repeal of the 1991 and 2002  authorizations for use of military force against Iraq once and for all.   Let's mark the 20th anniversary this week of the Iraq war by paying  tribute to the Iraqis who have suffered, to the Americans we lost, and  to the American families who have provided unconditional support for  those who have served every day for the last 20 years.   We will never forget the sacrifices they made in defense of the  values we hold most dear. Let's honor those values by doing what  Congress is supposed to do. When there is a need, it declares war, and  when that is over, it is time to end the declaration and the  authorization. That is what we have the power to do today.   With that, I yield the floor.                          Vote on Motion to Proceed     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.      Hon. Robert Menendez,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                    Greece--Assault Amphibious Vehicles         The Government of Greece has requested to buy sixty-three       (63) Assault Amphibious Vehicles, Personnel Variant (AAVP-      7A1), nine (9) Assault Amphibious Vehicles, Command Variant       (AAVC-7A1), four (4) Assault Amphibious Vehicles, Recovery       Variant (AAVR-7A1), and sixty-three (63) 50-Caliber Machine       Guns (Heavy Barrel).

The estimated total cost is $268 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the security of a NATO ally, which is an important       partner for political stability and economic progress in       Europe.        This proposed sale will improve Greece's capability to meet       current and future threats by providing an effective       capability to protect maritime interests and infrastructure       in support of its strategic location on NATO's southern       flank. Greece contributes to NATO operations, as well as to       counterterrorism and counter-piracy maritime efforts. Greece       will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        There is not a principal contractor associated with this       potential sale. Consequently, there are no known offset       agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.         Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of U.S. Government personnel, but will require one       (1) contractor representative, Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)       position to Greece to deliver Assault Amphibious Vehicles,       related equipment and support.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-12       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The mission of the Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) is       to maneuver surface assault elements of the landing force and       their equipment from assault shipping during amphibious       operations to inland objectives and to conduct mechanized       operations and related combat support in subsequent       operations ashore.        The AAV-7A1 Family of Vehicles includes the Personnel       variant which carries troops in amphibious operations from       ship to shore, through the surf zone and to inland       objectives. The AAVP-7A1 provides protected transport for up       to 25 combat-loaded personnel through all types of terrain.       The Command Variant, AAVC-7A1, is an armored assault       amphibious full-tracked landing vehicle. The vehicle provides       a mobile task force communication center in amphibious       operations from ship to shore through the surf zone to inland       objectives. The Recovery Variant, AAVR-7A1, is an armored       assault amphibious full-tracked vehicle. The vehicle is       designed to recover similar or smaller sized vehicles. It       also carries basic maintenance equipment to provide field       support maintenance to vehicles in the field.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce system effectiveness or       be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Greece can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Greece.
