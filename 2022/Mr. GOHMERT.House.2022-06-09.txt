 Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Rutherford), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. I  know my friend mentioned he had been a sheriff. He has great expertise  in knowing what he is talking about, and I appreciate his insights as a  lawman.   Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure and honor to yield to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Arrington), ambassador from Texas Tech University,  where their slogan is ``Guns Up,'' not because they are violent, but I  have always taken it to mean they were ready to preserve and protect if  the need arose.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the wise observations of my  friend from Texas. I couldn't have asked for a better lead-in to the  thoughts that I have on this very issue. Mr. Arrington had some great  insights.   I have an article here from, of all things, ABC News. Above the name  of the author, Bill Hutchinson, is a quote from a police official  saying: ``It is worse than a war zone around here lately.''   The article says: ``At least 12 major U.S. cities have broken annual  homicide records in 2021--and there is still 3 weeks to go in the  year.'' This is from December 8, 2021. This article became more  relevant because of the horrors that occurred in Uvalde.   Another quote, from Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney: ``It is terrible  to every morning get up and have to go look at the numbers and then  look at the news and see the stories. It is just crazy. It is just  crazy, and this needs to stop.'' He said that after the city surpassed  its annual homicide record of 500, which had stood since 1990.   ``Philadelphia, a city of roughly 1.5 million people, has had more  homicides this year''--this is 2021--``(521 as of December 6) than the  Nation's two largest cities, New York (443 as of December 5) and Los  Angeles (352 as of November 27). That is an increase of 13 percent from  2020, a year that nearly broke the 1990 record.''   The article goes on and talks about all these shootings in our major  cities. In fact, these aren't considered mass shootings. They don't  meet that definition as commonly used.   From worldpopulationreview.com, the top 10 cities in the United  States with the highest murder rates--and that is murders per 100,000  people--number one is St. Louis; number two, Baltimore; number three,  New Orleans; number four, Detroit; number five, Cleveland; number six,  Las Vegas; number seven, Kansas City; number eight, Memphis; number  nine, Newark; and number 10, Chicago.   Now, all of those cities have Democrat mayors. Las Vegas has an  independent who was a Democrat until 2009 when he announced now being  an Independent.   We also, in 2021, had 16 cities hit record-high homicide rates.  Again, rates normally are calculated in murders per 100,000 people.  Rochester, New York, had 80. Philadelphia had 524. Louisville,  Kentucky, had 179. Baton Rouge had 115. That was an unofficial number  but, apparently, accurate or close to accurate. Austin had 88.  Indianapolis had 258. St. Paul had 35. Portland, Oregon, had 84.  Albuquerque had 107. Tucson had 92. Columbus had 179. Jackson,  Mississippi, had 129. Atlanta, Georgia, had 150. New Haven,  Connecticut, had 25, which is a tremendous number for a small city.  Macon, Georgia, had 52. Milwaukee had 190.   Additional cities with high homicide rates, naturally, Chicago had  797 homicides in 1 year, yet Mayor Lightfoot, prominent Democrat that  she is, doesn't want to get to the root causes of that.                                time  1215    Black lives matter. There is absolutely an inordinate number of Black  lives that are taken in these Democrat-controlled cities.   New York, New York had 481. It is just tragic what has gone on. So  what is different? We have had guns in America. In fact, not only have  we had them from our founding, if it were not for guns in America we  would not have had a founding, starting perhaps with Lexington Green.   People in America had guns and they defended themselves and they  defended their liberty. That is how we came to have what I believe is  the greatest country in the history of the world. I know there are a  lot of schools that are teaching how terrible this country is, but I  hear over and over from people that come here to the United States from  other countries, and they say: You have got to protect your freedom  because if you lose your liberty, your freedom here in America, there  will be nowhere else in the world anyone can go to be free.   Historically, countries don't go fight for other people's freedom,  yet, this country has. We fought the bloodiest war with the biggest  loss of life here on our own soil for the freedom of people who were  slaves. Yes, I know States' rights were a big part, but let's face it,  slavery was at the bottom of it all.   Countries don't do that. This one did. You even had the Founders do  something that Founders don't do historically. They condemned  themselves in their own founding documents by saying all men are  created equal, they are endowed by their creator with certain  inalienable rights.   Thomas Jefferson himself put the grievance in the declaration. There  was disagreement on it. Here he was a slave owner, yet, the most  offensive, longest paragraph of the grievances was because King George  had allowed slavery to ever start. The problem, or the wrong, that was  being done through that institution, it was wrong. Yes, I know it has  always been here on Earth.   As I understand, there may be 40 million or more people in slavery  right now today in our modern world, but it doesn't make it right  anywhere and it needs to stop. This country had people who were  Founders that condemned themselves by putting that language in there  because they knew what was right.   This is an unusual country. I know Solomon's Israel was an absolutely  amazing place, supposedly the wisest man to ever live. Of course, he  had so many wives and that creates problems. More opportunities. More  liberty here than anywhere. Yet, we have spent the week hearing over  and over about the need for gun control.   The first time I was asked if I supported gun control years ago, I  said: Well, of course I do. We were taught in the Army that the most  effective gun control back then was--I believe there were eight steady  hold factors--which was the best way to control your gun while firing-- the steady hold factors were taught.   They don't teach that in the Army anymore, as I understand it. Kids  have grown up around guns in America and we didn't have mass shootings.  There is something going on here. I know I was condemned roundly this  week, yesterday, talking about--we had friends across the aisle who  made clear they didn't want to hear any more about prayer. They wanted  to do something. They didn't seem to care if it was wrong. They wanted  to do something.   Well, John Lott, Jr., had this article on May 26 in Newsweek. I am  just touching on certain parts.   He said: ``Just as with so many of these attackers''--talking about  the shooter in Uvalde--``the man who attacked Robb Elementary School  picked  [[Page H5436]]  a place where people were banned from carrying concealed handguns. For  example, the perpetrator of the Buffalo shooting from a couple of weeks  ago wrote in his manifesto: `Areas where' carrying with a concealed  weapon `are outlawed or prohibited may be good areas of attack.' ''   He put that in the manifesto in case people just were too dense to  understand that it draws shooters if they know they have got soft  targets.   John Lott says: ``Teachers and staff can carry concealed handguns in  about 30 percent of Texas school districts, so we don't need to guess  how the policy would work. Nineteen other States also allow concealed  carry in schools. Since the year 2000, there has yet to be a single  case of someone being wounded or killed from a shooting, let alone a  mass public shooting, between 6 a.m. and midnight at a school that lets  teachers carry guns.   ``While there have not been any problems with armed teachers, the  number of people killed at schools without concealed carry has  increased significantly over the course of the last decade.   ``Biden's speech Tuesday night contained one misleading or false  statement after another. Instead of trying to bring the country  together, it politicized the attack. When mentioning the Sandy Hook,  Parkland, Santa Fe, and Oxford school shootings, Biden claimed that  there were 900 instances of gunfire at schools over the last 10 years.  But someone committing suicide in a car parking lot at 2 a.m., two  gangs fighting over drug turf in a parking lot after school hours, and  an accidental discharge in a firearms training class are not remotely  similar to the sort of shooting that happened Tuesday. Even including  lone suicides, accidental discharges, including those by police, and  gang fights, the number--as compiled by my organization, the Crime  Prevention Research Center, is about half of what Biden claims it is:  470.   ``Since 1998, there have been a total of nine attacks similar to the  Robb Elementary School shooting. Nine is nine too many. But once you  adjust for population, there are many other countries, from Germany to  Russia to Finland, that have comparable rates of school shootings.   ``Biden says that we need commonsense gun laws, but what he proposes  simply will not help. He doesn't seem to realize that over 92 percent  of violent crime in America has nothing to do with guns. Focusing on  so-called `assault weapons' is not only not going to stop mass public  shootings, but it won't make a difference in reducing murders at large.    Madam Speaker, one murder is too many.   ``Only a small share of murders are committed with rifles, let alone  `assault rifles,' and that share has grown even smaller over time. The  percentage of firearm murders committed with rifles was 4.8 percent  prior to the Federal `assault weapons' ban that took effect in  September 1994.   ``When the ban was in effect, from 1995 to 2004, the figure stood at  4.9 percent.'' Up a tenth of a percent with the so-called assault  weapons ban in effect. ``And since 2004, it's been even lower. Based on  these numbers, it's hard to argue that the ban did anything at all.   `` `When we passed the assault weapons ban, mass shootings went down.  When the law expired, mass shootings tripled,' Biden claimed. In fact,  there was no drop in the number of attacks with `assault weapons,' and  virtually no change in total mass shootings, during the 1994 to 2004  ban.''   We know from the rules of the House--I can't say anybody lied,  including the President, but whoever is putting those words in his  teleprompter sure was because that just didn't happen, it  misrepresented the truth--I am sure not intentionally.   ``Biden asked Americans why people need `assault weapons' to hunt  deer. But, in reality, many so-called `assault weapons' are nothing  more than small-game hunting rifles. The AR-15 platform has just been  made to cosmetically resemble a military-grade weapon.''   For people that know weapons, it fires a .223 round. It is just 3/ 1000ths bigger around than a .22.   We were taught in military science--and I had an Army scholarship at  Texas A&M--that Vietnam had gone to the M-16, now the M-4, same basic  gun. It fires the same size round--or in the metric system, 556. We  were taught that, gee, it is a higher speed, but the rounds are lighter  weight, therefore, our military can carry more of them. We were also  taught it certainly is not more lethal than what was being used before  with the 7.62 round.   John Lott says, ``The Uvalde tragedy will inevitably lead to a push  for so-called `red flag' laws or extreme risk protection orders. You  would never know this from the media coverage, but the Federal  Government and every State already have laws on the books that deal  with people who are a danger to themselves or to others. These laws are  commonly known as `Baker Act' statutes, though they go by different  names in different States. They typically allow police, doctors, and  family members to have someone held for a mental health examination  based upon a simple reasonableness test--effectively amounting to an  educated guess.''   Further down: ``When faced with legal bills that can easily amount to  $10,000 for a hearing, few people find that it makes sense to fight  `red flag' laws just to keep their guns. Judges will thus initially  confiscate a person's gun on the basis of a written complaint and  `reasonable suspicion.' When hearings take place weeks later, courts  overturn a third of the initial orders. But since few defendants have  legal representation, the actual error rate is undoubtedly much higher.   ``When people pose a clear danger to themselves or to others, they  should be confined to a mental health facility. If someone is really  suicidal, simply taking away his gun won't solve the problem anyway. If  anything, `red flag' laws harm people who need genuine help; absent  such laws, a person contemplating suicide might speak to a friend or  family member and be dissuaded from that tragic course of action.   ``It is well past time that we address these mass public shootings.  But let's come up with proposals that matter--starting with eliminating  `gun-free zones'.''                                time  1230    It also is worth noting, although some say assault weapon bans would  reduce mass shootings and they think an assault weapon would be an  automatic weapon--you hear that over and over, Madam Speaker. Actually,  automatic weapons are already illegal and unavailable to the general  public. Assault weapons are only available to the military. Though you  have people who are vying for gigs on CNN or MSNBC who may say  otherwise, but people who actually are not don't have an ulterior  motive. They know an AR-15 is most often used as a defensive weapon.   I have heard why more people like an AR-15 with such a small round as  a defensive weapon at home is people who don't fire weapons often end  up twitching before the gun is fired which is extremely harmful to the  accuracy. The AR-15, because the round is so small, it doesn't have  much of a kick at all, and so people who are not used to using guns  actually can be more accurate and find it more helpful.   We have people here saying that you shouldn't have more than five  rounds. Yet, if you have multiple people coming into your home  threatening your family, Madam Speaker, and they will each have guns  most likely, then you need that.   Of course, I had a guy last time, some years back, when there was  talk by Democrats about eliminating or making illegal multiple rounds  in a magazine, and I had a guy over in the Rayburn Building who told  me, I know you all are looking at banning multiple rounds in magazines.  I am from Georgia. We don't want that because we find that, generally  speaking, it takes over 50 rounds to bring down a drone.   I thought he was kidding, but he didn't smile. So that was news to  me. That is the only time I have heard that request for multiple rounds  in a magazine.   But the ``Updated Assessment of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban:  Impacts on Gun Markets and Gun Violence, 1994 to 2003,'' the Department  of Justice concluded this: ``Should it be renewed, the ban's effects on  gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for  reliable measurement. Assault weapons were rarely used in gun crimes  even before the ban.''  [[Page H5437]]    According to recent data from the FBI between 2015 and 2019, you were  twice as likely to be killed by hands or feet than you are to be killed  by a rifle.   That is really amazing and shocking.   Our society, if you go back to a Supreme Court case in the late  1800s, they reviewed pages and pages of evidence and said that they  didn't think there was any question that the United States was a  Christian nation--not that everybody in the United States was a  Christian, of course not, never has been. But that Christian and Judeo- Christian principles had a major effect on our founding and on the  country up through those times.   I would agree with President Obama when he said we are not a  Christian nation. I think the Supreme Court was right back in the late  1800s, and I think President Obama was right when he said that we are  not now.   So what is the answer?   What is amazing to me is we have people deeply concerned--and I have  friends across the aisle, I know their heart, and I know how  desperately concerned they are about these shootings, and they want to  stop them.   But if you look at the data, Madam Speaker, and you look at the cold,  hard facts, the number one State in the Nation for gun control laws is  California.   This article is from AWR Hawkins from June 5, 2022:   ``An FBI report on active shooter incidents in 2021 shows that  California was the number one State for such incidents, with six  incidents total.   California is also number one for gun law strength, the Mike  Bloomberg-affiliated Everytown for Gun Safety noted.   According to the FBI, there were 61 `active shooter incidents' across  the country in 2021 and 12 of the incidents met the definition `of mass  killing'.''   Madam Speaker, California--where our Speaker is from--led the Nation  with six of those 12 active shooter incidents:         California has universal background checks, an assault       weapons ban, a high-capacity magazine ban, a 10-day waiting       period on gun purchases, they have got the red flag laws, gun       registration requirements, good cause requirements for       concealed carry, a ban on carrying a gun on a college campus       for self-defense, a ban on K-12 teachers being armed on       campus, a background check requirement for ammunition       purchases, and a limit on the number of guns a law-abiding       citizen can purchase in a given month, among other controls.        Additionally, ammunition purchases are only allowed if made       through a State-approved vendor.    Yet, as a friend mentioned at the beginning of our hour here, Madam  Speaker, you have got more shootings in Mexico.   As this article from ``American Wire'' by Melissa Fine indicates  that: ``According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, retailer  surveys revealed a 58 percent increase in gun sales to African  Americans, a 49 percent increase among Hispanic Americans, and firearm  sales to Asian Americans jumped by 43 percent.''   According to this article there is a guy named Juan Ramireo, who  immigrated from Mexico as a teenager, said: ``As a Mexican immigrant, I  feel that people are waking up.''   Ramireo, who legally immigrated to the United States when he was 13,  said, The Second Amendment is a large reason why people feel safer here  in the U.S. and in their homes at night. He said that as a kid--of  course, living in Mexico--he knew what it was like to feel helpless.  Nobody wants that feeling.   He said, ``I saw my mom and grandmother go through several struggles  and feelings of fear in our small Mexican town. It was difficult. But  after moving here to the U.S., it's a new world. I go to bed with no  worry about defending myself and my family.''   That is because he and his family have guns.   So what makes a difference?   We heard in our hearing in the Judiciary Committee from some  Democrats that they didn't want to attribute any effect to social  media. They didn't want us to attribute any effect to violent video  games or to Hollywood or to mental illness or to godlessness or to  fatherlessness or to drug use.    Yet we need to talk about these things. We really need to talk about  these things.   We were told that they didn't want to hear anything more about  prayers. And I know some media has made a big deal of that. But the  fact is before prayers were eliminated in schools we didn't have the  kind of mass shootings we do today.   I read a quote from a man named A.A. Hodge who was the principal of  the Princeton Seminary and a professor of systematic theology back  before the turn of the century of 1900. In fact, it was a few months  before his death in 1886. Jim Garlow had quoted Reverend Hodge.   He warned a few months before his death, ``I am as sure as I am of  the fact of Christ's reign that a comprehensive and centralized system  of national education, separated from religion, as is now commonly  proposed, will prove the most appalling enginery for the propagation of  anti-Christian and atheistic unbelief, and of anti-social nihilistic  ethics, individual, social and political, which this sin-rent world has  ever seen.''   George Orwell commented, ``Sometimes the first duty of intelligent  men is the restatement of the obvious.'' He said, ``The further a  society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak  it.''   I am getting a lot of hate.   ``The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate  their own understanding of their history.''   We are getting a lot of that in this country: eliminate our history,  lie about our history, and tear down our history and our statues.   When the truth is you learn from good history and you learn from bad  history, Madam Speaker, and if you don't get all of it or you get  inaccurate history, you don't learn anything accurate.   Orwell said, ``Free speech is my right to say what you don't want to  hear.''   He said, ``In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a  revolutionary act.''   But as he talked about history and the ministry of truth that rewrote  history every day like a disinformation board, he said, ``The past was  erased, the erasure forgotten, and the lie became the truth.''   We have seen a lot of that and not from Republicans.   Orwell said, ``So much of left-wing thought is a kind of playing with  fire by people who don't even know that fire is hot.''   He said, ``Threats to freedom of speech, writing and action, though  often trivial in isolation, are cumulative in their effect and, unless  checked, lead to a general disrespect for the rights of the citizen.''   He said, ``Whoever controls the image and information of the past  determines what and how future generations will think; whoever controls  the information and images of the present determines how those same  people will view the past.   ``He who controls the past commands the future. He who commands the  future conquers the past.''   Orwell defined journalism as ``printing what someone else does not  want printed. Everything else is public relations.''                                time  1245    We have got a lot of public relations in this town.   From the Gulag Archipelago, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had an interesting  quote. He said, ``Remember Lenin's words: `An oppressed class which did  not aspire to possess arms and learn how to handle them would deserve  only to be treated as slaves.' ''   That is Lenin. And the system he created in the Soviet Union resulted  in the second most murders by a government in the history of the world,  second only to Mao Tse Tung in China.   Whitaker Chambers--I waited too many years to read his book, Witness.  But he says--because he did a lot of analysis. He was an atheist. He  had had a troubled family life and loved the idea of communism; but  eventually saw what communism really was and decided he didn't want any  of it; eventually became a Christian.   But he said: `` . . . the moment man indulged his freedom to the  point where he was also free from God, it led him into tragedy, evil  and often the exact opposite of what he had intended. In human terms,  there was no solution for the problem of evil.''   He said: `` . . . the crisis of the Western world exists to the  degree it is indifferent to God. It exists to the degree  [[Page H5438]]  in which the Western world actually shares communism's materialist  vision, is so dazzled by the logic of the materialist interpretation of  history, politics, and economics, that it fails to grasp that, for it,  the only possible answer to the Communist challenge is to choose either  faith in God or faith in man.''   Well, what Lenin had to say about that issue, he said, ``Every  religious idea of God, even flirting with the idea of God, is  unutterable vileness.'' And that came after Dostoyevsky analyzed what  this crazy guy named Marx had to say. And Dostoyevsky took great issue  with it. And at one point, he said: ``The problem''--Dostoyevsky--``The  problem of communism is not an economic problem.'' Of course, some of  us know it is an economic problem. But his point is it is not the  biggest problem.   He said, ``The problem of communism is the problem of atheism.''   And back during the summer I was an exchange student to the real  Soviet Union in the seventies, it was nauseating to walk into a church,  and where you would have seen a gorgeous stained glass window of  Jesus--I remember one came in, and I have seen a picture depicting  Jesus surrounded by the children where he--the quote was: ``Suffer the  little children to come unto me,'' except it was Lenin sitting there  with the children around him. They had destroyed the stained glass  window of Jesus and had Lenin; which goes back to what Dostoyevsky had  to say, the problem of communism, socialism, progressivism, the big  problem is ultimately government has got to be God; and that doesn't  work out well.   Natan Sharansky, an amazing man, he said: ``A lack of moral clarity .  . . is why people living in free societies cannot distinguish between  religious fundamentalists in democratic states and religious terrorists  in fundamentalist states. That is why people living in free societies  can come to see their fellow citizens as their enemy and foreign  dictators as their friends.'' A lack of moral clarity. And that is not  being taught in too many of our schools.   Ronald Reagan told the Alabama Legislature in 1982: ``To those who  cite the First Amendment as reason for excluding God from more and more  of our institutions and everyday life, may I just say: The First  Amendment of the Constitution was not written to protect the people of  this country from religious values; it was written to protect religious  values from government tyranny.''   John Adams said, ``The general principles on which the Fathers  achieved independence were the general principles of Christianity.'' He  wrote this to Thomas Jefferson toward the end of his life.   Adams said, ``I will avow, that I then believed, and now believe,  that those general principles of Christianity are as eternal and  immutable, as the existence and attributes of God.''   And I have gotten mail before saying, How dare you bring these things  up on the House floor? Because people are not taught our history. The  fact is, the Bible has been quoted more times--many, many times more  than any other book throughout our history, but it is quoted less and  less these days. We have got our work cut out for us.   But it appears the Supreme Court is starting to understand, for them  to become oligarchs, monarchs, and rule from Mt. Olympus across the  street here, is not the best way to decide things better left for the  legislature, after a great debate. And that is what we need to do.   And we really need to look at what is different now than when we  didn't have mass shootings like we do now. And I think we will come to  the things that Natan Sharansky, Whitaker Chambers, Dostoyevsky, John  Adams, Ronald Reagan, and so many of our founders understood.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
