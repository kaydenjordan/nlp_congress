 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and share  the inspirational story of native New Mexican Ms. Stella Lavadie, who  celebrated her 100th birthday on April 29, 2021. Her friends, family,  and neighbors know Stella as a warm-hearted woman who celebrates her  veteran community with great pride and has lived a remarkable and  impactful life. A member of the ``greatest generation,'' Stella was  born in 1921 in Taos, and while she grew up partially in Wyoming, she  returned to New Mexico as a young adult to attend my alma mater, New  Mexico Highlands University. In a pivotal moment, Stella recalls seeing  Uncle Sam on signs in Albuquerque beckoning her: ``I want you!'' they  said, and she answered the call. Stella enlisted for the Women's Army  Corps in 1944 at the Bruns Army Hospital in Santa Fe and trained at  Fort Des Moines. Taking great pride in her fatigues and dress uniform,  Stella completed duty stations in Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and  South Dakota. Stella completed her service in 1946 when the war was  won, but she has said she would gladly have stayed in the Women's Army  Corps if given the chance.   Throughout her life, Stella has carried with her meaningful memories  from her service, including fellow Women Army Corps member Ruby Hart  singing ``Till we meet again'' and marching in formation every Saturday  morning in front of the ranking officers. Upon returning home to New  Mexico, Stella continued her Federal service working at the University  of California in Los Alamos, then at the Atomic Energy Commission also  in Los Alamos, before rounding out her career with a combined 32 years  at the Bureau of Land Management doing essential work contributing to  the management of New Mexico's Federal lands. She raised three children  as a single mother in the 1950s, due to her husband's early death, and  built a beautiful family in her own home State of New Mexico.   I want to personally wish Stella a happy 100th birthday and thank her  for her service and barrier-breaking accomplishments. In 2015, I had  the pleasure of greeting Stella on her visit to D.C. on Honor Flight  No. 0615, and I was honored to celebrate her birthday in a drive-by  celebration this year.   Stella, thank you for your service, and it is an honor to play a  small part in your story.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and share  the inspirational story of native New Mexican Mr. Bennie Montoya, who  will celebrate his 100th birthday on August 20, 2021. Bennie is a  member of the ``greatest generation,'' and his heroism and courage- filled life are an inspiration to us all.   Bennie was raised near Santa Fe in the Village of Agua Fria as the  youngest of six siblings. After finishing the ninth grade at Harrington  Junior High in Santa Fe, Bennie left school to help his family on their  ranch, until he was drafted in August 1942. Bennie trained at Fort  Bliss in El Paso, TX, prior to shipping out for Normandy to serve his  country at one of the most significant battle sites in U.S. military  history. At 23 years old, Private First Class Montoya landed in  Normandy 6 days after D-day, and to this day, he recalls the bloodied  waters and fallen soldiers from the momentous battle.   During the war, he worked as a switchboard operator and also had the  responsibility of driving his commanding officer from post to post. On  December 17, 1944, when Private First Class Montoya volunteered to  drive a senior military officer to the next post, he was ambushed by  German soldiers and taken prisoner. As a prisoner of war, Bennie was  forced to dig graves for Nazi soldiers who were killed in action. He  was often made to do hard labor in the freezing snow with no shoes and  suffered frostbite while under their abuse.   Private First Class Montoya was finally liberated in 1945 and sent to  a POW rehabilitation and recovery center in Santa Barbara, CA.  Honorably discharged, Bennie made his way back to New Mexico  unbeknownst to his family. The story of his homecoming speaks to the  power of prayer and the bond between family members. His mother, as  told by others with her on that day, kept a prayer card to St. Anthony,  the patron saint of lost people and things in her pocket. As she was  cooking and praying, she was overcome with emotion. What followed was  nothing less than a joyous reunion: Bennie's mother stepped outside to  collect herself and continued praying, and when she looked up and gazed  across the fields, she saw Bennie walking towards her, duffel bag in  tow.   Bennie has lived a full and meaningful life since his time in the  Army. Upon his honorable discharge, he was awarded several medals,  including a Purple Heart. He raised four children in Agua Fria with his  wife, Mary, before losing her to a drunk driver. Professionally, Bennie  worked in the local banking industry for 27 years. He still lives in  Agua Fria, where he is an upstanding and highly regarded member  [[Page S2412]]  of his community, and attends mass at San Isidro Catholic Church.   I want to personally wish Bennie the happiest of birthdays as he  prepares to celebrate 100 years and thank him for his service and  sacrifice during World War II.   Bennie, your service will never be forgotten, and I am forever  grateful for your role in fighting for our freedom.                            ____________________
