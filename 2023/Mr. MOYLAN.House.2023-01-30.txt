 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to remember  and honor twin sisters Katrina and Leslie. Their story is one of  tragedy, as they both are resting with our maker in heaven. Their  memories have and shall continue to be shared with their loved ones.   Katrina and Leslie were born with disabilities. As they were growing  up, they required a caretaker to address their basic needs.   These twins were loveable and stole the hearts of those they met.  Katrina and Leslie were also emotionally strong. They wanted to be  raised like other kids but knew that their conditions were permanent  and they wouldn't be able to participate in sports, attend a prom, or  get a job.   They accepted the reality of their life, but they knew they had each  other, and they had a loving family. The two were living in the State  of Pennsylvania and received Supplemental Security Income, SSI,  benefits that helped their caretaker purchase necessities.   Unfortunately, their caretaker, who was their mother, passed away  unexpectedly. Leslie and Katrina once again found themselves enduring  another unbearable hardship. Because of their conditions and the  undertaking it would require to care for not one but two disabled  individuals, the sisters were separated.    Leslie stayed in the State of Pennsylvania and continued to receive  SSI benefits. Katrina was taken in by her  [[Page H494]]  mom's sister, who is married to my childhood friend, Dr. John Fegurgur.  The couple brought her to Guam, and within 30 days of leaving  Pennsylvania, Katrina lost her SSI benefits.   Why, you may ask?   Because of a Federal inequity which denies American citizens who  reside in most territories the rights to secure SSI benefits. This  Federal law strips away the financial benefits from American citizens  with disabilities who relocate from a State to Guam, American Samoa,  the Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico.   We need to change this inequity. Why are U.S. citizens who reside in  U.S. territories denied benefits they can attain if they were residing  in a State?   This is a real case of unfairness.   Did you know that Guam has among the highest per capita numbers of  enlisted members in the United States armed services throughout the  Nation?   Yes, we, too, are proud Americans.   There have been lawsuits to fix this inequity, and the courts have  simply ruled that SSI benefits were created by Congress and, hence, can  be changed by Congress. So let's change it and do what is right.   Katrina and Leslie are both no longer with us in the world today. In  Leslie's final days, she said she sadly wouldn't be able to witness  when this wrong would be made right.   While neither sister may be here, let us fix this inequity in their  names and the names of many others who have been denied this benefit  just because they reside in a U.S. territory.                            ____________________
