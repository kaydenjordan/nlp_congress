 Mr. President, today I rise to honor and pay tribute  to Senate Historian Betty Koed who is retiring this week after 25 years  of service to the U.S. Senate. Betty is only the third person--and the  first woman--to hold the position of Senate Historian, and our entire  institution has benefited from her knowledge and expertise.   Betty has seen it all. She not only knows what is behind every door  in this building, she also knows the stories behind so many important  decisions that have been made in this Chamber over the years. She has  been an invaluable resource who has dedicated her career to  safeguarding the history that surrounds us and ensuring that it endures  for generations to come. She has spent the past 25 years preserving,  protecting, and promoting the history of the Senate and its Members,  turning the records on our institution into stories for all Americans  to experience both here at the Capitol and online.   Betty also provided critical support last Congress when I joined with  former Senator Roy Blunt to pass a bipartisan resolution to dedicate  the first two rooms in the Senate wing of the Capitol to women in  recognition of former Senators Margaret Chase Smith of Maine and  Barbara Mikulski of Maryland.   To commemorate her decades of esteemed service, this week, my  colleagues and I joined together to unanimously pass a resolution led  by Leader Schumer and Leader McConnell to designate Betty as the first  ever Historian Emerita of the U.S. Senate. I thank her for her  dedication and service to this institution and to our democracy, and I  wish her all the best in her retirement.

A lifelong resident of Granite Falls, Dave loved his  neighbors and gave so much to his city that he became known as ``Mr.  Granite Falls.'' During his entire 44-year career in public service,  which began with an appointment to the city council at age 26, Dave  always made time for his neighbors and would stay late after city  council meetings to share his vast knowledge of the region's history  and tell stories about Granite Falls.   I had the pleasure of visiting Mayor Smiglewsi and other local  leaders in Granite Falls earlier this year. We had productive  discussions about our shared vision for bringing broadband to rural  Minnesota, investing in Granite Falls' public schools, and  strengthening the city's economy. What I remember most fondly from my  visit, however, happened after our meeting, when Dave opened up the  historic Andrew J. Volstead House and gave me a tour.   Dave always looked out for the people of Granite Falls, but he loved  his family most of all. He and Cindy, his wife of 40 years, raised  three children and had three grandchildren who kept them busy with  sporting events, music concerts, and dance recitals. Throughout his  decades of public service, Dave cherished his time with his family and  made every effort to be with them.   That was Dave: a beloved mayor, a local historian, and, most of all,  a loving husband, father, and grandfather. Today, my heart is with all  those who knew and loved Smig.                            ____________________
