 Mr. President, I was absent when the Senate voted  on the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 608.   On this vote, had I been present, I would have voted nay on the  motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 608.   (At the request of Mr. Durbin, the following statement was ordered to  be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
