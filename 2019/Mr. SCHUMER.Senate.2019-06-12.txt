 Mr. President, let me thank my dear friend, the senior  Senator from Illinois, for the passion, persistence, and intelligence  he shows on behalf of the Dreamers, who simply want to be Americans,  who have shown their part of the American dream, and whom we are truly  blocking from achieving their dream--which is the American dream.   Thank you.
