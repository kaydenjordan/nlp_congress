 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Gosar of the  Western Caucus for arranging this Special Order tonight and especially  for his exemplary leadership as chairman of the Western Caucus.   The wildfire crisis facing our forests across the West comes down to  a very simple adage. Excess timber comes out of the forest one way or  the other. It is either carried out or it burns out, but it comes out.   When we carried out our excess timber, we had healthy resilient  forests and we had thriving, prosperous communities. Excess timber  sales from Federal lands not only generated revenues for our mountain  communities, but created thousands of job.   But in the 1970s, we adopted laws like the National Environmental  Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act that have resulted in  endlessly time-consuming and cost-prohibitive restrictions and  requirements that have made the scientific management of our forests  virtually impossible.   Timber sales from our Federal lands has dropped 80 percent in the  intervening years, with a concomitant increase in forest fires. In  California alone, the number of saw mills has  [[Page H7738]]  dropped from 149 in 1981 to just 27 today.   Timber that once had room to grow healthy and strong now fights for  its life against other trees trying to occupy the same ground.   Average tree density in the Sierra Nevada is three to four times the  density that the land can actually support. In this weakened condition,  trees lose their natural defenses to drought and disease and  pestilence, and they ultimately succumb to catastrophic wildfire.   Three years ago, an estimated 25 million trees in the Sierra fell  victim to these stressors. Two years ago, that number doubled to 50  million trees. Last year, more than 100 million dead trees are now  waiting to burn in the Sierra.   Well, after 45 years of experience with these environmental laws--all  passed with the promise that they would improve our forest  environment--I think we are entitled to ask: How's the forest  environment doing?   All around us the answer is damning. These laws have not only failed  to improve our forest environment, but they are literally killing our  forests.   The same politicians responsible for these failed laws have recently  conjured up two new excuses. One is climate change. The other is that  we are putting out too many fires.   Putting out too many fires?   That invites an important question: Exactly which fires did they  propose that we allow to burn?   Perhaps the King fire that almost wiped out the towns of Georgetown  and Foresthill on its way to Lake Tahoe in 2014?   Or perhaps the Detwiler fire this year that almost wiped out the town  of Mariposa on its way to the Yosemite Valley?   Or any one of the more than 1,000 fires in the Sierra that CAL FIRE  has put out this year, any one of which could have grown into a  megafire but for the vigilance and competence of our fire agencies?   Which of these fires would they allow to burn into a conflagration?   True, controlled burns play an important role in clearing out  underbrush, but as firefighters bitterly complained to me at the  command center at the Detwiler fire this year, these same laws make it  virtually impossible to get permits to do the controlled burns.   The other reason that we hear is climate change. Well, let's put that  to the smell test. Throughout our vast forests, it is often very easy  to visually identify the property lines between well-managed private  forests and the neglected Federal lands.    Now, I have seen it myself on aerial inspections. The private managed  forests are green, healthy, and thriving. The neglected Federal forests  are densely overcrowded and often scarred by fire because we can't even  salvage the fire-killed timber while it still has value. You can  literally tell from the condition of the forest where the property line  is. How clever of our climate to know exactly what is the boundary line  between private and government lands.   And if carbon dioxide is the problem, doesn't it make sense to mill  fully grown trees to sequester the carbon and replace them with young,  growing trees that absorb much higher levels of carbon?   But, again, these same laws prevent this.   This is not complicated. Our forests are catastrophically overgrown.  Drought is a catalyst. It is not the cause. In overgrown forests, much  snow evaporates in dense canopies and cannot reach the ground. The  transpiration volume in an overgrown forest is a big problem in a  normal rain year; in a drought, it becomes lethal.   Pestilence is a catalyst; it is not a cause. Healthy trees can  naturally resist bark beetles; stressed trees cannot.                                time  1930    A properly managed forest matches the tree density to the ability of  the land to support it, but we cannot properly manage our forests  because of the laws now in place.   Mr. Westerman's Resilient Federal Forests Act and other measures will  restore proper scientific management of our national forests, but we  are running out of time to enact them, because we are running out of  forests to save.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank the gentleman for yielding today, I thank  him for his leadership, and I thank him for arranging this hour  tonight.
