 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  this amendment.    I rise in opposition to this amendment, which  requires the FAA to ensure that pilots can schedule a practical test  within 14 calendar days of requesting a test.   What this amendment fails to consider is that the FAA does not  schedule these tests. These are independent individuals who have  decided to take on this responsibility as a personal choice. They work  around their own schedules--birthday parties, weddings, and doctors'  appointments.   This amendment would actually add additional bureaucracy and would,  therefore, be counterproductive and an administrative nightmare.   Moreover, the underlying bill contains several provisions to assist  with expediting pilot certification. For instance, the base language  already increases accountability and transparency for scheduling these  tests and even includes a web-based scheduling tool to assist pilots.   The committee developed a solution on a bipartisan basis to help with  this specific problem of delays in pilot testing. Therefore, I oppose  this counterproductive and burdensome amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, for the party that eschews  regulations, we now have more regulations being proposed, and these  regulations are unnecessary in this case.   Again, it is up to the particular applicant to schedule the test for  themselves. If they delay in doing so, then, of course, why would we  want to punish the Federal Government by forcing the Federal Government  to offer them a test in 14 days that they could have scheduled  themselves had they been more efficient with their scheduling?   Let's continue to rely on personal responsibility in this regard, and  let's make sure that the onus remains on the applicant to schedule the  testing.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an app on my phone and I  can look out for at least 10 days and determine what the weather will  be projected to be in a particular location. That technology is  available to all. All should use it, particularly those who are looking  to fly the public or fly themselves or their families. They are charged  with personal responsibility to make sure that they schedule a test in  accordance with their own particular schedule. Their schedule is up to  them.   We need to allow the FAA to work within its means to schedule testing  on a first-come-first-served basis, and it is up to the applicant to  make sure they get in where they fit in.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    I claim time in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, aviation is the only segment of  transportation still using leaded fuels. The health impacts of leaded  fuels are well-documented up to this point and the aviation industry  writ large has been making a good-faith effort to transition to  unleaded fuels.   The FAA closely regulates the availability of fuels at public  airports because it is a critical element to flight safety.   The underlying bill text, as well as the manager's amendment offered  by Chairman Graves and the ranking member, clarifies the fuel  availability requirements at airports in line with the aviation  industry timeline for transitioning away from leaded fuels.   This amendment is confusingly written, and it is unnecessary. Unlike  what the summary claims, it would reduce airports' flexibility to meet  the FAA's requirements for fuel availability. Specifically, it would  narrow the types of unleaded fuels that airports are required to  provide under the bill.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment and urge all Members to do the  same. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I believe that we are trying to  achieve the same goals here and I appreciate the gentleman's approach,  but I do believe that it is restrictive; maybe not intentionally so,  but as a matter of consequence. That is why I am going to continue to  oppose this amendment.   Not every airport has the flexibility to do what Representative  Obernolte suggests that is available to them. I urge my colleagues to  oppose this amendment.  [[Page H3831]]    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, again, not all companies have  unleaded fuel that meets the standards that the gentleman suggests.   I wish I could read this writing here. I would present a more  eloquent rebuttal. Unfortunately, I can't read the scribble.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment that would  remove the requirement for the FAA to study the social impacts of  unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS, in the expansion of FAA's BEYOND  program.   The BEYOND program is vital for evaluating the safe integration of  beyond visual line of sight and other advanced UAS operations.   There are many potential societal benefits of UAS that are already  being tested by the BEYOND program. UAS technology can be used for  remote sensing to make our power systems more resilient to deliver  medical supplies to underserved communities or to assist first  responders in disaster response and relief efforts.   For example, Dominion Energy used drones to inspect more than 40  power generation facilities, allowing them to conduct more frequent and  efficient inspections.   The expansion of the BEYOND program in the underlying bill will allow  for testing of other new and emerging aviation concepts and  technologies, such as more autonomous aircraft.   As part of this testing, the program should consider societal impacts  such as potential emissions, noise, and other community priorities.   Mr. Chair, for these reasons, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen), the ranking  member on the full committee.    Mr. Chair, it is ironic that today we talk  about wokeness, and we talk about including a word, ``social,'' in the  impacts that would be studied by the BEYOND program.   The truth of the matter is that the BEYOND program is a Trump  administration program, and the language that the gentleman seeks to  eliminate from this authorization bill is the same language that was  proposed, introduced, and passed under the Trump administration. There  was no harm then, but now we have got a problem, because everybody is  anti-woke.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would direct the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to ignore climate  change as it studies the impacts of weather on the nature of  turbulence.   To deny the existence of climate change is to deny reality. There are  copious amounts of data to show that climate change has been happening  for decades.   Recently, we have all experienced consecutive days of 90-plus-degree  heat here in Washington, D.C., as well as we have seen sustained  increases in temperatures across the country. In fact, June 2023 was  the hottest June ever recorded on the planet, according to NASA.   The scientific definition of weather refers to short-term atmospheric  conditions, while climate change refers to long-term patterns and  shifts in our climate.                                time  1630    The dramatic shifts caused by climate change are not merely weather,  and to limit NOAA's ability to study climate change would neglect our  responsibility for ensuring safe air travel.   Studying these long-term patterns and understanding how they impact  turbulence is critical for putting the best safety practices in place,  as well as understanding how to mitigate the impacts of turbulence.   NOAA must have the authority to gather the data we need to help keep  Americans safe in the air, reduce flight delays, and improve our  understanding of changing atmospheric conditions. Let us not force NOAA  to put its head in the ground while climate change is happening all  around us.   Mr. Chair, if my colleagues are with me, they will oppose this  amendment, and I encourage more of my colleagues to do so.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, long-term weather patterns  affect turbulence, and that is what we need to study. We should not  deny that there will be long-term effects of climate change. We should  not ignore the fact that climate change is real and is happening today.   To force our government to not look at these weather patterns in the  long term is very shortsighted. Let's plan for this turbulence as we  come to grips with climate change.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time, and I am ready to close.    Mr. Chairman, safe travel in the future  depends on the FAA's ability to predict long-term weather patterns, and  that requires us to study the effects of climate change. That is what  we need to do now. We need to do it to protect ourselves, our wives,  our husbands, our children, our grandparents. We don't want any of our  loved ones to die.   Let's do the studying that we need in order to mitigate the effects  of our previous ignoring of climate change as a  [[Page H3833]]  phenomenon. Let's study it and come to grips with it and make things  safer for the traveling public as we proceed forward. That is what we  are doing under this FAA reauthorization bill.   Mr. Chair, this amendment hurts that process. For that reason, I  oppose it and ask my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in agreement with this  amendment. It is a commonsense compromise. I rise in support of it, and  I thank the gentleman for his hard work on this amendment.   This amendment would simply increase the average number of flight  departures from Reagan National Airport from 400 average per day to 407  flights departing per day, not anything more than that.   For those who oppose this, the only reasons why airlines are opposing  this is that they want to limit competition, and they want ticket  prices to remain the highest in the Nation for flying in and out of  Washington, D.C.   When we allow more flights into Washington, D.C., and out of  Washington, D.C., we allow more families to come in from west of the  Mississippi to visit the Nation's Capital. We enable  [[Page H3834]]  more people to come in and work and be more efficient.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment which would slash funding authorization levels for the  Airport Improvement Program, the AIP, FAA operations and maintenance,  and research and development efforts.   The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee overwhelmingly agreed  that AIP funding must be increased to $4 billion annually in order to  fund critical programs across the FAA and invest in our aviation  industry.   This amendment would slash that funding level and impede the full  funding of grants and projects to address the pressing infrastructure  needs of airports across the country.   It would also significantly decrease FAA operations and maintenance  funding, which jeopardizes the effectiveness of the agency amidst  growing demands placed upon the aviation industry.   Finally, this amendment cuts agreed-upon funding for the FAA's  research and development activities on aircraft safety, on  environmental impact mitigation, on airport infrastructure, and on  human factors and new airspace entrants, among other important issues.   Cutting this critical funding would undermine U.S. aerospace  innovation and our relationship in the global sector. Moreover, it  would put public safety at risk.   For those reasons, I oppose the amendment, and I urge my colleagues  to do the same.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, if we have the money to shore up  our nuclear defense capability, more and more nuclear weapons, we  certainly have the ability to keep these people up here safe as they  fly in and out of Washington, D.C.   Our families, businesspeople, the flying public deserves Congress to  fully fund what the consensus has arrived at.   This is what Americans want us to do. They want us to arrive at a  consensus. This FAA reauthorization bill is a bipartisan effort, and  all of the figures were arrived at in a bipartisan way, and we present  this to the American people for their protection and for their safety.   I agree that there may be cuts that may be necessary, but not to this  particular program. I respectfully disagree with my friend on the other  side of the aisle, and I will ask my colleagues to join me in being  opposed to this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank you for the indulgence  here. The fact is, we have the money, and we need to spend this money  to promote the public welfare and the public safety. That is what we  are doing with this expenditure, with this authorization for that  expenditure, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting public  safety and the safety of the flying public.   We have the best aviation system in the world. We need to keep it  that way. We have to invest in it. That is what this is all about. We  don't need to divest and put our public at risk.   Mr. Chair, I ask that my colleagues vote to oppose this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I speak in opposition to the  amendment. My friend on the other side is well intentioned on this.  However, we may be putting the cart before the horse.   This bill would strike the requirement in the underlying bill for the  FAA to update the definitions in regulation to classify vertiports as a  subset of heliports.   The term ``vertiport'' is already being used in the advanced air  mobility, AAM, industry to describe points at which these advanced  aircraft can safely take off and land.                                time  1715    The updated definition in the underlying bill will help to create a  unified system for vertical aviation infrastructure, including for  electric aircraft, and provides necessary regulatory certainty for this  emerging sector to grow in the United States and also sets the stage  for the assessment of revenue by which we can continue to keep the  system upgraded and available for all, including these aircraft that  will use the vertiport.   This is about planning for the future, laying in the regulatory  groundwork for the future. For the reason that we need to do this, I  oppose this amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, sometimes we do need to raise  revenue, and I look forward to supporting any proposals that my friend  on the other side would propose, out of fairness, I think. I mean, no  one segment should be able to get a free ride, so I would appreciate  that.   The fact of the matter is that most of my friends on the other side  of the aisle have already signed on to the Grover Norquist no new tax  pledge, so for years, they have neglected to raise revenues where  appropriate, and they will continue to abide by the pledge that they  have given.   So far, I don't see any yield in that trajectory, but the fact is we  are going to have to raise some revenue as we move forward, and I look  forward to working with the gentleman in that endeavor.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
