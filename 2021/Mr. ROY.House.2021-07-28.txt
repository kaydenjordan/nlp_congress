 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate what my colleague earlier offered  as the previous question with respect to Title 42, because what we are  seeing at the border is an absolute travesty, and my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle are going to do nothing, literally nothing  about that today, even as we see people spilling across the border who  are clearly testing positive for COVID.   We have a hotel in La Joya, Texas, that is literally filled right now  with individuals who are heavily testing positive for COVID. These are  the facts on the ground.   I know my friend, the Speaker, knows how bad it is at the border,  knows how bad it is in Laredo, knows how bad it is in Del Rio, knows  how bad it is in McAllen.   I have got a text here from a sheriff in a small Texas town saying,  ``We are passing an emergency declaration tonight at city council that  no illegal immigrants can be released in the city of Uvalde per the CDC  guidelines of countries on their list without a negative COVID test. We  have had our health authority write orders that give us the authority  to have them, government, Border Patrol, and immigrants, quarantine for  10 to 14 days.   We have a crisis at our border, and we are playing footsie with mask  mandates in the people's House. I mean, it is absolutely absurd what  this body is doing, the people's House. It is an embarrassment. It is a  mockery.   The American people are fed up. They want to go back to life. They  want to go back to business. They want to go back to school without  their children being forced to wear masks, to be put in the corner, to  have mental health issues.   We are running around here, and the Speaker comes down here at 10  a.m. saying we have got to wear masks in the people's House while we  have got thousands of people pouring across our border, and Democrats  don't do a darn thing about it.   Heavily infected with COVID.   We have The New York Times today.         What a mess. CDC about to reverse on indoor masking for the       vaccinated.    This is some serious nanny-state stuff that will only breed  resentment. No kidding.   Consider resentment being magnified right here on the floor of the  House of Representatives. We are absolutely sick and tired of it. So  are the American people. This sham of an institution is doing nothing  for the American people. Nothing for the betterment of the people that  send their Representatives here.   I just met this morning with an organization that tries to take care  of people from human trafficking; met with an elected official from  Mexico while cartels are raping and pillaging and killing. And we have  people infected with COVID coming across our southern border into  Texas. And you all put masks, masks up front here? Here in the people's  House? We have got to go around and see, okay, I can't come to the  floor, I can't execute my constitutional duty unless I wear a mask.   Which is it, vaccines or masks? Do the vaccines work or don't they  work? Do the masks work or don't they work? I would like to know which  it is. I would like Dr. Fauci to come down and answer a single question  about natural immunity. If you have been infected with the virus, do  you have immunity? Or are they just going to go around poking people  saying: You must take a vaccine. Oh, but sorry, the vaccine doesn't  work. You must wear a mask.   This institution is a sham, and we should adjourn and shut this place  down.    Mr. Speaker, I offer a privileged motion.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I object.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
