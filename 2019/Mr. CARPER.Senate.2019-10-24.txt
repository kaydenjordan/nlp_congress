 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to take the next 15 or 20 minutes  today to talk about the ongoing situation in Syria and the region  surrounding that country.   It is a part of the world that some folks might not be all that  familiar with, so let's take a look at the area that I will be  discussing today: Syria, the Mediterranean, with Greece up here.   Just north of Syria, we have Turkey. To the southeast of Syria, we  have Iraq. Further to the east of Iraq, we have Iran. To the south- southwest of Syria, we have Lebanon, Israel, and Jordan. South of  Jordan is Saudi Arabia. Over here we have Egypt, the Red Sea, and  Georgia--not the State, the country. That gives us just a little bit of  the lay of the land. The focus of my remarks today will be on Syria.   Three years and 4 months ago this week, I stood here on the Senate  floor in front of a map of Syria and spoke of the progress that was  about to be made in that country in the battle to degrade and destroy  ISIS.   We are going to look at another map. It is pretty much the same area,  blown up--Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel. The area  here in what I call a peach color is where ISIS was running the show or  had undue influence.   At this particular point in time, ISIS had been making undeniable  progress in building what they called their caliphate, their country,  their capital. Again, this is the area they covered at the height of  their influence.   ISIS at that time had recruited more manpower than any terrorist  group in the world and was also the richest terrorist group in the  world. They would literally go into an area of the town or country and  loot the banks, empty the vaults, take the cash, take the money, and  run.   Through their dominant social media presence, ISIS was attracting  some 2,000 foreign fighters per month. That included 10 Americans per  month, which would mean over 100 Americans per year on an annual basis.  ISIS controlled most of northern Syria, including Raqqa, which it  claimed as its capital, and the strategic city of Manbij, which is  close by.   ISIS was able to project an image of strength to the world, reeling  in potential recruits by touting their victories in the region. You  know how everybody wants to be the winner in football, and you see a  lot of people wearing Boston Patriots clothing. We will probably see a  lot more Nats fans in the months to come and Houston Astros fans as  well. But ISIS was projecting an image of strength to the world, and  they were reeling in potential recruits by touting their victories in  the region and their growing territory.   Three years and four months ago, when I stood here on the Senate  floor, progress was actually being made in reversing ISIS's growth.  U.S. and Kurdish forces had recaptured Manbij, sending ISIS recruitment  tumbling, from about 2,000 fighters a month down to 200. I will say  that again. They were recruiting 2,000 a month, and they were down to  about 200.   We had found where they kept a lot of their money, not all of it, but  we destroyed about one-third of it. ISIS had previously held the  strategically important Sunni Triangle in nearby Iraq. But when I spoke  on the floor, right here, 3 years ago, in 2016, Iraqi forces recaptured  the cities of Tikrit, Fallujah, and Ramadi, and we were poised to make  additional gains in the months that followed in the battle against  ISIS.   Just over a year later, in 2017, Raqqa was recaptured from ISIS  control. Around that time, and in the months that followed, ISIS's  sphere of influence undoubtedly diminished by about two-thirds.   I referred to that map already, but we will look at it again. This is  where  [[Page S6147]]  they were about 3 years and 4 months ago. That is basically where they  were. In short order, from there, they lost about two-thirds of the  land they were controlling and are down to this point right here.   When I speak of the progress we made, I am not just referring to U.S.  forces or the United States alone or one or two of our allies. I am  speaking of a coalition--get this--of over 60 nations that would come  together to fight the rise of ISIS and prevent it from establishing the  caliphate that I referred to earlier.   Each member of the coalition found that it was in their own naked  self-interest to join this fight as part of a bigger coalition. Among  the forces that contributed the most, though, were--believe it or not-- the Syrian Kurds.   If you asked most people, who are the Kurds, where are they from,  tell us something about the Kurds, they would have no idea. It turns  out, the Kurds are one of the largest ethnic groups in the world  without a nation of their own to call their own home. There are 30  million of them. They are largely divided across four countries: Syria,  Turkey, Iran, and Iraq.   For decades, the Kurds have sought self-determination and basic  rights, something we all want for ourselves and our families. But too  often, instead, they have been victimized, attacked, and slaughtered,  including by President Erdogan of Turkey.   Over the last several years, though, Kurdish soldiers trained and  fought against ISIS alongside of our soldiers as part of the Syrian  Democratic Forces. They call themselves the SDF, or the Syrian  Democratic Forces. The Kurdish soldiers put their lives at risk to stop  ISIS from successfully establishing a caliphate from which to wreak  even more havoc around the globe and even here in the United States.   In fact, the Kurdish SDF fighters were the ones carrying out most of  the ground operations, while U.S. troops provided support. Their  willingness--the willingness of the Kurdish fighters--to risk their  lives and shed their blood likely meant that countless American lives  were spared.   I am going to say that again. The willingness of Kurdish fighters to  risk their lives and shed their blood likely meant that countless  American lives were spared.   Some 11,000 Kurdish fighters have been killed in combat while  fighting ISIS. Compare that to the four American lives we have lost  during the same campaign. Think about that. Eleven thousand Kurdish  fighters laid down their lives. Four Americans lost their lives. That  is too many, but what an imbalance. We have heard it said oftentimes:  They laid down their lives to spare ours. And that is exactly what  happened.   Earlier this month, President Trump abruptly announced that he would  be pulling the remaining coalition forces from Syria, effective  immediately. He did not do so after thoughtful consideration of the  risks involved to U.S. interests. He did not consult with our allies.  As far as I know, he did not consult with our military leadership-- certainly not some of the ones retired now who are speaking up, raising  their voices. Rather, he did so after a weekend phone call with Turkish  President Erdogan.   In the process, he left our Kurdish allies hanging out to dry.   As someone who has actually served this Nation in uniform at a time  of war, I have served with coalitions before. Two of the most important  factors in building a successful coalition are communication and trust.   Our abrupt abandonment of Kurdish forces and their people will not  serve to encourage other countries around the world to risk the lives  of their soldiers and join a coalition led by us, the Americans. In  fact, what we have done in abandoning the Kurds is going to discourage  other nations from deciding to join a coalition with us in the future-- certainly in the near future and maybe longer than that.   The decision to abandon our Kurdish allies isn't just morally wrong-- and it is. It is not just harmful to our credibility with allies around  the globe--and it is harmful. It is a gift to several of our greatest  adversaries.   Here is what President Trump's abrupt decision to pull U.S. ground  forces from Syria has achieved. He has created almost overnight a power  vacuum in which ISIS can regroup and wreak havoc again. According to  recent news reports, ISIS fighters are cheering President Trump's  decision on social media channels viewed around the world.   Just this week, our Secretary of Defense confirmed that over 100 ISIS  prisoners have escaped, adding that the United States does not know  where they are today. And what does our President say in response to  all of this? He tells us that captured ISIS prisoners are secured.  Unfortunately, that does not appear to be true.   And, when presented with the possibility that ISIS prisoners might be  released as a result of his hasty withdrawal, what did our President  say? This is what he said: ``Well, they're going to be escaping to  Europe.'' Think about that. ``Well, they're going to be escaping to  Europe.''   Who do we know in Europe? Do we have friends? Yes, we do--NATO, which  we have been a part of for half a century. They are our friends. They  are our allies.   Somehow, the idea that that is where the escaped ISIS folks are going  to head is OK. Well, it is not OK. Those words, in my view, are  disgraceful.    As chairman and ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee for a number of years, I worked with my  colleagues--Democrats and Republicans alike--and others to find ways to  effectively combat ISIS.   Of course, it was critical to degrade and destroy ISIS extremists  overseas on the battlefield, but, unfortunately, in today's day and  age, ISIS's message of hate doesn't need a visa and doesn't need a  plane ticket to reach our shores. It has been just as important to find  ways to counter ISIS's abhorrent and twisted messages in order to  prevent the radicalization of American citizens right here at home, in  the United States of America.   We worked tirelessly during the Obama administration to reach out to  communities across our country and worked with local officials, with  faith leaders, and with family members to combat terrorist groups'  efforts to radicalize and recruit our own citizens--our own citizens  who might be vulnerable to their hateful ideology.   ISIS fighters never have to step foot on American soil to spread  their hate and inspire unspeakable violence. For our President to brush  off the escape of 100 or more of these prisoners and say it is not our  problem because they will go to Europe I think is callous. I think it  is thoughtless. It is foolish, and it demonstrates a fundamental lack  of understanding of the ever-evolving terrorist threats we face in this  world today.   President Trump's decision to pull out of Syria without a plan to  protect our gains hasn't just energized ISIS fighters there. It has  also given Russian President Vladimir Putin a long-desired foothold in  the Middle East. Just yesterday, President Putin and Erdogan announced  that their forces will jointly establish and patrol a 20-mile-wide safe  zone along the Syrian-Turkish border.   I don't know if we can look at this. Here is Syria. Turkey is up  here. Close to the Euphrates, there is an area there, about a 20-mile  safe zone, that will be patrolled not by the Syrian Kurds but by the  folks from Russia and the soldiers from Turkey.   If the Kurds want help fighting Erdogan's ethnic cleansing and  chemical attacks, instead of turning to the United States, they now  have only another dictator to turn to, and that is Vladimir Putin. And  because we left the region without a plan for exit, Mr. Putin has  secured an important public relations win of his own.   At least one base where American forces used to work side by side  with Kurdish forces in Syria to gather and share critical intelligence  regarding ISIS's movements--now it not in our hands, not in the hands  of the Syrian Kurds, but it is in Russian hands. You know what they are  doing with that change of hands? They are tweeting their videos to  prove it and laughing all the way to--I don't know--where ever they go.   If empowering Russia, Erdogan, and ISIS wasn't enough, President  Trump's decision to leave the region also creates a golden opportunity  for Iranian hardliners to achieve a long-desired goal of their own-- that is, to establish  [[Page S6148]]  a land bridge across the Middle East in order to further antagonize our  allies the Israelis.   President Trump has repeatedly promised to fulfill his campaign  promise to end what he calls America's endless wars. We should not be  fooled. Not one war has ended during his Presidency. In fact, more  troops have actually been deployed to the Middle East than have come  home.   Today, roughly 200,000 U.S. troops are deployed all around the globe.  Some of those troops are in war zones, in places like Iraq,  Afghanistan, Somalia, and a small number remain in Syria. Even more  troops remain overseas from legacy missions, in places like Japan,  Germany, the Philippines, and Australia. For instance, right now more  than 28,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea. Just 2 weeks ago,  President Trump announced that he would be sending an additional 3,000  troops to Saudi Arabia.   Prior to President Trump's reckless withdrawal from Syria, there were  roughly 1,000 American troops stationed in the northeastern corner of  that country. Compared to America's military presence elsewhere, that  is a small fraction. Think about that. Some 200,000 American troops are  spread around the world. Roughly 1,000 of them, which is less than one- half of 1 percent, were serving in this part of the world, in Syria.   In spite of their strategic presence, President Trump chose to  abruptly pull a small number of troops out of Syria. As it turns out,  with the death of John McCain, I am the last Vietnam veteran serving in  the U.S. Senate. I know well what it is like to come home from a long  deployment. When I was with my squadron, we deployed overseas 6 months  three times to Southeast Asia.   I agree that we cannot afford to entangle our men and women in  uniform in endless conflicts around the globe. It is not fair to them,  and it is not fair to their families. But what Donald Trump has  achieved is not a carefully negotiated cease-fire to shore up the gains  we have made against ISIS and to fulfill our commitments to the allies  who helped us along the way. Oh, no, make no mistake, this is a  retreat.   The last thing I will say is this: I am not alone. In fact, I am far  from alone in criticizing this administration's decision with respect  to the withdrawal of a small number of troops from Syria.   In the past week, I have been joined by some unlikely colleagues to  warn about the dangers of Mr. Trump's Syria policy. We have also heard  from top national security officials, past and present--in uniform and  out of uniform--who have extensive experience when it comes to American  foreign policy and military policy.   Just last week, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee described the Trump administration's decision to pull  American troops out of Syria as--in his words--``out of line'' and also  as ``dangerous.''   That Senator also warned that--these are his words--``ISIS is the  biggest beneficiary.'' That is what he said. ``ISIS is the biggest  beneficiary.'' Of what? Of the administration's abrupt decision to pull  U.S. troops out of Syria and leave our Kurdish allies open to  predictable invasion and, unfortunately, likely slaughter by the Turks.   You might be surprised to learn those remarks were made by a  Republican colleague from South Carolina, someone who was also in  uniform in his life, Lindsey Graham.   Another one of our colleagues stood right here on the Senate floor  this last week and said that President Trump's decision to abandon our  Kurdish allies ``strikes at American honor.'' He goes on to say: ``What  we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain''--as a  bloodstain--``in American history.'' He went on to say that the  ceasefire deal described last week by Vice President Pence as a  victory--and these are words of our colleague--``does not change the  fact that America abandoned an ally, adding insult to dishonor.''    That Senator went on to say:         The administration speaks cavalierly, even flippantly, even       as our ally has suffered death from casualty. Their homes       have been burned and their families have been torn apart.    Again, those are the words of not a Democratic colleague but a  Republican colleague--our friend from Utah, Senator Mitt Romney.   Just this past weekend, we were warned by a highly decorated, retired  U.S. Marine Corps general, one who served in the Persian Gulf war, one  who served in the war in Afghanistan, and one who served in the Iraq  war. In his warning, he said that the administration's abrupt  withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Syrian-Turkish border will lead to  ``disarray''--disarray in Syria--and that ``ISIS will resurge.'' Those  are not my words, not a Democrat's words, but the words of President  Trump's former Defense Secretary, Gen. Jim Mattis, affectionately known  as ``Mad Dog.''   Colleagues, I am not describing a misguided foreign policy here  today. I am describing an abandonment of the values that we as  Americans have embraced since the founding of our democracy. I am going  to say that again. I am not describing a misguided foreign policy--oh,  no. I am describing something much bigger than that--an abandonment of  the values that we as Americans have embraced since the founding of our  democracy.   A bipartisan group of Senators, including myself, have introduced a  package of sanctions that ought to be passed and imposed on Turkey.  These sanctions are stronger than the ones President Trump imposed on  Turkey this week, which he has already, apparently, lifted. He lifted  those sanctions as part of the retreat negotiated by his  administration, and he lifted those sanctions in the face of evidence  that Turkish forces continue to attack Kurds outside of the agreed-upon  safe zone and continue to commit possible war crimes. But even strong  sanctions such as those contained in our bill, if passed, would not  solve the urgent crisis President Trump has created by abandoning our  Kurdish allies.   Here is what the President said in the last week or two: ``I alone  can fix it.''   Well, Mr. President, for once, that might be true. You alone can fix  it. After a single phone call with an authoritarian leader, you created  this mess, and maybe you alone can reverse that decision. I urge you to  do so. In fact, I think we urge you to do so. Don't turn your back on  the Kurds. Don't give up on the gains against ISIS that our service men  and women, along with our allies, fought for so bravely.   That would be leadership. That would protect our national security.  And that is what the American people and our allies look to the  President of the United States to do.   Tom Friedman, a noted author and columnist for the New York Times and  someone who has been here in the Capitol a number of times, has  something he calls the Trump Doctrine. He said the Trump Doctrine is-- it goes something like this: Barack built it. I, Trump, broke it. You  fix it.   I want to turn the Trump Doctrine on its head and say: No, no, no,  Mr. President. You broke it. It can be fixed, and you need to do the  fixing.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that three interns  from our Senate office here--Carter Thompson, Gil Connolly, and Tamar  Epps--be granted floor privileges for today.
