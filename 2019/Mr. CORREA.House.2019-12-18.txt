 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I know  firsthand the dangers that foreign interference in our elections  present to our democracy. As a Member of Congress, it is my sworn duty  to ensure that our Nation is secure from all threats, foreign and  domestic. And Congress has a constitutional job to investigate  allegations of misconduct by the executive branch, including the United  States President.                                time  1300    The Constitution is the highest law of the land, creating a system of  checks and balances to prevent the creation of a king. Congress is a  coequal branch of our Nation's government, equal with the Presidency,  with duties that are given to us by the Framers.   This is a very sad day, and I do not take impeachment lightly; yet, I  am here to do my job as a Member of Congress.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)   My town sent me to Washington to work with everyone, Democrats and  Republicans, to improve the lives of our communities.   Sadly, we are here, today, considering the actions of the President  of the United States.   My vote will be to ensure that we remain a democracy, and not a  dictatorship.   Many of our sons and daughters have paid the price of our freedom  with their blood. Our liberty and democracy must be the inheritance  that we leave to our sons and daughters.   A democracy exists when nobody is above the constitution, and we are  all subject to the law.   I ask God to give us wisdom, and to help us unite our beloved  homeland, the United States of America.   Mi pueblo me mando a Washington para trabajar con todos, Democratas y  Republicanos, para mejorar las vidas de nuestra comunidad.   Tristemente estamos presentes, considerando las acciones del  president de los Estados Unidos.   Mi voto, sera para asegurar que sigamos siendo una democracia, y no  una dictadura.   Muchos de nuestros hijos y hijas, han pagadado el precio de nuestra  libertad con su sangre. Nuertra liberated y democracia, tienen que ser  la herencia que les dejamos a nuertros hijos y hijas.   Una democracia existe cuando nadie esta sobre la constitucion, y  todos somos sujetos a la ley.   Le pido a dios que nos de sabiduria, y que nos ayude unir nuestra  querida patria, los Estados Unidos Americanos.   Mr. Speaker, today I pray to God for His guidance in uniting our  great Nation.
