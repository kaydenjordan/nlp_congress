 I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on February 3 of this year, at 4 in  the morning, outside of Reno, callers told police that there was a car  on fire on the shoulder of the interstate. Inside, officers found the  body of a 23-year-old woman named Anna Marie Scott. She had been  murdered by an unknown assailant.   This is Anna--as you can see, a beautiful, beautiful young girl. She  was a beloved daughter and a sister and a devoted mother of two young  children. She was also a member of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe. And  she joins a long and tragic list of Native women who have gone missing  or been murdered, leaving families desperately waiting for answers.   Families like Anna's will tell you one of the worst things about a  tragedy like this is that they never had a chance to say goodbye to  their loved one. Another is knowing that decade after decade, the  United States has not done enough to protect Native women, leaving  families all over Indian Country searching for answers.   A National Institutes of Justice study found that an unbelievable 84  percent of Native women experience violence in their lifetimes, along  with 81 percent of men. It also reported that Native women are almost  twice as likely as White women to have been the target of violence in  the past year. These numbers confirm what Native communities have known  for years: Native people are vulnerable, and they can be taken from  their families at any time.   In 2020, I secured passage of two bipartisan bills with Senator  Murkowski, who we all know is a tireless advocate for Native  communities, to finally create a national strategy to address the  crisis of missing, murdered, and trafficked Indigenous women and girls.  The Not Invisible Act instructs the Bureau of Indian Affairs to  coordinate Federal efforts to address the epidemic of violence in  Native American communities.   It also mandates a commission made up of Tribal, State, and local law  enforcement, service providers, representatives of Federal Agencies,  Tribal leaders, and survivors and family members.   The other piece of legislation, Savanna's Act, which we passed,  requires the creation of guidelines for law enforcement on how best to  keep Native women safe, and it improves reporting of violent crimes  against Native people and strengthens vital access to Federal crime  databases.   These two laws create powerful tools that will help curb violence  against Native people. But they cannot fulfill that mission if they are  not implemented by the executive branch. And to date, the  administration has missed too many deadlines mandated by statute for  putting the legislation into effect. That is why this week, I sent a  letter, with Senators Tester and Murkowski, to the administration  urging them to implement key provisions of our bipartisan bills.   Now, I am thrilled to share that, today, Secretary Haaland announced  the members of the Not Invisible Commission, which now can begin its  work. This is excellent news, and I appreciate this and other important  steps the administration has taken to address the problem.   But there is still more we need to be doing to implement the policies  Congress has passed that will make a difference on the ground for so  many families. That includes issuing Federal  [[Page S2365]]  guidelines to help local law enforcement with best practices to protect  Native communities and implementing the data collection needed to  address the crisis. The work must continue because families continue to  wait.   Just as I call on this administration to do more, I am committed to  doing more myself. My office is working to reintroduce legislation that  I cosponsored with Senators Udall, Tester, and Murkowski last Congress  to improve coordination and data-sharing between Tribal and Federal law  enforcement.   My congressional colleagues and I have, this year, once again  introduced a resolution recognizing May 5 as a day of awareness for the  crisis of missing and murdered Native women and girls. But let's be  clear: A day of awareness is for those who don't know about the  problem. Indigenous families in Nevada and across the country are only  too conscious of the risks their sisters, brothers, cousins, and  children face. And they are looking to Congress and to this  administration for concrete progress in the long way for justice.   I will keep fighting for that justice and for Anna. But I am here to  say to our Congress and administration, let's not have any more Annas.  Let's do the right thing for these families and individuals.                            ____________________
