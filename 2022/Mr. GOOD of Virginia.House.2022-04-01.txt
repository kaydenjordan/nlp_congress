 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon  for yielding.   Our country continues to suffer under the many crises created by the  Biden administration and Democrat policies; you know, the border  crisis, the crime crisis, the inflation crisis, the energy crisis. And  yet, the priority of this Congress now turns to expanding access to  addictive, behavior-altering, recreational drugs at a time when our  country is also experiencing increased addiction, depression, and  suicide.   What is worse, we want to target those individuals and communities  who are historically most impacted by the harm of illegal drugs and  provide Federal funding to help enable criminals to open and operate  now legal drug businesses.   We have rising violent crime in Democrat-run cities across the  country. More drug use won't help that.   We had 100,000 Americans die of overdoses last year, the leading  cause of death in Americans ages 18 to 45. More drug use won't help  that.   Our government, schools, and our education systems are failing us.  More drug use won't help that.   But, in fact, this legislation has no prohibitions on edible forms of  marijuana, flavored vape products, or other efforts to target,  specifically, teens and young people.   Meanwhile, we have surrendered operational control of our southern  border to the Mexican crime cartels, and we have got fentanyl and other  dangerous drugs streaming into our country at historic levels because  of this President's open border policies.   Of course, what is his solution? Let's end Title 42 which is  predicted to increase the daily crossings from the current 7,000 a day  to as much as 18,000 a day. That is over half a million a month.   How might this impact the illegal drug trade across our country? Law  enforcement tells me that legalizing marijuana will force the criminal  element to redouble their efforts into hard, more dangerous drugs to  replace the profit that has been lost from marijuana.   You can also look at the States that have already legalized it, and  you can see the increased addiction, dependency, and homelessness that  this has cost. We should be ashamed of ourselves for this legislation,  and I oppose this bill.                                time  0930
