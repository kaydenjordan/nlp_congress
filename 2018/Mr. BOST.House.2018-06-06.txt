 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the important  efforts of the 126th Air Refueling Wing at Scott Air Force Base in St.  Clair County, Illinois.   On June 2, I celebrated the many achievements of this unit when I  attended the 126th Air Refueling Wing Day, which was done by  proclamation by the Governor of the State of Illinois.   The 126th Air Refueling Wing routinely succeeds in its missions of  providing immediate, sustained, long-range air refueling of both  nuclear and conventional aircraft for both the U.S. Armed Forces and  NATO allies.   The 126th Air Refueling Wing has more than 1,000 Air National Guard  Active Duty United States Air Force personnel, who recently received  its eighth Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for service provided from  December 2014 through December 2016.   The servicemembers of the 126th Air Refueling Wing routinely  demonstrate their excellence in performance while supporting the United  States Air Force operations.   The significant awards and recognition the 126th Illinois Air  National Guard has received sets the foundational framework for being a  strong center of excellence for military aircraft.   I am proud of their hard work and dedication to ensuring the best  aircraft maintenance and repair work is done at Scott Air Force Base.   Our national defense depends on having our military aircraft able to  fly in a moment's notice, so the work that they do every day is  critical in keeping all of us safe at home.                Recognizing Wilber Hesterberg's 100th Birthday     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Wilber ``Whip''  Hesterberg of Maeystown, Illinois, who will turn 100 years old on June  24.   Whip worked for A&P Food Stores for many years, was a Teamster, and  served in the Army for 4 years.   He likes to camp, garden, and do word searches. He can also still be  seen driving around town slowly, it is reported.   Family and neighbors say he is ``loved by everyone.''   Every Wednesday night, Whip continues to host a family dinner at his  house with some of his five children, 17 grandchildren, 24 great- grandchildren.   This year, Whip will be honored as the Grand Marshal of Maeystown  Homecoming celebration on June 15 and 16.   Whip, southern Illinois wishes you a happy 100th birthday.               100th Anniversary of the Battle of Belleau Wood     Mr. Speaker, I also rise today and feel it is very  important that we recognize and remember that today is D-day, but also  that 100 years ago today was the battle of Belleau Wood in the First  World War, where the Marines earned the title of Devil Dogs.   It was a very, very hard fought battle. We must remember that freedom  is not free. So when we recognize not only D-day, but 100 years since  that time on that day, we lost 1,086 Marines.                        Happy Birthday, Matt McAuliffe     Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize today someone who  works in my office that everyone looks up to, because he is so tall, is  my chief of staff, and it is his birthday, Matt McAuliffe. Happy  birthday.  [[Page H4780]]                                ____________________     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I wish to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking  Member DeFazio for their support of the amendment.   The purpose of this amendment is to help local communities recover  from flood disasters. Under current law, the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers can only repair a non-Federal levee if the flood protection  benefit outweighs the cost. However, the standard can't always be met,  especially in rural communities, with specific economic and demographic  changes.                                time  1645    The Len Small Levee in southern Illinois is a perfect example. The  levee breached in the winter floods of January 2016. Several thousand  acres of infrastructure and agriculture land were destroyed when the  levee gave way. The Corps estimated the cost of repairing the levee  would be higher than its  [[Page H4826]]  flood protection benefits, leaving local residents with no recourse.   My amendment provides new hope in my district and elsewhere. It  allows local sponsors to pay the difference between the cost of  repairing a levee and its projected flood protection benefits.   My amendment does not increase the Federal Government's share of the  costs for repairs. Let me repeat that. My amendment does not increase  the Federal Government's share of the costs of the repairs. This is a  fiscally responsible way to give a lifeline to rural communities  struggling to rebuild after a disaster.   The amendment is supported by the National Waterways Conference and  the American Farm Bureau.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for his support of the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
