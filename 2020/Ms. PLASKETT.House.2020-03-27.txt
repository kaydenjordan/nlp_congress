 Mr. Speaker, our Nation faces the worst pandemic in  most of our lifetimes. We are, indeed, in an unprecedented time. Like  the rest of the Nation and countries around the world, the Virgin  Islands' life has significantly been altered.   Americans need the urgent action of this body, the Congress, to  address this threat to the lives and livelihood of the American people.  We do so with passage of this bill.   It is not a perfect bill, but this short-term action will go a long  way to save lives, help the economy, and pave a path to recovery.   Aside from support to healthcare and the economy, one of the most  important measures in this bill, in the CARES Act, is the support and  investment we make in our children. The $30 billion in educational  funds, as well as the $14 billion allocated to higher education, will  do that.   The foresight and fortitude of the Speaker and Democratic leadership  to ensure that small businesses, local government, and American workers  and families--often forgotten--are included in this bill will go a long  way.
