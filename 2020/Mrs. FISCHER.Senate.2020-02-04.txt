 Mr. President, I rise to voice my opposition to these  Articles of Impeachment. I want the people of Nebraska to know how I  will vote and why, as the Senate prepares for the trial's final vote.   I took an oath to uphold the Constitution, and I have a  responsibility to be an impartial juror during the trial.   I have given fair and careful consideration to the evidence presented  during this trial, and I have engaged in the questioning process. This  is a process that should be about facts and fairness, and that is what  the Senate has done its very best to do, but the reality is that the  House of Representatives didn't do its job.   Under the Constitution and by precedent, the impeachment  investigation is the responsibility of the House, not the Senate.  Hearings in the House inquiry during the Nixon impeachment  investigation lasted for 14 months. The Clinton impeachment House  inquiry relied on years of prior investigation and overwhelming amounts  of testimony from firsthand witnesses. President Trump's inquiry in the  House was deeply partisan, and it lasted only 12 weeks.   Disturbingly, there was a lack of due process during this House  investigation. The President was not allowed to have his lawyers cross- examine witnesses at the House Intelligence Committee hearings and  depositions. This is the committee that was the lead on the  investigative hearings. Shockingly, the President of the United States  was prevented from participating in the House's impeachment for 71 of  the 78 days of investigation. Our founding document protects the right  of the accused. The Constitution explicitly states that no one should  ``be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of  law.'' Our blueprint for freedom protects all individuals' rights,  whether that person is a truckdriver, a farmer, a businesswoman, or the  President of the United States.   The third branch of government--our court system--is of foundational  importance, and we have it for a reason. That reason is to provide  every American with the opportunity to have justice in a fair way in  accordance with the Constitution and the rule of law. But because House  Democrats were in a rush to impeach the President before their holiday  break, they decided to abandon the courts completely.   It was the House's constitutional right to subpoena witnesses. It was  the President's constitutional right to assert privilege. And it was  the court's constitutional right to enforce subpoenas. The House did  not petition the court to enforce subpoenas. Short-circuiting the  process led to an incomplete investigation by the House.   Article 1, section 3 of the Constitution provides that ``the Senate  shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.'' If the Senate were  to become the factfinder in an impeachment investigation, it would  completely change the role of the Senate from this point forward, this  hallowed Chamber, the world's greatest deliberative body. It would  become an investigative arm of the House. Setting this precedent would  have a devastating effect on our political institution, transforming  the very nature of the Senate during impeachment hearings for  generations to come.   The Senate is supposed to conduct a fair trial, protect the  Constitution, and guarantee due process of law.   My Republican colleagues and I understand the gravity of these  proceedings. The record shows that President Clinton's impeachment  trial was met with a motion filed by Senator Byrd to dismiss the  Articles of Impeachment early on. This time, not a single Senator filed  such a motion. We approached this process with the seriousness it  deserves.   Senate Republicans supported a resolution that gave the House  managers more than ample time to lay out their case. Since then, we  have heard an extraordinary amount of information over the last 2  weeks. The House managers presented 192 video clips with testimony from  13 witnesses and submitted more than 28,000 pages of documents.  Senators then submitted 180 questions. After 2 weeks of trial  arguments, the House managers failed to  [[Page S826]]  make a compelling case that the President should be removed from  office; therefore, I will vote for the President's acquittal.   I firmly believe it is time for the Senate to move forward and return  to the people's business. It is time to refocus our attention on our  bipartisan work: providing for our servicemembers, caring for our  veterans, funding research to cure diseases that cut short too many  lives, fighting the opioid addiction, and improving our criminal  justice system.   So I speak to Nebraskans and to all Americans in urging every Senator  in this Chamber to have the courage, the heart, and the vision to move  past this process and work together toward a brighter future for  generations to come. That should be our mindset at this pivotal moment.  That should be our mindset in everything we do.   I urge my colleagues to take the long view and fulfill our  constitutional role. Let's reunite around our common goals and our  values. Let's bring this process to an end and advance policies that  will make life better for Nebraskans and better for all Americans.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 2 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
