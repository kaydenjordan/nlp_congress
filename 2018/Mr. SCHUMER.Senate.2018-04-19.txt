 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is good to see the Acting President  pro tempore back in the Chair a second time.                            ____________________     Madam President, let me begin by addressing the  administration's ongoing effort to secure a diplomatic deal with North  Korea to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.   It is a worthy and ambitious goal. Indeed, we should all root for a  diplomatic resolution to the decades-long conflict. It is undeniable,  however, that  [[Page S2291]]  this meeting is fraught with peril. My primary concern is that the  President, in his penchant for spur-of-the-moment decision making,  could lead the United States into danger in one of two ways.   My first concern is that the President, without a clear or coherent  strategy, will buy a pile of magic beans, accepting an agreement--any  agreement--that allows him to declare victory. We know what he will  say: the greatest compromise ever, greater than Versailles, greater  than anything. Talking is good, but it is very far from an agreement to  disarm.   President Trump should not accept a deal that doesn't include  concrete steps to verifiably roll back North Korea's nuclear and  missile programs, including those that threaten our allies and  partners. So that is one concern: that the President accepts any  agreement because he is just so eager to tout that he was a great deal  maker and made an agreement, even if it is a rotten agreement for  America.   My second concern is sort of the opposite. My second concern is that  the President, without a disciplined or coherent strategy, will walk  away from a bilateral meeting if he doesn't get everything he wants.  There is also the possibility that the President will walk away from an  agreement after the fact if he decides later he is unhappy with it. We  have seen him do that on so many occasions. As someone who has  negotiated deals with the President, I know it is a very real  possibility.   Now, some may say that these are opposite possibilities. They are, in  a certain sense. If he takes too little, he walks away because he  didn't get everything. But they are all underlined by one coherent  fact: There is no strategy--at least apparent to just about everyone.   The President seems to operate on a whim, saying one thing one day  and another thing the next. When there is no coherent strategy, each of  these dangers is too real. Either scenario could leave relations with a  rogue state worse and more dangerous than before.   Now, the President said last night at Mar-a-Lago that he would leave  a meeting with Kim Jong Un if it wasn't fruitful.   Mr. President, this is not like a business deal. There is a very real  danger to walking away from a meeting with a nuclear-armed dictator. It  could risk serious escalation. If the United States is seen as the one  walking away from talks, we should be under no illusions that China,  Russia, and others will not follow suit.   We all want to see negotiations with North Korea succeed. If it is  true that North Korea will take its demand for U.S. troops to leave the  Korean Peninsula off the table, that is a good step. Our commitment to  the Korean people and our alliances with Korea and Japan are not  subject to negotiation. But, I repeat, if these talks are going to  truly succeed, the President and his team require a coordinated  strategy, something this administration hasn't been able to show with  respect to Russia, Syria, Yemen, the Middle East, and other hotspots  around the world.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another topic, I have come to the  floor several times over the past month to document the number of ways  in which this administration has signaled a willingness--perhaps a  desire--to interfere with Special Counsel Mueller's probe into Russian  interference in the 2016 elections.   Beyond troubling statements from the White House Press Secretary and  the President's allies in the media, President Trump himself has  publicly mused about the firing of the special counsel. So while I  appreciate that the majority leader believes the President would be  wrong to fire the special counsel, I believe it is a real mistake not  to pass legislation to protect the investigation. I sincerely hope  Leader McConnell reconsiders his refusal to entertain bringing such a  bill to the floor. It is a bipartisan bill.   I have talked to Members on both sides of the aisle who are worried  about a constitutional crisis. We all know the consequence of  Presidential interference in the Russian probe and how dire it would be  for the rule of law, fundamental to our democracy, and the  constitutional crisis that it would create should be avoided at all  costs. Unfortunately, there is substantial evidence that the President  has thought about firing the special counsel more than once in the past  and may well do so in the future.   The bipartisan legislation introduced by Senators Graham, Coons,  Tillis, and Booker has no real downsides to it. It would simply provide  a legal avenue to restore the special counsel if existing DOJ  regulations are breached and he is fired for political reasons.   So what is the reason not to do it? Why not head off a constitutional  crisis at the pass rather than waiting until it is too late? The rule  of law is fundamental to the functioning of our democracy. Why even  flirt with the prospect of a President challenging the very nature of  our system of government?   So I would urge my friend Leader McConnell to think twice about  this--to think not simply about his responsibilities to his party and  not simply about doing what the President might want, but to our  country and our Constitution. If we think of it in those terms, I think  it is inevitable that we would want to pass this legislation. That is  because the rule of law is fundamental to the functioning of our  democracy. Why even flirt with the prospect of a President challenging  the very nature of our system of governance and rules?   So I hope the Judiciary Committee moves forward with the bipartisan  bill. I hope there is no attempt to water it down or to create a back  channel for political interference in ongoing investigations. It is  clear that several Republicans, including Chairman Grassley, Senator  Tillis, Senator Graham, and others, see a need to pass this  legislation. Let them prevail upon the Republican leader to reconsider  his position.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
