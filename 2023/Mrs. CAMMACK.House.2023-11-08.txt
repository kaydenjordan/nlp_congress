 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment,  which would restrict funds at Federal agencies falling under the  Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act from being  used to finalize any rule or regulation that would have an annual  effect on the economy of $100 million or more.   The Biden administration has continually hamstrung the American  people with agency rules that circumvent congressional oversight.  Agencies like the SEC and CFPB do nothing to combat the hundreds of  billions of dollars in regulatory costs that our constituents have been  faced with since President Biden took office. In fact, they perpetuate  them.   Unreasonable regulations relating to climate and ESG disclosure  requirements, as well as aggressive and abusive IRS enforcement  measures, are examples of hurdles that our financial agencies place  upon everyday Americans.   My amendment seeks to prevent these types of abuses from these  agencies before finalizing major rules or regulations, which often  involve major policy decisions that should be decided by Congress'  elected officials, not unelected bureaucrats.                                time  1315    By including my amendment in this bill, we restore Congress' Article  I authority by preventing agencies from imposing rules behind closed  doors. Instead, we commit ourselves to the way the process is  intended--transparent, open governance in Congress, in the people's  House.   For example, under Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has bombarded the  financial sector with more rules and regulatory proposals than any  other predecessor since the 2008 global financial crisis. The SEC has  put forward a total of 47 proposals that substantially affect financial  markets since Gensler took the chair. In fact, these 47 proposals all  have $100 million more of industry impact apiece.   According to the Financial Times, the current SEC stands out for  their number of proposals that are not mandated by congressional  legislation. Just 17 percent of Gensler's SEC proposals were required  under the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act, meaning that the majority of  the SEC's proposals may not be necessary, let alone constitutional.  This regulatory regime is the quintessential example of executive  overreach. As The Wall Street Journal editorial board puts it: If it  moves, the SEC will regulate it.   Specifically, the SEC's predictive analytics rule and climate  disclosure rule are perfect examples of costly, misguided agency  regulations. The predictive analytics rule seeks to prohibit certain  technologies that investment firms and advisers use to automatically  inform investors about financial news. Under this rule, companies who  offer accessible, zero-commission trading would be hamstrung by  compliance costs that favor firms with larger investment operations.   Speaking of compliance costs, the SEC rule of climate-related  disclosure requirements would litter public companies and financial  disclosures and institutions with unnecessary reporting requirements.  Banks and companies would have to disclose greenhouse gas emissions and  conjure up plans to mitigate these climate-related risks. Like many  other Federal agency rules, there is no clear legal basis for these  requirements, as they are meant to ultimately advance a political  agenda rather than the will of the people.   It is simple, Congress should have oversight of these burdensome  rules and regulations. We should have an open and transparent process.  The great thing about this amendment is it is bipartisan. This same  language was passed earlier this year on this very floor.   Let's reassert Article I authority. Let's make Congress accountable,  open, transparent, and take the power back from this overreach.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I greatly respect my colleague on the other  side of the aisle, but I am not quite sure why he is thinking that this  would be harmful to put more power in the hands of the people's elected  Representatives.   In fact, this would encourage transparency. This would encourage  Members of Congress to do the work that we are hired to do rather than  unelected, nameless, faceless bureaucrats in a basement somewhere in  Washington. I think it is critically important that we reassert our  authority as prescribed by the Constitution.   Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
