 Mr. President, today is National Service Recognition Day,  when we take a moment to honor AmeriCorps and Senior Corps members for  the many contributions they make  [[Page S2191]]  in communities across the nation. As Americans, we take inspiration  from those who have answered the call to serve, whether in defense of  our Nation abroad or to strengthen our communities at home. The  willingness to serve a purpose greater than ourselves is a hallmark of  our Nation and those who commit themselves to the betterment of our  country deserve and have earned our support. That is why this year, on  National Service Recognition Day, I am joining Senators Coons and  Duckworth and Congressman Larson and other colleagues in introducing  the America's Call to Improving Opportunities Now (ACTION) for National  Service Act of 2019. Our legislation calls for a great expansion of the  number of service opportunities and an increased investment in those  who serve.   Since 1994, over one million individuals have served through the  AmeriCorps program. Annually, roughly 220,000 seniors over the age of  55 volunteer through the Senior Corps programs. These individuals have  addressed critical community needs in education, economic development,  health, and many other areas. They are among the teams of first  responders when disaster strikes. Unfortunately, we have not created  the capacity to support all Americans who want to serve.   The question of service is vital to our Nation. I was proud to have  joined my friend and colleague, the late Senator John McCain, in laying  out a vision and plan to support and encourage service--military,  national and public--by establishing the National Commission on  Military, National, and Public Service. After meeting with communities  across the country, the Commission submitted its interim report, which  highlighted that Americans value service and are interested in pursuing  transformative efforts to involve many more Americans in service. Yet,  the Commission also reported that there are many barriers to service,  particularly financial ones. Furthermore, there is a lack of awareness  about existing programs and opportunities.   The ACTION for National Service Act will honor our national value of  service, while addressing the barriers that limit citizens'  opportunities to serve. Our legislation will set us on a path to one  million national service positions within ten years. It will increase  the educational award so that an individual completing two full years  of service will earn the equivalent of four years of the average in- state tuition at a public institution. Those who are willing to serve  should not have to carry a heavy burden of student loan debt to achieve  their educational goals. The ACTION for National Service Act will also  ease other financial barriers to service, increasing the living  allowance and eliminating the tax liability for the education awards  and living stipends. The bill calls for a robust outreach campaign,  requiring that all eligible individuals be notified of their options to  serve. Finally, the ACTION for National Service Act calls for elevating  the Corporation for National and Community Service to a cabinet-level  agency and establishes a National Service Foundation to leverage  private sector resources to support national service activities.   Mr. President, it is time we reinvigorate the social contract between  America and its citizenry. Americans have a deep tradition of national  service, starting with the dedicated men and women of our armed forces  and including all those who have served in AmeriCorps, Senior Corps,  and the Peace Corps. However, as more Americans wish to serve, it is  important that they be given the opportunity to do so. Just as critical  is investing in the education and professional development of those who  have sacrificed and given so much to our Nation. Developing the talents  of our most committed citizens pays life-long dividends. Our investment  in the GI Bill not only honors our service members, but also enriches  our Nation. Similarly, the education awards for those who have served  through our national programs have economic impacts beyond the  individuals who earn them. That is the new deal that the ACTION for  National Service Act offers.   All AmeriCorps members take a pledge to get things done for  Americans, to make communities safer, smarter and healthier, and to  bring us together. I'd like to thank Senators Coons, Duckworth,  Gillibrand, Klobuchar, Blumenthal, Brown, Baldwin, and Blumenthal for  signing on as original cosponsors and urge our colleagues to join us in  pledging to ensure that all who want to answer the call to serve can do  so by cosponsoring the ACTION for National Service Act and working for  its passage.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS:   S. 995. A bill to amend title XXIX of the Public Health Service Act  to reauthorize the program under such title relating to lifespan  respite care; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions.
