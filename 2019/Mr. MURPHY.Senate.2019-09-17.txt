 Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their indulgence  this evening and those of you who help us keep this floor open.   I will make some longer remarks later this evening, but while we have  a short break on the floor and await Senator Brown, I want to say a  word of appreciation to all of my colleagues who have decided to join  us this evening on the floor.   This is my first appearance here to talk about the imperative of  changing the Nation's gun laws, recognizing that this number--100  Americans killed by guns every single day--is not inevitable. Almost  every single one of these murders and suicides and accidental shootings  is preventable if we make different choices here on the floor of the  U.S. Senate.   Our purpose tonight is to try to bring some consistency of effort to  a case that we have been making for a very long time. So I will be back  here later this evening to walk through the case, as far as I see it,  for universal background checks in particular but also for a host of  other measures that are broadly popular amongst the American public.   One point I will make right now is that this issue is really unique  in American politics today. It is not a controversial issue out in  America. It is only controversial here inside the political process. In  fact, there are very few matters in public life today that are,  frankly, more controversial than this issue. When you go out and ask  people if they support universal background checks, which is the  measure that passed the House of Representatives by a 9-to-1 margin,  they support universal background checks. There is almost nothing else  in American politics today--I would endeavor to say there is nothing  else in American politics today that is as popular as this measure; yet  it has this reputation of being a third rail of political discourse  here in Washington.   I would simply encourage my colleagues to get out there and have  conversations with their constituents, to have conversations with  members of their own parties, to have conversations with gun owners.  You will find that there is a consistency of opinion at least on a  large number of pieces of legislation that are before this body. At the  top of that list are universal background checks. I have this  conversation over and over and over again--and then I will leave the  floor to Senator Brown and return later--with the President's  supporters, with supporters of the Second Amendment, and with members  of the NRA in my State.   Of course, I have acquired a reputation of being a forceful and vocal  advocate for stronger gun laws in this Nation, and the NRA often  targets me in its advertisements and its emails. I will often be  confronted by my constituents who will see me at a public event. They  will come on a beeline over to me and start confronting me about my  agenda to confiscate their weapons or to take away their guns. Of  course, I try to disabuse them of that notion, and as soon as I can, I  take the conversation to background checks.   I say: Listen, let me ask you a question. Do you think that everybody  who is buying a gun in this country should have to go through a  background check?   Almost invariably, the individual, who just moments ago was so  confrontational with me about the issue of guns--his defenses drop, and  he says: Well, yes. Of course, I support that. Of course, everybody  should get a background check before buying a gun.   I said: You got one, right?   He said: I got one. It was 3- or 4-minutes long. That is not what I  am talking about. I object to all of the other things, but, of course,  I want background checks.   Gun owners support background checks by an 80- to 90-percent margin.  NRA members support it. Polls suggest that 75 to 80 percent of NRA  members support background checks. This is just one of the least  controversial issues that exists out there in the American public  today.   We are going to have a conversation today about the efficacy of these  measures, but we should remember that there are many times when we get  deluded into believing something is much more of a vexing political  conversation than it truly is, and background checks are on that  agenda.   At this point, I yield the floor, and I will come back down later for  longer remarks. I am glad to be joined this evening by Senator Brown  from Ohio.    Madam President, let me thank, once again, my colleagues  for being on the floor with us this evening, for the compelling  testimony of Senator Schatz, Senator Casey, Senator Brown, Senator Van  Hollen, and so many others who have joined us this evening. We have a  few more who will come down later in the evening.   I want to take a moment to put a face on this issue. There are 100  Americans who are killed every day by guns. The majority of these are  suicides, but many are homicides, and many are accidental shootings and  domestic homicides.   Shootings in this country happen at a rate 10 times that of any other  high-income nation. This is a uniquely American epidemic. Senator  Schatz very aptly pointed out that it can't be because of mental health  because we have no more mental illness in this country than any other  nation does. It can't be because of lack of law enforcement resources;  we spend just as much money, if not more, on law enforcement than any  other country in the world. It is not because we put less money into  treatment for mental illness; we put more money, on a per capita basis,  than other nations do.   To explain our abnormally high rate of gun violence--10 times that of  other high-income nations--you have to tell a story of the  proliferation of dangerous weapons, of the ability of almost anyone,  regardless of their criminal history or their history of mental  illness, to get their hands on a weapon. Nowhere else in the high- income world is it so easy to get your hands on a weapon and often a  weapon of mass destruction.   Leo Spencer was born an only child. He grew up in Bridgeport, CT, but  he was far from an only child in his mind. His cousins were like his  siblings. He spent summer after summer after summer with them in  Boston, in Connecticut, in Cape Verde, and in St. Thomas. He was known  as ``Lil Bill.'' His friends described him affectionately as an amazing  person, a phenomenal soul, the greatest friend they ever had, and the  best family member they knew.   A family member said Leo was ``a simple man who loved to keep to  himself, but deep down inside he was a free spirit that wanted nothing  more than to make people laugh. Always joking around, he kept us on our  toes, and his smile lit up the room.''   Another friend said:         Never one to follow trends, Leo was intent on making his       own path through hard work and unparalleled ambition. He was       a creative soul with a deep love for expressing himself       through music and loved fiercely without bounds.    Leo placed a priority on making sure his family and friends were  happy. He made each person feel like they were the most important  person in the world. He loved his parents. He did everything he could  for them. He wanted to take care of his mom the way she took care of  him.   On September 8 of 2019, just a few days ago, Leo was shot in the head  and the neck while sitting in the passenger seat of a friend's car. His  friend hit the accelerator and drove him as fast as he could to  Bridgeport Hospital, but he was pronounced dead shortly thereafter.   Leo Spencer is 1 of the 100 Americans who die every day from gun  violence. It is so much bigger than Leo. I mentioned Leo's cousins, his  family members, and his friends. Their lives will never be the same  either, forever altered.   Studies show that when 1 person dies from a gunshot wound, there are  20 other people who experience life-altering trauma. It becomes a cycle  that becomes hard to get out of.   I will talk a little bit later about Sandy Hook, CT, but Sandy Hook  will never ever be the same--never--after what that community has been  through.   Leo, whether he knew it or not, may already have been affected by gun  violence because when you grow up in places like Bridgeport, where kids  literally fear for their lives when they are walking to and from  school, the trauma associated with the fear of losing your life from  gun violence ruins your brain. We call this a public health epidemic,  not to be cute with our words but because that is exactly what it is.   When you don't know whether you are going to make it through the rest  of the week as a child--and studies show that, criminally, a high  number of young people of color in this country living in urban  environments that are violent don't believe they are going to live past  25 years old--when that is your belief, something happens to your  brain.   Most of us in this Chamber have probably confronted only once or  twice in our lives a fight-or-flight moment. That is a moment in your  life where you face a risk that is so great, a danger that is so acute,  that you have to make a decision in a split second: Do you fight or do  you run? Our bodies are designed to rush into our brains a hormone  called cortisol that helps us make that quick decision.   Many of us may never have actually faced that moment, and, frankly, I  don't hope that anyone ever has. But when you grow up in a place like  the east end of Bridgeport, you face that decision: Fight or flee on a  weekly basis.   What doctors will tell you is that the brains of these kids who grow  up in these neighborhoods are literally bathed in cortisol. Cortisol,  when it comes in and out in an instant once or twice in your life, can  be helpful. But when it is flowing through your circuitry on a regular  basis, it literally corrupts your brain. It corrupts your brain. So it  is no coincidence that all of the ``underperforming'' schools in this  country are in the violent neighborhoods because these kids show up  with brains that cannot learn, brains that cannot cope and cannot  create lasting relationships, brains that have been atrophied by the  daily fear for their lives and their daily experience. This Congress  has done nothing--nothing--to address their reality.   We are here on the floor today to tell you about people like Leo so  that maybe our colleagues who aren't responding to the numbers may  respond to the stories of those lives that have been lost.   Let me tell you another one. Over the winter, we shut down the  government for an unacceptable period of time. We were all figuring out  what to do with our days when we weren't legislating. I decided one day  to take a trip to Baltimore.   Baltimore, in some years, has been the most violent city in the  country with the most kids who are going through this life-altering  cycle of trauma. But I had heard about a program in an elementary  school that was teaching kids how to be entrepreneurs and was giving  them a vision for their lives after growing up in one of the poorest  neighborhoods in Baltimore. They are trying to give them a pathway or a  ray of sunshine in their lives.   I went up to talk to the person who ran that program. Her name is  Joni Holifield. She and I sat down in a classroom on the second floor  of Matthew Henson Elementary School, and she started to explain to me  her path out of the corporate world into programming for kids at  schools like Matthew Henson and what she thought that program could  bring to those kids.   In the middle of this conversation, the intercom starts blaring a  recorded message: code green, code green, code green. I didn't know  what a code green was. Joni didn't know what a code green was. Shortly  thereafter, a teacher opened the door to our classroom and yelled: Shut  the blinds. Turn off the lights.  [[Page S5533]]    We did as instructed, and we sat there a little nervous, not knowing  what a code green was. Shortly thereafter, someone from the main  office, knowing that there was a U.S. Senator in a second floor  classroom, called up. Joni answered the phone and was told that a code  green means there has been a shooting in the proximity of the school  and that the school is on lockdown.   The day that I was there at this elementary school in Baltimore,  there was a shooting within a block or two of the school. Here is what  I found out. That morning there had been a delay in school starting. It  had snowed that morning, so I walked in with all the rest of the kids  at around 9:30, 10 o'clock. About the same time that I was showing up  at the school that morning, a young man by the name of Corey Dodd  brought his two little twin girls to school. He was doing the drop-off  for his wife, who was home tending to their relatively newborn child.   Corey decided to bring the kids to school that morning himself. He  drove home a couple of blocks away after dropping the twins off,  probably right about the time that I was walking upstairs to the second  floor. When he got out of his car, he was shot to death.   One of his other little daughters always sits at the door waiting for  her dad to come home, and she was there waiting for Corey. Her mom had  to tell her that her dad was never coming home. He had been shot  outside of their house that morning.   As that code green was happening inside that elementary school--and  the kids were probably having a little bit of fun, wondering when the  lights were going to come back on--there were two little girls who were  never going to see their father again and who were going to be told in  a matter of hours that this shooting had taken the life of their dad.  And every single kid in that school was going to be wondering: Is it  going to be my dad next? Is it going to be my mom next? That cycle of  trauma and that cortisol that bathes kids' brains were going to be  reality once again for all of these kids in this neighborhood. That is  just one day that I happened to be in Baltimore.   Imagine that it isn't just coincidence. Imagine that is the reality  day after day after day for kids all across this country. Why are we  doing nothing? Why are we sitting on our hands? Why are my Republican  colleagues waiting for the President to give them direction?   It would be one thing if we didn't know what to do--if we were  overflowing with compassion for those two little twin girls in  Baltimore, MD, and for the family of Leo Spencer in Bridgeport and we  just couldn't figure out what would make the situation better. That is  not the case.   We know what will make the situation better. There is no mystery  about it. In my State of Connecticut, we passed a law requiring all  handgun buyers to pass a background check as part of the permit  process. Studies show that there was a 40 percent reduction in the gun  homicide rate after Connecticut passed that law.   You might say: OK, well, that is just one State. And 40 percent--that  is pretty serious. That is a pretty big return on one change in the  law. Give me another State, you say.   OK, let's take a look at Missouri, which did the opposite. A few  years ago, it repealed its purchase permit law that requires you to get  a background check with every sale of a weapon in Missouri. Guess what  happened. A year later, gun homicides went up by 23 percent,  controlling for every other factor that could have explained it. In  fact, during that period of time, gun homicide rates were going down in  all the States around Missouri, and they went up in Missouri.   Then they found out that, in fact, in other States, what did go up in  those other States was the number of weapons used in crimes that came  from Missouri because all of a sudden you didn't need a background  check in Missouri. So if you wanted to traffic guns from another State,  Missouri was the place to get them.   Across the board, when you look at all of the States' experiences,  you don't get 40 percent and 23 percent everywhere, but, on average,  States that have background checks have 15 percent lower homicide rates  than States that don't have them.   If we did this on a national basis, even States that have universal  background checks would benefit. Why? Because the guns that are being  used in Connecticut aren't coming from Connecticut. They are coming  from States with--you guessed it--no universal background checks.   The guns being used in Chicago don't come from Chicago. The guns  being used for crimes in New York City don't come from New York City.  One percent of guns used in crimes in New York City come from New  Jersey. Do you know why? New Jersey has universal background checks.  Those guns are coming up from South Carolina and Georgia and places  where you can go to a gun show and get a whole truckload of guns  without having to ever go through a background check.   Background checks work. They are the most impactful public policy  measure. Since the background check law was passed in the midnineties,  over 3.5 million sales have been blocked to violent criminals and other  prohibited individuals, and that is just the tip of the iceberg because  those are the people who actually have the gall to set foot in a gun  store, knowing that they have an offense in their history that would  prohibit them from buying a gun--maybe not, knowing that. But these are  the people who went into the gun store and tried to buy a gun and got  denied. There are millions and millions more people who wanted guns but  couldn't get them and didn't go into the gun store in the first place.   The problem is, today, getting that denial from the gun store is not  really a barrier to buying a gun because 20, 30 percent of gun sales  now happen without a background check. They happen in a private sale  between one person and another. They happen at gun shows, which are  forums that don't require, under Federal law, background checks.   A man in Odessa, TX, failed a background check because he had been  diagnosed by a clinician as seriously mentally ill. That didn't stop  him from getting a gun. He just found a private seller; he found  another way. The private seller gave him a gun and didn't require him  to go through a background check. He took that gun, and he used it to  kill 7 people and injure 20 more.   I don't think you have to pass a law to fit the last mass shooting. I  think that is a ridiculous trap that people try to put us in. This  isn't the only mass shooting in which universal background checks could  have changed the outcome. One of the first mass shootings that sits in  my consciousness is that in Columbine as another example of a shooter  who got a gun outside the background check system who couldn't have  gotten one through it.   So whether you want anecdotal evidence or statistical data, I have it  all. Background checks work. Here is what is so maddening. People love  background checks. Apple pie, baseball, and grandma--none of them are  as popular as background checks are. Ninety percent of Americans like  background checks. Show me any other public policy today in the United  States of America that gets 90 percent support in this country; 80  percent of gun owners and 70 percent of NRA members, everybody wants  background checks--universal background checks. They don't want  Manchin-Toomey, which just expands background checks to commercial  sales. They want H.R. 8. They want H.R. 8, which has passed the House  of Representatives and has been sitting on the floor of the U.S. Senate  for 202 days. That is what Americans want. Ninety percent of Americans  support H.R. 8.   Don't tell me that this issue is controversial. It is just  controversial in this bubble. It is not controversial out in the  American public, and it is not a blue State or a red State issue.  Background checks are just as popular in Georgia as they are in  Connecticut.   As Senator Schatz said, we don't have to wait for the President to  tell us what to do. Senator McConnell has a different copy of the  Constitution than I have. My copy of the Constitution says that none of  us are required to get permission slips from the President before we  act or before we do something that we think is good for the country.   It is wild to me how the Republican leadership is so eager to  advertise that the Senate will do nothing unless President Trump gives  it permission. He is not the most popular guy. I don't  [[Page S5534]]  know why my friends on the Republican side would just openly admit that  they don't act unless the President tells them it is OK. That is not  how it has to be. We can make the decision ourselves, and on this one,  every single person here should do it because it is the right thing,  and it is also going to win you a lot of support back home.   I have a few more colleagues who want to say a few words, and then I  may wrap up at the end. I want to finish, in my last 5 minutes or so,  by reading something to you. I apologize to my friend Neil Heslin  because I made a commitment to read this every Father's Day after the  shooting in Sandy Hook. I forgot to do it this year. This is a makeup  effort.   I don't want to talk too much about what happened at Sandy Hook this  evening. I have spent plenty of time talking to my colleagues about it.   Unfortunately, there is a macabre club of Senators and Congressmen  who have now had to walk with their communities through these horrific  mass shootings. Maybe there is not another one like Sandy Hook where 26  7-year-olds lost their lives in a matter of 5 minutes, but they are all  terrible. They are all awful.   One of the things that happens in the wake of these mass atrocities  is that you get to know the victims' families. You get to know the  parents, the brothers, and the sisters. They become friends of yours. I  feel like I have a personal obligation to the families of Sandy Hook  separate and aside from the global obligation I believe I have to human  beings in this country to do something about the issue of gun violence.    Amongst the parents, one of those whom I have become closest to is a  gentleman by the name of Neil Heslin. Jesse Lewis was one of the  children who lost their lives that day. Neil has had an up-and-down  life--an up-and-down life. He would admit that to you. It hasn't been  an easy life for Neil. Jesse was Neil's best friend, not just his son.   I tell his story every Father's Day because it is a reminder to all  of us who are fathers how none of us are protected from this. Neil  thought he was. Neil never ever thought this would happen to him, but  it did. It is a reminder that but for the good grace of God, any of us  could be a victim, any of us could know a victim. So why sit on our  hands and do nothing when we could do something?   Let me finish by reading an excerpt from Neil Heslin's testimony that  he gave to the U.S. Senate in February 2013, 2 months after his son was  shot, and I will wrap up after I finish this page and a half of his  testimony.         My name is Neil Heslin. Jesse Lewis was my son. He was a       boy that loved life and lived it to the fullest. He was my       best friend. On December 14, he lost his life at Sandy Hook       Elementary because of a gun that nobody needs and nobody       should have a right to have. I'm here to tell his story. I       know what I am doing here today won't bring my son back, but       I hope that maybe if you listen to what I say today and you       do something about it--maybe nobody else will have to       experience what I have experienced.        On December 14, Jesse got up and got ready for school. He       was always excited to go to school. I remember on that day       that we stopped at the Misty Vale Deli. It's funny the things       you remember. I remember Jesse got the sausage, egg and       cheese he always gets, with some hot chocolate. And I       remember the hug he gave me when I dropped him off. He just       held me, and he rubbed my back. I can still feel that hug.        And Jesse said ``It's going to be alright. Everything's       going to be okay, Dad.'' Looking back, it makes me wonder.       What did he know? Did he have some idea about what was about       to happen? But at the time I didn't think much of it. I just       thought he was being sweet.        He was always being sweet like that. He was the kind of kid       who used to leave me voice messages where he'd sing me happy       birthday even when it wasn't my birthday. I'd ask him about       it, and he'd say ``I just wanted to make you feel happy.''       Half the time I felt like he was the parent and I was his       son.        He had so much wisdom. He would know things, and I would       have no idea how he knew. But whatever he said, it was always       right. And he would remember things we'd done and places we'd       been that I had completely forgotten about. I used to think       of him as my tiny adult. He had this inner calm and maturity       that just made me feel so much better when I was around him.        Other people felt it, too. Teachers would tell me about his       laugh, how he made things at school more fun just by being       there. If somebody was ever unhappy, Jesse would find a way       to make him feel better. If he heard a baby crying he       wouldn't stop until he got the kid to smile.        Jesse had this idea that you never leave people hurt. If       you can help somebody, you do it. If you can make somebody       feel better, you do it. If you can leave somebody a little       better off, you do it.        They tell me that's how he died. I guess we still don't       know exactly what happened at that school. Maybe we'll never       know. But what people tell me is that Jesse did something       different. When he heard the shooting, he didn't run and       hide. He started yelling. People disagree on the last thing       he said. One person who was there says he yelled ``run.''       Another person said he told everybody to ``run now.'' Ten       kids from my son's class made it to safety. I hope to God       something Jesse did helped them survive that day.        What I know is that Jesse wasn't shot in the back. He took       two bullets. The first one grazed the side of his head, but       that didn't stop him from yelling. The other hit him in the       forehead. Both bullets were fired from the front. That means       the last thing my son did was look Adam Lanza straight in the       face and scream to his classmates to run. The last thing he       saw was that coward's eyes.        Jesse grew up with guns, just like I did. I started       shooting skeet when I was eight years old. My dad was vice       president for years at a local gun club. . . . Jesse actually       had an interest in guns. He had a bb gun. . . . I taught him       gun safety. He knew it. He could recite it to you. He got it.       And I think he would have got what we are talking about       today. He liked looking at pictures of army guns, but he knew       those [guns] weren't for him. Those were for killing people.        Before he died, Jesse and I used to talk about maybe coming       to Washington someday. He wanted to go up the Washington       monument. When we talked about it last year, Jesse asked if       we could come and meet the President.         [I'm a] little cynical about politicians. But Jesse       believed in you. He learned about you in school and he       believed in you. I want to believe in you, too. I know you       can't give me Jesse back. Believe me, if I thought you could,       I would be asking you for that. But I want to believe that       you will think about what I told you here today. I want to       believe that you will think about it and then you will do       something about it, whatever you can do to make sure that no       other father has to see what I've seen. You can start by       passing [legislation to take] these senseless weapons out of       the hands of people like Adam Lanza.    Do something, he said. Do something. Seven years later, we haven't  done anything.   So we are down here on the floor tonight begging our colleagues to  put a bill on the floor. Amend it, debate it, do whatever you want, but  let's not stay silent any longer.   I yield the floor.
