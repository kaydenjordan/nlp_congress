 Madam Speaker, I thank the Representative from  California for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Today, we are here to discuss H.R. 2116, which would clarify that it  is a Federal crime to discriminate based on an individual's hair. But  we are also here to discuss H.R. 963, the FAIR Act, which bans  arbitration clauses in private contracts.   H.R. 963 makes it clear: The intention is to remove arbitration as a  legal tool for the American people while preserving arbitration with an  exemption for labor unions. The belief is that the American people need  Washington watching over their private contracts. I assure you, those  in Minnesota's Seventh District do not need them.   The bill purports to ban forced arbitration. This is misleading  rhetoric. Forced or involuntary agreements are already illegal. So,  what would this bill really do?   It would insert the Federal Government into the private contracts of  citizens and remove their ability to settle disputes outside of the  courtroom through predispute arbitration agreements.   This bill pretends to empower plaintiffs, but by voiding arbitration  clauses in the context outlined in the bill, it would effectively end  most arbitration entirely, even when that arbitration would benefit  those most impacted.    Because the bill fundamentally changes an arbitration clause from a  mutual commitment to use an alternative dispute resolution method into  a one-sided election for an injured party, contracts will be far less  likely to include the option to arbitrate.   If parties cannot agree in advance to arbitrate, the plaintiff may  never have access to arbitration. These unintended consequences will  have real-life implications, especially for those who lack deep pockets  and do not have the possibility of a high-dollar settlement that some  of the more affluent individuals do.   Democrats are also ignoring how arbitration is generally a good way  to resolve disputes. They seem to assume that all arbitration is  secret, that arbitration automatically keeps individuals from going to  the authorities or publicizing their experiences. But agreeing to  resolve a case outside of court is different than agreeing to silence.   That distinction matters here because much of the push for this bill  comes from concern about secrecy rather than whether justice can be  served in the arbitration context. And despite that emphasis, the bill  does not actually address confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements.                                time  1230    Additionally, arbitration is often less expensive and more efficient  than litigation. It tends to be less adversarial, which allows parties  to continue doing business together after the dispute is resolved. That  is why so many Americans choose to enter into contracts with  arbitration clauses in them.   Voting for this rule is a vote for a bill empowering Washington to  micromanage the business life of Americans. Voting for this rule is to  take away freedoms from Americans. Congress should stand ready to  improve the legal system, and we must make sure that whatever we do  will actually be an improvement for the American people.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule and the underlying bills.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment  to the rule to provide for consideration of Congresswoman McMorris  Rodgers' and Congressman Westerman's American Energy Independence from  Russia Act.   I ask unanimous consent to include the text of my amendment in the  Record along with extraneous materials immediately prior to the vote on  the previous question.    Madam Speaker, while the majority is continuing their  agenda of misguided woke policies, constituents in my district continue  to send me photos of their energy bills and prices they are paying at  the pump.   Since President Biden took office, gasoline prices are up more than  50 percent, natural gas is up more than 25 percent, and diesel fuel is  up more than 47 percent. These price increases are on top of crippling,  unprecedented inflation. They are attacks on Americans of every stripe,  class, and creed.   When adjusted for these factors, wages and salaries are actually  below prepandemic levels. My constituents are pleading with the  majority to focus on this issue rather than the idealism filled with  Green New Deal pipe dreams.   To further explain the amendment, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Madam Speaker, under the Trump administration, the  U.S. became a net exporter of petroleum for the first time since 1958.   Under President Biden's leadership, starting with the revocation of  the Keystone XL pipeline, the U.S. is back to being a net importer of  petroleum and is expected to continue through this year. This is  unacceptable, and our constituents are paying dearly for it.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Dakota  (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, every action the Biden administration  has taken since Keystone's cancelation has increased our foreign  dependency on oil. June 2021, 5 months after canceling Keystone, the  Biden administration suspends leasing of ANWR. Three months later, the  White House calls on OPEC to boost oil production. Two months after  that, the Biden administration stopped efforts to modernize the NEPA  permitting process for domestic extraction.   Every action this majority has taken is directly responsible for the  prices  [[Page H3758]]  consumers are seeing today. Fortunately, the solution to this problem  is very simple.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Johnson).    Madam Speaker, the prices American consumers are  paying at the pump is directly affected by how much oil is produced  domestically. Canceling American oil production jobs, while seeking it  from dictators, is not only nonsensical, but it also is against our  national interest.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gooden).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, how long will the House continue to attack the basic  freedoms of the American people? It is not for Congress in Washington  or some bureaucrat to tell the American people what they can and cannot  do when revolving disputes. That is, frankly, none of their business.   If they want to agree to an arbitration clause before a dispute  arises, that is for the American people to decide and not Washington,  who think they know better than the American people.   It is not our job to micromanage the lives of our constituents. It is  our job to safeguard their freedom.   We need to consider the unintended consequences of this legislation.  There are many policies in this well-intentioned bill, but if it  becomes law, contracts will be far less likely to include the option to  arbitrate. This may not be an issue for people with deeper pockets and  the ability to hire attorneys, but it will be a concern for those who  do not have the option of a high-dollar settlement.   We must also keep in mind that sometimes arbitration is the best way  to solve disputes. This is just one of the many aspects of this bill  that needs to be reconsidered before we can move forward.   I oppose this bill, and encourage my colleagues to do the same.  Everyone has the best intentions.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
