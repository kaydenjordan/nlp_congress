 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the  bipartisan bill H.R. 397, the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions  Act. This bill would allow pension plans to get back on their feet and  ensure retirees receive their promised benefits.   We must act quickly to ensure that Americans who contributed to their  multiemployer pension plans will not have their financial security at  risk. That is why I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 397. This bill provides  financial assistance to financially troubled multiemployer defined  benefit pension plans covering about 10 million, mostly working-class,  Americans across the country.   The financial assistance provide by the bill consists of loans with a  30-year repayment term. Multiemployer pension plans are collectively  bargained pension plans covering employees with two or more employers.  Retirees, workers and their families, who rely on these plans are  losing benefits earned over a lifetime of work through no fault of  their own.   As an example, the Central States Pension Fund in my district has 10  employers covering more than 1,500 participants. Some of the top  employers using Central States Pension Fund are YRC Inc., ABF Freights  Systems, Penske Truck Leasing Co., DHL Express, and Air Express  International. Without this financial assistance, pensions of truck  drivers, electricians, ironworkers, bakers, and many more would  continue to be cut significantly--putting their families' financial  security and future at risk.   Mr. Speaker, the growing number of families in our country relying on  their pension plans is growing and can no longer go unnoticed. We now  have an opportunity to help these families protect their financial  security.
