 Mr. Speaker, I want to focus a light today on the ongoing  humanitarian crisis unfolding at our southern border. This week,  President Biden once again refused to visit the border saying: ``There  are more important things going on.''   It is no surprise the President doesn't want to go to the border  because he would have to confront the crisis that his rhetoric and  policies have created.   Unlike the President, I have visited the border. During my visit, one  thing became crystal clear: his catch-and-release policies have  dramatically escalated the crisis. Law enforcement told me about how  coyotes bring women and children across the border trafficking and  sexually abusing them along the journey.   Data underscores the impact that President Biden's rhetoric has had.  CBP reports show that Southwest land border encounters have increased  almost fivefold in 2 years.   I have a message to the President: It is time to address the border  crisis. It is time to stop the drug and human trafficking. And it is  time, Mr. President, to finish the wall and reinstate the policies to  remain in Mexico.                            ____________________
