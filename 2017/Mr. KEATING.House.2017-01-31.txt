 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in strong support of my legislation H.R. 665, the  Airport Perimeter and Access Control Security Act.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be joined by my colleague from New York  (Mr. Katko), as well as my colleagues, Ranking Member Thompson, and  Members Rice, Richmond, and Swalwell.   Since I first was elected to Congress in 2010, I have worked to  secure our Nation's airports from porous perimeters and unsecure access  control points.   Last year, at my request, the Government Accountability Office  released an independent report of all airports within the  Transportation Security Administration's presence.   While TSA has made some progress in assessing risks at airport  perimeters and access control security points, the GAO report revealed  that the agency had not taken emerging threats or the unique makeup and  design of individual airports into consideration.   More and more, we have seen that terrorists are targeting the soft  areas in our airport perimeters and within the airport itself.  Terrorists are looking for these soft targets. We have seen it in  Europe. We have seen these tragedies in Brussels. We have seen it in  Istanbul. And, sadly, we have seen it here at home in Fort Lauderdale.   Updating the risk assessment of airport secured with information that  reflects the current threat ensures that TSA bases its decision on the  latest information, enabling it to focus limited resources to the  highest priority risks to airport security.   The TSA's efforts to access, really, our entire airport security  around the country, has been, frankly, inadequate. The numbers are  startling. From 2009 to 2015, TSA conducted comprehensive risk  assessments at only 81 of the 437 commercial airports nationwide--or 19  percent. Some years, this really represented only 3 percent of the  airports that were assessed at all.   The Airport Perimeter and Access Control Security Act will make law  the recommendations from the independent report and increase safety at  airports nationwide. Further, this bill incorporates the input of major  airport operators--whose concerns for lack of individualized security  strategy we heard from firsthand.   Last year, the Associated Press revealed that there had been at least  268 perimeter security breaches at 31 major U.S. airports. From 2004 to  2015, their investigation found that intruders breached airport fences,  on average, every 13 days.   This figure includes a fatal incident, a tragic incident that I  investigated before I came to Congress as a district attorney when  Delvonte Tisdale, a teenager from North Carolina, snuck onto the tarmac  at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport and stowed away undetected  in a wheel well of a commercial 737 on a flight to Boston.   The figures I mentioned really don't account for the many unreported  instances of perimeter breaches, including things like trespassers or  people that scale the fences around the perimeter.   We are lucky that all of these individuals did not harbor nefarious  intentions. But that does not mitigate the risk posed by such behavior  at airports, employees and others, and the passengers and travelers who  rely on TSA officers and the airport operators for their security.   As you may recall, this legislation passed the House of  Representatives with the support of my colleagues last year and has  been a long time coming.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone that worked so hard to make this bill a  reality, and to have the success it did last year, and, hopefully, go  all the way and get enacted into law this year.   The recent tragedies demonstrated at airports remain a steady target  for terrorists and nefarious actors. This bipartisan legislation will  close loops in the airport security practices and procedures and bring  us closer to ensuring that the access control points and the perimeters  of all of the unique designs are as secure as possible.   Passage of H.R. 665 is an important step in the safety of passengers,  pilots, and the airport employees.   I thank the chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee again, Mr.  Katko; the full committee ranking member, Mr. Thompson; and  Representatives Rice, Richmond, and Swalwell for joining me in  requesting this report and in supporting this legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 665.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 665.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) for  her work on this bill.   Over the past several years, the Government Accountability Office has  examined various Department of Homeland Security programs and concluded  that the Department has not followed standard best practices for  acquisitions management. Though DHS has taken steps to improve its  performance, there remains specific deficiencies in how it carries out  major acquisitions.   When a DHS acquisition program falls short in terms of effectiveness  or efficiency, this not only risks undermining that program, but also  risks wasting the limited homeland security dollars that are available  to us. We owe it to the American public not to repeat our mistakes.   This bill is intended to strengthen accountability for the  acquisition and use of border security technology by the Department of  Homeland Security. This bill would require all major acquisitions for  border security technology to have written documentation of costs,  schedule, and performance thresholds and demonstrate that the program  is meeting these thresholds.   The bill also requires coordination and submission to Congress of a  plan for testing and evaluation, as well as the use of independent  verification and validation of resources for border security  technology.   Addressing border security technology acquisitions is an important  step toward bettering acquisitions and  [[Page H785]]  management overall. We owe it to the American taxpayer to make sure we  are managing these investments wisely and preventing wasteful spending.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 505 aims to focus and improve the way we invest and  manage border security technology by providing a specific framework for  accountability and oversight on behalf of the American taxpayer. I urge  my colleagues to support this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 505 to  have transparency, accountability, and efficiency of vital border  security technology projects.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 505, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 677, the CBRN Intelligence and Information  Sharing Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, last Congress, the Committee on Homeland Security held  several hearings to evaluate Federal, State, and local capabilities to  prevent, identify, and respond to a chemical, biological, radiological,  or nuclear attack, a CBRN threat.   Although the State and local stakeholders we heard from were  generally aware of the evolving CBRN threat, there was a consistent  message from everyone who testified--from public health professionals  to emergency managers, to first responders--improved information  sharing would make our communities safer.   H.R. 677 would facilitate improved CBRN information sharing by  directing DHS to analyze CBRN-related terrorist threats and share  relevant threat information with Federal, State, and local  stakeholders. These activities will both improve situational awareness  at all levels of government and help DHS grant recipients better target  their limited grant dollars to address this particular threat.   The CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act passed the House  overwhelmingly last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support the  measure once again.   Information sharing is at the core of our ability to prevent, thwart,  and respond to threats posed by bad actors. H.R. 677 would facilitate  information sharing in the CBRN space where the threats are constantly  evolving. This commonsense legislation costs next to nothing but will  reap significant benefits.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 677.   I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 677,  this legislation that will enhance the sharing of CBRN-related threat  information.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 677.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 678, and I would like to thank the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally).   I rise in strong support as a cosponsor of H.R. 678, the Department  of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2017.   Since coming to Congress, I have worked to enhance and secure  intelligence information sharing among both domestic and international  partners. A key mechanism to fostering such information sharing has  been the development of a network of fusion centers across the Nation.  These centers allow Federal intelligence and homeland security  information to be shared with State and local law enforcement and other  key stakeholders.   For fusion centers to realize their full promise, it remains critical  that personnel assigned to fusion centers be able to access Department  of Homeland Security information, data, and personnel.   In the course of conducting oversight of fusion centers, the  committee has learned that not enough State and local analysts and  officials assigned to these centers have the TS/SCI clearances  necessary to foster the timely sharing of homeland security information  and intelligence.                                time  1530    H.R. 678 would authorize the DHS to sponsor such State and local  analysts for security clearances. Last Congress, this bill passed  unanimously by our committee.   I urge the passage of H.R. 678, the Department of Homeland Security  Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2017. This is legislation that will  help ensure that key fusion center personnel have access to the  security clearances they need to keep our communities secure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one of the core missions of the Department of Homeland  Security is to share threat information with State and local first  responders. Fusion centers are a key mechanism for that process. As  fusion centers continue to mature into national assets, Congress must  ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is supporting fusion  centers with the resources that are needed to keep our communities  safe.   I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 678.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 678.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
