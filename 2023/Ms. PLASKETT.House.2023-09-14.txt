 Mr. Speaker, we find ourselves in a critical juncture  in our Nation's history. You have heard my colleagues say that we have  16 days left. That is only 9 legislative days away from a government  shutdown.   The extreme MAGA Republicans in the Republican Conference are driving  the entire Republican majority to time and time again pursue their  divisive agenda at the cost of American lives. This would inflict  untold harm upon millions of hardworking families and jeopardize our  national security. This is not governance; this is political  gamesmanship.   Let me be clear. They have chosen to embark on a perilous path that  threatens the very fabric of our government and the well-being of our  citizens in an attempt to slash vital investments in healthcare,  childcare, education, and food assistance.   This senseless self-manufactured crisis would disrupt critical  government services. I implore my colleagues across the aisle to stop  playing political games and join us in the commitment to the American  people.                            ____________________
