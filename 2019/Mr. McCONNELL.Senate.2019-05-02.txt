 Mr. President, in March, the Senate narrowly passed a  resolution that would have misused the War Powers Act and actually  hampered efforts to bring the conflict in Yemen to a close.  Fortunately, the President vetoed it.   So today, Members will have a second chance to send the right message  to our partners in the region, to important humanitarian missions, and  to eradicating al-Qaida from the Arabian Peninsula. I urge my  colleagues to vote to uphold the President's veto.   The resolution before us starts from false premises. We are not  parties to the civil war in Yemen. We are no longer providing even air- to-air refueling.   More important, the resolution would make it actually more difficult  to prevent the loss of innocent lives. This resolution would require  U.S. advisers to cease training and intelligence sharing operations  that help pilots avoid civilian casualties. And it would dry up U.S.  noncombat support to the weakened, U.N.-recognized government in Yemen.   The resolution would also create serious new problems for the U.N.- led diplomatic mission that is doing all it can to negotiate an end to  the bloodshed.   Abandoning our Yemeni, Emirati, and Saudi partners just as diplomatic  efforts are starting to make progress is hardly the way to give them  the confidence to take the hard diplomatic steps that are necessary.   An abrupt withdrawal of U.S. support for the coalition would be good  news for Iran, for the Houthi rebels they support, and, of course, al- Qaida, as well.   I share many of my colleagues' serious concerns about aspects of  Saudi Arabia's behavior, but the best way for us to encourage better  behavior from our partners is to remain involved with Saudi Arabia and  the UAE, not push them into the arms of Russia and China.   The War Powers Act is a blunt tool, and not at all the right vehicle  to productively or diplomatically express concern about the behavior of  close partners of the United States.   The Senate passed a more nuanced resolution in December of last year,  and it has many other tools to register concern and disapproval. If  Senators want to play a productive role in this conflict, I would  encourage them to meet with Saudi, Emirati, and Yemeni officials, to  travel to the region, and to hold hearings on this important matter.   But for all the reasons I have laid out, this particular resolution  is a particularly bad idea. I urge each of my colleagues to join me in  setting it aside and upholding the President's veto.                            ____________________     Mr. President, a few weeks ago, a majority of the  Senate took a modest step to revise some of our institutional  traditions and process the President's nominees for lower level  positions in a more fair and expeditious manner. At the time, our  Democratic colleagues protested angrily. They had gladly supported a  [[Page S2580]]  nearly identical procedural step in 2013 when it stood to benefit  President Obama. Now, with a different occupant in the White House,  apparently the same principle just doesn't apply.   They said their unprecedented delays and obstruction were justified  because this administration's nominees were so controversial. They said  there were legitimate reasons why they had forced cloture votes on 40- plus different positions for the first time in history and wasted so  much floor time.   My Democratic colleagues insisted these were highly controversial  people. Well, Republicans knew better, so we took the sensible step to  expedite the proceedings for these lower level nominations. It is time  to take a look at some of the individuals who have been moving through  under these new procedures and how controversial they are.   This week alone, we have now confirmed the Energy Department's  general counsel by a vote of 68 to 31; the Director of the Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 72 to 27; and an Assistant Secretary of  State, 90 to 8. Yesterday afternoon, we advanced the nominations of  three district court judges with 64 votes, 89 votes, and 94 votes.  Obviously, they are really controversial people we have been talking  about here.   We aren't talking about lightning-rod partisans here. These are  abundantly qualified, noncontroversial public servants. They are the  kinds who used to go in big groups by voice vote. The two leaders would  put together packages and voice vote them. Well, our friends across the  aisle aren't letting that happen.   Now we are beginning to make better progress, nonetheless. Now that  we are finally able to get these people voted on, our Democratic  colleagues mostly don't oppose them. It would be almost comical if it  weren't a sad reminder of just how totally pointless the past 2 years  of obstruction have been.   But it is also a hopeful sign as we move forward. After studying and  considering these nominees, the Senate will keep on filling traditional  vacancies. We will keep confirming the President's team. We will keep  giving the American people the government they actually voted for back  in 2016.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as I have mentioned, there has been a  remarkable development this week in the House. The Rules Committee held  the first hearing to discuss Medicare for None. It was another  demonstration of how disconnected our Democratic colleagues' agenda has  become from the best interests of working Americans and middle-class  families.   The last 2 years have been a case study on how much American families  benefit when Republican policies get out of the way. Helped along by  tax reform, regulatory reform, and other efforts, the country is seeing  starkly low unemployment, faster wage growth--more opportunities for  more families to get ahead and build their lives.   Rather than admit the obvious, our Democratic colleagues are choosing  to double and triple down on jacking taxes back up and making families  cede a larger role for Washington in their daily lives.   We have heard the pitch on healthcare. They want to trade seniors'  Medicare and all private, employer-sponsored health insurance plans for  a one-size-fits-all Federal plan and the higher taxes needed to pay for  it.   Just yesterday, a new report from the CBO confirmed that such a  scheme would substantially increase Federal spending and could lead to  longer wait times, worse quality of care, and a system less responsive  to patient needs.   On top of that, we know what our Democratic colleagues tried to sell  families when it comes to the Green New Deal: a Washington, DC, war on  our domestic energy that would cost Americans their jobs, increase  families' bills, forcibly change the homes Americans are allowed to  live in, industries they are allowed to work in, and, of course, the  cars they are allowed to drive.   Let's remember that all of this self-inflicted economic pain would  not really buy any meaningful gains in terms of carbon emissions. For  the better part of the last decade, as U.S. emissions actually  declined--emissions have been going down--our largest competitors, like  China, continued to emit more and more.   Hog-tying the U.S. economy in the name of further emissions  reductions would do nothing but give the largest emitters license to  keep on emitting while poaching American jobs in the process.   I don't think real progress is actually the point here. Facts are not  the motivating factor. My colleagues on the left think these self- inflicted national injuries just feel like this greening of America is  the right thing to do. They just feel it.   Case in point, I understand that House Democrats are planning to pass  a measure today that would try to force the Trump administration to  remain in the 2015 Paris Agreement on greenhouse emissions. This is the  big international deal that the Obama administration cheered on. It  doesn't even pass the laugh test.   One expert analysis noted this week that even a generous estimate  puts the impact of America's participation on global temperature  reduction well within the margin of error: One-hundredth of 1 degree  Celsius. In other words, he points out, it is a completely unmeasurable  effect--tons of redtape and real economic damage for zero measurable  effect. That is my friends across the aisle in a nutshell on this  issue. Tie America's own hands for no benefit, while China and our  other international competitors go roaring right by, all so a few  pockets of high society can pat themselves on the back at the next  cocktail party.   House Democrats may see this as exciting political theater, but the  middle-class Americans I represent give it two thumbs down. So this  futile gesture to handcuff the U.S. economy through the ill-fated Paris  deal will go nowhere here in the Senate. We are in the business of  actually helping middle-class families, not inventing new obstacles to  throw in their paths.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
