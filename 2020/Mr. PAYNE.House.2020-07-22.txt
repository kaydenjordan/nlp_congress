 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from  North Carolina for allowing me several minutes to pay my respects to a  great man.   And it is not remiss that I see the Speaker pro tempore; it is very  appropriate that you are in the seat tonight, sir.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John Lewis. He was an American  icon, civil rights legend, and dear friend and an inspiration to  millions. Yet, these words truly fail to describe the difference he  made in our country.   He always spoke of ``getting into good trouble,'' and I know that has  been echoed here on numerous occasions, but it sums up what Mr. Lewis  was all about.   His efforts led to the Civil Rights Act. His efforts led to the  Voting Rights Act. And his efforts led to the Congressional Black  Caucus, and even the election of President Barack Obama.   But his loss is more than his legacy. For me, once again, I have lost  one of my fathers on the floor of Congress. He was a role model for  what makes a great Congressman, and I constantly watched as he moved  about his business: Like the way he always fought for the right thing;  the way he could convey such power and strength through such a gentle  demeanor.   But when he had passion, and was committed, there is no one else on  this floor you would rather have with you going into that fight.   And the way he stood up to abuse to make this country a better place.  One of my greatest honors was to be a part of the sit-in he led on the  House floor to fight for gun control legislation after the terrible,  dreadful Florida issue. We got into some good trouble that day.   He inspired us then, and his words and deeds will inspire new  generations; whether they are civil rights pioneers, elected officials,  or any American with a dream or cause.   God bless you, Mr. Lewis. Your life made our country and our world a  better place.
