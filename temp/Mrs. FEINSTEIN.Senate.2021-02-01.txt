 Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce a bill to  facilitate improved access to the Indian Health Service's Desert Sage  Youth Wellness Center in Hemet, California. My colleague Senator Alex  Padilla (D-CA) is joining me as an original cosponsor of the bill.   The Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center is the only currently operating  center in the State of California that provides culturally-sensitive  substance use disorder treatment to indigenous youth.   The Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center, located in Hemet, is run by  the Indian Health Service. The facility not only provides healthcare,  but also academic support, family therapy, and treatment plans to  support the healing and long-term recovery of youth enrolled at the  Center.   Currently, the Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center is only accessible  by a dirt road. This limits access to the Center during California's  extreme wet and dry seasons. The dirt road frequently cracks or floods  during these times and creates significant challenges to those  depending on the Center's important work.   The Indian Health Service does not currently have the authority to  buy land from willing private landowners who are supportive of selling  their land to provide for a paved access road. It is necessary that we  provide for safe and dignified access to the center, and I am pleased  to reintroduce this legislation to do so.   This commonsense bill would authorize the Director of the Indian  Health Service to purchase land from willing sellers and construct a  paved road to improve access to the Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center.  After the road's construction, Riverside County would maintain it.   This bill has the support of local stakeholders, including Riverside  County. An identical, bipartisan bill is being introduced by  Representatives Raul Ruiz (D-CA), Ken Calvert (R-CA), Nanette Barragan  (D-CA), Tony Cardenas (D-CA), and Pete Aguilar (D-CA) in the House of  Representatives.   This bill passed the Senate unanimously last year, and I look forward  to working with my colleagues this Congress to enact this bill into  law.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce a bill to  facilitate improved access to the Indian Health Service's Desert Sage  Youth Wellness Center in Hemet, California.
