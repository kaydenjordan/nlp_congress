 Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to extend my  warmest congratulations to the Springfield, Massachusetts, Citadel of  the Salvation Army, The Republican newspaper, El Pueblo Latino  MassLive, Reminder Publishing, and The Westfield News upon the occasion  of celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Toy for Joy campaign.   Founded in the early 1920s by the Bowles family, the Toy for Joy  program has been a century-long collaboration between The Salvation  Army and The Republican, with roots going back to The Daily News and  the Union News, providing toys and books to children in need throughout  the Pioneer Valley.   Sustained by the spirit of giving through periods of war, economic  depression, and health crises, Toy for Joy has benefited thousands of  families when they needed it most.   Thanks to the hard work of countless volunteers, along with the  generosity of the people of western Massachusetts, Toy for Joy has  continued to fulfill its mission of bringing Christmas joy to the  children of our region during the holiday season.   Toy for Joy is a cherished initiative in western and central  Massachusetts, and I, like others, want to wish it many more years of  success and prosperity.                            ____________________
