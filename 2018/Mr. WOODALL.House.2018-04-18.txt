 Mr. Speaker, I rise, unexpectedly, on tax day. You  probably woke up on Monday morning this week thinking Tuesday was going  to be tax day, as most of America did, but, lo and behold, when the  IRS' payment system crashes, suddenly we are now deeming today tax day  rather than yesterday. While it is a surprise to be speaking on tax  day, that collapse of the website sort of makes my point.   I want to talk about the great successes that we have had working  together, collaboratively, over the last 14 months to move the American  Tax Code in the right direction, and then I want to talk about what we  can do together to do even more.   You may have seen some of the headlines in the Washington, D.C., tax  rags today, Mr. Speaker, folks talking about the House Ways and Means  Committee and how we are prepared to begin to do more. The Senate may  be a little bit reluctant to do more. At some point, it is going to  require an outpouring of public support to do more.   Let me tell you what I mean by ``more.''   When we began the process of tax reform here in the House, Mr.  Speaker, we were talking about tax reform first and tax cuts second,  reform being that everyone knows that they have to pay taxes. Taxes are  certain. But it doesn't have to be complicated. It doesn't have to be  an additional burden.   Writing the check is burdensome; figuring out how to calculate how  much to write the check for doesn't have to be. But it has grown that  way in this country, Mr. Speaker, and we set about trying to change  that in the House.   Now, I have a bill in the House called H.R. 25. It is the Fair Tax  Act. It would  [[Page H3437]]  actually take the American Tax Code and shift it, for the first time in  100 years, away from an income tax-based system and return it to the  consumption tax-based system on which this country began.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, I don't know if you have looked at the numbers  recently. We are the only OECD country that doesn't have a consumption  tax.   As you know, the power to tax is a power to destroy. If we want to  get rid of something like cigarettes, we tax them in the hopes that  there will be less of it.   Well, by the same token, when we tax income, guess what. We send the  incentive that there should be less of it. We tax productivity. The  harder you work to feed your beautiful family, Mr. Speaker, the more  that the American Government takes from you.   You look at these young people coming out of college. They are trying  to save for their future. They are trying to pay back those student  loans. They are trying to make it all work by themselves for the very  first time. The harder they work, the more hours they put in, the more  we decide we are going to take right off the top.   It doesn't have to be that way.   Now, the tax cuts that we passed in December, Mr. Speaker, as you  know, lower the American tax burden for the first time in a long time.  In fact, a poll out recently said that fewer Americans believe they are  overtaxed today, matching record low levels.   I think that is a step in the right direction. I think that speaks to  kind of the collective sigh of relief that you feel across the country  among entrepreneurs and those who want to start their own business and  families trying to put food on the table. I am glad that we have that  collective sigh of relief, but can we do more?   Today, we were talking about reforming the IRS, Mr. Speaker. I have  got a list here--H.R. 5444, H.R. 5445, H.R. 2901, H.R. 5440, H.R. 5438,  H.R. 5446, H.R. 5437, H.R. 5439, H.R. 5443--all bills that this House  has considered this week designed to make the IRS serve the American  taxpayer better. That is a long list of bills, Mr. Speaker, and that is  worth celebrating. We took a big step this week in trying to make the  IRS more responsive to the American people.   Not to be a pessimist, Mr. Speaker, but when you have to share with  this agency every penny you earn, everyplace that you earned it, share  with them how you spent it, the places that you gave it, when you gave  it, sometimes why you gave it, what you purchased with it, right on  down the line, Mr. Speaker, I would argue that your wife may know less  about your family finances than the IRS does. If not in your family,  certainly in many families, we tell the IRS things we would not tell  members of our family.   We place an incredible amount of power and responsibility in the IRS'  hands. And I want to be clear: This isn't an IRS institutional problem.  The IRS didn't ask for this authority. This is a 435-Members-of-the- U.S.-House problem. We put this authority in the IRS' hands. We gave  them an untenable task of wielding this power without abuse. That is  why you have almost a dozen bills, Mr. Speaker, today to reform them.    Making those reforms is important, but is there a better way? Do we  have to have the IRS involved in every aspect of our financial life? I  am here to tell you that the answer is no.   H.R. 25, the Fair Tax Act, Mr. Speaker, moves us to a consumption  tax, which says that we are going to tax you based on what you spend,  not on what you earn. So I no longer need to tell the IRS what I  earned, where I earned it, and how I spent it.   When I get taxed on what I spend, I am not sending that information  to the IRS. I am getting taxed while I am at the store. I am getting  taxed at Home Depot. I am getting taxed at Kroger. I am getting taxed  at Publix. I am getting taxed at Macy's. I am getting taxed on  amazon.com.   When we tax based on what people consume instead of what they earn,  we end that disincentive to earn, and we begin to ask that people ask  more serious questions about what they purchase.   Mr. Speaker, today, as American workers are going off to produce  high-quality American goods, they are doing so at a disadvantage. Most  nations, as I mentioned earlier, have a consumption tax, which means  that, when the Germans produce an automobile and they send it to  America, they have a consumption tax--a value added tax, in their  case--that had been taxed on that car that had been sold in Germany.  Since they are shipping it to America, they remove that tax and send  that car to America tax free. We pay taxes on it when we purchase it.   Not so when the American car goes to Germany. The big BMW plant in  South Carolina producing BMWs, when that car is produced, all of the  embedded taxation of the corporate taxes BMW is paying and the payroll  taxes BMW workers are paying, all of those taxes are built into the  price of that BMW. When we ship it out for sale to the rest of the  world, the price of that car is higher because Americans built it.   That is just nonsense.                                time  1915    Why in the world have we chosen to disadvantage ourselves relative to  the rest of the world?   Well, when you choose to have an income tax and when you choose to  have a payroll tax, you then choose to bury those costs in the price of  your goods and services. It is a competitive disadvantage of America.   I mentioned payroll taxes, Mr. Speaker. You may not know, but payroll  taxes are the largest tax that 85 percent of American families pay. Let  me say that again.   We just had this whole long debate over reforming the income tax  system, and it was an important debate to have. We had this whole  debate about how it is we can provide more money in workers' paychecks  by changes to the income tax system. It was an important debate to  have. But 85 percent of American families pay more in payroll taxes-- that FICA tax you see, it is 15.3 percent of everything that you earn-- pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes.   So the time is going to come that we are going to have to gather  here, Mr. Speaker, in this Chamber to have a debate about how we reform  the payroll tax system.   The payroll tax system is very important. It funds Social Security  and Medicare. We want those programs to be successful. We know that as  we sit here today, the revenue streams are not sufficient to make those  programs successful. So if you believe in those programs, we need to  have those conversations today about the Fair Tax, Mr. Speaker, the  only tax bill in Congress that examines the payroll tax as the lead  reform mechanism of tax reform.   We went in and we changed the corporate tax system in the tax cuts  bill last year, Mr. Speaker, and we did a good job there. We took it  from being the absolute worst Tax Code on the planet in terms of  competitiveness and we moved America to about the top five. That is  good news. Not worst to first, but worst to top five. I will take it.   When Ronald Reagan and the Democrats did tax reform back in 1986,  they then moved America from worst to first. In the intervening 30  years, the rest of the world caught up with America, surpassed America,  moved us back into last place. We moved ourselves last December into  the top five.   My question is, Mr. Speaker, when did it become an American value,  when did American exceptionalism begin to be defined by being in the  top five, one of the folks out in front?   My definition of American exceptionalism is being number one, being  the very best, setting the standard, letting the rest of the world  follow.   The Fair Tax encompasses that by recognizing that businesses don't  pay taxes. They just collect taxes. They collect them from their  employees in the form of lower wages, they collect them from their  customers in the form of higher prices, they collect them from the  owners of capital in the form of lower returns to pension plans for  American retirees, but businesses don't pay taxes. There is no secret  drawer that a business dips into to pay its tax bill. It is lower  wages, higher prices, or lower rates of return.   Well, recognizing this, and we did a lot of recognizing of that  during this tax reform debate, we have now lowered the corporate tax  rate to the lowest rate in my lifetime.  [[Page H3438]]    The question is, now that we are seeing the benefits of that, we are  seeing money plowed back into workers' paychecks, we are seeing wages  rise--and we are not having the discussion of minimum wage here  anymore, Mr. Speaker, because businesses across the country can't find  enough employees, they are raising wages on their own, they are putting  bonuses out there on their own. Those businesses have more money in  their pockets and they are putting it in the pockets of their  employees.   There is not a business in your district, Mr. Speaker, that doesn't  recognize the most important asset that business has is a motivated and  loyal workforce. Employees are the most valuable asset that a business  has. Those employees are rewarded when the business succeeds.   Why is it that now that we are seeing that, now that we are  recognizing that, we see the reality that when you put more money back  in the business, that business puts more money back in a paycheck, why  don't we go the rest of the way? Why don't we move America back from  worst to first one more time, abolish that corporate income tax,  recognize that businesses don't pay taxes, they just collect them from  their employees?   That reduction of corporate income taxes so far, Mr. Speaker, has led  to bonuses for more than 4 million American workers, wages rising  across the board at the highest level in years, unemployment at a  sustained level lower than ever before recorded.   Mr. Speaker, the Tax Code is one of those things that people can use  to pick winners and losers, and an income Tax Code particularly lends  itself to pick winners and losers.   The Fair Tax says let's not pick winners and losers; let's have one  rate that everybody pays on everything that they buy. Let's recognize  that consumption is a better form of taxation than income is, again, as  the only OECD country that does not have a consumption tax, and let us  recognize that there is even more economic growth that we can squeeze  out of the American economy today.   You have seen the capital investment that comes from the immediate  expensing that was included in the last tax bill, Mr. Speaker. Well,  immediate expensing is the same as not taxing that investment at all.  It is what I am saying. Instead of just being for some purchases, for  some investments, it would be for all purchases, for all investments.   We gave businesses that benefit in December. Four million workers and  counting have received bonuses, wages rising faster than they have in  years.   What about repatriated earnings, Mr. Speaker? How are we advantaged  as a Nation by trapping earnings overseas?   If a company can't bring its earnings back to America to invest in  America, what is it going to do? If those earnings are trapped  overseas, they are going to get invested overseas, they are going to  build that next plant overseas, they are going to make that next  purchase overseas. How in the world are we advantaged as a Nation by  trapping earnings overseas?    Well, we recognized that we are not. We recognized that by lowering  the repatriation rate, we have brought back trillions of dollars. That  return to America is continuing, but we can do more. That corporate  rate going to zero does more.   The Tax Code is the only regulatory action we take, Mr. Speaker, that  disadvantages America relative to the rest of the world for no benefit  whatsoever.   Let us concede that we have bills to pay as a Nation and we are going  to raise the revenue to pay those bills.   Now, having conceded that we are going to raise the revenue to pay  those bills, let's raise that revenue in the simplest, least  economically destructive way possible: a consumption tax. Milton  Friedman would tell it. If you don't believe Nobel laureate economists,  you can look at State experiments across the country. If you don't  believe those State experiments, you can look at changing tax codes in  our neighboring countries around the world, our allies around the  world.   We have a choice in how we collect revenue, and H.R. 25, the Fair Tax  Act, is the most comprehensive recognition that we can do away with the  income tax, we can repeal the 16th Amendment that even made the income  tax possible in this country. We can return to a consumption tax so  that we all have skin in the game in how this government is run and  operated. We can ensure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare by  changing the way we collect the revenue stream for those programs.   We can put more money in workers' pockets by eliminating the largest  tax that 85 percent of American families pay in eliminating that FICA  tax. We can put America back on top economically, as we tried to do in  1986, as we saw happen during the 1990s as a result of those Tax Code  changes, and we can return America to being an exporter to the world,  not just an importer from the world.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have that debate. If someone believes that  disadvantaging the American worker is valuable in some way, let's talk  about it. If someone sees a hidden benefit to making it harder for the  rest of the world to buy American goods, let's talk about it and let me  understand those benefits with you.   But if you share my vision of American exceptionalism, that being in  the top five isn't good enough, that being number one, being the  leader, being the definer of success is the only thing that is going to  be good enough for the families that each and every one of us  represent, then go back and look at H.R. 25 one more time.   I understand, having just passed tax reform, the largest tax reform  in a generation, folks wonder if we are able to do even more. We can.   I understand that having this tax day to be the very last tax day  that any American family has to deal with the old, complicated code,  folks wonder, can we do even better for next tax year. We have already  done better for next tax year, Mr. Speaker, but we can do even more.   Take a look at the Fair Tax. Dozens upon dozens of your colleagues  have already recognized its merits. Dozens upon dozens of your  colleagues have already recognized our opportunity to stop fighting the  economic battle with one arm tied behind the American worker's back.   I celebrate the success that we achieved together, Mr. Speaker. I  celebrate the coming together in the name of making a better economy  possible for American workers and their families. Let's take that  success and let's build on that success, and let's not have this be the  last tax day that we celebrate.   Let's celebrate today that we will never have to deal with the old  Tax Code again, and let's anticipate that day where we will never even  have tax day again, because in the absence of an income tax, the  American family need never deal with the IRS again.   Let's eliminate April 15 as tax day. Let's make it just another  beautiful spring day. Let's relieve the American family of the burden  of complying with the Tax Code. Let's free the American family and  American businesses to do what is in their own family's and their own  business' best interest.   Make tax day just another day, Mr. Speaker. Support the Fair Tax.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 27 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, April 19, 2018, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
