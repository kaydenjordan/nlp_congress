 Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. Fleischmann).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good) for the purpose of a  colloquy.    Madam Speaker, I would now like to address several  issues today and maybe give it a little bit of a different spin or a  little bit of different observations than people are getting from some  of the other congressmen.   I was glad today to vote to suspend normal trade relations with  Russia and, hopefully, reduce the number of oil imports we are getting  from that country.  [[Page H4428]]    Every day, you cannot help but be touched by the reports from Ukraine  and what is happening to the civilians there.   Nevertheless, I am a little bit concerned about the public statements  coming out of Washington. I believe we should all be working to end  this war and wind up with a free Ukraine.   Nevertheless, to end this war, we will eventually have to get to the  bargaining table, and I am afraid that statements being made by both  sides will make it more difficult to reach an end result. The sooner  the war ends, the more lives of Ukrainian troops will be saved, the  more lives of Ukrainian civilians will be saved, and, quite frankly,  the more lives of Russian troops will be saved.   To negotiate a final deal, both sides must realize and respect that  deal, and both sides must feel that they came out of the negotiation  with something.   I sure hope we are not in the current position we are right now 3 or  4 months from now. I would encourage all of my colleagues, and also the  President of the United States, when they make public statements, to  ask themselves: Are we getting closer to ending this war by my  statements, or are we not getting closer to ending this war?   I suppose politicians always think about politics. But I sometimes  think statements are made for political effect rather than reaching the  serious goal of ending this conflict.   I would also like to follow up on what is going on on the border and  the danger that we may soon end title 42. I think for the future of the  United States, the most important thing going on--what is going on in  Ukraine is important. The most important thing is what goes on at the  border.   We all know that around the time President Biden took office, about  20,000 people a month, and sometimes well under 20,000 people a month,  were crossing the border, for a variety of reasons. The major one is, I  think the current administration isn't really thrilled about enforcing  our laws. We have gone from having under 20,000 to 80,000 or 100,000  people a month cross our southern border, people who are not vetted,  people who we, in many cases, would not want here under any  circumstances.   There is a danger that in May, that 80,000 to 100,000 figure is going  to jump to 400,000 or 500,000 people a month. People are not being  vetted, and people are coming from all around the globe.   I will be there next week. When you get down there and you talk to  the Border Patrol, you will find people not only coming from Mexico but  more people from Central America, people from the Caribbean, people  from South America, people from sub-Saharan Africa, people from eastern  Europe, people from countries that are currently hostile to us are  being waved through after they get a minimal amount of paperwork. We do  not need to increase that to 300,000 or 400,000 or 500,000 people a  month.    The last time I was down there, I noticed that there were a lot of  photo IDs of people from Central America and South America being thrown  away before they checked in. What does that tell you? It means people  don't want us to know about their past. They are running away from  their past as they enter our country.   I remember the statement of John Adams: ``Our Constitution is only  fit for a moral and religious people.'' We have to make sure we are  getting a moral group of people crossing our southern border, not to  mention we have to make sure we are getting people who respect our  laws.   We, right now, swear in over 800,000 people from around the world  every year. That is fine. They are appropriately vetted. I encourage  all citizens to watch as people come here legally and are sworn in.   Our economy cannot accept another 400,000, and we know a given number  of these people, perhaps, have a criminal background and are not going  to help our country.                                time  1415    Not to mention, no country as successful as ours, can accept an  unlimited number of people. We are not prepared for them. They have not  been adequately trained in the way of the American ideals, the  importance of our Constitution, why we have our Constitution.   Furthermore, having been down there, the more people you let in, the  more it strengthens the Mexican drug gangs, and those gangs make $3,000  or $5,000 or $9,000 or $20,000 per person who comes across here. We are  strengthening their power. We are making them wealthy. Why would we  want to expand the current fiasco south of the border?   Last time I was down there, the Border Patrol told me about fights  between Mexican and Chinese gangs on our side of the border. How do  these people from these gangs get here? They cross the border  illegally. Is it helpful for the United States to have open warfare  between Chinese and Mexican gangs? That is what we are getting more and  more.   Our poor, underappreciated Border Patrol, more shots directly at  them. And what does the administration do? Rather than strengthen the  border, we propose legislation giving them free college, college that  American citizens have to go $30,000 or $40,000 or $50,000 in debt to  get.   Rather than hire more Border Patrol to enforce the border, we hire  more people to investigate the Border Patrol. I am not sure what  psychological problem we have going on here. It is the same  psychological problem that looks at, say, a city like Milwaukee that is  approaching 200 homicides a year, and saying we have to investigate the  police, or we have to make it easier to sue the police.   That same mindset at the southern border says we have 100,000 people  here who shouldn't come here every month? I know what we will do, we  will hire more people to investigate the Border Patrol and make sure  they are not doing anything wrong. They think the Border Patrol are the  bad people.   Another problem, and I don't know whether this has occurred to  President Biden's advisers, I don't know whether you wanted a war in  Ukraine, but I don't believe that war would have started if we wouldn't  have had an open borders policy. What do you think countries like Iran  or China, or Russia make of us having an open border and not enforcing  our border laws? Normal countries don't do that. They think it is  because we have such a weak President who will never do anything. It  invites trouble.   I have felt for a year-and-a-half or 2 years that the open borders  policy was inviting mischief; and that is what we have now, mischief  that I don't believe would have happened had we tried to enforce our  border laws.   Please, Mr. President, keep title 42. Fire the Vice President from  her position as border czar. That is another problem we have.   As mentioned, next week I will go and tour part of the border in San  Diego and Yuma. I have been in many other parts in the past. But I go  down there to learn more directly from the Border Patrol. As is common  from all agencies, you learn a lot more from the people doing the work  than the bureaucrats at the top, and I look forward to coming back and  reporting whatever grim statistics I gather from talking about the  Border Patrol and their suggestions to save our country.   I hope all Americans listening and paying attention are contacting  their Representatives and Senators about what is going on on the  border. I personally believe one of the reasons that President Biden is  threatening to remove title 42 is because the news is dominated with  what is going on in Ukraine, and now is the time you could get away  with really opening the floodgates. But if we are going to save our  country, we have to enforce the borders like we would in any normal  country.   By the way, an excuse for removing title 42 is saying that they feel  that COVID is no longer a threat. If you look, over 500 people a day on  most days are dying of COVID. It is still a problem. Right now, or at  least the last time I was down there, they didn't even feel they had  the legal ability to test people as to whether or not they had COVID.  As long as that situation is out there, I beg you to keep title 42 in  place. It is bad enough having 80,000 to 100,000 people crossing here  every month who we have not vetted.   The next crisis that I would like to address today is an ongoing  crisis. It has been a problem in this country for 50 years, but I think  things keep getting worse. And that is the decline in which Black Lives  Matter would refer to as the Western traditional family. Again and  again, bills are introduced  [[Page H4429]]  around here to provide benefits, and the traditional nuclear family is  left out of those benefits; be it an increase in the earned income tax  credit or flooding more money into low-income housing, increases in  food share, increases in Pell grants, increases in childcare.   All of these programs an average married couple are not eligible for  because in the traditional family, usually at least one parent and  sometimes two are working. In order to be eligible for these programs,  you have to put yourself in a position in which you are considered in  poverty, and if you are in poverty, you are eligible for governmental  assistance.   I had a woman in my district who had two children who were both  $30,000, $40,000 in debt from going to college complain why did her  sister's kids get free college while her own kids are stuck paying off  their debt? She was proud of her children; she was proud they were  current on their student loans, but it didn't seem right to her that  her niece, who was raised in a nontraditional family, or what Black  Lives Matter would consider a traditional family, her niece got free  college paid for by the government, whereas her kids had to work to pay  off the student loans.   I hope in the future, as we dole more money out of this place, we  stop discriminating against and showing hatred for the traditional  family. I will point out, that I think over time more and more  Americans are catching on to the idea that materially they can get  benefits that they wouldn't get if they didn't get married.   I will point out some statistics on SNAP benefits. Between 1996 and  2016, a 20-year gap--and these are both years in which the economy is  doing well, so I am comparing apples to apples--the number of people on  SNAP jumped up from about 25,000 to 44,000. Taking those two years,  about a 50 to 60 percent increase in the number of people on SNAP.   Now, we have to make sure people can eat. I realize all people can go  through a tough time in their lives, where there are some people who  may have mental problems or such, that makes it very difficult to hold  a job, but when you have a 50 to 60 percent increase in 20 years on the  number of people who have arranged their life that they are eligible  for SNAP, people better wake up because we are destroying the  traditional family in America.   I hope in the future the majority party, as they put together more  budgets, or if the Republicans ever get the majority, when they get the  majority, that they would begin to look at this problem. It is not a  new problem that gets press like a surge at the border will get press  or a disaster in Kyiv will get press, but it is an ongoing problem as  we eat away at the traditional nuclear family of this country, and it  is being eaten away by the programs that are passed by this Congress. I  hope if the Republicans take control, even though it is not a sexy  issue because it is an ongoing issue, I hope they do something about  this hatred or discrimination against the traditional family.   Now, I will make one more point, I make it as much as I can, before I  leave this podium today. One more time I am going to talk about vitamin  D. In part I am going to talk about it because there was an expert in  vitamin D who I ran into last night from Maryland who, again, brought  up that he felt he had a cocktail which was about 100 percent  successful in curing people from COVID if they get it.   If any of the Speaker's office is paying attention, I would be happy  to give them the name of this individual. Maybe it is something that  should be given to the Speaker.   But the new cocktail, in part, is based on substantial amounts of  vitamin D. A week and a half ago I talked to Dr. Dror of Israel who  commented on the importance of being vitamin D sufficient. In his  Israeli study, with a small number of people, he found that people who  were vitamin D deficient were 11 times as likely to die of COVID if  they were hospitalized as people who were not vitamin D deficient. He  was using a very low threshold, 20 nanograms per milliliter. Eleven  times more likely to die if you were vitamin D deficient.   I don't know what is wrong with our Department of Health and Human  Services on this. I talked to Secretary Becerra. It is something that  the American public should have been educated on 18 months ago. I  personally have known nine people who have died of COVID. I always  wonder how many of those would still be alive today if they had done  half as much to push vitamin D as they did with all the other  advertising, pushing masks, pushing social distancing, what have you.   But with 500 people dying a day, it is still something that should be  publicized. I have written a letter to Secretary Becerra; and 14 times  less likely to wind up with serious COVID once hospitalized. Among  people hospitalized, of the people who didn't have enough vitamin D-- under 20 nanograms--25 percent died. If they had over 20 nanograms, 2.3  percent died who wound up hospitalized in Israel. Kind of dramatic  numbers. News you can use.   Those are some of the comments or issues of the day that I think the  press should be paying attention to. I thank the indulgence of staff  for giving us the hour. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
