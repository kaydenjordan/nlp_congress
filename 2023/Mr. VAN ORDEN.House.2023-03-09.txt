 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the  life of an exceptional young man, David John Chase of La Crosse,  Wisconsin.   David passed away November 1 of last year at the age of 15 after a  courageous 10-month battle with an aggressive form of brain cancer for  which there was no cure.   Despite facing a tremendous battle, David displayed courage and  compassion far beyond his years. In the midst of battling this  incurable brain cancer, David was far more concerned about his family  and how they were impacted by his diagnosis.   David's selflessness and care for others around him was a constant  presence throughout his life. He volunteered his time at Immanuel  Lutheran Church in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and hoped one day to serve in  the United States military and later have a career in construction. He  wanted to work with his hands and he wanted to build America. He knew  at his young age that this is what he wanted to do.   Most of all, David loved his family. One of his favorite memories was  hunting deer in Ettrick, Wisconsin, with his dad.   David leaves behind a legacy of bravery, selflessness, and love.   I extend my deepest condolences to David's family--his parents,  Jennifer and Abraham; his grandmother, Diane, who is here in the House  gallery; and his brother, Landyn, who was David's caretaker and is with  his grandmother today in the gallery.   God bless David and his family, and God bless the United States of  America. We will miss this young man.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  Biden administration's rule defining the waters of the United States,  or WOTUS.   I am not going to mince words. These proposed changes would be more  aptly named ``WOKEUS,'' as they are confusing, partially nonsensical,  not based in science, and will cause many unintended consequences that  the Biden administration has clearly not contemplated.   Under this new rule, over 85 percent of the waterways in Wisconsin's  Third District would be subject to EPA regulation. In many places,  these rule changes will actually harm the environment, as many of the  farmers in my district are pioneers in environmental stewardship.   They have dug retention ponds that collect agricultural runoff, and  then the nitrates and phosphates settle to the bottom. They recycle the  water and these important nutrients, which actually lowers the costs  and prevents them from entering the watersheds in the Mississippi  River.   If this ``WOKEUS'' goes into effect, these revolutionary farming  practices will stop and these agricultural byproducts will wind up in  our actual navigable waterways. Then what will the Biden administration  propose doing? Fining our farmers, putting them out of business, and  increasing the food costs that are already out of control due to the  out-of-control spending of the Biden administration.   Mr. Speaker, I stand with the farmers, and they stand in support of  the CRA. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand with  them.                                time  1315
