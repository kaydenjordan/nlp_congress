 Madam Speaker, I rise in gratitude for the service and  sacrifice of the brave troops, diplomats, aid workers, and others who  served in Afghanistan over the last 20 years, and for those who are  still there on the ground working heroically to defend and evacuate  American civilians and our Afghan partners.   Madam Speaker, I remain deeply concerned about the deteriorating  situation in Afghanistan, and I am calling on the administration to use  every available tool to ensure that we not only protect and evacuate  American personnel, but as many of our Afghan partners as possible.   I applaud the administration for picking up the pace of evacuations  over the weekend and for expanding the perimeter around the airport in  Kabul in order to increase access for evacuees and to avoid the  developing humanitarian crisis.   But we cannot stop there. Thousands more are at risk, including  journalists, women's rights activists, and NGO employees. I am calling  on President Biden to establish a special humanitarian program  specifically for these groups and other highly visible activists in  Afghanistan; to increase processing capacity at USCIS; and to  immediately ensure the safe exit from Afghanistan of all priority 1 and  2 visa holders to third countries.   Getting citizens out of harm's way must remain our top priority, but  we also cannot abandon our Afghan allies.                            ____________________
