 Mr. Speaker, malevolent actions and accidents give an  opportunity for people to rise to heroic actions. America is a country  familiar with heroes.   At a sad and awful event this weekend in Nashville, Davidson County,  at a Waffle House where four individuals were killed and four injured  by a crazed individual with an AR-15, a man named James Shaw, Jr.,  rallied all of his courage and strength to rise to the occasion of  heroics, to get the assailant, take his gun from him, and to save his  life and other people's lives.   James Shaw, Jr., is a lifetime Nashvillian. He didn't plan to be a  hero that day, but he rose to the occasion. I take my hat off to him  and commend him for his actions in saving other lives.   Just a week or so earlier, we had a Southwest Airlines plane that  would have crashed if it weren't for a great pilot, possibly, a plane  that, tragically, had a piece of the wing come off and fly into the  airplane and cause the death of a passenger and chaos on the plane.   The pilot, a trained Navy fighter pilot, Tammie Jo Shults, stayed  calm and brought that plane in safely without any other loss of life or  injuries. She is a Sully part 2: Sullenberger, who took that plane in  New York and landed it in the river and saved a lot of people's lives.   We all honored Sully, as we should and should have. We need to honor  Tammie Jo Shults in the same way. She is Sullenberger part 2. And James  Shaw, Jr., of Nashville is a hero of the same dimension, and he saved  many American lives. Those acts need to be remembered, reflected upon,  and honored. I do so today, and I know other Members of this House do  as well.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        April 24, 2018, on page H3457, the following appeared: THE  HEROIC ACTS OF JAMES SHAW, JR., AND TAMMY JO SCHULTZ  Mr. Speaker, malevolent  actions and accidents give an opportunity for people to rise to  heroic actions.
