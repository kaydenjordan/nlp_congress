 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an American hero and a  proud son of New Jersey, Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone, and I offer  this bill to name the post office in Raritan, New Jersey, in his honor.   Gunnery Sergeant Basilone is an exemplar of brave service in our  Armed Forces, and a member of the Greatest Generation, whose collective  bravery and selflessness won World War II and liberated millions from  oppression.   In Congress, there are many actions we take to honor and remember  those who serve our Nation. These commendations matter. Younger  generations ask whose name is inscribed on monuments and flag posts or  on Federal properties; and in retelling these stories, we inspire young  Americans to appreciate the generations that came before in public  service.   Sergeant Basilone, indeed, has a tremendous story. Born on November  4, 1916, in Buffalo, New York, he was 1 of 10 siblings born to  Salvatore and Dora Basilone. His father, an immigrant from Italy, and  his mother, a native of Manville, New Jersey, decided to raise their  family in the Somerset County, New Jersey, Borough of Raritan.   At just barely 18 years of age, a young Basilone decided to enlist in  the United States Army in the 1930s. He would begin his military career  with a tour of the Philippines.   In the Army, he was popular, extremely well-liked. He boxed and  contributed to a sense of camaraderie that put the young men who were a  world away from home at ease. He would later be honorably discharged  from the Army and return home.   But in 1940, the trumpet summoned him again, and he re-enlisted, this  time in the Marines. He would be dispatched to the height of battle in  the Pacific theater.   Sergeant Basilone and many fellow marines were part of Operation  Watchtower to regain territory in Guadalcanal, the site of a Japanese  airfield. On August 7, 1942, the group took the airfield and defended  it bravely from Japanese attempts to reconquer the territory.   In October of 1942, the Japanese began another land attack to regain  control of Guadalcanal. Sergeant Basilone fought bravely for 2 days and  [[Page H9817]]  ultimately contributed to the annihilation of a considerable portion of  the Japanese regiment.   In a moment of selfless service to his fellow marines, Sergeant  Basilone endured brutal enemy fire during the assault to assist nearby  machine gunners in trouble.   Seeing the immediate danger, he killed eight encroaching Japanese  soldiers and quickly provided aid and equipment to the pinned marines.  He saved many lives that day and, in later testimony, his fellow  marines credited Sergeant Basilone's gallantry and heroic conduct for  saving their lives, actions that would earn him the Medal of Honor in  recognition of his actions at Guadalcanal.                                time  1445    Sergeant Basilone would return home for a short time, selling war  bonds to continue doing what he could for the country he loved and the  work of which he was so proud.   However, staying stateside was not where he wanted to be. He  volunteered to go back to the Pacific. Before he left Camp Pendleton  and returned to battle, he married Lena Mae Riggi on July 10, 1944.   One of Gunnery Sergeant Basilone's greatest traits was his tremendous  regard for the safety of his fellow warriors. He could not let the  narrow escape in Guadalcanal happen again, so he worked diligently to  train recruits on proper machine-gun use. His trainees became known as  the Basilone Boys.   One of his recruits, William Douglas Lansford, spoke of the pride and  confidence Gunnery Sergeant Basilone instilled in him. ``We wanted to  be just like him,'' Lansford was known to have said.   While he could have remained stateside at home with his new wife, he  insisted on staying with the Basilone Boys. Gunnery Sergeant Basilone  and his men stormed the shores of Iwo Jima with the first wave of  marines on February 19, 1945.   The Japanese returned heavy fire. Sergeant Basilone ran toward one of  the block houses, the source of Japanese fire, and quickly destroyed it  with grenades and demolitions. After this, he scrambled to rescue an  American tank that was trapped in a minefield.   But in a moment that will forever live in our hearts, Sergeant  Basilone and a handful of his fellow marines were then hit by heavy  mortar fire. He died alongside the brave men who stepped forward to  serve this country and the men he wanted to return to battle to protect  and defend.   Thanks to his bravery and his fellow marines, the Allied Forces were  able to complete the invasion. He would be awarded, posthumously, the  Navy Cross, the United States Navy's highest decoration, for his  sacrifice and service on that fateful day, becoming the only marine in  the war to receive both the Navy Cross and the Medal of Honor.   In the generations that have followed, Sergeant Basilone has  rightfully taken his place as an American hero of the Second World War.  Raritan has held a parade in his honor every September. His statue  stands in the heart of the borough. His legacy of love and service to  the country has been maintained by his extended family, such as his  niece Kim Van Note, through the Basilone Foundation. Kim joins us today  in the House gallery.   Gunnery Sergeant Basilone, more than self, his country loved, and it  is that great love of country and an American spirit I hope that  inspires future generations for years--might I suggest, decades--to  come. It is the least we can do in the House of Representatives to name  Raritan's post office in his honor. I am honored to sponsor this  legislation.
