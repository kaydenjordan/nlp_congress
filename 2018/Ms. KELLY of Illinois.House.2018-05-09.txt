 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome Reverend  Andrew D. Singleton, Jr., pastor of Victory Apostolic Church in my  hometown of Matteson, Illinois, as today's guest chaplain.   For more than 20 years, Pastor Singleton has been a powerful and  positive force in our community working to improve the lives and  futures of our neighbors while tending to their spiritual needs.   Pastor Singleton has a unique gift of communicating a message of  faith, justice, and equality across generations. I could not be prouder  to welcome him and his inspirational voice to Capitol Hill, especially  at this critical time for our Nation.   I hope his words serve as an example and challenge to this Congress  to redouble our efforts to uplift and empower families and communities.   Thank you, Pastor Singleton, for joining us and leading us in prayer.                            ____________________
