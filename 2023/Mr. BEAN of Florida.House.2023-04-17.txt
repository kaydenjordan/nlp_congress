 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to stand before you  and lead this Special Order tonight.   I have a message. That message is our Nation's higher education  system is being purchased and manipulated by the Chinese Communist  Party.   America needs a wake-up call. I thought that wake-up call would come  in the form of a Chinese spy balloon. If it was the Chinese spy balloon  sent to wake us up, it seems that America has hit the snooze button.   A few weeks ago, several members of the Education and the Workforce  Committee were briefed on the scheme, the manipulation of the Chinese  Communist Party on higher education in the USA, and we were all  shocked. It was a shocking report, and we wanted to share the truth of  how China is infiltrating and taking control over higher education in  the United States.   Since 2013, $12 billion has poured into our higher education system  from foreign sources. China is by far the largest of foreign donations  since that time.   Between 2013 and 2020, U.S. universities accepted nearly a billion  dollars from Chinese donations. The tuition paid by Chinese students is  estimated to be over $12 billion per year. It is time we look at this  influence and take it seriously.   It started over 20 years ago, Mr. Speaker, that China has been  playing this game of infiltration, manipulation, and trying to purchase  influence. It started with this game they play that they call the  Confucius Institutes. These centers teach Chinese languages and culture  but avoid discussing China's widespread human rights abuses and present  Taiwan as undisputed Chinese territory.   They are simply a propaganda machine funded and directed by the  Chinese Government, and we haven't even gotten started on what they are  stealing from us, Mr. Speaker.   Tonight, members of the Education and the Workforce Committee and  other invited Members are going to tell the story of just how far China  has been infiltrating our university system. You are going to hear how  top colleges and universities have not fully reported donations from  foreign sources, including that of the Chinese Government.   You are going to hear the administration is not enforcing existing  laws requiring full reporting of these foreign sources.   Universities, in their desire to seek donations from the public,  sometimes unexpectedly or overtly take money from foreign sources and,  in this case, many times from the Chinese Government.   You are going to hear also how the United States is losing the  technology edge that we have long enjoyed for many years in computing,  science, and engineering, all kinds of energy sources where we were the  dominant player, but now because of theft and China's influence in our  university system, those edges in technology are now leaning China's  way. You are going to hear about that.                                time  2045    So, Mr. Speaker, as we begin tonight, I just want to say that it is  long overdue that we hear the truth and we are fully aware how bad  China is.   I would first yield a few minutes to the chair of Education and the  Workforce Committee, the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  California (Mr. Kiley).   Mr. Speaker, for those just tuning in, China is manipulating and  trying to peddle influence among our higher universities, and Members  are standing up and saying enough.   A few weeks ago, and to great amazement, we saw this Chinese spy  balloon that cruised over our most sensitive sites in our country.   We were told we were blocking it from transmitting any data at the  time, but now we have found that that spy balloon was transmitting  pictures and information of our most sensitive military and nuclear  sites in real time.   Who knows? I don't know if we will ever find out the true damage of  that espionage break. Why on earth it wasn't shot down, I don't know.  But what about the things we can't see? We can't see what China is  doing to buy influence and to infiltrate our university systems.   Mr. Speaker, somebody that is going to tell us his angle on it is a  gentleman who was part of a delegation that just last week went to  Taiwan, went on an Asia tour to meet with leaders about just exactly  what is going on over there.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Moran).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's higher education system is being purchased  and manipulated by the Chinese Communist Party. You have heard about it  and we keep hearing about it. China can't keep up with our Nation's  unrelenting free market system that is constantly innovating, so the  only way they see to catch up with us is to cheat and steal our  intellectual property and infiltrate our university systems and steal  our discoveries. It has got to end.   Let's hear more about what China is doing to manipulate our  university systems.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Owens), the distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on Higher Education  and Workforce Development.    Mr. Speaker, our Nation's higher education  system is being purchased and manipulated by the Chinese Communist  Party. You have heard from various Members giving you details of how it  is done, but we need somebody who can give us the big picture.   We need somebody who can give us big ideas. We need somebody who can  give us big solutions. There is only one guy that can do that, Mr.  Speaker.   I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, our Nation's higher education  system is being purchased and manipulated by the Chinese Communist  Party. Tonight, you have heard from various members of a fantastic  committee and other Members, led by Dr. Virginia Foxx, shining the  light on just how bad it is, just how blind an eye that we have turned  to it for the last 20 years.   We now realize through donations and purchases and influence in  sending their kids here to school, as well as something called the  Confucius Institutes, that it is all for the propaganda and a way for  China to infiltrate and manipulate our higher education system.   Mr. Speaker, where do we go from here? We have work to do, including  alerting America, which is what we are doing tonight, but also alerting  our higher ed, our leadership in our universities and colleges, to let  them be wary of any foreign donation coming into their institutions,  particularly anything coming from China should be a red flag.   The Department of Education should immediately enforce existing laws.  Should we make a new law? How about enforcing the laws that are already  on the books requiring these institutions, some of the biggest names in  higher ed, to report foreign gifts and grants?   The Biden administration should ban Confucius Institutes and all  collaborations between U.S. institutions and Chinese entities  affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security immediately.   Congress should also consider withholding State and Federal funds  from colleges and universities that resist efforts to eliminate CCP  influence operations.   Lastly, the State Department--Mr. Biggs said it so well. The State  Department must review applications from adversarial countries,  including the CCP, the background and research plan of every applicant  for a student visa. We need to say no. We need to say no to the CCP  coming in, getting our information, and then going back home.   We have lots to do, but it starts with alerting the American people.  We have done that tonight. The rest of the work is up to this Congress.  It is up to the administration to enforce our laws and to hold these  universities and China accountable for exactly what they are doing,  which is manipulating and using undue influence in our higher education  system. It stops now and going forward.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
