I know       where to get the money from. Nobody else does.    On January 24, 2015, Mr. Trump said:         I'm not a cutter. I'll probably be the only Republican that       doesn't want to cut Social Security.    Mr. Trump did not make these statements in the middle of the night.  It wasn't an ambush interview with some reporter who caught him off- guard. This was one of the centerpieces of his campaign for President.  And I think whether you are a Republican or a Democrat or Independent  or whatever you are, you will acknowledge that Mr. Trump said: I am not  a conventional Republican. I am going to do it differently. Everybody  else, all the Republicans, they want to cut Social Security, Medicare,  and Medicaid. And he is absolutely right. They do. But he made a  promise to the American people that he would be different, that he  would not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   President Trump sends out tweets every single day, but the American  people are waiting, are still waiting for that one tweet which says: I  will keep my promise. I will not cut Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid, and if Republicans give me legislation to do that, I will  veto that legislation.   In fact, the President could save us all a whole lot of time if he  would get on the phone now with the Republicans in the House and some  here in the Senate and say: Hey, save your efforts. Don't waste your  time because if you bring me legislation that will cut Social Security,  cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, I am going to veto it.   If President Trump sent that tweet, it would save us all a whole lot  of time but, more importantly, it would tell millions of seniors who  today cannot make it on $13, $14, $15,000 a year in Social Security  that he will not make their lives more difficult. He will tell seniors  who are struggling with difficult, painful, costly illnesses that he is  not going to devastate Medicare.   He will tell low-income people who are trying to survive on minimum  incomes that he will not take away the health insurance they have  through Medicaid, and he will tell middle-class families and working- class families that, no, they do not have to worry that their parents  can remain in nursing homes and have those bills paid by Medicaid.   What I think the American people are worried about is not just that  Mr. Trump has not yet sent out that tweet. We did get a tweet about  Arnold Schwarzenegger and how well he is doing on his TV show--we got  several tweets about that--but we did not get the tweet that tells  seniors and working people they do not have to worry about their  future; that this President was not lying but was telling the truth  when he said he will not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.    The problem is, President Trump has nominated people like Congressman  Price whose views are absolutely contradictory to what he campaigned  on. So why would you appoint somebody whose views run exactly opposite  to what you told the American people during your campaign?   The truth is, in the House of Representatives, Congressman Price has  led the effort to end Medicare as we know it by giving seniors  inadequate vouchers to purchase private health insurance.   In 2009, Congressman Price said, and I quote--and I hope people  listen to this quote and try to ask yourselves: How could somebody who  ran on a campaign of not cutting Medicare appoint this gentleman to be  Secretary of Health and Human Services? This is what Congressman Price  said:         Nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery       of health care than the Federal Government's intrusion into       medicine through  . . We will not rest until we       make certain that government-run health care is ended.    Now, how does that tally with Candidate Donald Trump saying: I will  not cut Medicare and Medicaid.   We don't need an HHS Secretary who will end Medicare as we know it.  We need an HHS Secretary who will protect and expand Medicare. The idea  of this voucher program, of ending Medicare as we know it, as a defined  benefit plan and converting it into a voucher plan, not only  contradicts what Candidate Donald Trump said, but it will be a disaster  for millions of seniors.   Right now, if you are a senior and you are diagnosed with a serious  and costly illness, you have the comfort of knowing that Medicare will  be there throughout your illness. It will pay your bills.   The Republican plan, led by Congressman Paul Ryan, has a very  different approach, and what that plan is about is a voucher plan which  says that we will end Medicare as we know it. We will give seniors a  voucher of an undetermined amount--the last number I heard was $8,000;  it may go up, it may be lower--and give that check to a senior who then  goes out into the private insurance market looking for the best policy  that he or she can get.   I would like the American people to think for a moment what kind of  policy an 80-year-old person who is struggling with cancer and who has  a check for $8,000 can get. The answer is, when you go into a private  insurance company.   Also, if the Republicans are successful in doing away with the  Affordable Care Act and the patient protections within the Affordable  Care Act, including a ban on the insurance companies' ability not to  insure you if you have a preexisting condition--now let's assume they  got rid of that.   Now you are 80 years old. You walk into an insurance company, and you  say: I have been diagnosed with cancer, and here is my check for  $8,000.   The insurance agent looks at you and says: Are you kidding? Don't be  absurd. Why would we cover you? What do you think we are going to give  you for $8,000 when you are about to run up some enormous health care  costs related to cancer? You are going to be in the hospital. You are  going to undergo all kinds of treatment. You are going to need  expensive drugs, and you expect us to take you with an $8,000  [[Page S1042]]  check. How are we going to make any money out of you? Because that is  what our job is. We are an insurance company. We don't care about  health care. We care about making money. That is our function. We don't  make money on $8,000 for taking care of somebody who is 80 years of age  who has cancer. Furthermore, because the Republicans got rid of the law  protecting people with preexisting conditions, we don't even have to  take you. Or maybe we will take you, but you are going to have to add  another $10,000 on top of that $8,000 because that is the only way we  make money.   Oh, by the way, also, so there is no confusion, they want to raise  the retirement age to make sure you keep working until 67 years of age.   So not only is that a disaster, but maybe in a deeper sense, if we  take democracy seriously, if we think candidates should run for office  based on what they really believe, all of that stuff is a direct  contradiction to what Candidate Donald Trump talked about.   I have heard many Republicans say: Look, what he was talking about  was really absurd. It was ridiculous. Of course we are not going to do  that.   Well, then, that takes us to a whole other discussion: What does it  mean if you have a candidate who runs for office who simply lies to the  American people and really doesn't mean anything he says?   I have no problems getting up and debating or disagreeing with my  colleagues who have a very conservative point of view. That is their  point of view. This is a democracy, and we have different perspectives.  And many of those candidates ran on positions. They were honest enough  to say: Hey, if you elect me, I think we have to cut Social Security,  and they gave their reasons. I think we have to cut Medicare; they gave  their reasons. I think we have to cut Medicaid; they gave their  reasons. I think we have to give huge tax breaks to billionaire; they  gave their reasons.   Well, for some reason or another, the people in their State elected  them. That is fine. It is called democracy.   But that is not what Donald Trump did as a candidate. So I rise in  opposition to Congressman Price becoming Secretary of HHS because his  appointment would go in diametrical opposition to what Candidate Donald  Trump told the American people. I think that is a bad thing for  democracy. If you run for office, keep your word, you know? Do what you  told the American people you would do. The profound disgust so many  millions of people feel for the American political process is not just  of what we believe, it is that we don't keep our word, the promises we  make to them, and this is exactly where Donald Trump is today.    Let me touch on another area where I think President Trump has not  been clear with the American people, and that is, we pay today by far  the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. One out of five  Americans between 18 and 65 cannot afford to fill the prescriptions  that their doctors write for them. The numbers go down after 65 because  of Medicare Part D. But can you imagine living in a nation where one  out of five people cannot afford to fill the prescriptions their  doctors write?   Mr. Trump campaigned on taking on the pharmaceutical industry. Well,  the record of Congressman Price is very different from the rhetoric  that Candidate Donald Trump used during his campaign.   So I eagerly await Mr. Trump's statement--he can do it through a  tweet; that would be fine with me--that says he will support concrete  legislation that some of us are going to be offering very shortly which  does two fundamental things that will substantially lower prescription  drug costs in America today.   No. 1, at a time when you can buy many medicines for far less cost in  Canada or in many other countries around the world, at a time when we  have free trade agreements so that the lettuce and tomatoes you are  having dinner can come from Mexico or Latin America or anyplace all  over the world, the fish you eat can come from anyplace all over the  world, we will introduce legislation that says that individuals,  pharmacists, and prescription drug distributors will be able to  purchase lower cost medicine in Canada and eventually in other  countries around the world.   Mr. Trump--President Trump had talked during his campaign about  taking on the pharmaceutical industry. I hope very much that he will at  least keep his word on that issue and that he will join us in  supporting legislation to allow for the reimportation of brand-name  prescription drugs from Canada and many other countries around the  world. If he is prepared to do that, we will pass it. We will pass it  because there are a number of Republicans who support it, and the vast  majority of Democrats support it. We have the votes to pass it, and if  President Trump signs that bill, we will go a long way in ending the  burden that so many elderly people and working people and people with  chronic illnesses are facing today, and that is the outrageously high  cost of prescription drugs.   By the way, this huge increase in prescription drug costs takes place  at a time when, in 2015, the five largest pharmaceutical companies in  this country made $50 billion in profit--$50 billion in profit in  2015--yet one out of five Americans under 65 cannot afford the medicine  they need. The top 10 CEOs or executives in the pharmaceutical industry  that year made over $300 million in salary.   Passing reimportation is one mechanism to lower the cost of  prescription drugs, but it is not the only one. We have a totally  insane prescription drug pricing system in America right now. If you  are Kaiser Permanente, you will pay a certain amount for a drug. And by  the way, of course, we don't know what that amount is that you are  paying; that is secret. If you are Medicare, you will pay a different  amount. If you are the Veterans' Administration, you will pay a  different amount than Medicare. And if you are Medicaid, you will pay a  different amount than Medicare or the Veterans' Administration. We have  a situation today where by law the Veterans' Administration is able to  negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry. Today we have a  situation where Medicaid, by law, is guaranteed a significant rebate  over list price. But in terms of Medicare, which spends over $4 billion  a year for prescription drugs, a number of years ago Republicans  insisted that Medicare would not be able to negotiate drug prices with  the pharmaceutical industry.   President Trump has indicated in vague language that perhaps he would  support the ability of Medicare to negotiate prices with the  pharmaceutical industry. Given all of the tweets he has sent out on so  many subjects, I would hope that he has the time to send out a very  simple tweet which says: If Congress passes legislation allowing  Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry, I  will sign that bill. That tweet will have a profound impact on  taxpayers because we can save very substantial sums of money, and it  will also result in lowering the cost of prescription drugs.   Unfortunately, once again Congressman Price is coming from a  different place than Candidate Trump came from--again, that  contradiction of a President appointing somebody whose views are  diametrically opposed to the views he raised during the campaign.    I think the American people are growing increasingly concerned about  the contradictions in general, not just on health care, of what  Candidate Trump said and what President Trump is doing. During the  course of his campaign, not only did Candidate Trump say he would not  cut Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid, he also said that he  thought Wall Street was causing all kinds of problems and that you  can't clean up the swamp by bringing people in who are a part of the  swamp, in so many words. You can't bring people in to clean up the  problem who have caused the problem in the first place. And you know  what, he is exactly right. He is exactly right. You can't bring in  people whose greed and recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street  caused us the worst economic downturn in modern history of this  country. You can't bring those people in and then say: We are going to  solve the problem that Wall Street caused.   But in an exactly similar way to what he has done with the Secretary  of Health and Human Services, he is bringing in top Wall Street  executives. His main financial adviser comes from Goldman Sachs, one of  the largest financial institutions in this country, a  [[Page S1043]]  financial institution that required a multibillion-dollar bailout from  the taxpayers, an institution whose illegal behavior caused them to  have to pay a $5 billion fine to the Federal Government. Those are the  people he is bringing in to regulate, to take on Wall Street. He is  bringing Wall Street executives who caused the worst financial crisis  in modern history of this country to take on Wall Street. Well, I don't  think most Americans believe that.   So, Mr. President, let me close by saying that I hope that tonight  the Senate stands up for the American people, demands that President  Trump keep the campaign promises he made, and that we reject the  nomination of Congressman Price to be the next Secretary of Health and  Human Services.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.
