 Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3292 and ask  that it be called up by number.    Mr. President, Montana small businesses are critically  important for our jobs; for local economies; and, really, to bring our  communities together. And through no fault of their own, many were hit  very hard by the pandemic.   Unfortunately, some Members on the other side of the aisle have put  forth some very misguided efforts to raise taxes on these small  businesses, attempting to redefine what constitutes a small business.   Thankfully, we already have an agreed-upon definition that was set by  the Small Business Administration, which defines a small business as  one with fewer than 500 employees.   Efforts to end tax relief, such as to limit the 20-percent small  business tax deduction passed in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act based on  arbitrary income thresholds, should be called out for what they are:  These are small business tax hikes.   For this reason, I am offering an amendment to create a deficit- neutral reserve against prohibiting tax increases on small businesses,  as defined by the Small Business Administration.   I urge my colleagues who believe in the importance of small  businesses--   --to join me in voting for this amendment.
