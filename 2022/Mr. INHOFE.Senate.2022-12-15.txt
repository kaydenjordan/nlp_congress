 Thank you.    First of all, I want to thank the chairman for all the  hard work. People don't realize that this is, in my opinion, the most  significant vote of the year. It has been one we have been through for  a long period of time, and it is necessary, and I like the way it  turned out. It is really good.   I am pleased that the Senate is voting today for the fiscal year 2023  National Defense Authorization Act. I have said it before, and I am not  the only one saying it: The world is more dangerous than I have ever  seen it before in my lifetime. Typically, there is bipartisan agreement  on this fact, and that is why this bill has gotten done for 61 years in  a row. It is almost always bipartisan, and for this year's bill, that  is definitely the case. We have worked together for a long period of  time. I have worked closely with my friend Chairman Jack Reed, and both  of us made sure that that would be the case.   The Armed Services Committee agreed, almost unanimously, to boost  President Biden's inadequate defense budget by $45 billion. This  additional funding will address record-high inflation rates and ensure  that we are able to implement the little blue book that we talk about  all the time. It has worked very successfully in the past. It will be  working successfully long after I am gone too. So additional funding  will address record high inflation rates, and we are ensured that we  will be able implement the little blue book the way we have done it in  the past.   We need to prioritize defense. It is as simple as that. The NDAA  addresses the National Defense Strategy in concrete ways. We need to  get this done. We are going to get it done, and we will get it done  this evening.   I encourage all of my colleagues to support this year's National  defense authorization bill. Let's extend our track record of getting  this bill done, and let's show our troops that we love them and that we  support them.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, after months of deliberating, just like  that, the most important bill we work on every year has passed the  Senate.   There is an old document that no one reads anymore called the  Constitution. It tells us what we are supposed to be doing here:  providing for our national defense. That is why Congress has passed a  Defense authorization bill for 61 years in a row. This year will be No.  62. I am proud to have been involved in quite a few of those.   Just like prior years, Republicans and Democrats came together and  made compromises on the many provisions in this bill. And it is a good  thing we did because we face threats like I have never seen before in  my life. We have got a bill that addresses many of these threats and  helps provide our military with all the tools needed to do their jobs.   This bill includes a significant topline increase and provides a  blueprint for where we need to invest to deter China. It fully supports  our nuclear modernization program. It also takes the first step to  restoring America as the Arsenal of Democracy by expanding munitions  production. It includes multiple provisions that strengthen America's  frontline partners, including Ukraine and Taiwan. We continue to take  care of servicemembers, including by repealing the COVID vaccine  mandate and strengthening parents' rights at DOD schools. It is also  important to note that we kept poison pills out of the final text that  could have jeopardized passage of this critical bill. This is a good  bill. It is not the bill I would have written on my own, but I am proud  to vote for it today.   Lastly, I would like to thank a few people who put in a ton of work  on the NDAA. That starts with Chairman Reed, who has been a great  partner and friend. I would like to thank the Armed Services Committee  staff, who have worked tirelessly to make this bill a reality,  including the majority staff director, Liz King.   On my staff, there are many who have had a hand in crafting this  bill. They worked the late nights and early mornings to make sure we  had a bill to vote on today. First on that list is my Republican staff  director, John Wason. John has been serving this country his entire  life, first in the U.S. Army, then at the House Armed Services  Committee, and now here in the Senate. None of this would be possible  without his leadership.   On the minority staff for the committee, I want to thank:         Rick Berger        Scott Richardson        Greg Lilly        Jennie Wright        Adam Barker        Kristina Belcourt        Allen Edwards        Katie Magnus        Sean O'Keefe        Brad Patout        Jason Potter        Brian Slattery        Katie Sutton        Eric Trager        Adam Trull, and        T.C. Williams    On my personal staff, I want to thank:         Dan Hillenbrand        Wendi Price        Kim Cutter        Sarah Klotz        Sofia Rafiq        Mark Powers        Ellen Brown        Jake Hinch        Jake Johnson        Alexandra Slocum        Bennett Crow        Davis Bunn        Laurie Fitch        Lauren Pickett        Whitney Sterling        Isabelle Colleti        Laura Hill, and        Richard Balzano    And the hard-working floor staff:         Robert Duncan        Chris Tuck        Tony Hanagan        Katherine Foster        Brian Canfield        Max Boyd        Maddie Sanborn        Charlotte Ueland, and        Noelle Ringel    I am very grateful for all of their service.   As I finish my time here in the Senate, I can leave knowing that we  have done all we can to support our troops for another year and we have  succeeded.                            ____________________
