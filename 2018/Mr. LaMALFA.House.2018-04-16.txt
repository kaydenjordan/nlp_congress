 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the last  year that Americans will ever have to file under our old, outdated Tax  Code. Starting next year, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will take full  effect. That means the annual hassle associated with filing taxes will  be done away with for most Americans, who will be able to file on a  form as simple as a postcard.   Most Americans will also find the new, simpler Tax Code will also be  more beneficial to their families financially. For example, the  standard deduction will be nearly doubled to $12,000 for individuals  and $24,000 for families, and the child tax credit is doubled to  $2,000.   Throughout this entire process, some of my colleagues have attempted  to market this historic tax reform as Armageddon or the increase they  are going to keep in their paycheck as crumbs.   Well, people are keeping more of what they have earned and will  continue to do so as this bill takes full effect. The flood of bonuses  and new investments in employees by companies across the U.S. is  evidence to the contrary of that ``Armageddon'' or ``crumbs'' talk.   This time next year, the vast majority of Americans will have a  simpler, more lucrative tax filing process to look forward to for  themselves and their families.                            ____________________
