 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 2622, sponsored by the gentleman from  Texas. To put this in context, we have one regulatory scheme to deal  with broker-dealers and another to deal with registered investment  advisers.   Traditionally in the United States, a broker-dealer is only  registered as a broker-dealer, subject to that regulatory scheme, and  the broker-dealer not only executes transactions but also gives advice  and does research.   Our friends in Europe have required that under certain circumstances,  a broker-dealer must charge separately for the research and advice on  the one hand and for the execution of the transaction on the other.   Following that pattern would ordinarily cause that broker-dealer to  be subject to that second regulatory scheme, the regulatory scheme for  registered investment advisers. It is appropriate that since 2017 the  SEC has had a no-action letter, saying that if broker-dealers under  these circumstances do not register as investment advisers, the staff  of the SEC will recommend to the board that it take no action, no  enforcement action. Basically, it is a pass for the broker-dealer to  follow the European rules but not register as a registered investment  adviser, continuing to be subject to regulation only as a broker- dealer.   Now, this bill in its original form would have made this no-action  letter, this pass permanent, but several investor groups expressed  concerns about that original version of the bill. For example, a joint  letter from the Council of Institutional Investors, the CFA Institute,  and others argued against taking that approach without further thought.   During the committee markup, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Gottheimer) offered an amendment to change this bill from the permanent  exemption to instead only relief for 6 months. It requires the SEC to  study the impact of letting the no-action letter expire, something that  the Financial Services Committee is very interested in understanding.   The bill would also review other tangential issues, including  conflicts of interest and the provision of financial services by  middle-market financial intermediaries.   With Mr. Gottheimer's amendment adopted, I think this bill is a  reasonable compromise, and I urge all of my colleagues to support the  bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   There is an image in the country that nothing is getting done in  Washington, that we are tied up in partisan knots. As the gentleman  from Texas points out, this bill passed our committee 45-2. Congress  continues to function, although it is much more exciting for the press  to cover the fights than the progress.   The amended version of H.R. 2622 being considered on the floor today  represents a bipartisan compromise. It gives the SEC the time to  address potential concerns laid out by stockholders related to the no- action letter for broker-dealers that offer research services from  needing to register as investment advisers.   It is a well-thought-out response to our current situation. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill and yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1548, the Improving Access to Small  Business Information Act, sponsored by Representative Young Kim from  the great State of California.   The Paperwork Reduction Act mandates that all Federal agencies  receive approval from the Office of Management and Budget before  putting forth a paper form or survey that will impose an information  collection burden on the general public.   Although this is well-intentioned, the Paperwork Reduction Act may  often prevent Federal agencies like the SEC from obtaining data from  the public, the very data that assists agencies in carrying out this  mission.   This bill streamlines the ability of the SEC's Advocate for Small  Business Capital Formation to carry out its mission by exempting it  from the requirements of the Act in the same way that a sister agency,  the SEC's Investor Advocate, is currently exempted.   In effect, it enables the small business advocate to properly conduct  its job, which will strengthen the ability of the SEC to craft  regulations that help small businesses raise capital.   I also want to note that as part of the negotiations that resulted in  this bipartisan compromise bill, Chairman McHenry and Ranking Member  Waters agreed that in the months ahead they will work together on bills  to strengthen the independence and capacities of the investor advocate  and of the small business advocate at the SEC.   These two offices, both of which are congressionally created, must be  given sufficient resources to satisfy their unique roles within the  SEC. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close if the gentlewoman from Missouri has no further  speakers.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I commend the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim) for her  excellent work on this bill.   H.R. 1548 streamlines the ability of the SEC's small business  advocate to better support small businesses' efforts to raise capital.  I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri for reprising  for us the proud history of the United States Marines, and I join her  in support of H.R. 1096, the 250th Anniversary of the United States  Marine Corps Commemorative Coin Act, sponsored by Representative Seth  Moulton of Massachusetts.   I want to thank Representative Moulton, first, for his service in the  United States Marines and, second, for offering H.R. 1096. I also want  to mention Senator Blumenthal for leading the Senate version of this  bill.   This important legislation would authorize the Secretary of the  Treasury to mint a series of commemorative coins honoring the 250th  anniversary of the United States Marine Corps in 2025.   These coins will be sold to collectors at a profit. The sale of these  coins will then support programs for the Marine Corps Heritage  Foundation, which funds programs for the National Museum of the Marine  Corps. The museum has been open since 2006, allowing the public to  honor the Marine Corps and learn about its important work, as well as  allowing for the storage of artifacts and research. The foundation also  supports educational programming and cultural events.   Representative Moulton, as a proud marine, has been a tireless  advocate in advancing this legislation to commemorate this important  anniversary.   The Marine Corps has protected the United States for two-and-a-half  centuries and deserves the highest level of  [[Page H3189]]  honor, including the minting of these commemorative coins. I am so  appreciative of their dedication to this important issue and am pleased  to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in that support, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), the sponsor of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   H.R. 1096 will commemorate the important 250th anniversary of the  creation of the United States Marine Corps.   I am pleased that my colleague, Representative Moulton, chose to  champion this issue so that we can all honor the work of the Marine  Corps in protecting our freedom and our liberty over the past two-and- a-half centuries.   Madam Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
