 Madam President, today let the Senate recognize the  retirement of Ms. Kobye Noel, a public servant who has worked for 23  years in the U.S. Senate.   Ms. Noel served for over a decade with the Senate Budget Committee.  She has also worked for Senator Kent Conrad, Senator Heidi Heitkamp,  Senator Doug Jones, and for me and for Senator Reverend Raphael  Warnock. Her leadership has shaped the work of the Senate for longer  than most of us have been here. To that, we owe Ms. Noel a tremendous  debt.   Ms. Noel was instrumental in establishing Senator Reverend Warnock's  and my offices this year. Her expertise and hard work have served  Georgians to the highest standard.   For her colleagues, Ms. Noel has been a source of reassurance and  generosity. She consistently lends a helping hand to others.   Ms. Noel's skill, commitment, and heart for service will be  irreplicable on my team. Ms. Noel will be dearly missed, but has become  a lifelong friend for so many of us.   On behalf of the Senate, I express our heartfelt gratitude for Ms.  Noel's service.   Thank you for sharing your brilliance with us, Ms. Noel. You embody  the promise and integrity that should define the U.S. Senate.                            ____________________
