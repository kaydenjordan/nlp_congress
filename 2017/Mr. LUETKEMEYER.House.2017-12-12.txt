 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Hensarling), our distinguished chairman of the committee.   I want to start by thanking the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Tenney), who has become a real advocate for small financial  institutions and their customers. Escrow requirements are costly and  burdensome for community banks and credit unions. Many institutions  lack the resources to create and maintain escrow accounts in house, and  outsourcing the work is, in many cases, cost prohibitive. But this  doesn't mean that these financial institutions shouldn't be in the  business of mortgage lending.   H.R. 3971 amends the Truth in Lending Act to direct the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau to exempt from certain escrow requirements  a loan secured by a first lien on a principal dwelling if the loan is  held by a creditor with assets of $25 billion or less.   Under the bill, the Bureau must also provide either exemptions to or  adjustments from the mortgage loan servicing and escrow requirements of  the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. That relief applies only to  servicers of 30,000 or fewer mortgage loans. These aren't high  thresholds, nor are the institutions that will benefit large or  complex.   The gentlewoman's legislation is targeted squarely on the small banks  and credit unions servicing Main Street; the financial institutions  that have relationships with their customers.   This is an important aspect of the bill that isn't delineated in the  legislative text. I can tell you, as someone who has made loans in my  community for more than 30 years, that these small institutions care  about their customers. Community bankers help people fulfill their  dreams of homeownership because they care about the customer and  economic health of their community.   The unfortunate reality is that, across the Nation, these banks and  [[Page H9802]]  credit unions are exiting the residential mortgage business. I heard  from one just a few days ago. It isn't necessarily one rule that is  driving this trend. It is the onslaught of rules from the CFPB and the  Federal prudential regulators that, in totality, make mortgage lending  and servicing cost prohibitive.   These rules aren't helping consumers. They are forcing banks to cut  off services and access to mortgage credit. They are bushing borrowers  to large financial institutions and nonbank servicers, the very  entities that the ranking member and some of my friends on the other  side of the aisle say pose the greatest threat to consumers.   The gentlewoman's legislation ensures that consumers continue to have  various credit choices by allowing smaller institutions to remain in  the mortgage market without being deterred by the high cost of  regulatory compliance. The increase in the small servicer exemption  threshold will better delineate small servicers from the large  servicers and give credit unions and community banks greater  flexibility. This flexibility will help to ensure that more of their  customers have access to the mortgage market and achieve the dream of  homeownership.   We shouldn't be driving that business away from small servicers, and  we shouldn't subject community institutions, in this instance, to the  same regulatory regime as larger ones.   This is an issue the Financial Services Committee has worked on for  several years, always with bipartisan support. I want to thank the  gentlewoman from New York for picking up this legislation and for  diligently working on this matter. I hope my colleagues will join me in  supporting H.R. 3971 and other measures that allow our Nation's smaller  financial institutions, their customers, and their communities to  thrive.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to further explain what this  bill would do and why it could be harmful.   Under the present law, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act  would require that the servicers handle no more than 5,000 or less  loans. Why is this important? It is important because when you have  servicers that are handling a relatively small number of these kinds of  accounts, they can pay attention to them.    Don't forget, these are loans by community banks. They are riskier,  they are higher priced loans, they are directed toward rural  communities and communities that basically you have to pay a lot of  attention to when you give out these loans. And now this bill would  say: Yes, we know that when you are servicing a small number, 5,000 or  less, that the services have to pay attention because they are under  the rule of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and that act  says not only do you have to pay attention and you have to contact your  borrower when you are going to transfer the loan--and let me tell you  how important this is.   This is so important because when you transfer a loan, if you don't  give the kind of notification to the borrower that they will understand  that the originator of the loan no longer has the servicing or has the  same servicing contract that is now going to move to another servicer,  then people, oftentimes, end up not sending their payment to the right  place. And guess what, I have seen this go on for months, and then  people end up in a situation where they are defaulting on the loan, and  the new servicers are putting them in a position where now their homes  are in danger.                                time  1245    So this contact, this oversight, this attention that you pay to these  small borrowers is so important, and that is why the 5,000.   Now, with this bill, they want to take it up to 30,000. What does  that mean? It means that we are going to see the kind of problems that  we have seen in the subprime meltdown that we have gone through.   We have found that servicers caused us the most problems. Of course,  they didn't service the loans adequately. They lost them. They had  people applying over and over again.   First of all, we discovered that many of the servicers had no  training, that they were literally hired off the street, and that they  were basically saying to senior citizens, 75 and 80 years old: We lost  your paper. Reapply again. Reapply again. We are sorry.   It has been just an awful situation that was created because the  servicers could not handle the volume that they were contracted with,  oftentimes, for the financial institution that they were supposed to be  doing this work for.   So, here you have a bill that literally is not about community banks.  This is about increasing the number of banks that can now have the kind  of protection that we were giving to the very small community banks. So  don't believe this is about community banks.   In addition to that, what you are doing is you are changing the rules  and the laws under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act that  protects these rural borrowers and these small, high-risk loans that  are in these communities that need a special kind of help.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
