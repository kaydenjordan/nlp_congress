 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 4001(b)(1) of the  Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2017 (S. Con. Res.  3, 115th Congress), I hereby submit for printing in the Congressional  Record the 302(a) allocation to the Appropriations Committee of the  House consistent with that concurrent resolution. Allocations for  authorizing committees were previously filed on March 24, 2017.   Section 4001(b) of S. Con. Res. 3 authorized the House Committee on  the Budget to file 302(a) allocations consistent with the budgetary  levels established in S. Con. Res. 3. This filing authority was  necessary because there was no joint statement of managers accompanying  S. Con. Res. 3. Under section 301(e)(2)(F) of the Congressional Budget  Act of 1974, the allocations are to be included in the report  accompanying the concurrent resolution on the budget.   This allocation is enforced by section 302(f) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974, which prohibits the consideration of appropriations  measures that would cause the applicable allocation of new budget  authority to be exceeded for the budget year, fiscal year 2017.   This allocation applies to bills, joint resolutions, and amendments  thereto or conference reports thereon, considered by the House  subsequent to this filing.   A corresponding table is attached. If there are any questions on this  allocation for fiscal year 2017, please contact Brad Watson or Jim  Bates.

Con.  Res. 3.   These revisions are designated for the House Amendment to the Senate  Amendment to H.R. 244, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal  Year 2017. The revisions designated are made pursuant to section 314 of  the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.   These revisions represent an adjustment for purposes of budget  enforcement. These revised allocations and aggregates are to be  considered as the aggregates and allocations included in the budget  resolution, pursuant to S. Con. Res. 3, as adjusted. Pursuant to  section 314 of the Congressional Budget Act of  [[Page H3321]]  1974, these revisions to the allocations and aggregates shall apply  only while the House Amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 244 is  under consideration or upon its enactment.
