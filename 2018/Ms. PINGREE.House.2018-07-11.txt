 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for his eloquent  defense of our oceans, and also for yielding me the time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 200.   I represent the great State of Maine, with a rich maritime heritage,  strong fisheries, and vibrant coastal communities that I am very proud  to represent.   The hardworking men and women who earn their livings on or near the  water in my State have been working for decades to follow the Magnuson- Stevens Act and Federal fishery policy. They are responsible stewards  of our ocean resources. And while the current law could certainly be  improved, it has been successful in allowing Mainers and others to  support their families while restoring and preserving the health of  their fisheries. They want to pass this maritime heritage on to the  next generation, and I am afraid this bill would make that task even  harder for them.    The bill before us today, therefore, is a big disappointment to me  because it misses the opportunity to update the Magnuson-Stevens Act.  By reauthorizing Magnuson, we could work in a bipartisan way to address  the current needs of our fisheries and provide more flexibility. We  could bring Federal policy further into the 21st century.   This bill is the wrong approach for addressing fishery management. It  weakens rebuilding requirements, creates loopholes in some conservation  efforts, and has the effect of decreasing accountability that has been  put in place to prevent overfishing.   H.R. 200 undoes efforts that have been proven to work, while failing  to address some significant challenges in our fisheries. It is a lost  opportunity and a bill that I cannot support.
