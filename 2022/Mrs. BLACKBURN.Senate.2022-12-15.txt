 Madam President, on October 16, Music City  welcomed the Country Music Hall of Fame's Class of 2022, Joe Galante,  Jerry Lee Lewis, and Keith Whitley, into country music's closest circle  of friends. As a lifelong fan, I like to spend time each year  reflecting not only on the ties that bind the genre, but on those that  set each generation of artists, songwriters, musicians, and executives  apart. This year, the Hall's newest members have one very simple thing  in common: Country music came naturally to them.   If all had gone according to plan for Joe Galante, he never would  have spent his life making country music. This year's Non-Performer  inductee came to Nashville on a 2-year assignment as a junior financial  analyst, then spent more than four decades modernizing the country  music recording industry's business practices as one of the most  influential executives in entertainment. The industry at the time may  not have known what to make of this young man from New York City, but  the industry of today is far more successful and creative for having  embraced his vision of what country music could be.   On October 28, 2022, we lost Jerry Lee Lewis, this year's Veterans  Era Artist inductee. But if there was ever an entertainer whose spirit  will endure in the music of future generations of country stars, it is  Jerry Lee. He made his mark in rock & roll, gospel, and the blues, but  country is where he felt most at home. He was one of the greatest  showmen in music and he knew it--and as the Hall's CEO Kyle Young put  it, who are we to argue?   Keith Whitley, this year's Modern Era Artist inductee, died before he  reached most of country's unique career milestones. But during his  short time in the spotlight, he stood at the forefront of the New  Traditionalist revival and convinced Music City that while sonic  evolution was inevitable, country's roots would always be waiting for  artists brave enough to embrace them. Keith struggled to control the  darkest parts of himself and eventually succumbed, leaving behind a  singular body of work that reveals a passion and dedication to the  craft we have rarely seen since.   On behalf of all Tennesseans, it is my honor to celebrate these men  for their contributions to the gift that is country music.                            ____________________
