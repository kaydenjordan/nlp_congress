 Mr. Speaker, I stand on the House floor today to  demand justice for my constituent, Spc. Vanessa Guillen, who was  brutally murdered at Fort Hood.   I am here for her family and the Houston community who mourn her  tragic loss.   And I am here for every women and man in uniform who has shared their  stories of sexual assault and harassment in the military.   We must put an end to this culture of sexual assault and harassment  in the military.   This is why I urge my colleagues to support this bloc of amendments.   It includes Amendment 293, which will establish a confidential  reporting option for sexual harassment complaints made by military  servicemembers.  [[Page H3584]]    And, it also includes Amendment 282, which will require the GAO to  study the procedures for investigating missing persons by the Armed  Forces.   As members of Congress, we have a responsibility to our women and men  in uniform.   We must honor Vanessa's memory by ensuring this never again happens  to another soldier or her family.
