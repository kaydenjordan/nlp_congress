 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this bears an important, absolute, and imperative  necessity of a little walk down memory lane. In actuality, the American  people really want to uphold her values, the values that they have come  to understand as a core of who we are.   The Homeland Security Committee traditionally, as the chairman and I  have seen over the years, worked in a bipartisan manner. A little  history is that just more than a decade ago, there was a bipartisan,  comprehensive immigration bill led by the late John McCain.   Unfortunately, interestingly enough, the Senate moved, and the House  simply imploded that dream, the dream that those who came to this  country without anything and did not know they had come wrongly, if  you will, young people, could be DACA recipients and ultimately work  their way toward citizenship.    It was an effective asylum process, and we argued vigorously for  legal immigration. People dutifully got in line, but consistently, as  we refused to build on the comprehensive immigration structure, even  though Democrats supported heavily enhancing the border--my bill some  years ago provided enormous new equipment and technology.   One of our colleagues even explained, by the way, this new border  wall that everyone wants to talk about is not a border wall because it  is indented onto U.S. soil. Once you get over the wall, you are already  eligible to apply for asylum.   Most of the people who come, come through legal points of entry, so  why the cruelty of this bill?   I can be for legal immigration, and I can be for securing this  Nation, and I don't have to take a sledgehammer and bloody the very  fabric of this Nation.   It is interesting that we offered 43 Democratic amendments. None were  accepted.  [[Page H2219]]    Is there something wrong with body cameras for our officers at the  border? Not accepted.   Is there something wrong with refusing to separate 9-month-olds and  5-year-olds from their families, family unification, committing to not  separating families? Is that something wrong?   I work with NGOs. I am in Texas. I am in Houston. We are getting some  of those migrants in Houston, and there will be an NGO that will be  dealing with individuals who are not statused.   What you want to have happen, as is happening in El Paso because of  the overwhelming, is that you want no resources, people on the street,  and, I am so sad and ashamed to say, the loss of individuals in  Brownsville in what seemed to be a murderous rage. We cannot do this.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Republicans who support detaining and deporting  more migrants to take a look at section 115(c) in division A.    Mr. Speaker, if enacted, it would prohibit DHS from  contracting with any nongovernmental organization to transport or  shelter ``inadmissible aliens.''   What is that? This language would prevent ICE from being able to  contract with private companies that facilitate deportation or provide  detention space because they are nongovernmental organizations.   Ironically, it seems that this child deportation act may actually  undermine our friends on the other side's MAGA deportation agenda.   Why are we not more committed, Mr. Speaker, to coming together around  the ideals of the Statue of Liberty? Bring us your forlorn, your worn,  your desperate.   Yes, they are coming in droves, but the President has a plan. There  will be more interaction with Guatemala. There will be processes in  Mexico. There will be more officers at the border for those who are  seeking asylum.   Why should we reject that? Why don't we come and find a way to stand  up the infrastructure because a border wall that is $45 million per  mile is not going to be the only solution.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to take this bill off the floor, go  back to the drawing board, work with those of us in the Homeland  Security Committee, with all the amendments we offered, and make a  reasonable difference in the lives of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, might I put back on the table, because they are all in  my office all the time, that the DACA recipients need a response. They  are paramedics, doctors, lawyers, teachers. How dare we ignore the  talent that is here that wants to be patriotic Americans.   I only ask for mercy. Take the bill back. Help our children. Make a  difference. Honor the Statue of Liberty and protect the national border  of this United States of America. We can do it, and it is not being  done either by Texas or by the United States of America. We want to do  it. The people in Houston want to be humanitarian, and they want to be  safe.   Mr. Speaker, I am here today to reassert my opposition to H.R. 2-- Secure the Border Act of 2023.   I along with my colleagues have attempted to address many of the ills  these bills purport by offering common sense amendments that  Republicans have continued to refuse any meaningful consideration.   I would like to highlight some of my amendments that were offered in  both the Judiciary Committee Markup and the Homeland Security Committee  Markup for H.R. 2.   In addressing, H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act of 2023, we need the  American people to understand that this is an unfortunate patchwork of  extreme anti-immigrant proposals that would only add to more chaos at  the border.   It includes a variety of illogical measures that would shut down the  U.S. asylum system and target families and children for the cruelest  forms of treatment.   One measure would make overstaying a visa a crime--for the first time  in our history.   I offered amendments to H.R. 2 along with many of my Democratic  Colleagues both during Homeland Security Committee markup and for  consideration by the House Rules Committee for inclusion for  consideration during the of this bill--but all Democratic amendments  were rejected by the Republican majority.   As a senior member of the House Committees on Homeland Security and  Judiciary I have a well-established public record for working to  address our Nation's most pressing immigration issues through sound  government policies.   Immigration is not a criminal matter but categorized as a civil claim  because seeking to travel, requesting refugee status, or attempting to  make a better life in another country should not result in criminal  prosecution.   There are nations who do seek to punish U.S. citizens who are  traveling abroad through criminal prosecution with tragic consequences.   I have worked on the issue of unlawfully detained U.S. citizens who  are held in other countries for a host of reasons that come down to the  politics of a country and not due to a defendable immigration policy.   The conduct of the previous Administration in the forced separation  of I offered would have added a mens rea requirement such that to be  criminally liable, a person must knowingly and willingly overstay their  visa.   It is important to remember that an individual can make an honest  mistake about when they need to depart the country, be physically  incapable of departing the country, or unable to return because of  circumstances beyond their control in their home country.   Yet this bill has no exceptions or flexibility when it comes to  overstaying a nonimmigrant visa. It is also important to remember that  if a person overstays their visa, they are already subject to removal.  The addition of a criminal penalty is both cruel and unnecessary.   Our immigration system needs reforms, and we are absolutely  interested in bold new ideas to fix it, but this is not one of them.   My first amendment for H.R. 2, was offered to require U.S. Customs  and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE) to provide Congress with a plan for implementing-- within one year--the use of body-worn cameras by its agents and  officers who are engaged in border security or immigration enforcement  activities. Any implementation of a plan for body-worn cameras would  require additional congressional action.   Both CBP and ICE have already begun deploying body-worn cameras to  their frontline officers and agents to provide greater transparency  into interactions with the public.   In the event there are allegations of excessive force or other  misconduct by an officer or agent, footage from body-worn cameras can  enhance the agencies' ability to investigate.   Several studies on the effectiveness of body-worn cameras have found  that police officers wearing cameras generate significantly fewer  complaints and ``use of force'' reports relative to officers without  cameras.   And savings from reduced complaints against officers, and the reduced  time required to resolve such complaints, can result in substantial  cost savings.   It is troubling that the underlying bill seems to seek cost savings  at the expense of ensuring orderly and fair processing of asylum  seekers; It would make more sense to save money by investigating  complaints more quickly and preventing misconduct in the first place.   My second amendment for H.R. 2, was offered to clarify that the  official policy of the United States as implemented by the agencies of  the Department of Homeland Security shall be to keep families together  and not remove children from parents or responsible adults unless the  safety or welfare of the child is at risk.   The official policy of the Trump Administration was to separate  children from their parents. No child--no matter where they are born-- should be separated from their family, particularly after surviving the  harrowing journey to the U.S. border.   My amendment was offered to stand firm in our principles that should  bar CBP from separating children from their families unless there is  evidence that the child is being trafficked. It further directs the  DHS, in coordination with the State Department and HHS and the Attorney  General to provide quarterly reports to Congress on the status of  efforts to reunify migrant families and prevent future family  separations.   Never again should we allow families to be ripped apart.   These are common-sense amendments that have been repeatedly  disregarded by my colleagues across the aisle who have instead chosen  to put forward legislative attacks on our most vulnerable populations.  Border security can be done in Bipartisan solutions.   It is time we stop the negativity and counterproductive efforts that  are ripping apart our country, and to instead focus on coming together  to work towards sensible and effective solutions that can work for the  betterment and growth of our country and the security at the southern  and northern border.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on this wrong minded legislation.                   Section 115(c)--Deportation & Detention    Mr. Speaker, I urge Republicans who support detaining and deporting  more migrants to take a look at section 115(c) in Division A.  [[Page H2220]]    If enacted, it would prohibit DHS from contracting with any  ``nongovernmental organization'' to transport or shelter QUOTE  ``inadmissible aliens'' UNQUOTE.
