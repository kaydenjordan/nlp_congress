 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   This is essential legislation that would protect the lives of  children who  [[Page H3118]]  survive the trauma of an abortion, children who deserve to be given the  best medical care, a bill that should not be controversial.    Mr. Speaker, if this unanimous consent request cannot be  entertained, I urge the Speaker and majority leader to immediately  schedule the Born-Alive bill.
