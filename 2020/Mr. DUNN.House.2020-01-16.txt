 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jimmy Patronis, Sr., a  local legend in Bay County, Florida, where he recently passed away at  the age of 88.   Mr. Patronis truly lived a life in full, one of family,  entrepreneurship, and of service to our community.   He served as a captain in the United States Air Force and then moved  to Panama City in 1953 to join in the restaurant business with his  brother, Johnny Patronis.   The brothers purchased Captain Anderson's, which has been in his  family's ownership ever since and has become a favorite spot for people  who are visiting Panama City.   From a very young age, Jimmy had an unwavering desire to serve others  and make the world a better place. He had an enormous staff, and he  treated all of them like family.   He leaves behind the love of his life, Helen, and four sons: Theo,  Yonnie, Nick, and the current Florida chief financial officer and  friend of mine, Jimmy, Jr.   Jimmy Patronis will be sorely missed by many. May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
