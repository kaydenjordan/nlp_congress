 Mr. President, as if in legislative Session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S.  Res. 82, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, that the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    I yield.                            ____________________
