 Madam Speaker, the city of Stafford, Fort Bend County, the  State of Texas, and all of America lost a great man Sunday: Mayor  Leonard Scarcella.   He was a true Texas force of nature. He listened to all, regardless  of what country you came from or where you worshipped. His life was  about making all human life better.   Madam Speaker, for 51 years as mayor, he did just that. He helped  bring Texas Instruments to Stafford in 1967, opening the door to Fort  Bend to attract corporate America.   Not happy with the public education in Stafford, he fought for the  only city-run school board in Texas.   Tired of people going to the big city of Houston for concerts and  conventions, Leonard opened the Stafford Centre in 2004.   He proudly governed without one penny of property tax.   It was Leonard who brought the stunning 30,000-piece BAPS Hindu  Temple to Stafford in 2004.   Madam Speaker, to close, nearly 1 million Texans in Fort Bend County  are mourning now. I join them. God bless Mayor Leonard Scarcella.                            ____________________
