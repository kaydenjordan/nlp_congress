 Madam President, as more Americans enjoy longer lives than  ever before, it is more crucial than ever that retirement plans and the  policies that govern them keep pace with healthcare innovation and  demographic change. That is the reason why a bipartisan coalition in  both houses of Congress has proposed the SECURE Act, to modernize  retirement savings policies.   For the first time, it would give businesses the option to band  together to create pooled retirement plans for their employees, helping  them save time and money and expanding access to millions of workers to  an indispensable job benefit. This would especially help small  businesses who would love to offer their employees retirement plans but  simply cannot afford it on their own. It would allow graduate and  postdoctoral students to save for their retirements by contributing  income from their stipends and fellowships to Individual Retirement  Accounts. And it would allow parents to withdraw retirement funds,  without penalty, for the birth or adoption of a child, providing  special help to younger families when they need it most.   I support all of the above provisions, and to see them enacted, I am  willing to accept multiple provisions in this bill that I oppose.  Unfortunately, one provision goes over the line, would hurt the very  workers it purports to help, and would set a dangerous precedent for  Federal policy. This measure would allow a handful of select businesses  to cut their required contributions to their workers' pension plans,  while still promising those workers full benefits.   Under current law, if a pension plan fails to meet its funding  target, the plan sponsor must eliminate the funding shortfall through  additional plan contributions, plus interest, over 7 years. The bailout  in the SECURE Act, however, would extend that period to 30 years for  only a handful of struggling newspapers. Additionally, it would entitle  them to legally assume a higher return on investment than other  businesses must use.   This would reduce the amount that certain community newspapers are  required to contribute to their employees' plans each month and, given  the longer payback window, would also make it less likely that these  bailed out companies would ever make up the shortfall. In other words,  this bill grants a special bailout to a handful of community newspapers  by allowing them to shortchange their workers' pensions.   This is bad policy and bad precedent. This short-sighted strategy  might prolong the life of these community newspapers for a while; that  is what short-sighted strategies do. But it would only do so at the  expense of their employees because, when these newspaper pensions  inevitably become insolvent, which is the trajectory they are already  on, they will most likely end up in the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation. The PBGC is a federally-chartered business that provides  pension insurance through premiums paid by private companies. In other  words, all the companies required to pay into the PBGC, but that do not  receive a special bailout, will be forced to pay the price. This is the  opposite of ``secure.'' We ought not provide special treatment to a  select group of community newspapers in the first place. And we  certainly shouldn't set the precedent that those bailouts entitle  recipients to raid their workers' pensions and then force more  prudently run businesses to pick up the tab.   This is why I have an amendment that strikes this pension bailout  provision out of the bill. A few weeks ago, Senator Toomey offered a  reasonable path forward for the SECURE Act. He suggested allowing the  Senate to consider the SECURE Act with five Republican amendments and  five Democratic amendments of their choosing. Unfortunately, Senator  Murray refused to accept that proposal, claiming that the amendments  are ``not in the interest of hardworking Americans.''   I respectfully disagree. In addition to my amendment, which would  stop corporate bailouts and protect workers from corporate raids on  their pension funds, Senator Cruz and Senator Braun have amendments to  expand 529 savings accounts. Under their proposals, parents and  grandparents could save money for the educational expenses of children  with disabilities, for homeschooling, and for apprenticeships and  training programs.   All of these amendments are ``in the interests of American workers.''  The Senate should consider each of them. I hope my Democratic  colleagues will recognize the need to put this bill on the Senate floor  so we can vote on the underlying text, as well as the reasonable  amendments that have been proposed.                            ____________________
