 I would ask consent to speak as if in morning business.    Mr. President, I rise this evening to talk about Black  History Month and, in particular, to talk about a program that my  office has been presenting every February for many years now.   Each February, it has been my privilege to honor several  Pennsylvanians as part of the celebration of Black History Month. This  year, we pay tribute to four esteemed Pennsylvanians who have helped  their community and the Commonwealth build resilience.   And I will list them first, and then I will be talking about each of  them in greater detail: First, Tyrone Holmes, from my hometown of  Scranton, PA; Della Clark of Philadelphia, PA; Julius Boatwright of  Pittsburgh; and Theo Braddy of Harrisburg--all Pennsylvanians. And  their work is demonstrative of this year's theme for our program:  ``Resilience in the Face of Adversity.''   As their persistence and strength has helped their communities  surmount significant difficulties this year, their enduring leadership  is an encouragement to me after a year where, sadly, resilience has  been sorely needed throughout our Commonwealth and throughout our  country.   Now, in some ways, we have made some progress in the last year. Just  consider this: The national economy created 6.7 million jobs, the most  ever in the first year of a Presidency. Pennsylvania's unemployment  rate went way down from 7.1 to 5.4. Tens of thousands of jobs have been  added just in Pennsylvania. Wages are up, and child poverty is down.  The number of fully vaccinated Americans has increased from 2 million  to 213 million in just the last year. And we have more tools to manage  COVID-19 and keep us safe.   And, finally, the number of schools open for in-person learning has  skyrocketed from just 46 percent a year ago to now 95 percent of  schools. Some believe it is as high as 98 percent.   However, despite those measures of progress, we are still grappling  with so much--grappling with a virus that is adaptable and still  deadly, especially for people with preexisting health conditions, and  even more so for those who are unvaccinated.   And as COVID-19 has lingered, so, too, have the attendant direct  effects. Our schools still struggle to teach our kids and to maintain  the regularity that is critical to learning.   Our businesses must contend with fluctuating demand and a fragile  supply chain. Many of our children have fallen behind on their other  critical vaccinations and routine doctor visits. Many children and  adults struggle with isolation and pandemic-related mental health  challenges.   We know that much of the adverse impact of COVID-19 has been  particularly acute for communities of color. In the United States,  Black Americans have experienced higher rates of COVID-19  hospitalization and death compared to White Americans. And  [[Page S667]]  Black Americans have had higher levels of COVID-19-related  unemployment.   Beyond the pandemic, other challenges remain. Systemic racism  persists in our economy, in our schools, in our healthcare system, and,  of course, in our criminal justice system, just to mention a few. And  even as we strive as a nation to achieve our high ideals of liberty and  freedom for all, we must openly acknowledge a history of discrimination  and racism and reckon with its present-day manifestations and  implications, including disturbing efforts around the country to turn  back the clock on voting rights.   It is only the challenges brought about by adversity that occasion  the rise of resiliency and the triumphs of the human spirit and of  community action that can lift all of us.   The late Member of Congress, Shirley Chisholm, once said:         Leadership is to have the vision for what is necessary and       the courage to make it possible.    Leadership is to have the vision for what is necessary and the  courage to make it possible.   Following a year of difficult challenges, it is fitting that as part  of our Black History Month celebration, we honor innovative,  courageous, and enterprising Pennsylvania leaders who have both the  vision and the courage to help our communities and our Commonwealth to  exhibit resilience in the face of that adversity.
