 Mr. President, the Florida legislative  act establishing Florida House on Capitol Hill was approved by Governor  Ruben Askew on March 30, 1972. Rhea Chiles, wife of Senator and  Governor Lawton Chiles, worked tirelessly with like-minded citizens  from across the State, to purchase, renovate, and open a place for  Floridians to gather while in our Nation's Capital. The Florida House  on Capitol Hill is Florida's embassy in Washington, DC, that connects,  celebrates, and champions Florida to the world and has been a home away  from home for hundreds of thousands of Floridians over the past 50  years.   The Florida House welcomes congressional leaders, students, teachers,  visitors on vacation, and Floridians living and working in our Nation's  Capital. Men and women conducting business in Washington, DC, gather at  Florida House to grow Florida's economy and influence around the world.  The intern program for college students has afforded hundreds of young  men and women the opportunity to learn more about the Federal  Government and help prepare them for meaningful careers.   Due to the endless dedication of the Florida House Staff, trustees,  and generous contributors, the Florida House has been able to remain an  intricate part of Washington, DC, hosting over 10,000 visitors per  year. The Florida House operates with the generosity of Floridians,  without State tax dollars, and belongs to the people of Florida and  remains a place where all Floridians will find comfort, kindness, and a  cold glass of Florida orange juice in their ``home away from home.''   The 50th anniversary of Florida House on Capitol Hill will be  celebrated on October 26, 2023. We, Members of the U.S. Senate,  recognize the ongoing service of Florida House on Capitol Hill to the  citizens of Florida for 50 years.                            ____________________
