 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I consistently hear a great deal from my  constituents about pervasive, intrusive helicopter noise. I have  carefully listened to them for years, through community forums,  townhalls, letters, emails, phone calls, and the like. I have also  worked with both the FAA and the Department of Defense on possible  solutions.   We certainly have a difficult balance to strike in the National  Capital Region, but people shouldn't have to live under the constant  thunder of helicopter noise. Helicopter noise, by all accounts, has  gotten significantly worse year after year after year. Even those who  are neighbors with the Pentagon have noticed it has gotten much worse.                                time  1530    Last year, I had an amendment to the NDAA for the Department of  Defense to conduct a study on mitigating the helicopter noise. We had  excellent conversations. Colonels and majors came out from the Air  Force, the Army, the Marines, and the FAA came out. We had big townhall  meetings. In those conversations, we moved forward with a now completed  DOD noise study.   The Department of Defense has repeatedly informed me that they follow  the FAA helicopter maps perfectly and that they fly at the required  minimum altitudes. So as a solution, my amendment would require the FAA  to simply review all the helicopter flight paths in the national  capital region, including those used solely by the Department of  Defense, to assess whether some of these helicopter trips could be  safely flown at a higher altitude. If they can be, the amendment would  also require the FAA to revise the official helicopter flight maps for  this region to allow some relief for those communities that live below.   Progress has remained very slow on this issue--glacial--and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment so that we can move  forward with a responsible way to mitigate this helicopter noise.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, with great respect to the chairman of the  committee, the many conversations I have had with the general who runs  the Washington Military District, with the Air Force and Army colonels,  with the Marine major, and with many of the helicopter pilots, none of  them have suggested for a moment that national security, homeland  security, or law enforcement were at risk here. In fact, the pilots  said: We would be happy to fly higher as long as we have permission  from the FAA.   We are not interfering in the slightest with their ability to  accomplish their mission. We understand their mission. We respect it.   No one is saying that we can't protect not only our Nation's top  executives, but also the military officers who need to fly in and  around this region. What we are simply saying is that, in many cases,  300 feet, 500 feet, 700 feet is a more logical place to fly.   We have had testimony that people have been in apartment buildings in  Crystal City, looked out their window, and seen the helicopters fly  below their window. This happens in Rosslyn, also.   What we are simply asking is that the FAA responsibly look at  whether--with lots of feedback from the Army, Air Force, Marines, from  law enforcement, from the Secret Service--they couldn't, in fact, fly a  few hundred feet higher than they fly right now. If they can't, we will  accept that and do our best to move some other way. But, really, this  is at the recommendation of our military leaders that the FAA examine  this and find a way to move forward.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
