 Mr. President, there are already significant taxpayer  mandates in the bill, as it is limiting award size, prohibiting funds  from going to so-called foreign entities, such as China, and clawback  provisions.   Why do we need chips?   We need chips for Javelin missiles. We need them for--major weapons  systems contain thousands of chips. The Arleigh Burke-class destroyer  includes 250,000 chips.   It would make it much harder for Americans to produce these chips if  the Sanders amendment were to pass.   I urge a no vote, and I join my friend from Ohio in urging a no vote.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
