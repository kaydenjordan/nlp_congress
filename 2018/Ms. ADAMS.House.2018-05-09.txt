 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Raskin for putting this  Special Order hour together. I thank him for his commitment and for his  concern.   I join all of my colleagues in opposing what is being proposed in  terms of this farm bill.   Three weeks ago, my Republican colleagues on the House Agriculture  Committee sat silently while Chairman Conaway introduced a partisan  farm bill. Then they allowed him to preach about the many reasons why  he feels that SNAP should be transformed from a feeding program to a  work program, uninterrupted.   Then they voted for this flawed bill that takes food off of the  tables of veterans, seniors, and children. Now they want to pass it  through the House and push it forward with their agenda to starve our  Nation's most vulnerable.   My Republican colleagues ought to be ashamed of this because Proverbs  22:9 says: ``The generous will themselves be blessed, for they share  their food with the poor.''   I have said it once, and I will say it again: I don't believe that  the Lord is pleased with what we are considering in this bill.   In my home county of Mecklenburg, North Carolina, more than 162,000  people are considered food insecure. Worse, 50,000 of those are  children.   In my community, more than 55,000 families depend on SNAP to help put  food on their tables. No one should wonder where their next meal will  come from. But, sadly, this is a reality for many, many people.   Last year, North Carolina Republicans introduced a bill on the State  level that would have a similar impact to this partisan farm bill.  Analysis of that bill shows that roughly 130,000 North Carolinians will  lose their SNAP benefits if this bill passes, including 50,000  children.   Nationwide, the impact of this bill would even be worse: kicking 2  million people out of the program and causing an estimated 265,000  children to lose free or reduced lunch at school. So, no work, no eat?   If we are lawmakers and we aren't protecting our Nation's children,  then I don't think we deserve to be here.   Republicans continue to push the idea that we need entitlement reform  just to appease the Speaker. Well, I understand the Speaker has  announced his retirement, and I would like for us to just retire the  idea that this so-called reform is just numbers on a page because it is  not. Real people depend on SNAP programs and, without it, they will go  hungry. No one can expect to work if they are hungry. No child can  expect to learn if the child is hungry.   More than $8 in $10 in nutrition assistance go to households that  include a child, a senior, or a person with a disability. Additionally,  many working Americans depend on SNAP to make ends meet in expensive  cities where earning the minimum wage doesn't pay all of the bills.  People work two and three jobs a day at minimum wage, leave work, and  go to a food bank to eat.   Additionally, many American families depend on SNAP. Working hard is  not enough if you don't make enough.   Instead of punishing working Americans, let's address the cause of  the issue, and let's raise the minimum wage to a living wage.   Mr. Speaker, I join my Democratic colleagues in urging Chairman  Conaway to scrap this flawed bill and return it to the drawing board.  We can, and we should, craft a bipartisan farm bill that benefits all  communities.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Raskin is so absolutely right. I think  that is why people have generally lost faith in their government.   I mentioned a Scripture from the Bible, but there are 3,000  references--more than 3,000--that speak to how we should treat the  poor. We are, I think, being derelict in terms of our duties. Yes,  there seems to be a lot of corruption going on. We are not placing our  priorities on the people. We are putting profits over people. That is  so unfortunate because we were elected to serve everyone, including the  poor.   The poor will be with us always. We have a responsibility to reach  out and to give a helping hand, a help up. We are not talking about  people who some folks think are lazy and they are not working. They are  working, and they are the caregivers of the children.   Children live in poverty because their parents do. We must ensure  that we can help those adults who help our children. We want our  children to go to school and we want them to do well. Children will not  do well if their stomach growls because they are hungry.   Mr. Speaker, I think Mr. Raskin is right. We have two worlds here:  the haves and the have-nots. It is time to give something to those who  have not.    Mr. Speaker, there are probably some lazy folks in here,  too.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Raskin for those comments.   One of the reasons that I wanted to serve on the Agriculture  Committee was because of the issues that are impacted not only in my  district but throughout this Nation. Having so many people who are food  insecure gave us an opportunity, I think, to do good in this farm bill.  It is my understanding that we have never had a bill that was not  bipartisan, and I think we need to think about that. The citizens of  this country are looking to us to do what is right because it is the  right thing to do.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Raskin is exactly right. Hunger is not a  partisan issue.                                time  1745
