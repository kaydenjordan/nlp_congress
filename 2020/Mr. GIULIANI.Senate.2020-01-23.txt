 I decided, Sharon, I'm not going to go to       Ukraine.         I am not going to go because I think I'm       walking into a group of people that are enemies of the       President.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. It appears Giuliani's statement influenced  President Trump's view of Ukraine, as well. At an Oval Office meeting  on May 23, U.S. officials learned of Giuliani's influence. Ambassador  Volker testified that President Trump ``didn't believe'' the positive  assessment government officials gave the new Ukrainian President.  Instead, President Trump told them that Giuliani ``knows all of these  things'' and said that President Zelensky has ``some bad people around  him.'' At this point, the scheme had stalled. Mr. Giuliani and the  President knew that they were going to have  [[Page S510]]  trouble with President Zelensky fulfilling his corrupt demand for  investigations that would benefit President Trump's reelection  campaign.   That brings us to the next phase of this scheme. Although his corrupt  scheme was in trouble due to the unexpected results of the Ukrainian  election--the election which yielded an anti-corruption reformer-- President Trump doubled down on his scheme to solicit investigations  for his personal benefit.   In May of 2019, with a gap in American leadership in Ukraine after  Ambassador Yovanovitch was removed, President Trump enlisted U.S.  officials to help to do his political work. The scheme grew from false  allegations by disgruntled, corrupt Ukrainian prosecutors to a plot by  the President of the United States to extort the new Ukrainian  President into announcing his political investigations. During the May  23 Oval Office meeting, President Trump directed Ambassador Sondland,  Ambassador Volker, and Secretary Perry to work with Mr. Giuliani on  Ukraine. Giuliani had made clear he was pursuing investigations for  President Trump in a personal capacity. He said publicly, on numerous  instances, that he was only working for the President in a personal  capacity and not on foreign policy. Yet President Trump still told  White House officials that they had to work with Mr. Giuliani to get  anywhere on Ukraine. We heard significant testimony on this point. For  example, Ambassador Volker recalled that at the Oval Office meeting on  May 23, President Trump directed the U.S. officials to ``talk to  Rudy.'' Ambassador Sondland testified that President Trump directed  them to ``talk to Rudy.'' In that moment, the U.S. diplomats saw the  writing on the wall and concluded ``that if we did not talk to Rudy,  nothing would move forward, nothing would move forward on Ukraine.''  Pay attention to Ambassador Sondland's testimony.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. In response to our persistent efforts       in that meeting to change his views, President Trump directed       us to, quote, ``talk with Rudy.'' We understood that ``talk       with Rudy'' meant, talk with Mr. Rudy Giuliani, the       President's personal lawyer.        Let me say again, we weren't happy with the President's       directive to talk with Rudy. We did not want to involve Mr.       Giuliani. I believe then, as I do now, that the men and       women of the State Department, not the President's       personal lawyer, should take responsibility for Ukraine       matters.        Nonetheless, based on the President's direction, we were       faced with a choice. We could abandon the efforts to schedule       the White House phone call and the White House visit between       Presidents Trump and Zelensky, which was unquestionably in       our foreign policy interest, or we could do as President       Trump had directed and talk with Rudy. We chose the latter,       of course, not because we liked it, but because it was the       only constructive path open to us.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. And just like that, U.S. officials charged with  advancing U.S. foreign policy--U.S. officials who were supposed to act  in our country's interest--were directed to, instead, advance President  Trump's personal interests. From that point on, they worked with the  President's personal agent on political investigations to benefit the  President's reelection.   Their work on President Trump's behalf to solicit foreign  interference in our elections continued throughout all of June. For  instance, on June 21, Mr. Giuliani tweeted that President Zelensky had  not yet publicly committed on two politically motivated investigations  designed to benefit President Trump. And when Mr. Giuliani's public  efforts and his tweets didn't move President Zelensky to announce the  investigations, he used U.S. diplomats as directed by President Trump.  This is important.   After Giuliani canceled his trip to Ukraine in May and commented that  President-elect Zelensky had enemies of President Trump around him,  Giuliani had minimal access to the new Ukrainian leader's inner circle.  His primary Ukraine connection, Prosecutor General Lutsenko, had  already been informed that he would be removed as soon as the new  Parliament convened. So President Trump gave him U.S. diplomats and  directed them to work with Mr. Giuliani on his scheme. As you heard,  President Trump told Ambassadors Sondland and Volker to talk with Rudy  and work with Rudy on Ukraine. And what did that mean? Well, Mr.  Giuliani tried to use Ambassador Sondland and Volker to gain access to  President Zelensky and his inner circle through their official State  Department channels and made clear to President Zelensky that he had to  announce the investigations.   On June 27, Ambassador Sondland brought Ambassador Taylor up to speed  on Ukraine since Ambassador Taylor had just arrived in the country a  few weeks beforehand. Ambassador Sondland explained that President  Zelensky needed to make clear that he was not standing in the way of  the investigations that President Trump wanted--that President Zelensky  needed to make clear that he was not standing in the way of the  investigations that President Trump wanted. And here is his testimony.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. On June 27th, Ambassador Sondland told       me during a phone conversation that President Zelensky needed       to make clear to President Trump that he, President Zelensky,       was not standing in the way of investigations.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambassador Taylor relayed this conversation to  one of his deputies, U.S. Diplomat David Holmes, who testified that he  understood the investigations to mean the ``Burisma-Biden  investigations that Mr. Giuliani and his associates had been speaking  about'' publicly.   Let's listen to Mr. Holmes.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
