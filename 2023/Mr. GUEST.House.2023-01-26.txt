 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and to encourage my  longtime friend, Alan Loving. Alan serves as pastor for students and  families at First Baptist Church of Madison.   Alan has dedicated his life as a minister of the Gospel and has  impacted countless lives for eternity during his many years of service  as a youth minister.   Recently, Alan suffered a life-changing accident that has left him  paralyzed from the waist down. We praise God for Alan's continued  recovery and rehabilitation.   God's word tells us in Proverbs, ``As iron sharpens iron, so one man  sharpens another.''   Throughout this journey, Alan and his family have been an inspiration  to me and so many others throughout our community. We have been  sharpened by his strength and his faithfulness.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to let Alan know that Mississippi loves him  and his family. We are praying for him; his wife, Courtney; his  daughters, Mary Addison and Anna Claire. We are inspired by his  determination and faith.                            ____________________
