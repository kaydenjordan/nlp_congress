 Mr. Speaker, last week, the Indian American  community celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights. The holiest day of  the Hindu calendar, Diwali celebrates the spiritual victory of light  over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. Today, we  welcome these amazing community members right here in our Nation's  Capitol.   In Bucks and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania, I am honored to  recognize the Hindu community and members of the Indian American  community who celebrated and expressed their faith. Today, I am proud  to recognize the several mandirs who serve our community in innumerable  ways located in Levittown, Montgomeryville, Warrington, Feasterville- Trevose, Bensalem, and Souderton.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join the Hindu faith community in  celebrating Diwali and applaud their efforts of inclusion and community  betterment in Pennsylvania and across America. I look forward to  working with these amazing people today and every day                            ____________________
