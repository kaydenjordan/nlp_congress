 Mr. President, I am here today to advocate on behalf of  Maryland's four Historically Black Colleges and Universities that face  a funding cliff next week. Without the immediate passage of the FUTURE  Act, Bowie State University, Coppin State University, Morgan State  University, and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore face a  collective $4.2 million funding shortfall when the Higher Education  Act's authorization for mandatory funding for these institutions  lapses.   This clean, bipartisan, 2-year reauthorization gives us breathing  room to continue to negotiate the full reauthorization of the Higher  Education Act without holding these historically underfunded  institutions hostage. Our HBCUs and minority serving institutions know  that they can count on this mandatory funding each year to strengthen  their course offerings in in-demand STEM programs, make infrastructure  improvements, and provide academic counseling and student support  services to first generation and historically underrepresented  students.   This potential lapse in the authorization for mandatory funding is  exacerbated by the inability of Congress to provide a fiscal year 2020  budget on time, leaving institutions in even more of a financial  planning crunch. Throwing the budgets of these institutions into chaos  directly harms their ability to serve their students and communities.  If this mandatory authorization were to lapse, schools could not count  on mandatory funds to backfill spending at a later date. Institutions  would have to make decisions about reducing levels of academic  services, delaying needed infrastructure investments, or make staffing  decisions.   This is an unnecessary obstacle that our HBCUs and MSIs do not need  to face. I urge this body to join with the House of Representatives and  pass the FUTURE Act to ensure this mandatory funding remains in place.
