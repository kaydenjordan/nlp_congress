 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1163,  the Protecting Taxpayers and Victims of Unemployment Fraud Act, which  addresses the urgent need to safeguard taxpayer dollars from  unemployment insurance fraud schemes.   One of our most crucial oversight duties is to ensure the responsible  use of taxpayer funds. Recent reports from the White House, GAO, the  Department of Labor, and other organizations have exposed the alarming  theft of up to $400 billion in taxpayer dollars due to unemployment  insurance fraud during the COVID pandemic.                                time  1515    This revelation demands immediate action. What we are trying to  accomplish here is to show a plan that is feasible to be able to go  after this fraud.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about wanting to go  after fraud, too. These arguments that we are talking about are missing  the point. This bill will go after the fraud that took place. We  introduced H.R. 1163, and it will help enable the recovery of lost  dollars, ensuring that this stolen money is reclaimed.   While fraud has been widespread across this Nation, some States have  demonstrated success in minimizing these losses. In Utah, my home  State, overpayment due to fraud consisted of less than 1 percent of  total benefits disbursed. I am proud of this.   Our leaders in Utah have done an excellent job managing and  protecting these resources thanks to the systems and processes  implemented by former Governor Herbert, Governor Cox, their  administrations, and the Utah State legislature.   The Federal Government must now work to restore public trust. It  starts with holding bad actors accountable. This bill will enable that  by strengthening the integrity of our systems for the future and  encourage States to be proactive rather than reactive.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this fiscally  responsible bill.
