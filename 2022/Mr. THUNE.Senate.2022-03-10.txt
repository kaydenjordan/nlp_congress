 Mr. President, the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine  continues to escalate. Americans who walked by a newsstand on Monday  were met with the wrenching picture of a Ukrainian family killed by  Russian shelling, a mom and her two children struck down as they  attempted to flee along a main evacuation route from Irpin to Kyiv, an  evacuation route that Russia shelled.   Yesterday, the world saw pictures of the devastation after a  maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine--maternity hospital--fell  victim to a Russian air strike.   President Zelenskyy reported that there were children buried under  the rubble--children.   One newspaper reported:         The bombing took place during what was supposed to be a       ceasefire in Mariupol so that civilians could evacuate. It       marks the fourth time a so-called `humanitarian corridor' out       of the city has failed because Russian forces opened fire.    ``[T]he fourth time a so-called `humanitarian corridor' out of the  city has failed because Russian forces opened fire.''   ``Opened fire'' on civilians, on parents trying to save their  children, this is what Russia is doing.   The scenes in Ukraine are unreal. They are scenes that we thought had  finally been left behind in the dust of European history: devastated  cities, apartment buildings with their sides sheared off, the smoking  ruins of homes and businesses, a school reduced to rubble, mass graves.   In 2 short weeks, Vladimir Putin has wrought an unimaginable amount  of devastation. The damage he has done will take years, if not decades,  to rebuild. The scars may last much longer.   And for what, Mr. President? For what? For one man's vision of a  Russian Empire. Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine, and he is apparently  willing to destroy Ukraine to get it--destroy Ukraine and devastate his  own nation, because Russia is suffering too because of Putin's war of  aggression.   There are no smoking ruins of apartment buildings in Russia, but  there is the senseless waste of so many young Russian lives, soldiers  and conscripts sent to die in Ukraine for a war that is not their own.  There is Putin's brutal crackdown on protesters and journalists, and  there is the economic devastation his nation will suffer--is already  suffering--as a result of sanctions and companies' decisions to pull  out of Russia to protest its unprovoked attack on Ukraine. Vladimir  Putin is laying waste to two countries.   These have been dark days for Ukraine, but the devastation in Ukraine  has been met with determination. This is Ukrainians' fight, and they  are not shrinking from it. The Washington Post recently reported that  more than 66,000 Ukrainians who were outside the country have returned  to answer President Zelenskyy's call to arms. That is 66,000 Ukrainians  who could have sat in safety outside Ukraine who have returned to help  defend their country.   Outnumbered as they are, the Ukrainian people are standing fast, and  they are slowing down and in many places holding off the Russians.  Soldiers and civilians alike have taken up arms to defend their nation,  and it is clear that the spirit of Ukraine, now roused, will not be  quenched.   No matter the resolve of the Ukrainian people, Ukraine cannot hold  out alone. Without military, intelligence, and humanitarian support  from other free nations, Ukraine may fall. We can't sit by and let that  happen.   Congress is currently considering legislation to send additional  military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. I hope that we will be able  to take a vote on this and very, very soon. As I have said before, the  United States was too slow to send aid to Ukraine and sanction Putin in  the lead-up to Russia's attack. We can't afford to make the same  mistake again.   I commend President Biden for doing the right thing this week and  banning American imports of Russian energy. Every dollar we send to  Russia to purchase energy is a dollar that Russia can use to prosecute  its war in Ukraine.   Now, we need to focus on developing our energy resources here at  home, all of them--all of them, conventional and alternative--to ensure  that our Nation never again has to depend on countries like Russia for  essential energy supplies. We should also take this oil ban a step  further by enacting the bipartisan Crapo-Wyden bill to suspend  permanent normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus.   The bill would also direct the U.S. Trade Representative to seek to  suspend Russia from the World Trade Organization. A nation that flouts  the rules and makes a mockery of diplomacy should not enjoy a seat at  the table.   I heard directly from President Zelenskyy in a Zoom call Saturday,  and he made a powerful appeal for help from the West. Among other  things, President Zelenskyy requested that we help close the skies over  Ukraine.   One solution that has been offered to help protect Ukrainian airspace  is for Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia to provide their MiG-29  jets to Ukraine. We need to do everything that we can to help Ukraine  in this fight, including helping to pave the way for Ukraine to get the  air defense resources it needs.   Poland has stepped up and expressed a willingness to provide the  MiGs, but we now find ourselves at a dead end as to how to facilitate  the transfer to Ukraine. We need to find a solution, and I encourage  the administration to find a way to safely navigate the logistics of  such a transfer. After all that Ukraine has managed to do, it would be  a tragedy to see the country lose its fight because the United States  and other NATO countries could not agree on how to get the Ukrainians  the resources they need.   While we should be cautious about what Putin may choose to do as his  losses grow and his off-ramps dwindle, the United States and NATO  cannot allow Moscow to dictate our actions. To do so would not only be  to surrender Ukraine but to give a green light to despotic governments  the world over, from China to Iran.   On Saturday, President Zelenskyy delivered an address to the  Ukrainian people. ``Free people of a free country,'' he began. ``Free  people of a free country.'' That is what Ukrainians are fighting for,  to be a free people in a free country. And I think their fight is very  close to the hearts of the American people, for after all, for what did  our forefathers fight but to be a free people in a free land, to have  the right to determine their own destiny and to live free of  oppression?  [[Page S1076]]    ``Free people of a free country.'' Long may the Ukrainians remain so.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe).
