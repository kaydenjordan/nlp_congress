 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  champion for democracy, David Sassoli, President of the European  Parliament, who passed away earlier this week.   President Sassoli was a respected leader of conviction and principle;  a distinguished Italian journalist-turned-public-servant dedicated to  his service to helping vulnerable women, homelessness, individuals and  the rights of refugees.   Sassoli was a symbol of balance and generosity to Europe. His  leadership and commitment to social justice will not be forgotten. He  will be remembered as a stalwart defender of the shared European and  American values of human rights, the rule of law, and equality.   I send my deepest condolences, as I know Members of the House do, to  the people of the European Union. And my thoughts and prayers are with  his family and loved ones.
