 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   Earlier this year I was honored to work as a member of the Problem  Solvers Caucus to participate in developing the bipartisan  infrastructure framework that formed the foundation of this  legislation. I deeply appreciate my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle and their willingness to work together to find common ground.   In the Seventh District, we know the importance of this bill since we  have one of the worst commutes in the country. Businesses have left our  community because of the congestion and lack of access to transit.   The significant increases in funding for roads, bridges, transit,  high-speed rail, electric charging stations, among many other  investments will help unlock gridlock, spur economic growth, and make a  critical down payment on tackling climate change.   I appreciate the work on both sides that has gone into crafting this  bill. I urge all Members to support it.
