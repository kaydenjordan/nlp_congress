 Madam Speaker, I am proud today to recognize the  outstanding Anna Liable from Lehighton, Pennsylvania. Anna will  graduate this year from Lehighton Area High School, in addition to  receiving an associate degree in communications from Lehigh Carbon  Community College. Although she is only graduating this year, Anna has  been an avid reporter since 2019.   Anna reports for Sports Illustrated Kids, covering press conferences,  conducting interviews, and reporting on assignment like any other  reporter with press credentials.   She writes for MLB.com where she is the only young person asking  questions of Major League Baseball players during interviews. She  created her own podcast, ``Speak Up Sports,'' where she  [[Page H2410]]  covered the MLB Hall of Fame induction ceremony and interviewed an  Olympic medalist, an NFL official, MLB general managers, and more--and  where she highlighted the importance of Title IX and the contributions  of women in sports.   For these achievements and more, Anna received the Congressional Gold  Medal. She is well deserving of this highest national honor. I am so  optimistic for what the future of journalism looks like, thanks to  young people like Anna. She has a bright, bright future.   On behalf of all of Pennsylvania's Seventh District, we congratulate  Anna.                            ____________________
