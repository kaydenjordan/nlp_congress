 Mr. President, I thank Senator Flake for his comments,  his willingness to speak out, and for the courage with which he has  spoken. His beliefs, I think, are admirable, and this Senator wants to  state that for the record. What he has spoken about does not look down  the blind alley of partisanship. He is talking about looking at  America, and this Senator appreciates his remarks.
