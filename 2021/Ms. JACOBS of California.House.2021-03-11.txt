 Madam Speaker, today, the House passed H.R.  8 and H.R. 1446, two bills to enhance background checks and promote gun  violence prevention.   As a millennial, I am a member of what is known as the Columbine  generation, a generation that grew up in the shadow of gun violence and  school shootings.   When violence came to our Capitol on January 6, congressional  staffers barricaded themselves into a conference room and hid under  furniture because it is what they learned to do in years of active- shooter drills.   It is time for that to change, and this is the start. Today, I rise  to honor the young people who called us here to act.   From Steele Canyon to Bonita Vista, students in San Diego have  organized, protested, and marched for their lives. I have been so  inspired by them and young Americans across the country who have  fundamentally changed the conversation on gun violence.   Because of their activism, we finally passed commonsense legislation  that will save so many lives.    I was proud to support these bills.                            ____________________
