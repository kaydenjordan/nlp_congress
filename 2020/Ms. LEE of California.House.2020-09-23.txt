 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support  of H.R. 1923, the Women's History and Nineteenth Amendment Centennial  Quarter Dollar Coin Program Act. This bill will celebrate 100 years of  women's suffrage by featuring women leaders from across the country on  quarter dollar coins.   We have been working to advance this bill for over 3 years, and I am  so proud to have the endorsement of various stakeholders and the  support of the United States Mint and Treasury on this legislation.   Let me first thank my co-lead, Congressman Anthony Gonzalez, as well  as our Senate counterparts, Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Deb  Fischer, for their efforts, and for all of our staff for working  diligently on this legislation.   And I thank my good friend Congresswoman Maxine Waters and the  Financial Services Committee for their leadership and commitment to  getting this bill to the floor. There is bipartisan and bicameral  support for this legislation.   My good friend, Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman's legislation on  semiquincentennial coins commemorating the 250th anniversary of the  United States is included in this coin package, and I thank her for  spearheading the efforts on that initiative.   Finally, let me thank my dear friend, former U.S. Treasurer, Rosie  Rios, who was really instrumental in shaping this legislation years  ago, and for her incredible work to raise the visibility of women in  every space and place to reinforce the critical role women have played  and continue to play in history. I am deeply grateful for her  leadership.   Finally, let me just specifically acknowledge my staff, my former  legislative director, Emma Mehrabi, for early on never missing a beat  with diligence and strategic work in getting this bill to the floor,  and also my current legislative director, Gregory Adams, who really has  taken this bill to the finish line.   H.R. 1923 will create a new series of circulating quarters, starting  in 2022, featuring trailblazing women in American history. It is my  hope that women of all backgrounds, diverse American women, will be  chosen and depicted, celebrating the accomplishments of our Nation's  historical leaders, thinkers, innovators, activists, freedom fighters,  women who have contributed to achievements in many, many fields: civil  rights, abolition, suffrage, science, and technology, the arts and  humanities, education. Because of these women our country is better for  them and their leadership.   Much like the previous and celebrated 50 State Quarters program, the  women featured on these coins and their images will be selected with  broad public input. Each Governor will engage with members of the  general public and local groups focused on increasing the inclusion of  women or improving the quality of life for women to recommend a  prominent, trailblazing woman to represent their State or territory to  be featured on their State coin.   It is my hope that through this process the broader American public  can engage in a dialogue and celebration of the contributions of these  women, ensuring that their legacy and contributions are more widely  known, understood, and valued in each and every corner of our country.   Mr. Speaker, driving to the Capitol this morning, traffic was stopped  at the corner. I saw the hearse carrying the casket of our beloved  Justice Ginsburg to the Supreme Court. I said a prayer as I witnessed  the procession, and thought about her life and how she paved the way  for racial and gender equality, and I thought about it in the context  of this bill today, and the phenomenal women who this country will have  a chance to get to know. I thank her for her life, her legacy, and for  what she has done to ensure that women now have their rightful place in  history.                            ____________________
