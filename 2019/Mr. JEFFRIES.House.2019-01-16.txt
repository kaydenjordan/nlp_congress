 Madam Speaker, this is day 26 of the reckless Trump  shutdown. Coast Guard officers and their families are suffering; Border  Patrol agents and their families are suffering; TSA agents and their  families are suffering because the President has decided to hold  800,000 Federal employees and the American people hostage.   We are prepared to have a conversation about infrastructure on the  border, prepared to have a conversation about personnel, and prepared  to have a conversation about technology. We are prepared to have a  conversation about border security in a comprehensive way; prepared to  have a conversation about our broken immigration system and how we fix  it in a bipartisan fashion.   But, Madam Speaker, we are not prepared to have a conversation about  these issues in the midst of a reckless shutdown where the President  has decided to hold the American people hostage and try to force us to  pay a $5 billion-plus ransom note.   Madam Speaker, it is time for the adults in the room to get their act  together and reopen the government so we can continue the business of  the American people.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I  offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.
