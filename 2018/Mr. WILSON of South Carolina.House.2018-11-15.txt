 Mr. Speaker, the administration of  President Donald Trump should be appreciated for promoting religious  freedom.   This summer, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hosted the first ever  international ministerial on religious freedom. Representatives from 88  countries attended to review the harsh realities confronting religious  minorities around the globe.   The clearest message of all throughout the ministerial is that the  United States unequivocally stands for religious liberty.   I am grateful that Ambassador Nikki Haley emphatically addressed the  U.N. Security Council about the human rights crisis against the ethnic  and religious minority Rohingya of Burma, as well as the minority  Christians in Burma. After President Barack Obama lifted sanctions on  Burma, the Burmese military has been targeting religious minorities,  resulting in the creation of the world's largest ever refugee camp of  1.1 million people in Bangladesh.   Secretary Pompeo and Ambassador Haley deserve thanks for shining a  light on this tremendous evil in Burma.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do  now adjourn.
