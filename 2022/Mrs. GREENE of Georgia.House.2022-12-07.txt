 Mr. Speaker, since 9/11 over 13.5 million  border encounters have occurred at our border. Over 1 million Americans  have died from drug overdoses, and CNN reports that the cartels take in  $19 to $29 billion annually from drug sales to the United States of  America.   Since 9/11 the United States has spent $8 trillion on foreign wars,  and over 7,000 U.S. servicemembers have died defending foreign lands  and foreign borders.   Now we have sent over $50 billion to Ukraine, and President Biden  wants another $37 billion to Ukraine. This will be pushing it to over  $90 billion.   Yesterday Democrats voted ``no'' on my House resolution to audit  Ukraine. The American people deserve transparency and oversight on  where their money is going.   I also want to point out that America deserves our borders to be  defended so that if we are going to support any war, we should support  a war on the cartels that are killing Americans and invading our  country.                            ____________________
