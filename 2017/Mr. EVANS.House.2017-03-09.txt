 Mr. Speaker, I want to share with you what repealing the  Affordable Care Act means to Pennsylvania's Second Congressional  District:   369,000 people who receive health care from their employers could  lose consumer protections;   335,000 people with health coverage that covers preventive care  services could lose their coverage;   62,000 people covered by Medicaid expansion could lose their  coverage;   21,000 people who receive financial assistance will be at greater  risk of not being able to afford coverage.   These are our mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and  daughters, and friends and neighbors. Philadelphia deserves a  healthcare law that offers quality, affordable care. We must continue  to speak up and speak out against the new healthcare law that hurts so  many people in our city, our State, and our Nation.                            ____________________
