 Mr. Speaker, last week President Trump held a rally in  the Twin Cities where, once again, immigrants and refugees were  demonized. This time it was the Somali and east African communities who  call Minnesota home who were attacked.   We should call those attacks on those who have come to the United  States seeking a better life for what they are: racist and wrong.   Since the rally, members of the Somali community have come forward  publicly to share their fear of being targeted: fear to go to work,  fear to go to school, fear to gather socially in public.   Minnesota has a long and proud history of welcoming refugees.  Minnesotans will always stand up for our values and our neighbors. To  my Somali and east African neighbors, my message is clear: You are  welcome in Minnesota. You are an important part of the fabric of our  community, and the contributions you make to the State we all love  makes Minnesota stronger.   Your friends and neighbors stand with you, and together we will  continue to defend our long and proud history of welcoming refugees.                            ____________________
