 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  National Cancer Prevention Month and to highlight the long-term,  exceptional work of the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute at the  University of Arkansas in Little Rock.   The Rockefeller Cancer Institute opened in 1989 and serves as  Arkansas' only comprehensive cancer treatment and research facility.  Now in its 30th year, the Rockefeller Cancer Institute is in the  process of pursuing designation as a National Cancer Institute.   In 2018, approximately 44 Arkansans a day were diagnosed with some  form of cancer, and 6,910 Arkansans lost their lives to this terrible  disease. NCI grant funding would increase Arkansans' access to clinical  trials and new therapies, expand services for patients, and create more  healthcare jobs in central Arkansas.   With 70 NCI-designated cancer centers across the country, not one is  in Arkansas, and therefore, this is a vitally important mission.   I applaud the Rockefeller Institute's objective.                           Recognizing Bill Holmes     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my  friend, Bill Holmes, who passed away peacefully late last year. He left  an indelible impact on the Arkansas business community.   Bill dedicated over four decades of his life to financial services,  community banking, and government policy, most recently as CEO of the  Arkansas Bankers Association. I was fortunate to work with him  throughout my business career in Arkansas.   Among his friends, Bill was known for his quick wit, mischievous  smile, and ability to connect with others. Bill's contributions to our  State and our community banks will not be forgotten. I join all  Arkansans in recognizing Bill for his remarkable career and his life  well-lived.   I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his wife, Rita, and  their family and friends.                       Recognizing Sybil Jordan Hampton     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my  friend, Sybil Jordan Hampton, who was recently awarded the alumni award  from the University of Chicago for providing leadership in advancing  social justice and equity in our society.   Sybil grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas, and in 1962, in the aftermath  of the Little Rock Nine integration of Central High in 1957, Sybil  became the first African American student to complete her entire  education at Little Rock Central High School.    She went on to earn her bachelor's degree from Earlham College, a  master's degree in elementary education from the University of Chicago,  and a second master's degree and doctorate from Columbia University.   After working as a higher education administrator and philanthropist,  Sybil returned to Little Rock to become president of the Winthrop  Rockefeller Foundation, focusing on building a better Arkansas. She  continues to be involved in many local community service organizations  and is a life member of the Girl Scouts of America.   As a local educator and civic and community leader, Arkansas has been  an enriched place to live and work due to the outstanding  accomplishments of Sybil Jordan Hampton.                            Recognizing Jim Hinkle     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  achievements of Mr. Jim Hinkle, who was inducted into the Arkansas  Outdoor Hall of Fame last year by the Arkansas Game and Fish  Commission.   Born and raised in Mountain View, Arkansas, Jim graduated from the  University of Central Arkansas before pursuing a lifelong career in  community service and the outdoors. He served as commissioner of the  Arkansas Game and Fish Commission before transitioning to 14 years on  the board of the National Wild Turkey Federation, ultimately serving as  president of the national chapter.   Jim's leadership helped lead toward the expansion and improvement of  habitat throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. His service  to the State of Arkansas and to wildlife and conservation causes will  not be forgotten, and I join all Arkansans in congratulating Jim on  this achievement and wish him much continued success.                    Recognizing Thurman Booth's Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life  of Thurman Booth. Thurman retired earlier this year after serving more  than 52 years in wildlife services, most recently as the Arkansas  director of Wildlife Services for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.   Thurman's journey began at Louisiana State University. He quickly  joined the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife as a trainee and then  became assistant State supervisor in the Division of Wildlife Services.  He served as the Wildlife Services lead in Arkansas since 1968.   We appreciate his service to conservation and to the Game and Fish  Commission, and I wish him a great retirement.                            ____________________
