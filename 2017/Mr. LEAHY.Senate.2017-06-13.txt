 Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator  from Illinois for his comments. Certainly we hear those same things in  town meetings in Vermont.                             Russia Investigation    Mr. President, on another matter, this afternoon, Attorney General  Sessions will return to the Senate for the first time since his  confirmation hearing. It has been more than 3 months since the press  revealed that the Attorney General gave false testimony in response to  questions from both myself and from Senator Franken about his contact  with Russian officials; yet the Attorney General has made no effort to  come back before the Judiciary Committee to explain these actions-- actions that some could construe as perjury.  [[Page S3421]]    There are now countless new and troubling questions swirling around  the Attorney General. In fact, he was scheduled to appear before the  Appropriations Committee this morning--a committee that would have to  vote on his request for a budget--but, for the second time in as many  months, he abruptly canceled. Neither I nor Senator Franken sit on the  Intelligence Committee, so we are not going to have the opportunity to  follow up with the Attorney General in person. I am not going to be  able to ask him why he hid his contacts with the Russian Ambassador,  including a reported third meeting at the Mayflower Hotel, nor will I  be able to ask about the timing of his recusal or his involvement with  the Russia investigation both before his recusal and after. I will not  be able to ask whether the President ever suggested he intervene in the  Russia investigation in any way. And especially I will not be able to  ask how the Attorney General can justify violating his recusal from the  Russia investigation by working to fire its lead investigator.   The American people deserve answers to each of these questions--not  only answers, they deserve truthful answers. That is why I shared my  questions for Attorney General Sessions on these topics. But I also  shared them with members of the Intelligence Committee.   So, at least, on the plus side, Attorney General Sessions will  finally face some serious questions, but I am still concerned he is not  going to be the most forthcoming witness. We saw last week that Trump  administration officials have invented a brand new claim of privilege  to insulate themselves from congressional oversight--and to protect  themselves from giving answers that would be embarrassing or damaging  to the President.   I asked the Congressional Research Service to provide me with a list  of valid reasons to refuse to answer a question from a Senator. There  is executive privilege, of course, but it has to be invoked by the  President, and it is not absolute. Of course, there are also  constitutional privileges, such as the Fifth Amendment right to not  incriminate oneself. Even in my days as prosecutor, I strongly  protected the rights of people, no matter what crime they were charged  with, to take the Fifth Amendment if they wanted to, but there is no  ``I would rather not answer'' privilege. That is not in the Fifth  Amendment. That is not an executive privilege. Unless it necessarily  involves disclosing classified information, the answer ``I would rather  discuss this behind closed doors'' is not a valid response either. That  is really not a valid response. That is just trying to get out of  answering questions.    The Attorney General's spokesperson said yesterday that Attorney  General Sessions ``believes it is important for the American people to  hear the truth directly from him and [he] looks forward to answering  the committee's questions.'' Yet it was also reported yesterday he  plans to invoke executive privilege in response to some inquiries. If  true, the Attorney General is speaking out of both sides of his mouth.   I hope the Attorney General is not going to allow President Trump to  follow the precedent of Richard Nixon and go down the path of invoking  executive privilege to stop an inquiry into illegal or unethical  conduct. These questions need to be answered. The American people  deserve the truth. They deserve an Attorney General who is held  accountable for his leadership of the Justice Department, not one who  is embroiled in controversy and hides from the congressional committee  of oversight jurisdiction of his Department.   We must not lose sight of the fact that our democracy was attacked.  It was attacked by a country that has no respect for us. If we do not  take this seriously, we will be attacked again. We must know exactly  how that happened so we can protect our democratic institutions and  protect our country. This goes way beyond the Republican or the  Democratic parties. That includes knowing whether members of the Trump  campaign enabled Russian interference.   Russia is not a friend. Just as they have tried to interfere with  elections in some of the NATO countries in other parts of the world, we  know they have tried to interfere with ours. The American people also  deserve to know whether the President or his administration have  attempted to interfere in the Russia investigation, knowing it was  improper. Any such attempt would amount to obstruction of justice.   Attorney General Sessions needs to answer critical questions today.  He needs to answer for his leadership of the Justice Department in both  the Senate Appropriations and the Judiciary Committees. He can keep  ducking the questions, but sooner or later, the Attorney General must  answer for his actions.   We deserve to know whether he is acting in the public interest--which  is what an Attorney General should do--or in Donald Trump's personal  interest. If he cannot decide between those interests, if he cannot  distinguish between the public's interests and Donald Trump's  interests, well, he is not fit to serve as Attorney General.   I pointed out, when Deputy Rosenstein came before the Appropriations  Committee this morning, all the things the administration were cutting  out of the budget--money for victims of crime, money to go after the  opioid epidemic in this country, large cuts in the FBI. I could go on  and on. However, there is one place they did put in money for more  lawyers. They put in money for lawyers to work taking private property  of people in Texas and Arizona and elsewhere to build this wall of the  President's. So we will take out money for victims of crime or for  fighting the opioid epidemic, but we will sure learn how to get money  to hire private lawyers to go after people's private property along the  Rio Grande to build a wall which will not really accomplish anything,  other than to fulfill part of a campaign promise--a campaign promise to  build a $40 billion wall. The other part, of course, was to have Mexico  pay for it. The check is in the mail--very, very, very slow mail.   I see--speaking of Attorneys General and people from Texas--my  friend, the former attorney general of Texas, the distinguished senior  Senator from Texas on the floor so I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.
