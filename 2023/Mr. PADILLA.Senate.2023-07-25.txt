 Madam President, I rise to introduce the Mental Health  for Latinos Act. This important bill would boost our continued efforts  to reduce stigma and promote mental wellness, while meeting the diverse  needs of Latino communities across the country.   In response to the mental health crisis in the Latino community, this  legislation requires the Department of Health and Human Services to  develop a strategy to provide information on evidence-based practices,  interventions, and treatments that are culturally and linguistically  appropriate and increases awareness of symptoms of mental illnesses  common among such populations, considering differences within  subgroups, such as gender, gender identity, age, sexual orientation,  race, or ethnicity.   The evidence is clear: We are experiencing a mental health crisis in  the Latino community. Disparities within our healthcare system are  preventing members of Latino communities from receiving lifesaving  mental health services.   These barriers to care are causing too many to suffer in silence, and  this must change. Presently, only 36.1 percent of Latino adults aged 18  or older with a mental illness received services in 2021, compared to  the U.S. average of 47.2 percent. Between 2010 and 2020, the suicide  rate among male Latino adults ages 20 to 64 increased by 35.7 percent,  and the female rate increased by 40.6 percent. Even those who are able  to access services rarely receive the effective, culturally competent  care they need.   This bill would further our continued efforts to reduce stigma and  promote mental wellness, while meeting the diverse needs of Latino  populations across the country. As our Nation confronts an unfolding  mental health crisis, this critical legislation reinforces the timeless  message that there is zero shame in asking for help and that seeking  support is a sign of strength.   I would like to thank Congresswoman Napolitano for leading this  legislation in the House of Representatives, and I look forward to  working with my colleagues to enact the Mental Health for Latinos Act  as soon as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Mr. Warner):   S. 2477. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to  provide pharmacy payment of certain services; to the Committee on  Finance.    Madam President, I rise to introduce the Converting Our  Waste Sustainably, COWS, Act of 2023. This legislation will help dairy  and livestock producers reduce methane emissions, improve air and water  quality, and implement more sustainable alternative manure management  practices.   As the top dairy State in the country and the second in cheese  production, California is the largest producer of milk, butter, and  cheeses like mozzarella, Monterey Jack, and queso fresco. Dairy  operations contribute billions of dollars to California's economy but  are also responsible for 60 percent of California's methane emissions.   Recognizing the urgency of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions like  methane, California and the dairy industry are on track to reduce dairy  methane emissions by 40 percent by 2030 largely due to the successes of  California's own Alternative Manure Management Program.   The COWS Act would establish an Alternative Manure Management Program  to help dairy and livestock producers transition toward pasture-based  management, alternative treatment and storage practices, solid  separation systems, and scrape technologies.   This voluntary program, modeled after California's extremely  successful Alternative Manure Management Program, will provide more  resources for the dairy and livestock industry to modernize  technologies for manure management that help boost profitability,  improve water quality, and reduce methane and nitrogen oxide emissions  by fostering climate-smart farming.  [[Page S3526]]    The bill also makes composting eligible for funding under the  Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation  Stewardship Program.   Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural operations is  critical to addressing the climate crisis. Because of the high  construction and operation costs associated with anerobic digesters,  nondigester manure management practices can provide a more cost- effective alternative for family dairy and livestock operators seeking  to improve profitability while improving air and water quality for  their communities.   I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Brown and Heinrich, for  their leadership in reducing agricultural methane emissions and  Representative Costa for championing this bill in the House.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the COWS Act as  quickly as possible.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to introduce the Mental Health  for Latinos Act.
