 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I, too, rise in support of H.R. 4499, the National Institute on  Minority and Health Disparities Research Endowment Revitalization Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my Committee on Energy and Commerce colleagues  on both sides of the aisle, especially Congressman Carter and  Congresswoman Barragan, for their leadership on this bill, and the  chairman for moving it.   This bill authorizes the National Institute on Minority Health and  Health Disparities to award research grants to current and former  Centers of Excellence that conduct research on minority health  disparities.   Health inequalities and inequities are disproportionately experienced  by minority populations, and we all know they can have adverse impacts  on health outcomes, on economic opportunities and, frankly, on overall  quality of life. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these  disparities, which is why this legislation is so important, Mr.  Speaker.   Continued support of these Centers of Excellence is critical in  advancing minority health, addressing health inequities, and expanding  educational and training opportunities for those interested in further  advancing research in this space.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Latta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), one of the coauthors of this piece of  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I don't believe we have any other Members  wishing to speak on this legislation, so I will just close and say it  is another great work product from our Energy and Commerce Committee,  bipartisan legislation that I encourage our colleagues to support, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5668. This is the MODERN  Labeling Act, and I want to thank our colleagues, Representatives  Guthrie and Matsui, for their leadership on this important legislation  which will allow the FDA to require modifications be made to outdated  labeling for generic drugs.   Now, while drug manufacturers are required to update a label when it  becomes inaccurate, false, or misleading, there is no such requirement  when new scientific information indicates there may be a new use for  the product.   Generic drugs are generally required to have the same labeling as the  brand drug they reference; however, once the brand drug is no longer on  the market, the generic manufacturer is actually prohibited from  updating their label to reflect the most accurate, up-to-date  information, information that is often discovered through postmarket  use. So the inability to update labeling can result in information gaps  for providers and patients when discussing treatments.   For example, it has been estimated that more than half, Mr. Speaker-- half--of all uses of cancer drugs are off-label, meaning the drug is  used for a disease or medical condition that it is not approved to  treat. Many of these uses are widely accepted in the medical community  and based on the most up-to-date scientific evidence; however, they are  not reflected in FDA-approved labeling.    So H.R. 5668 would help. It would close this existing information  gap. It would give doctors and patients the information they need when  making decisions about their treatment options.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), one of our terrific leaders on the Energy and  Commerce Committee on the Republican side and someone who put a lot of  time and effort into this bipartisan legislation.    Mr. Speaker, no, I do not.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I too rise in support of H.R. 4712. This is the Fairness  in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act as you have heard. I want to thank  Representatives Carter, McKinley, Dean, and Veasey for their work and  leadership on this important legislation.   The Orphan Drug Act was enacted to incentivize the development of  drugs for rare diseases by providing products that receive an orphan  drug designation 7 years of market exclusivity. That means a drug  produced by another manufacturer that contains the same active  ingredient to treat the same condition is barred from entering the  market during this time period.   One way a drug can receive an orphan designation and subsequent  marketing exclusivity is by the manufacturer's demonstration that there  is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will  be recovered.   However, we have seen in recent years that some drug manufacturers,  in an effort to block competitors from entering the market, have taken  advantage of a loophole in this law. Existing law allows an orphan drug  designation and marketing exclusivity to carry forward to future  versions of the same drug without requiring the manufacturer to  demonstrate the drug has not been, and remains unlikely to be,  profitable. This legislation closes that loophole. It requires  manufacturers to demonstrate there is no reasonable expectation that  the costs of research and development will be recovered for each  successor drug, while still preserving incentives for orphan drug  development.   While disagreements do remain, Mr. Speaker, on whether these  amendments should apply retroactively, those differences should not  prevent us from addressing this important issue today.   So I look forward to continuing negotiations on these differences as  we work with the Senate and get a bill down to the President's desk for  signature.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), who is one of the coauthors of this very  important legislation and who is the only--I think still only-- pharmacist in the United States House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I do not have any more speakers on my side  of the aisle on this matter.   Mr. Speaker, I urge colleagues to approve the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I too rise in support of H.R. 2466, the State Opioid  Response Grant Authorization Act which, as you heard, was introduced by  Representatives Trone, Armstrong, Sherrill, and Riggleman.   I would like to thank Representative Trone for leading this work on  this bill and for working with us to get the language to a good place.  We appreciate that.   When I chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee, I think we passed  out something like 60 or more pieces of legislation dealing with the  opioid crisis. All of them were cosponsored by Democrats and  Republicans--bipartisan effort--that became the SUPPORT Act signed by  President Trump into law now almost over 2 years ago. I just want to  say this epidemic continues, and so does our work. It has been made  worse by the pandemic as people have turned to these sorts of  medications to help themselves cope, and it is sad.   This important bill would authorize appropriations for the Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's State Opioid Response  grant program by placing it under the 21st Century Cures Act, which  first established State Response to Opioid Abuse Crisis grants.   The United States remains in the midst of this opioid crisis, and it  has been exacerbated, as I said, by the COVID-19 pandemic. But Federal  grants have provided a substantial level of support for innovative and  lifesaving programs in States across the country that are on the front- lines of addressing substance use disorders. By authorizing this grant  program and aligning it with the initiatives established in the 21st  Century Cures Act, H.R. 2466 would ensure continued, reliable support  for substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts.   Of course, Mr. Speaker, I strongly lend my support to passage of this  legislation, and I join with the chairman of the committee, Mr.  Pallone, in urging our colleagues across the building to act swiftly on  this.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want my friend from Maryland to know that we all are  sympathetic to what his family has gone through and the loss that he  has suffered. That is a very difficult story to tell.   When we were working on all the legislation in the last Congress, I  met with a lot of families who had suffered similar fates, and it is  just a tragedy. So I commend him for his work in a bipartisan way on  this issue.   And our friend from Virginia, Mr. Riggleman, who I am going to yield  to, he has been a terrific legislator during his term in Congress and a  good friend. I know how deeply he cares about this issue, and his  willingness to work in a bipartisan way should be recognized by all of  us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Riggleman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers on this important  legislation. I encourage my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2281, the Easy  Medication Access and Treatment, or Easy MAT, for Opioid Addiction Act,  which was introduced by myself and my Committee on Energy and Commerce  colleague, Mr. Ruiz.   Emergency room clinicians are well positioned to interact with those  struggling with opioid addiction and help transition them into  treatment. Currently, an ER clinician who does not have a DATA 2000  waiver can only provide a 1-day supply of narcotic drugs to be used for  medication-assisted treatment to an individual at one time for a total  of up to 3 days.   What does that mean? It means that while the patient waits to get  into treatment, they have to go back to that same clinician on each of  those 3 days to obtain medication.   Now, in a rural district such as mine--which, by the way, is larger  than the landmass of any State east of the Mississippi--this is not  realistic, especially when there is already a shortage of health  practitioners who are willing to treat patients with substance use  disorder.   One of my constituents, who I met in Hermiston, Oregon, told me she  had to travel 5 hours--5 hours--just to find a physician who could  oversee her Suboxone treatment because no one in her community was  available to do that.   H.R. 2281 would allow physicians to dispense up to 3 days of narcotic  drugs at one time for purposes of relieving withdrawal symptoms while  the individual awaits arrangements for treatment.  [[Page H5813]]    This is commonsense legislation, another good product of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Curtis), Utah's Third Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, we have no speakers left on our side, so I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2117, the Food  Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research Act.   This legislation codifies sesame as a major food allergen. This means  that, with enactment of the legislation, products containing sesame  would have to list this ingredient on the food packaging label. That is  really important for consumers.   Recent studies indicate that sesame allergies in the United States  have a prevalence rate on par with the allergies for soy and fish,  which are both listed as major allergens under the Federal Food, Drug,  and Cosmetic Act.   It is commonsense legislation. It provides consumers with important  and, perhaps, even lifesaving information to protect themselves and  their families from dangerous allergic reactions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5855, the Bipartisan  Solution to Cyclical Violence Act of 2020.   I want to thank our colleagues, Representatives Ruppersberger and  Kinzinger, for putting forward a meaningful solution to address  violence in all of our communities. This legislation provides Federal  grants to hospitals and trauma centers for intervention services for  victims of violent crime.   Violence in America disproportionately impacts urban and underserved  communities where poor social determinants of health can contribute to  structural violence. Hospital-based intervention programs help reduce  violence because they reach high-risk individuals recently admitted to  a hospital for treatment of a serious violent injury.   Hospitalization presents a unique and, frankly, teachable moment when  an individual may be open to help, in turn, breaking the cycle of  violence by immediate intervention.   Currently, many hospitals are left with nothing but simply  discharging gunshot injury patients without any strategy in place to  reduce the risk of recidivism or retaliation. However, according to the  American College of Surgeons, those who received violence intervention  at the hospital, Madam Speaker, were significantly less likely to be  reinjured and to get involved in crime in the future. So it works.   By supporting hospital-based violence intervention programs, this  bill would help individuals at risk from becoming entangled in violent  crime and connect them with local resources that address the underlying  risk factors for violence.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Maryland for his  good work on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Kinzinger), who is a very talented legislator. He has put a lot into  this bill.    Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers on our side of the  aisle. I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3878, the Block,  Report, And Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act, which was led by my  Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues, Representatives McKinley and  Dingell.   This legislation addresses an alarming problem that was identified in  the committee's 2018 bipartisan investigation in the distribution of  prescription opioids by wholesale drug distributors. The committee  found that when millions of prescription opioids were dumped into  communities, large and small, across the country, the distributors  flagged the orders for the DEA, but shipped the orders anyway, even  after notifying the authorities that the orders were suspicious.   H.R. 3878 would place additional commonsense obligations on drug  manufacturers and distributors who discover a controlled substance  suspicious order. In addition to reporting the suspicious order to the  DEA, this legislation requires the manufacturer or distributor to  exercise due diligence, to decline to fill the order, and to provide  information to the Drug Enforcement Administration on the indicators  that led to the belief that filling the order would violate the  Substances Controlled Act.   We all have a part to play in the fight against the opioid epidemic,  and it is critical that pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors  step up in stopping pill dumping.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Representatives Dingell and  McKinley, for their extra effort on this legislation. It is a fine  piece of work moving forward, and I commend them for their work.   Madam Speaker, I don't believe I have any speakers on this one, so I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4806, the Debarment Enforcement of Bad  Actor Registrants, or DEBAR Act, which was introduced by Energy and  Commerce Communications and Technology Subcommittee leader  Bob Latta.  He spoke to this legislation earlier on a different bill and had a  commitment now that precludes him from being here as this bill comes  up.   This legislation would give the Drug Enforcement Administration  debarment authority to prohibit a person who has repeatedly violated  the Controlled Substances Act from being able to receive a registration  to manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance.   A recent Justice Department Office of Inspector General report found  that certain bad actor registrants who had their registration revoked  were able to simply reapply for registration the day after the  enforcement action or registration surrender occurred. As a result,  registrants who pose a significant risk of diverting drugs are actually  given an opportunity to do it again. Repeat offenders should not be  able to get away with a new registration from the DEA just days after  the suspension of the old one. Limited debarment authority is a  commonsense and effective administrative tool to address diversion,  fraud, and misconduct.   I strongly support Mr. Latta's legislation and I thank my colleague,  the chairman of the committee, for his work on this, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I, too, would urge this bill's passage,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 4812, the Ensuring Compliance Against  Drug Diversion Act spearheaded by Energy and Commerce Committee  colleague Representative Morgan Griffith. I thank Mr. Griffith for his  leadership on this and many other pieces of legislation.   This legislation addresses a policy issue that was identified again  in our 2018 Energy and Commerce Committee report summarizing the  committee's bipartisan investigation into the distribution of  prescription opioids by wholesale drug distributors and subsequent  enforcement practices by the DEA.   The investigative report that we issued found that an opioid  distributor and its pharmacy customer did not go through the  appropriate process of transferring a registration to a new pharmacy  owner. This is disturbing, because failing to appropriately contact the  DEA and verify whether the agency approved the transfer of a  registration to dispense controlled substances creates a serious risk  that could lead to drug diversion.   In order to prevent people who have not been vetted by the  authorities from dispensing controlled substances, H.R. 4812 makes  clear that the transfer of any controlled substance registration  without written consent from the DEA will be prohibited.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith), who has been a real  workhorse on this and many other pieces of legislation.    Madam Speaker, I again thank the gentleman from Virginia  for his leadership on this and so much other legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of the legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 6096, the READI Act. This legislation will  help improve the Federal Communications Commission's oversight over the  wireless and broadcast emergency alert systems, something that is much  needed in a new age of communication.   This year, our Nation was hit by horrific and deadly wildfires that  destroyed entire communities. My district and many parts of Oregon  witnessed this situation with catastrophic fires that moved very, very  rapidly, caused incredible and historic destruction, and will take  years for people to recover.   Our Emergency Alert System is so important during these times, and we  need to make sure it delivers for Americans when they need it most. In  some parts of my State, it worked flawlessly. In other parts, they are  reviewing what worked and what didn't work.   I daresay I am probably the only Member of Congress who actually has  wired in Emergency Alert System components because we used to own radio  stations. So I have pushed the buttons, and I have done the alerts, all  of that. I know how important that coordination is and how important it  is to work together ahead of time to really understand the plans and  who triggers what and how it works going forward. Because when the  emergencies do hit, there isn't time to come up with a plan. You need  to have that in place.   This bill will help establish State Emergency Communications  Committees, develop Emergency Alert System plans, and coordinate those  plans with the FCC. This type of coordination allows States the  independence to tailor their plans to their specific needs and to alert  citizens during emergencies that are specific to their localities.   However, the bill also allows the FCC to review the plans to ensure  States and other localities have considered any necessary technical  issues so that there is consistency across the plans in the case of  multistate or national emergencies.   Importantly, this bill requires coordination not only with the  experts on telecommunications technology but also with the experts on  emergency management, FEMA. The FCC will ensure State plans have  considered the necessary technical requirements, while FEMA ensures  consistency regarding the types of emergency alerts.   This type of State and national coordination will make sure that all  Americans receive alerts during emergencies and that those alerts make  sense, and that will no doubt save lives and property.   Madam Speaker, that is why I am happy to support this forward-looking  bill to improve the Emergency Alert System management at all levels,  and I urge my colleagues to do so as well.   I would just close my comments with a brief story about one of these  practice emergency sessions in my hometown on a Saturday morning. It  was a full-fledged one. All the various resources in the area were to  be engaged. The theory was that one of the mainstem Columbia River dams  had breached and that there would be massive flooding. So, that was  kind of the idea: What do you do in a mass casualty situation like  that?   Fortunately, the gentleman who worked Saturday mornings at our local  radio station had been around the block a few times. He was actually a  retiree who just liked working, doing an old radio show on Saturday  mornings. When they got the call and told him he needed to trigger the  Emergency Alert System because Bonneville Dam had been breached, he  said, ``Okay. I understand that is the practice, but I am not going to  actually go on air and say the dam has been breached.''   Because he had been around a little bit, he pushed back on the  emergency folks who were going by the letter of the plan and decided  not to create one of these events like occurred in Hawaii by saying,  ``I don't think we really want to say that, even though this is a  practice.'' I think we headed off probably a little bit of a problem  there.   Madam Speaker, this is important, and these plans are important. I  thank my colleagues for their work on this legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a State that has dealt with a  lot of disasters over the years and will in the future, to talk about  this important legislation.    Madam Speaker, I don't believe I have any other speakers  on our side of the aisle on this legislation, so I would urge its  passage.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today to urge passage of H.R. 6624, the USA Telecommunications  Act. This bill will help put the United States at the helm of network  security, ensuring that communications providers have a secure,  diverse, and competitive marketplace of trusted equipment suppliers for  their next-generation networks.   Until now, most network providers have relied on a small set of  trusted suppliers to build their networks. While these suppliers have  done a tremendous job, they face increased pressure from untrusted  Chinese suppliers who are handpicked and encouraged by the Chinese  Communist Party to significantly undercut the network equipment  marketplace by offering nearly free equipment.   As a result of this unfair competition, trusted suppliers have  increasingly relied upon proprietary soup-to-nuts offerings to survive.  But under the soup-to-nuts model, once a network provider selects a  vendor, the provider must use the same vendor for all of the hardware  and software across its network.   Well, this model is simply not sustainable, Madam Speaker. If we want  the United States to continue to have access to trusted, affordable  communications equipment that can withstand state-sponsored attempts to  undermine our security, then we have to act.   This model results in an expensive and timely process to upgrade  equipment and software for the next-generation 5G networks.   Furthermore, competing for a small set of contracts in a limited  marketplace, while simultaneously trying to fight off untrusted state- sponsored vendors, has also resulted in significant losses to research,  development, and innovation.   So Congress needs to act. We need to do all we can to ensure the  United States supports capitalism and competition among trusted  vendors. Today's bill will help us do just that.   The USA Telecommunications Act will promote and accelerate the  deployment and use of open radio access technology by infusing the  marketplace with a $750 million grant program. This hefty infusion  should help  [[Page H5825]]  create a marketplace filled with a diverse array of vendors, large and  small, who are aggressively researching and innovating.   Competition among open network solutions will reduce costs for  network providers by creating a diverse marketplace of trusted  suppliers and ensure that the same suppliers can withstand pressure  from those who do not have our best interests in mind.   So this strong endorsement of open, interoperable, and standards- based equipment would help ensure the United States maintains its place  as a global leader in wireless communications for 5G as well as future  network generations.   I am very pleased to support this legislation which will help ensure  the superiority of our wireless networks for generations to come. I  urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Guthrie), one of the principal authors of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I have no other speakers on this  legislation, so I urge its passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 7310, the Spectrum IT Modernization  Act.   I would like to thank Chairman Doyle and his team for working with  us, along with our colleagues in the Senate who introduced this bill,  Senators Wicker, Cantwell, Inhofe, and Reed.   Today's bipartisan legislation will help improve NTIA's ability to  fulfill its mandate of managing spectrum among Federal agencies.   The Energy and Commerce Committee has long conducted oversight of our  Nation's spectrum resources, and we work to balance the critical agency  mission needs and the demand to make spectrum available for commercial  users.   Through NTIA and the Federal Communications Commission, we have  successfully made Federal spectrum available for commercial use, which  is why the United States has led the world in deploying advanced  networks such as 3G and 4G, and we are continuing these efforts to  maintain U.S. leadership in 5G.   Working across all of the Federal agencies has resulted in  unprecedented commercial access to our airwave resources--like the  recently announced 100 megahertz of spectrum identified for commercial  use that the FCC will auction next year--and has garnered billions of  dollars in private investment by the private sector.   In order to leverage the efficiencies and innovation from our free  market system, NTIA must have visibility across Federal agencies as to  how agencies are using or not using these critical resources consistent  with their statutory mission.   As our world continues to demand increased connectivity, it is  essential that we harness technological innovations and empower the  NTIA to efficiently track Federal spectrum use to identify new  opportunities to improve efficiency. Done correctly, this results in  benefits for American consumers, taxpayers, and, frankly, the Federal  agencies as well.   H.R. 7310 would require NTIA to establish a process to upgrade their  spectrum management infrastructure for the 21st century. The bill would  direct the policy coordination arm of NTIA to submit a plan to Congress  as to how they will standardize the data collection across agencies and  then directs agencies with Federal spectrum assignments from NTIA to  issue an implementation plan to interoperate with NTIA's plan.   This is a good-government bill--it really is--and with continued  support and oversight from Congress, we can continue the United States'  leadership in making Federal spectrum available for flexible use by the  private sector. So I encourage my colleagues to support the  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge passage of the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2610, the Stop  Seniors Scam Act.   I too want to thank the main sponsors, Representatives Walberg and  Blunt Rochester. I know we are all keeping Representative Walberg in  our thoughts and prayers as he copes with COVID right now, or he would  be here on the floor.   I also want to acknowledge Representatives Hudson, Lujan, O'Halleran,  Kelly, and Gianforte. I guess to follow up on our chairman's comment,  this was the bill to cosponsor if you want to move into higher office  apparently. Both a future Governor and Senator are cosponsors here, and  who knows where the rest of the gang goes.   The Stop Senior Scams Act would establish a Senior Scams Prevention  Advisory Council which would create model educational materials to  educate employees of retail companies, financial institutions, and wire  transfer companies on how to identify and prevent scams. Importantly,  this effort prioritizes scams targeting our senior citizens and Native  nations, populations that have unfortunately and tragically been  targeted at a much higher rate during the COVID-19 pandemic by scammers  offering false medications----   Can you imagine that, Mr. Speaker? Or faster ways to claim stimulus  checks or Social Security checks. All of them are fraud.   The bill would also help enhance collaborative efforts between the  Federal Trade Commission and State attorneys general to prevent,  publicize, and penalize frauds and scams targeting U.S. citizens.    It is critical for Congress to do our duty to help end these scams.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Delaware, my friend, for her  work on this and so many other pieces of legislation and our work  together. We have had a good run. There is still more work to be done  in the next 40-some days, but I thank her for her kind comments and her  good work.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have said before and I will say it again: I don't think there is a  more fierce advocate for consumers than the gentlewoman who chairs the  subcommittee. She has, once again, brought solid legislation to the  floor. We appreciate her and her team working with us to make this  bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New Mexico. I think it is  worth pointing out that this probably won't make a lot of coverage in  national media, but he chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign  Committee when I chaired the National Republican Congressional  Committee. We are of different parties and sort of different regions,  in a way; we are both westerners. But once again, we are working  together for the American people, and we do a lot of that around here.  Especially on the Committee on Energy and Commerce, we have a fine  record of working things out. We have 16 of these bipartisan things on  the floor today, and I just wish our constituents saw more of this.   Mr. Speaker, I wish the gentleman from New Mexico well in his  endeavors across the Capitol. He will bring a breath of fresh air over  there, and I know his commitment to his State and all who reside in it.   I hope our paths do continue to cross in some manner. I have enjoyed  serving with the gentleman from New Mexico.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from  Illinois for her support of this legislation and her work on it.   Once again, I urge passage of the legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6435, the Combating Pandemic  Scams Act of 2020. I thank Representative Buddy Carter from Georgia,  along with Representatives Kuster, Blunt Rochester, and Hudson, for  their work and their leadership on, again, another bipartisan piece of  legislation.   As we all know, we are in the midst of this horrible pandemic. COVID- 19 has forced millions of Americans to isolate and rely on the internet  to work, learn, receive healthcare, stay connected to loved ones, and  so much more. Unfortunately, bad actors come out of the gutters  wherever they live to seek to exploit times of crisis and target our  most vulnerable.   During this pandemic, we have seen scammers attempt to exploit  consumer fear and confusion by falsely promising additional stimulus  checks, illegitimate lifesaving medications, and fake avenues to save  businesses or pay employees--all scams.   H.R. 6435 aims to protect Americans, especially senior citizens and  people with disabilities, from malicious and deceptive scams. The bill  directs the Federal Trade Commission to prioritize informing the most  vulnerable among us about mail, telemarketing, and internet scams, all  related to COVID-19.   Importantly, the bill would provide Americans with the tools they  need to educate and protect themselves against these very scams. This  legislation will be even more important as we work together to ensure  that the COVID vaccine is delivered in a safe and timely fashion.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see H.R. 6435 under consideration today. I  urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), the coauthor of the bill who has been very active  on many of these pieces of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank our colleagues on both sides of the  aisle for their work on this legislation. I urge its passage, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8121, the Pandemic Effects on  Home Safety and Tourism Act.   I thank Representatives Cardenas and Davis for their leadership and  effort on this bill to protect consumers. I also thank Ranking Member  Upton and Chairman Castor, as their legislation to promote and assist  the recovery of our tourism industry was adopted as part of this bill;  as well as Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers and Chair Schakowsky along  with, obviously, Chairman Pallone.   The Pandemic Effects on Home Safety and Tourism Act would direct the  Consumer Product Safety Commission to report and make available to the  public information about injuries and deaths from consumer products  during the COVID-19 pandemic. This would provide Americans with updates  on trends of potentially hazardous products that have entered the  marketplace during this critical time.   In addition to studying the trends of injuries, the bill would  support further research on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the  U.S. travel and tourism industries. Many communities, particularly  rural communities like those in my district, rely on tourism. We must  have the information necessary to promote and assist the travel and  tourism industry as we emerge from this devastating pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), who has put so much work into this piece  of legislation and so many others.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends on both sides of the  aisle and our terrific staffs for their great work on these 16 pieces  of legislation that we brought forward to the House floor from the  Energy and Commerce Committee.   I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
