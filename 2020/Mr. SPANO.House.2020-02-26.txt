 Madam Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Mrs. Miranda  Harwood on becoming Hillsborough County's Teacher of the Year. Mrs.  Harwood is a fourth-grade math teacher at Brooker Elementary School in  Brandon, Florida.   Mrs. Harwood embodies everything that educators should be--a kind  heart, dedication to her profession, and a commitment to her pupils. On  Monday she hosts a math club for her excelling students, and on  Wednesdays and Thursdays she stays late for those needing additional  help and encouragement.   Not only does she create a learning environment conducive to academic  achievement, but she also strives to promote safety and security for  those with difficult home lives. She really, truly cares. A former  student described the impact that she left on him and his classmates as  ``making every student feel like they are her own child.'' Wow. Praise  like this is both commendable and rare.   As Mrs. Harwood moves forward to the State competition for Teacher of  the Year, I wish her the best of luck. More importantly, I am honored  to have her passion and dedication in my district and to have her  instill these characteristics into our next generation.                            ____________________
