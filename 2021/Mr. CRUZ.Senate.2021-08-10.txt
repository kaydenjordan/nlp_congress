 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3781 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support my amendment ensuring that the Department of Homeland Security  continues to have the legal authority to expel illegal immigrants who  may have COVID-19 under title 42 of the U.S. Code to protect Americans  from the spread of this deadly pandemic.   There is a crisis at our border caused by this administration's  policies, and the fact is that our open borders and unlimited illegal  immigration coming into this country are contributing to the spread of  COVID-19 and to the dangerous Delta variant. For example, McAllen, TX,  one city in the Rio Grande Valley, has a population of 141,000 people.  But this year alone, the Biden administration has released more than  7,000 illegal aliens who have been positive for COVID-19. In fact, this  week alone, 1,315 illegal aliens were released positive with COVID-19.   This is a serious public health crisis. Title 42 gives the  administration the authority to protect public health against this  pandemic.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3681 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support this amendment to create a point of order against any  legislation that would fund or subsidize the import of electric  vehicles with supply lines that run through Xinjiang.   Right now, the Chinese Communist Party is committing genocide against  millions of Uighurs in Xinjiang. They are being tortured, murdered, and  forced into slave labor. The CCP has exploited that slave labor to  ensure that much of the world's EVs are made in Xinjiang and have parts  produced in Xinjiang.   Our Nation is in perilous risk of becoming complicit in these  atrocities as part of the massive rush to import EVs. This amendment  would prohibit our bringing in EVs that are made with slave labor. We  cannot and should not fund slave labor in communist China.    Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act, I  move to waive, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this bill  would constitute a Federal Government takeover of elections. It would  constitute a massive power grab by Democrats. It would disenfranchise  millions of Americans. It would do precisely the opposite of its  nominal title, ``For the People.'' It is, instead, for the politicians  because it entrenches politicians and ensures that the people cannot  vote them out of office.   It would strike down virtually every reasonable voter integrity law  in the country, including voter ID laws supported by the overwhelming  majority of this country; including prohibitions on ballot harvesting-- again, widely supported by people in this country. It would mandate  that felons be allowed to vote, and it would automatically register  millions of illegal aliens to vote. It would profoundly undermine  democracy in this country, and for that reason, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the text of  the Constitution explicitly assigns power to engage in redistricting to  elected State legislatures in the States. There is a reason for that.  That ensures that redistricting is controlled by the people.   We have an unfortunate pattern in today's Congress, which is today's  Democrats no longer believe in democracy. Their bill, S. 1--what many  call the Corrupt Politicians Act--is designed to prevent the voters  from voting Democrats out of office.   This bill, the bill to remove the State legislatures from their  constitutionally appointed responsibility of being in charge of  redistricting, would instead assign that to commissions and ultimately  to the Federal courts, to unelected Federal judges.   Now, redistricting and gerrymandering can lead to ugly consequences.  This is not new. The Founders were well aware of the ugly consequences  of gerrymandering. Indeed, the very word ``gerrymander'' comes from  Elbridge Gerry, one of the Founders whose district was so contorted, it  looked like a salamander. That is where the district came from.   The Founders knew that if you give redistricting to elected  politicians, they will act based on political concerns. The reason the  Founders did so is, even with those down sides, it keeps the process  accountable to the people. If you instead hand it over to unelected  commissions or to unelected Federal judges, the people are  disenfranchised. That is a serious mistake.   I would note, over a decade ago, I defended the constitutionality and  the constitutional assignment of that responsibility to the State  legislatures before the U.S. Supreme Court in the Texas redistricting  case, and we won a landmark 5-to-4 victory where the Supreme Court  upheld the clear constitutional authorization of legislatures to engage  in redistricting even if they engaged in political concerns because the  check on that is not unelected judges second-guessing the people;  rather, the check on that is democracy and the people engaging in their  own check and balance.   Accordingly, I object.    Mr. President.    Reserving the right to object, you know, I would note there  is a long history of government trying to force the disclosure of the  identity of political contributions, and much of that history is  sordid.   Indeed, in a landmark case before the U.S. Supreme Court, racist  southern Democratic politicians tried to force the NAACP to hand over  their donor list, and they wanted to do so for reasons that were not  difficult to discern, because they intended to persecute those who dare  contribute to the NAACP.   And the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, concluded that the  Constitution protects against that forced disclosure. But I will say,  the majority leader said just a few minutes ago that surely there must  be some area of common ground, and indeed there is on this issue.   I think all of us, if we were speaking in a moment of candor, if we  were not engaged in our typical partisan battle on the floor, would  acknowledge the current system is stupid. The current system makes no  sense. Super-PACs make no sense. Why is that? Because in all of our  elections--every one of us has run for election--there are super-PACs,  which are independent groups. It is illegal for us, as candidates, to  speak with those independent groups. And in every one of our races--I  see the Senator from Arizona. He is going have a hotly contested race.  It wouldn't surprise me to see $100 million or more spent in his race,  perhaps on both sides. Much of that will be spent in super-PACs.   It is illegal for us, as candidates, to communicate with those super- PACs. So we are left with the bizarre situation where there is millions  or sometimes tens of millions of dollars being spent on behalf of us;  millions, sometimes tens of millions of dollars, spent attacking us;  and we can't communicate with them. We hope it has some bearing or  relevance to what we believe.   Every Congress, since I have been here, I have introduced legislation  to end this. This is legislation called the SuperPAC Elimination Act.  This act does two very simple things. No. 1, it allows unlimited  individual contributions to Federal campaigns, not from unions, not  from corporations but from real human beings, from people--unlimited  contributions.   I would note this is the way the State of Texas handles State  elections.   No. 2, my legislation, the SuperPAC Elimination Act, requires  immediate 24-hour disclosure. So if an individual  [[Page S6252]]  writes a check to a campaign, that gets disclosed immediately, and you  can debate about whether that contribution was corrosive or not.   This legislation would not prohibit super-PACs, but, as a practical  matter, super-PACs would fade from relevance because every candidate  would much prefer money given to their campaign, where you can spend on  your own message. It would make far more sense to have an open,  transparent system.   Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of a bill at the desk that would protect  freedom of speech in America's electoral process and ensure  transparency in campaign finance. I ask unanimous consent that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed, and that a motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the able.    I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the Senator  from New Jersey and, indeed, all of the Senators in this Chamber know  precisely why these nominees have not moved forward, and the reason is  because the Biden administration is currently engaged in open defiance  of the U.S. Congress and is doing so in a way that is working serious  and material harm to the United States national security.   Over a year ago, December of 2019, this Senate and, indeed, the full  Congress passed legislation imposing strong sanctions on the Nord  Stream 2 Pipeline. The Nord Stream 2 Pipeline is a pipeline between  Russia and Germany designed to carry natural gas. It is a deep sea  pipeline.   Vladimir Putin desperately wants this pipeline completed. If the  pipeline is completed, it will give billions of dollars to Putin to use  for malign efforts in Europe and throughout the world.   This Congress is overwhelmingly convinced that completing the Nord  Stream 2 pipeline is terrible policy. It is bad for the United States;  it is bad for Europe; and it is good for Russia and Putin. Accordingly,  the Congress passed overwhelmingly bipartisan sanctions legislation  that I authored, along with Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, and that  legislation proved tremendously successful.   How successful was it? When the President signed it into law, if my  memory serves correctly, at 7 p.m. on a Thursday, construction on the  pipeline halted at 6:45 p.m. on that Thursday. Fifteen minutes before  the sanctions went into law, they ceased building the pipeline. And for  a year the pipeline lay dormant. It lay as a hunk of metal at the  bottom of the ocean.   We had succeeded together. This body had won a bipartisan national  security victory for the United States.   Then, in November of last year, Joe Biden was elected. When Joe Biden  was elected, President Biden and his foreign policy team immediately  began signaling weakness on Nord Stream 2 to Putin, and that signal was  heard. Putin commenced preparatory efforts to begin building the  pipeline again within days of the Presidential election in November.  And Russia began building the pipeline again in January, just days  after Joe Biden was sworn in.   Existing laws that this body has passed, not once but twice, mandate  sanctions to stop the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. Unfortunately, the Biden  administration decided to waive those sanctions. Waiving those  sanctions, I believe, will prove to be a generational geopolitical  mistake. If we continue on the current pace set out by President Biden,  Putin will complete the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline.   If that happens, for decades, Putin and the next dictator in Russia  and the next dictator in Russia will get billions of dollars every year  from this pipeline. They will use it for military aggression. They will  use it for spying on America. They will use it for attacking their  enemies.   Not only that, Europe will be captive to Russian natural gas. It will  be subject to energy blackmail. We don't have to hypothesize this  because Putin has demonstrated his willingness to use energy blackmail  on Europe going forward. This undermines the interests of Europe. It  undermines the interests of America. And by the way, it also hurts jobs  in the United States of America.   I have made clear to every State Department official, to every State  Department nominee, that I would place holds on these nominees unless  and until the Biden administration follows the law and stops this  pipeline, imposes the sanctions.   As the Senator from New Jersey knows well--he and I worked together  closely on these sanctions legislation that the Biden administration is  refusing to follow--I have been negotiating with the Biden  administration in good faith for a month, months, laying out a path to  move these nominees forward. But unfortunately, to date, President  Biden has insisted on giving a multibillion-dollar gift to Joe Biden  benefiting Russia, hurting America, and hurting our national security  interests.   That being said, there is a path where I would readily lift these  holds, and it is a path I am in a moment going to propound a unanimous  consent resolution--a unanimous consent request to take up and pass  legislation that I have introduced that would impose the sanctions that  are already required by law that the Biden administration refuses to  follow. This legislation is legislation that both of the Democratic  members of the Foreign Relations Committee have voted for substantially  similar legislation in the past.   If this legislation passes the Senate, if it passes the House and is  signed by the President, the day it is signed by the President, I will  lift these holds. But given that the President and the White House have  indicated they intend to defy the law, I am not going to lift the holds  unless and until they relent in their effort to give this gift to  Vladimir Putin                          Unanimous Consent Request    Mr. President, accordingly, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of a bill at the desk that would  require the imposition of sanctions with respect to Nord Stream 2. I  ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Reserving the right to object, I will respond briefly to  the Senator from New Jersey.   The talking point from the Biden administration as to why they have  given this gift to Vladimir Putin is they say the pipeline is almost  completed; that it is over 90 percent complete. The problem with that  argument is it is demonstrably false because it was equally true in  December of 2019. In December of 2019, the pipeline was over 90 percent  complete. And, indeed, at that time, there was a massive Russian  disinformation campaign throughout Europe, where the Russian Government  was putting out: These sanctions will never pass, and if they pass,  they will never work.   Why? Because the pipeline is over 90 percent complete. Well, a  pipeline that is 90 percent complete is a pipeline that is zero percent  complete. Until it is 100 percent complete, it transmits zero natural  gas. The pipeline doesn't work until you finish it, and that Russian  disinformation we discovered the day the sanction legislation was  signed was exactly that, was utterly false, nonsense.   Why? Because the day it was signed they stopped construction, and  they stopped it for a year. And Putin only began construction after Joe  Biden was elected, after he was sworn into office, and after his team  indicated weakness, that they wouldn't enforce the sanctions against  Russia.   So their talking point that it was 90 percent complete, that was true  a year ago. And we knew we could stop it then. We can stop it now. The  only reason Putin is building this pipeline is because the Biden  administration is unwilling to stand up to Russia. Accordingly, I  object.    Reserving the right to object, I would note, as the Senator  from New Jersey knows well, that I pressed President Trump vigorously  on this topic, engaged aggressively with the Trump administration, with  the Treasury Department, with the State Department, with the National  Security Council, and we prevailed in those battles. The Trump  administration issued a series of sanctions, and they worked. They  stopped the pipelines.   So I have demonstrated a perfect willingness to stand up to a  President of my own party on this issue, and we succeeded in stopping  the pipeline. Now, when there is a Democratic President, we have yet to  see Democratic Members of this body willing to stand up as vigorously  to their own party's President, who is actively and eagerly  facilitating the building of this pipeline.   I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because it is  a generational geopolitical mistake to give a multibillion-dollar gift  to Vladimir Putin to strengthen Russia and to undermine national  security, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because it is  a massive strategic error, one that weakens our allies, that endangers  our allies, and makes Russia more dangerous, more aggressive, more  willing to attack and undermine U.S. national security, and because Joe  Biden and the Biden administration are defying U.S. law passed with  overwhelming bipartisan support from Congress, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because the  Biden administration should not be giving a massive multibillion-dollar  gift to Putin, strengthening Russia, and weakening America and U.S.  national security interests, I object.    Reserving the right to object, because I think it is a  generational mistake, one that will harm U.S. nationality security  interests, will endanger U.S. service men and women, will weaken  America, will weaken our allies, and will strengthen our enemies and  our adversaries, because I believe that Joe Biden giving a massive  multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin to make him stronger and  more aggressive is enormously harmful to America, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because Joe  Biden should not be giving a multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir  Putin, strengthening Russia, and undermining U.S. national security, I  object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because Joe  Biden  [[Page S6257]]  has made the decision to give a massive multibillion-dollar gift to  Vladimir Putin, because that weakness toward Russia empowers our  enemies, endangers our service men and women, weakens our national  security, and destroys jobs here at home, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because Joe  Biden should not be defying U.S. law, disregarding the overwhelming  bipartisan consensus of both Houses of Congress, because Joe Biden  should not be giving a massive multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir  Putin that constitutes unilateral surrender to Russia in a way that  strengthens Russia, weakens America, and endangers our Nation,  undermining U.S. national security, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I appreciate  my friend from New Jersey's attempt to abbreviate this, and I am  endeavoring to be concise but nonetheless lay out the factual  predicate, because it was a mistake for Joe Biden to give a  multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin, to disregard U.S. law, to  weaken U.S. national security interests and to strengthen Russia at our  expense, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because Joe  Biden is giving a multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin, in  defiance of U.S. law, in contravention of the overwhelming bipartisan  consensus of Congress, which hurts America, strengthens Russia, and  endangers the people of this Nation, I object.    Mr. President, reserving my right to object, because Joe  Biden is giving a multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin, which  weakens America's, strengthens Russia, and endangers our national  security, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because it is  a generational geopolitical mistake for Joe Biden to give a  multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin, because that mistake  weakens America, strengthens Russia, and endangers our national  security, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I would  note something to my friend from New Jersey, as the Senator from New  Jersey knows--with respect to the previous nominee, I do not have a  hold on the previous nominee. I have lifted my hold pursuant to  discussions and negotiations. The same is true with respect to former  Senator Ken Salazar, who has been nominated to be Ambassador to Mexico.  My understanding is he is going to be confirmed momentarily. I don't  have a hold, and I don't believe there are any other holds or blocks to  his confirmation. So that will occur momentarily.  [[Page S6258]]    And, indeed, there have been several other nominees at the State  Department where I have lifted the holds in negotiations, including at  the request of the Senator from New Jersey. I have worked with my  colleagues, but at the same time used the leverage that we have as  Senators to try to pressure the Biden administration to follow the law  and to defend U.S. national security interests.   With regard to this particular unanimous consent request, because Joe  Biden is giving Vladimir Putin a multibillion-gift, which is a  generational geopolitical mistake, because it strengthens Russia at the  expense of America and it undermines U.S. national security interests,  I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because it is  a generational geopolitical mistake for Joe Biden to give Vladimir  Putin a multibillion-dollar gift that will continue for decades into  the future, because that mistake strengthens Russia at the expense of  America and it undermines U.S. national security, I object.    Reserving the right to object. The Senator of Texas spoke  of revisionist history. Perhaps it was fitting that he did so because  we proceeded to hear quite a bit of revisionist history.   The unfortunate reality is the Democratic Party in this Chamber has  been reluctant to stand up to Russia and reluctant to stand up to the  Soviet Union before that, for decades. The Democratic Party  consistently has embraced weakness on Russia and the Soviet Union.   I am old enough to remember President Barack Obama in debate with  Republican nominee Mitt Romney when Mitt Romney said we need to stand  up to Russia. And President Obama stood up and said: Mitt, the 1980s  called and they want their foreign policy back because the Democratic  Party position was weakness to Russia.   I am old enough to remember President Obama leaning over to Medvedev  caught on a hot mic saying: Tell Vladimir--that would be Putin--I'll  have more flexibility after the election.   It was only when Donald Trump was elected that the Democratic Party  suddenly discovered Russia is a menace. I welcome that. I welcome that  sudden discovery. I think Russia was a menace before and after.   But for too many Senate Democrats, it is purely political. Russia,  Russia, Russia was a stick to beat up on Donald Trump and the substance  of it didn't matter   So the Senator from Connecticut said: Well, gosh, Donald Trump--he  thinks--was terrible on Russia.   Here is a simple fact. Under President Trump, we stopped the pipeline  the day this sanctions legislation was signed into law.   Under President Biden, Putin began building the pipeline again. Those  are facts. You want to talk about who is weak on Russia? Those are  simple facts, and those facts are dangerous.   Because Joe Biden giving a multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin  was a generational geopolitical mistake because it strengthens Russia  and it weakens America because it endangers U.S. national security  interests, I object.    Reserving the right to object. Just a few moments ago, the  Senator from Connecticut said something bad is going to happen. Let me  tell you, he is right. Something bad is going to happen, and there is a  reason for it.   The Biden foreign policy, in just 7 months, has been the most  disastrous foreign policy we have seen of any administration since  Jimmy Carter. To every enemy of America, they have projected weakness.   On Russia, Joe Biden has given Vladimir Putin what he wanted most: A  multibillion-dollar pipeline to let him extort Europe.   On China, the Biden administration has been projecting weakness over  and over and over again, including kowtowing to China and reversing the  State Department policy on Taiwan, prohibiting Taiwan from displaying  their flag or wearing military uniforms on U.S. Government property;  kowtowing to the Communist Party of China.   On Iran, the Biden administration said their top foreign policy  objective is sending billions of dollars to the Ayatollah Khomeini,  even as he is the leading state-sponsor of terrorism to the world and  chants, ``Death to America.''   And on Hamas, the Biden administration has sent hundreds of millions  of dollars to the Palestinian Authority, much of which has found its  way to Hamas and has been materialized in rockets raining down on  Israel.   So is something bad going to happen?   Yes, because when you show weakness to our enemies, it encourages our  enemies and they get more and more aggressive.   Where I differ with the Senator from Connecticut is I don't think the  way to avoid something bad is to keep showing weakness and give Putin  what he wants. The way to stand up to our enemies is to demonstrate  strength, not weakness. I believe in peace through strength. I think  appeasement invites conflict.   Because Joe Biden's multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin is a  generational geopolitical mistake, because it strengthens Russia at the  expense of America, and because it undermines U.S. national security  interests, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I would note  one of the efforts that the State Department has endeavored to do to  try to force these nominations through is planning a whole series of  articles in papers, which they somehow believe would pressure me. The  most abusing of which was an article, I believe, in POLITICO, if I  remember correctly, that began ominously: The mansions in Europe where  our ambassadors reside are sadly empty due to this one Senator's  objections.   I will confess, my heart is not broken that some rich Democratic  donor is not wining and dining people in a grand ambassadorial mansion.  I am sure that is an enormous crisis in Georgetown.   What I think is a crisis is making Putin stronger and Russia stronger  and weakening Europe, weakening our allies, and weakening America.   And because Biden's multibillion-dollar gift to Putin weakened  America, strengthened Russia, and undermined our U.S. national  security, I object.    Reserving the right to object. I would note there is irony  in the Senator from Connecticut expressing deep concern about China  just an hour or 2 after this Chamber voted on an amendment I introduced  that said we should not be importing electric vehicles that were made  in China using slave labor in concentration camps. The Senator from  Connecticut and every single Democratic Senator, save one, voted to  reject that amendment.   The consequence is that the Biden administration is preparing to  import millions of dollars of electric vehicles that were built--or  parts of them were built--using slave labor in concentration camps in  China.   You want to talk about what is encouraging and empowering the Chinese  Communist regime?   It is the willingness of the Democratic Party to overlook their  murder, torture in concentration camps because of their commitment to  the Green New Deal.   Because Joe Biden giving a multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin  strengthens Russia at the expense of America and it undermines U.S.  national security interests, I object.    Reserving the right to object. Because Joe Biden's  multibillion-dollar gift of this pipeline in defiance of U.S. law and  contravention of the overwhelming bipartisan consensus of Congress,  because it strengthens Russia at the expense of America and it  undermines U.S. national security, I object.    Reserving the right to object, because Joe Biden's  multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin is a generational  geopolitical mistake that strengthens Russia at the expense of America  and undermines U.S. national security, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because Joe  Biden's multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin is a generational  geopolitical mistake, because it strengthens Russia at the expense of  America, and it undermines U.S. national security, I object.  [[Page S6260]]     Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because Joe  Biden's multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin is a generational  geopolitical mistake, because it strengthens Russia at the expense of  America, and it undermines U.S. national security, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because Joe  Biden's multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin is a generational  geopolitical mistake, because it strengthens Russia at the expense of  America, and it undermines U.S. national security, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because Joe  Biden's multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin is a generational  geopolitical mistake, because it strengthens Russia at the expense of  America, and it undermines U.S. national security, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because Joe  Biden's multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin is a generational  geopolitical mistake, because it strengthens Russia at the expense of  America, and it undermines U.S. national security, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, you know, the  Senator from Connecticut is correct in that, if a Senator were to halt  a large number of nominations for an idiosyncratic concern, for a  concern unique to that Senator that was not widely shared, that could  constitute an abuse of power, and I am going to suggest some aspects of  this situation that make it quite different and that, in a subsequent  administration, if there were a comparable situation, would make these  same levers appropriate   No. 1, the Biden administration is defying three separate Federal  laws: two different Nord Stream 2 sanctions, both of which I authored,  along with Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, both of which passed the  Senate and the House and were signed into law, both of which enjoyed  massive, near-unanimous bipartisan support. In addition to that is  CAATSA--strong Russia sanctions that are mandatory, that are designed  to force a President to sanction Russia even if they are reluctant to  do so like Joe Biden is.   Right now, the administration is defying the law, and so the message  that I have conveyed to the administration repeatedly is, follow the  law. I am not asking for a change in the law; I am saying follow the  law. That is No. 1, if you have an administration that is openly  defying the law, but No. 2, that is openly defying an overwhelming  bipartisan consensus of Congress.   This is not a narrow partisan issue. And I would note, after Joe  Biden waived the sanctions on Nord Stream 2, in the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, I introduced an amendment to reverse his decision.  Every single Senator but one on that committee voted in favor of my  amendment. The Senator from Connecticut voted in favor of my amendment.  The Senator from New Jersey voted in favor of my amendment.   The Biden administration is telling all of Congress, essentially:  Jump in a lake. We don't care that every Democrat and virtually every  Republican has a dramatically different assessment of this situation  than they do.   Third is the national security magnitude of this issue. This was a  major national security victory.   When I met with the Biden administration, with each of their  successive national security officials, I said: Look, I understand the  instinct of any new administration to say, ``Whatever the old guys did  must be wrong.'' I get that the Biden guys want to say,  [[Page S6261]]  ``Whatever Trump did must be wrong.'' And by the way, the Trump guys,  by and large, said, ``Whatever Obama did must be wrong.'' That is not a  new thing. Whenever you have a change in an administration, that tends  to be a default position. But what I urged them to do is, just because  that is your knee-jerk instinct, this was a massive bipartisan victory  for America, a national security victory that we won that Joe Biden is  on the verge of throwing away.   The Secretary of State sat in my office and promised to fight to  sanction Nord Stream 2. The Deputy Secretary of State sat in my office  and promised to fight to sanction Nord Stream 2. The Under Secretary of  State sat in my office and promised to fight to sanction Nord Stream 2.  They did, in fact, fight to sanction Nord Stream 2, but unfortunately  they were overruled by the White House, which made a political decision  to give in to Putin.   In those circumstances, when you are defying explicit U.S. law, when  you are defying the overwhelming bipartisan consensus of Congress, and  when you are endangering U.S. national security and, indeed, turning a  victory into a loss, I think it is appropriate to use the tools we have  in front of us.   That being said, I have engaged in active negotiation with the Biden  administration. In the past week, I have had conversations on this  topic with the Secretary of the Treasury, with the Deputy Secretary of  the Treasury, with the National Security Advisor. I have had  conversations with multiple Democratic Senators about a path forward.   But I will tell you what the path forward is not going to be. It is  not going to be, let's roll over, give Putin his pipeline, and accept a  massive national security loss for America. If that is where Joe Biden  and Kamala Harris want to go, they can go there, but they are not going  to go there with my acquiescence, and I am going to use every tool I  have as a Senator, elected by the people of Texas, to prevent that  outcome.   Accordingly, because Joe Biden's decision to defy U.S. law; to defy  the overwhelming bipartisan consensus of Congress; to surrender to  Vladimir Putin; to give him his No. 1 priority--a multibillion-dollar  pipeline that will provide billions of dollars of rewards for Russia  for decades to come--because that decision is a generational  geopolitical mistake on the order of magnitude of Jimmy Carter giving  away the Panama Canal--that even 50 years later, the consequences of  that geopolitical mistake still reverberate--50 years from now, Russian  dictators will benefit from Joe Biden's weakness on Russia.   Because that strengthens Russia, because it empowers Russia to attack  our enemies, to extort our enemies, to engage in economic blackmail  against our enemies--our allies, rather--because our allies are begging  us not to do this--I have met with senior officials of the Ukraine. The  Ukrainians are begging us not to do this, and the Biden White House is  threatening Ukraine: Keep your mouth shut because we have a political  objective here.   Because that strengthens Russia at the expense of the United States,  at the expense of Europe, at the expense of our allies, because it  destroys jobs in America, and because it endangers U.S. national  security, I emphatically object.
