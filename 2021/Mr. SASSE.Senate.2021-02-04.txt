 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 192 and ask that  it be reported by number, please.    Mr. President, we are doing a lot of red versus blue  jersey stuff today. Until about 2 a.m., it is going to be mostly  straight partisan votes. It would be good for us to find some common  ground, and this amendment is an opportunity to do that.   This amendment, modeled on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act, is an opportunity to come together and to defend  babies. It is pretty simple, actually. Every baby, whether she is born  in a state-of-the-art hospital with a NICU unit or whether she is born  in an abortion clinic in a strip mall, every baby is born with dignity  and is created in God's image, and she deserves care. This amendment is  aimed at making sure that babies who survive abortions get the same  degree of care that any other newborn would. There is nothing partisan  about that. That is why my Democratic colleagues, Joe Manchin and Bob  Casey, both voted for this last year as legislation. We disagree on a  bunch of stuff, but not this.   There is a lot of complicated debate in this Chamber, but this isn't  actually one of them. Here is a chance for 100 Senators to come  together and support every baby. Every baby deserves a fighting chance.    Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of  1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, I move  to waive all applicable sections of that act and applicable budget  resolutions for the purposes of Senate amendment No. 192, and I ask for  the yeas and nays.
