 I yield the floor.    Madam President, nearly 5 years ago, our State,  Nation, the city of Orlando, and Hispanic and LGBTQ communities were  attacked, and 49 innocent and beautiful lives were lost. It was an evil  act--an act of terrorism--designed to divide us as a nation and strike  fear in our hearts and minds but instead we came together; we supported  each other; and we persevered. We proved to the world what we in  Florida already knew: Floridians are resilient.   The days I spent in Orlando following the shooting will always be  with me. I talked to many parents who lost their children. I went to  funerals and wakes. And I sat in hospital rooms. As a father and  grandfather, it was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. It  was heartbreaking.   But in this horribly dark time, the selfless courage of so many, from  community members to law enforcement, to healthcare workers, provided a  sense of hope. This incredible strength, love, and bravery lifted up  Orlando and the State of Florida and helped us begin to rebuild.   This week, on the fifth anniversary of this unthinkable tragedy, the  State of Florida comes together to honor the lives lost too soon. And  we vow to always stand up and fight against evil and hatred in this  world.   Now I yield the floor to my colleague from Florida, Senator Rubio.    Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague  from Florida for participating in this with me. It was a devastating  day 5 years ago for all of us in Florida and around the Nation.   Today, I am requesting all my colleagues join us to honor the memory  of the 49 lives lost and come together to say their nation will always  stand against hate and evil in this world.   I will be asking consent for the Senate to pass a resolution honoring  the memory of the victims of the heinous attack of the Pulse nightclub,  cosponsored by my colleague from Florida, Senator Rubio, and  legislation designating the location of the Pulse nightclub in Orlando  as the National Pulse Memorial to serve as a tribute to the victims and  a reminder for us to always stand for love and kindness over hate and  evil in this world. It is also cosponsored by my colleague from  Florida, Senator Rubio, and my colleague from California, Senator  Padilla. I hope my colleagues join us in the effort today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I  ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources be discharged from further consideration of S. 1605 and the  Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  bill be considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I  ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 49 and the  Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  bill be considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I  ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of  S. Res. 265, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, it is with heavy heart that I  stand here today and remember this dark day in Florida's history. I  thank my colleagues for joining me to honor the 49 lives lost far too  soon in a terror attack on Pulse nightclub nearly 5 years ago. While  nothing can ever bring back the lives lost, I am glad we are able to  come together to stand for love and kindness over hate and evil in this  world.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, America is in a debt crisis. It  appears, for Joe Biden and my colleagues across the aisle, reckless  spending has only just begun. If left unchecked, this spending will be  devastating for families in my State of Florida and all across our  great Nation.   Washington's insane spending has our Federal debt rocketing toward  $30 trillion. That is equal to $233,000 of debt for every American  family. Think about that. America's debt crisis, caused by decades of  wasteful and reckless spending by Washington politicians, has now grown  to the equivalent of every American family owing a quarter of a million  dollars in debt. Yet Biden and my colleagues across the aisle want more   President Biden is pushing for trillions in wasteful spending,  raising the U.S. Federal debt by 60 percent, to $39 trillion, and the  debt-to-GDP ratio to 117 percent in 2030, the highest level ever  recorded in American history.   Enough is enough. It is time to end the madness.   Today I am introducing the Federal Debt Emergency Control Act to help  bring some accountability back to Washington.   On July 31, the current suspension of the Federal debt ceiling is set  to expire, giving Congress a choice: Act responsibly to reduce Federal  debt through structural reform to how we approach spending or suspend  the debt ceiling again, allowing more reckless spending that will  cripple our Nation with insurmountable debt.   Reckless spending has consequences. We are already seeing rising  inflation. Let's remember, inflation doesn't hurt the rich, but it  devastates our poorest families. It hurts families like mine growing  up. It hurts poor families. It hurts people on fixed incomes. Just look  around us. Milk prices are up. Bread prices are up. Gas prices are up.  Meat prices are up. It seems like everything is up right now.   When inflation happened in the seventies, I watched. I watched what  my parents went through. At that point, my mom was taking in ironing  from other families to make ends meet. At the end of the day, whatever  she had made that day, either my older brother or I would go to the  grocery store, and we would watch--and she was worried about milk and  food, all of the prices going up. She said, ``You only have this amount  of money,'' and we had to know what everything cost before we went to  the checkout counter.   It is not fair. No family should have to go through worrying about  the price of bread and milk and things going up week after week.   We can get control of inflation. We can put our Nation on a fiscally  responsible path, but we have to have real solutions that hold Congress  accountable.   My Federal Debt Emergency Control Act aims to rein in Washington's  out-of-control spending with concrete checks and balances, including  the declaration of a Federal debt emergency anytime the debt exceeds  100 percent of GDP.   By the way, once debt equals 100 percent of GDP, it is very difficult  to start paying down debt. You have to dramatically either reduce  spending or dramatically grow your economy.   Declaring a Federal debt emergency would initiate commonsense debt  reduction measures, including a requirement that two-thirds of Congress  vote  [[Page S4020]]  to increase the debt before approving any bill with deficit spending.   It would also terminate any unobligated funding for the American  Rescue Plan Act and any previous stimulus bills, sending it back to the  Treasury General Fund for deficit reduction to reduce our debt.   Finally, it would ensure that any bill reducing the Federal debt by  at least 5 percent over 10 years is fast-tracked through the  legislative process.   Everyone can get behind these commonsense measures. That is why my  bill is already endorsed by the National Taxpayers Union, the Council  for Citizens Against Government Waste, Americans for Tax Reform,  Americans for Prosperity, FreedomWorks, and Club for Growth.   I am also proud to have the support of Senators Cruz, Braun,  Blackburn, Johnson, Barrasso, Ernst, and Tuberville as cosponsors of  this important legislation.   With President Biden's budget proposal--and just to put that in  perspective, his budget proposal is $6 trillion. This year, our Federal  receipts are only going to be $3.5 trillion. How can we expect to run  trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars of deficit year after  year? With his budget proposal, we see how important the need is to get  Washington's awful spending habits under control and start paying down  our debt.   I did it before. I did it as Governor of Florida. I walked in with a  $4 billion deficit. I started reducing taxes my first year. We reduced  it every year in 8 years, and we cut over a third of the State debt. We  did it by being responsible, by holding government accountable for  watching how we spent every dollar. It can be done.   So getting back on track is possible, but it takes discipline. It  takes accountability. It starts with taking concrete steps, like  rejecting bloated budgets and passing commonsense legislation like the  Federal Debt Emergency Control Act. We have the chance to do this. We  know the vote over the debt ceiling increase is a tough vote for  everybody. Let's take this opportunity to have real structural reform  so we can start paying down our debt and not leave this debt to future  generations                            ____________________     Mr. President, America is in a debt crisis.
