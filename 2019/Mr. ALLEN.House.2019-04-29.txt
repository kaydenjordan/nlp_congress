 Mr. Speaker, over this past weekend the 2019 National  Science Bowl finals took place down the road in Chevy Chase, Maryland.   I am proud to rise here this evening to congratulate Stallings Island  Middle School and Lakeside High School--both located in Georgia's 12th  district--for their students' stellar performance in this year's  competition.   The path to the finals is no easy task. With over 1,000 high schools  and nearly 650 middle schools participating in the regional tournaments  nationwide, these Georgia-12 students worked hard to advance to the  finals and compete at the national level. The students' brilliance  solving technical problems and answering questions about all branches  of science and math is truly incredible.   I would like to thank and congratulate the educators, coaches, and  especially the bright young students of Stallings Island Middle School  and Lakeside High School who made this tremendous run possible.   Georgia-12 is certainly proud, and we look forward to cheering them  on again next year.                            ____________________
