 Madam President, as everyone in this Chamber knows, the  filibuster requires a supermajority--60 votes--to proceed on most  issues in the Senate. The filibuster is truly the essence of this  deliberative body. It is what makes the Senate the Senate. It is what  forces collaboration, long-term solutions, and prevents a partisan  roller coaster ride of ever-changing laws and rules every 2 years. The  filibuster puts the brakes on hasty legislation and helps prevent  unintended consequences, which come with most every new law.   I ask America this: Do you want more laws or less laws? Do we want  more certainty from our government or less certainty?   Arguably, the best speeches to keep the filibuster in place have been  made by Presidents and Senators from across the aisle. Nothing is more  convincing than my Democrat friends' own words.   President Obama, then-Senator Obama, said in a floor speech here in  2005:         But the American people sent us here to be their voice.       They understand that those voices can at times become loud       and argumentative, but they also hope we can disagree without       being disagreeable. At the end of the day, they expect both       parties to work together to get the people's business done.        What they do not expect is for one party, be it Republican       or Democrat, to change the rules in the middle of the game so       they can make all the decisions while the other party is told       to sit down and keep quiet.    I am still quoting President Obama here:         The American people want less partisanship in this town,       but everyone in this Chamber knows that if the majority       chooses to end the filibuster, if they choose to change the       rules and put an end to democratic debate, then the fighting,       the bitterness, and the gridlock will only get worse.    In that same year, our current majority leader stated from this very  floor, and I quote the majority leader again:         We are on the precipice of a crisis, a constitutional       crisis. The checks and balances which have been at the core       of this Republic are about to be evaporated by the nuclear       option, the checks and balances which say if you get 51       percent of the vote you do not get your way 100 percent of       the time. It is amazing. It is almost a temper tantrum by       those on the hard right.    Still quoting the current majority leader:         That is not becoming of the leadership of the Republican       side of the aisle, nor is it becoming of this Republic. That       is what we call abuse of power.    If the current Democrat majority party jams this through, they will  live to rue the day, possibly as soon as next year. But for now, my  colleagues across the aisle are kowtowing to the radical left base. The  tail is wagging the proverbial dog.   Sadly, 25 of my colleagues across the aisle have flip-flopped from a  position they staked out in writing just 4 years ago, but thank  goodness that 1 Senator who signed the letter has remained true to his  word.   What has happened to change the minds of these 25 Senators? Why is  the national media not asking them the same question? Because it would  point out the hypocrisy.   Let me remind them all, as President Joe Biden once stated to this  body, that removing the 60-vote threshold would, and I again quote-- again from President Biden:         Quite frankly, it is the ultimate act of unfairness to       alter the unique responsibility of the Senate and to do so by       breaking the very rules of the Senate. . . . Put simply, the       nuclear option would transform the Senate from the so-called       cooling saucer our Founding Fathers talked about to cool the       passions of the day, to a pure majoritarian body like       parliament. . . . But the Senate is not meant to be a place       of pure majoritarianism. At its core, the filibuster is not       about stopping a nominee or a bill, it is about compromise       and moderation.    These men and women of noble character, in their heart of hearts, do  they truly believe in making this rule change that will forever alter  the way our government functions, the way our Founding Fathers intended  it to be? What will they say to the people of their State when the shoe  is on the other foot, when Republicans hold the majority in the Senate  once again and Republicans show them how the hog eats the cabbage?   I yield the floor.    Madam President, today I wish to recognize Gary  Amble of Kansas City, KS. For the last 30 years, Gary has worked for  his community by broadcasting the weather. I would like to congratulate  him on his retirement from KCTV5 and thank him for the invaluable  service that he has provided Kansas over the last three decades.   In 1987, Gary graduated from the University of Kansas with a degree  in atmospheric science. Before his employment at KCTV5, Gary worked as  the head anchor at WHO-TV in Des Moines, morning meteorologist for KDFA  in Amarillo, weekend weathercaster for KSNT in Topeka, and chief  weathercaster for Cable 6 in Lawrence. While in Des Moines, he worked  22 hours continuously live on the air covering the unprecedented flood  of 1993, which affected nine States along the Missouri and Mississippi  Rivers. He has described it as a highlight of his career. Gary's tenure  at KCTV5 began in the summer of 1994, where he would stay for the next  28 years. There, he cemented himself as the Kansas City area's familiar  face of weather, always charismatic and--most importantly--accurate  whenever he came on screen. Because of his distinguished career, Gary  has been awarded the American Meteorological Society seal of approval,  and is currently a member of the society.   Tracking and reporting on the weather is great public service, so I  take pride in recognizing Gary Amble as an exceptional member of the  Kansas community. I would like to wish Gary and his family the best in  this new chapter of their lives.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to honor and  memorialize a true representation of Kansas values. Mrs. Ruth Scheer  departed this Earth on January 4, 2022, after a long life full of  faith, family, service, and community.   Ruth was born and raised in Wichita, KS, where her parents, Clyde and  Edith, provided a childhood full of love and support. She quickly  picked up a love for music, beginning with the accordion before she  turned 10. Her musical efforts, nurtured by her parents, continued to  grow as she did. Ruth's talent and dedication were rewarded by the  opportunity to perform in the National Piano Playing Auditions and  winning multiple piano diplomas throughout high school and college. Her  love of music and the arts continued as she started a family with her  husband, Harold. She taught her children to play various instruments  and sing. She even led the family to perform multiple operettas in the  community as the ``Scheer Delights.''   Beyond music, Ruth also inspired children by publishing seven  children's books. Each book contained different messages, but at the  heart of her literary philosophy was finding the best version of one's  self through God's guidance. These books have undoubtedly touched many  lives, and I appreciate that she spent her career bringing such a  wonderful sentiment to life.   Ruth practiced what she preached by finding the best version of  herself and employing her time and talents with an impressive number of  prominent organizations throughout Wichita. Highlights of her  involvement include the First Evangelical Free Church, 3-time president  of the Thursday Afternoon Music Club, member of the Alpha Beta Mothers  Club, and she even received the Kansas Mother of the Year Award.   In my own life, my parents showed me the importance of community and  staying involved. A strong, connected community benefits its members by  fostering happiness and success. Ruth embodied what it means to be a  community builder, mother, and teacher. Wichita is a better place  because of her efforts. She is a role model everyone should strive to  emulate in their own communities. I ask my colleagues to join me in  remembering Ruth Scheer and celebrating a life well-lived.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to honor a true  hero from Labette County, KS, Deputy Gabe Vitt. His quick thinking and  expertise helped save the life of a woman in a situation only seen in  movies.   Deputy Vitt was on patrol in Parsons, when he heard over his radio  that a woman had been hit by a train. EMS was preparing to respond to  the situation like they normally would, but the person calling about  the accident disconnected before they could say where the woman was  hit. By great luck and coincidence, Deputy Vitt was only a few blocks  from the tracks.   Realizing that emergency medical services wouldn't be there in time,  he rushed to the scene to find a woman with a severed leg. Making use  of his EMT training from school at Labette Community College, Vitt was  able to apply a tourniquet which stabilized the woman's leg steady,  ultimately saving her life. After the incident, Deputy Vitt credited  that training heavily, describing his heroics as a natural reaction to  the situation. Had he not been nearby or received his EMT training,  that woman may very well not be here today.   I want to thank this brave officer for being so courageous to dive  headfirst into peril. As the son of a police chief, I know the risks  our men and women in blue take on each day. I admire these unique  citizens for continually working to ensure our safety. Deputy Vitt has  shown what true valor looks like, and Labette County is safer because  of him. I ask now that my colleagues show this same admiration and  recognition for Deputy Vitt and that he may stay safe protecting his  community.                            ____________________
