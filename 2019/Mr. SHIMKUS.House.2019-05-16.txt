 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I  do not oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chair, the chairman of the full committee is  correct. We appreciate his help and support in working through these  technical corrections. We don't oppose them, and with that, I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I believe I have the right to close.    Mr. Chairman, it is great being on the floor with a lot  of my friends on the Energy and Commerce Committee and my colleagues  across the aisle. Obviously, we have a fundamental disagreement.   I know, in southern Illinois, one of the biggest questions I always  got and concerns was that ObamaCare plans are too expensive, and the  deductibles  [[Page H3877]]  are too high, so we can't use them. Hence, no one wanted to use them.   Part of the change in the political landscape because of that was  Republicans controlled the House. That is what happened politically.  Here we are, and my colleagues and I have belabored this point all day,  Mr. Chairman, about what we are trying to do. We are trying to lower  the cost of prescription drugs, but we have to go back to this  ObamaCare debate.   Republicans control the Senate. They are not going to bring it up.  The President is not going to sign the bill. It is instructional to  have this debate. We understand it. We will eventually come back, and  we will address these prescription drug bills. We will get there, but  we have to go through this exercise. I understand that.   The three bills that we could vote on and pass right now, probably on  a suspension calendar and a voice vote, would be the three prescription  drug bills that are part of this package. Those are the CREATES Act,  the Protecting Consumers' Access to Generic Drugs Act, and the Bringing  Low-cost Options and Competition while Keeping Incentives for New  Generics Act, called the BLOCKING Act.   That is what we could be doing today, that and some other things. We  hope that what we will be addressing will make major changes in  affordability, transparency, and the like.   My colleagues also point out the numerous votes to repeal or replace  parts of ObamaCare. I am proud to say I voted for all of them. The  facts state that a lot of Democrats supported these, to fundamentally  change provisions of ObamaCare.   In fact, 30 of the bills my friends are citing were signed into law.  Twenty-one of those bills were signed into law by President Obama. Of  the 30 that were signed into law, Speaker Pelosi voted ``yes'' on 19 of  them. These are part of the 60 bills that would repeal and replace, and  we have 21, and 19 were voted for by Speaker Pelosi. Leader Hoyer voted  ``yes'' on 21 of them. My friend Chairman Pallone voted on 20 of them.   Here are the examples that we want to lay out: repealing the  unworkable and unsustainable CLASS Act, rescinding billions of dollars  for the failed ObamaCare co-op program, delaying the Cadillac tax and  medical device tax, cutting funding to the Independent Payment Advisory  Board, providing regulatory and financial relief from ObamaCare's  requirements for small business and independent contractors, requiring  accurate income verification before disbursing subsidies to ObamaCare  exchanges, and modifying eligibility for ObamaCare exchange subsidies.    We can have this tit for tat, Mr. Chairman, and they will still want  to defend ObamaCare. We will always say that the private market is  better to provide lower cost and rapid response. It is an ideological  fight.   We will get through this debate. We will eventually come back and  address these prescription drug issues that, as I mentioned, Mr.  Chairman, we probably would pass on a voice vote once we return to  this.   I thank my colleagues. I have great respect for my colleague from  Vermont. He is a very sincere and good friend. We look forward to  debating this more in the future.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is hard to sell a lemon, no matter how  much you give in advertising. That is kind of the basis of our  opposition to this amendment.   Mr. Chair, as you heard me say in the last debate, in my  congressional district, people didn't want to be forced to buy  something that was too high, that was unaffordable, that the  deductibles were too high, and that we in Washington mandated that they  have to buy.   Now we see a period where, in essence, people have a few more choices  because of the waiver system, the 1332s. We see people flocking away  from  [[Page H3878]]  ObamaCare plans to 1332 waivers within the States, which we think is a  good deal.   Part of the debate on this is: Let's pump more money in and maybe  these people will stay in these failed ObamaCare plans. We reject that.  We reject it based upon what we have done with Medicare Advantage and  Medicare part D.   The executive branch has said: Let's spend the same amount of money  that we do for Medicare part D and Medicare Advantage, which have much  higher enrollment than the ObamaCare exchanges.                                time  1515    So we think that is appropriate. We do think that, with $100 million  or more to try to get people to buy a product and you see enrollment go  down, that is not a good use of money.   Mr. Chair, with that, we would ask for a ``no'' vote on the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I don't know my colleague very well, but I  think it is instructive to our citizens as a whole that Members come  from across this great land and have a lot of different issues. I think  it is instructive that even Members of Congress can be fighting  illnesses and need lifesaving medicine to do that.   I don't think we are fundamentally opposed to the amendment. We don't  think it does exactly what the author is claiming it will do.   In this package, in this bill, it is not, obviously, going to go  anywhere because the President is not going to sign this bill. It is  not going to go through the Senate.   Mr. Chair, I would encourage my colleague to come back and visit with  us so that we start moving something that can get bipartisan agreement  that I think would be very instructive in looking at this as an  addition.   Now, I am speaking for myself, not for the ranking member of the full  committee, because the gentleman is right that we need to have  information. And when government is helpful in creating the initial  science that then goes over to the private sector, that then goes to  creating blockbuster drugs, then we should know, kind of, the skin in  the game, Mr. Chairman, and how much that is due to good Federal policy  by not just legislators, but also our agencies that help push that  research by NIH or the CDC or the National Cancer Institute.   Had this bill been brought and the three prescription drug  transparency lower cost options been brought to the floor, as I said  before--and I am not going to restate this every amendment debate--but  we probably would have had a voice vote and we could have gone out for  dinner. But it is attached to the ObamaCare rescue mission, which we  think the public has already rejected.   So we will get through this process, but I would encourage my  colleague to join with the chairman of the committee and Republicans in  looking at what we can do on this provision in the future.   Mr. Chair, I would ask my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I would reserve the balance of my time unless  my colleague yielded back.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, I appreciate my colleague coming down to the floor, especially  when, in his opening statement, he says he wants drug costs to go down  now.   It is not going to happen now because it is in a package that is not  going to be accepted by the Senate and the President is not going to  sign.   So, if we really want drug prices to go down now, we would have done  what we did out of the full committee. We would have packaged this up  with H.R. 965, the CREATES Act, which is a bipartisan agreement that is  part of this bill, which would penalize branded drugmakers that  withhold samples from generic manufacturers.   We would have brought to the floor, either separately or in a  package, H.R. 1499, the Protecting Consumer Access to Generic Drugs  Act, bipartisan out of the committee. This would ban pay-for-delay  agreements, which are a problem.   And we would have brought up H.R. 938, the Bringing Low-cost Options  and Competition while Keeping Incentives for New Generics, which is  called the BLOCKING Act, which would limit the first-approved generic  maker's ability to stall another rival's launch.   I think we all want to get there. I think we will get there. We still  are going to go through this process. But, make no mistake, this is not  going to be signed into law that we can go down to the White House for  a ceremony.   Again, I would encourage my colleagues to work with the chairman of  the Energy and Commerce Committee, my good friend Frank Pallone, and we  can address this amendment and other processes and hopefully bring the  bipartisan bill to the floor that would address a lot of other  colleagues' concerns and really work on a bipartisan agreement that,  then, by that bipartisan approach, the Senate would have to really look  at seriously, and, hopefully, we would convince the President to sign  the bill.   I am just a simple man from southern Illinois, taught high school  civics: two Chambers, President has got to sign the bill. Sometimes  when we use all this time, it is for other purposes than really trying  to have a bill become law.   So, with that, I would ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, obviously, I rise in opposition to this,  and I understand my colleague from Florida's great expertise in this  area and served in the previous administration.   But when you have to subsidize a plan--there are a couple of  problems. First of all, before ObamaCare came into being, or the  Affordable Care Act--I am not trying to be disrespectful--insurance was  regulated by States. The new law yanked that away from States to the  point where they created a system of mandatory coverage that was  unaffordable.   So then part of the plan was, well, we need to subsidize these plans  because, actuarially, they are not going to work without government  intervention.   Now, the Court case on this, we thought--and actually, I guess the  Court case is still pending. Can the Federal Government force someone  to buy something they don't want to buy? And we probably will hear  another ruling on that. Initially, they said, yeah.   The real debate shifted to: Does the Federal Government have the  power to tax, versus do you have the power to force someone to buy  something they don't want to buy?   So the Supreme Court, in that ruling, said, since the Federal  Government has the power to tax, this is really a tax; then, yeah, we  can do this.   So then we had the rollout. And the rollout, I think, in the public's  eye, as a whole--first, due to the delay because of the computer  system, the network couldn't manage it. And then, just the cost.   As I said before, premiums way too high; deductibles too high; people  forced to buy an insurance product that they could not use.   People would go in and say, oh, I got coverage. Okay. But your  coverage is you still got to pay the first $10,000 in deductible. And  people say, what? That is not very good insurance.   Well, that is what we created in this national healthcare delivery  system.   The public rendered judgment, as they do, through the political  process. Republicans came back into control.   Now, what we are trying to do is return to federalism. We have  returned to States' regulation of insurance; provide more options to  consumers. That is what is occurring now, so the higher cost or the  costs are going down. In fact, I think there was a projection that 30  percent--there was 30 percent increases until this last cycle, when  there was a 3 percent increase. Why?   Well, because, under the law, there are 1332 waivers which allow  States to present another package; and you see our citizens, our  constituents, voting with their feet to go to these State-based plans.  That is a good thing.   So we are trying--we don't want to turn the clock back again. So that  is why I would ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the gentlewoman's  amendment. Although brought well-intentioned and lovingly, I know.   Mr. Chairman, I reject that. I ask for a ``no'' vote, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
