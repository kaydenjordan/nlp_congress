 Madam Speaker, the Biden infrastructure plan is another  classic example of the old bait-and-switch. Much like the COVID relief  bill, where only 9 percent of the $1.9 trillion price tag actually went  to COVID relief, this plan has very little to do with infrastructure.   The definition of the word in the Cambridge Dictionary is: The basic  system and services, such as transport and power supplies, that a  country or organization uses in order to work effectively.   So we know what it really means: roads, bridges; and, in the 21st  century, broadband internet would qualify.   How much of the $2.2 trillion is actually going to infrastructure?   $115 billion is set aside for bridges, roads, and highways; just 5  percent. And under a more broad definition, if we include public  transportation and broadband, the total grows to $405 billion, which is  still just 18 percent of the new spending.   So where does the other 82 percent go?   Democrats across the country have said their definition of  infrastructure includes universal pre-K, climate action, climate  justice, eradicating right-to-work environments, caregiving, affordable  housing, police accountability, and paid leave.   This ain't infrastructure.   So we all know what this is: The largest corporate welfare slush fund  in American history.   Joe Biden will have virtual carte blanche to nepotistically dole out  hundreds of billions of dollars to curry favor with allies, supporters,  friends, and family.   This isn't the hallmark of innovation, but it will ensure that the  D.C. swamp continues to be a festering pool of corruption.  [[Page H2043]]                                     time  2000
