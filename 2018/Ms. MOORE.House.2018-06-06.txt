 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and madam ranking member.   Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amendment to this critical bill, which  authorizes billions of dollars in Corps projects.   My amendment is very simple. I can keep it short. It would reaffirm  the need for the Army Corps to make every effort to ensure, as part of  their project planning and implementation process, the fair treatment  of all communities in this vital process.   Mr. Chair, this amendment addresses the continuing concern that  certain vulnerable communities affected by Federal actions often have  little to no input into the planning and implementation of those  activities, and they include low-income communities, both urban and  rural, communities of color, and other marginalized groups such as  Tribes.   By adopting my amendment, the Army Corps could lead in reforming how  Federal agencies engage with vulnerable communities by working  collaboratively with community stakeholders, by outreach, proactive  outreach, and requiring really meaningful involvement and conversations  with these communities of color, including Tribal communities, engaging  them in developing Corps development of the projects and  implementation.                                time  1615    I would ask that no one would object to requiring that the Corps  spend more time listening to and validating community concerns and  working to resolve them collaboratively at every step of the process,  rather than waiting until a lawsuit occurs.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
