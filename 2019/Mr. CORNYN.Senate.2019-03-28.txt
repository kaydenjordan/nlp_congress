 Mr. President, in 2017, I said on the Senate floor that  we needed to come together to help rebuild in the wake of Hurricane  Harvey in the Houston area and that our work was not complete and more  work needed to be done. That, unfortunately, still is true today.   It is true also for the damage caused by other natural disasters  during the same timeframe that was appropriated by Congress but has not  yet found its way to the intended beneficiaries. Although we voted to  send billions of dollars to help Texans still reeling from Hurricane  Harvey, some of those funds are still needlessly caught up in  bureaucratic redtape.   This is not just a phenomenon that affects my State. It affects all  of our States. This is not acceptable to me, and it isn't acceptable to  the people I represent--all 28 million of them--and it shouldn't be  acceptable to Members of the Senate.   This storm ravaged the Texas coast and was the largest rain event in  American history, with parts of Southeast Texas seeing 60 inches of  rain over about a 5- or 6-day period. It destroyed people's homes,  their businesses, and our communities.   In the wake of the storm, we all pulled together in Congress, in an  unusually bipartisan manner, to provide billions of dollars in disaster  aid. Like I said, it wasn't just for Texas. It was for Florida, Puerto  Rico, for wildfires out in California, and other places that suffered  from natural disasters.   The dollars we appropriated, and were signed into law by the  President, have helped Texans get back to some sense of normalcy, and I  am grateful to my colleagues for working together with us to make that  happen. What has not been helpful, however, are the unnecessary delays  on the part of the Office of Management and Budget in getting the  roughly $4 billion in mitigation funds into the hands of State and  local communities that desperately need them.   I have searched in vain in the Constitution for where the Office of  Management and Budget has the power to veto appropriations bills passed  by Congress and signed into law by the President. I can't find it. Yet  they are still the impediment to the execution of Congress's intent to  get the money to the people who need it.    The intent of Congress was crystal clear in the February 2018  disaster supplemental, when we appropriated about $12 billion of  community development block grants for disaster recovery.   As I said, the undue delay is unacceptable, and I am filing an  amendment to the disaster relief that is on the floor of the Senate  this week to ensure that these funds and other like funds are properly  disbursed.   Last month, Governor Abbott, Senator Cruz, and I wrote a letter to  the OMB to stop stalling, but so far all we have heard is crickets.   The amendment we will file will start a timer on when the Federal  Government must release funds appropriated by Congress. It will give  the government bureaucracy up to 90 days to get the money untangled  from all the redtape and to get it to the communities that desperately  need it. This 90-day rule wouldn't just apply to this particular block  of funding; it would apply to any funds that are now being withheld by  the Office of Management and Budget that Congress appropriates to these  States.   As I said, last time I checked, Congress had the power of the purse,  not the Office of Management and Budget. I don't know about the rest of  my colleagues, but I am not OK with letting OMB dictate when and how  duly appropriated funds are released to the intended beneficiaries.   The disregard of those who are still struggling to rebuild and  prepare for future storms by the bureaucrats is appalling. They know  the kinds of hardships my constituents are facing, and they know that  Hurricane Harvey will not be the last hurricane to hit Texas. It is  time to do what is right by our State and local communities who have  seen their livelihoods rot in a fleet of floodwater.   It has now been more than a year since President Trump signed a bill  that would have sent roughly $4 billion to Texas. Imagine what could  have been accomplished with that money in the meantime. They could have  repaired wastewater treatment facilities that haven't been fully  restored. It could have led to important economic revitalization  projects in decimated areas. They could have even relocated or elevated  damaged facilities to prepare for the next storm. But, no--those  projects are still on hold because the OMB has refused to release the  funding.   The 2019 hurricane season is fast approaching, and it is critical we  get work done on long-term projects to protect my State and the Texas  coast against future storms.   It is difficult to plan for the future with the resources we need  being caught up in bureaucratic limbo. We have been waiting to get to  the place where before Harvey and after Harvey isn't such a stark  difference.   With the inclusion of my amendment, the clock will start ticking on  the Office of Management and Budget to do its job and ultimately  release these hurricane recovery funds. Texas communities have waited  long enough.                               Border Security    Mr. President, I want to draw attention to another group of people  who need our help, and those are the officers and agents of the U.S.  Customs and Border Protection.   Yesterday, Commissioner McAleenan announced that Customs and Border  Protection is facing an ``unprecedented humanitarian and border  security crisis all along our Southwest border,'' and he provided some  alarming statistics.   Yesterday morning, CBP had more than 13,000 migrants under their  care. Under normal circumstances, a high number is 4,000. They consider  6,000 to be a crisis, and now they have more than double that.  Yesterday, the Commissioner said that we are at a ``breaking point''  along the border.   Frankly, because the American people aren't acquainted with some of  the details, they may think that CBP can easily handle 13,000 people in  their custody on a given day, but, unfortunately, that is not the case.   CBP's detention facilities are relatively small, built for the short- term detention of single adults. The current immigrant surge from  Central America is primarily of children and family units and has put  these small facilities at overcapacity levels. Processing times have  slowed due to the large number of people being processed and the lack  of Border Patrol personnel to process them.   As the Chief of the Border Patrol has testified before the Senate  Judiciary Committee, this is intentional on behalf of the transnational  criminal organizations that are responsible for transporting people  from Central America to our borders. This is a moneymaking proposition.  If you can charge $5,000 or more a head for every person you deliver to  our border, that is a big, big deal. These people are not just involved  in transporting immigrants. They are engaged in trafficking of human  beings for sex or involuntary servitude, and they are also engaged in  trafficking drugs.   I will remind all of us that last year, 70,000-plus Americans died  from drug overdoses--70,000 Americans died from drug overdoses last  year--according to the Centers for Disease Control. A substantial  portion of that was part of the opioid crisis, not just prescription  drugs but also synthetic fentanyl as well as heroin. Ninety percent of  the heroin that comes into the United States comes across the U.S.- Mexico border. As President Obama himself said in 2014, this is truly a  humanitarian and security crisis, but it is on steroids today.   On Monday, CBP had the highest totals of apprehensions in more than a  decade, and on Tuesday, they broke that record. Daily averages for  border apprehensions are higher than we have seen at any time since  2006.   Last month, CBP apprehended 76,000 people in 1 month on our southern  border--the highest monthly total in over  [[Page S2072]]  a decade. Yesterday, Commissioner McAleenan, announced that, in March,  they are on track to beat that record with 100,000 apprehensions along  our southwest border. That is 76,000 apprehensions in February and an  estimated 100,000 in March.   As a result of the surge, because the Border Patrol has to do  something, 40 percent of the Border Patrol's manpower is now spent  processing immigrants and providing care and transportation. In other  words, they are not engaged in their primary mission, which is border  security, because they are busy handing out juice boxes and diapers to  children, as well as processing the immigrants who are providing other  transportation.   The Border Patrol simply doesn't have the resources, nor should it be  expected to have the resources, to handle this crisis and perform their  primary duty, which is to protect our border. We know that detention  centers are at or over capacity, and local charities and  nongovernmental Agencies are strained, as well, and all of our border  communities are being overrun by humanity.   Recently, Senator Cruz and I were down at the Sarita checkpoint to  name that checkpoint after a heroic Border Patrol agent who was killed  by two illegal aliens. We were approached by the chief of police from  McAllen--somebody who is well respected in law enforcement circles in  our State--who said that because the Border Patrol is simply unable to  process all of these people, and they are being released into those  communities or put on a bus and sent to places like San Antonio, they  are increasingly worried about public safety. That is notwithstanding  the fact that many of our border communities are extraordinarily safe,  at least on our side of the border. If you go on the Mexican side of  the border, they are some of the most dangerous cities in our  hemisphere.   This is having a profound impact on our local communities, on the men  and women of the Customs and Border Patrol. Frankly, it should be an  embarrassment to us here in this country that we haven't dealt with  this in a more timely and more effective way.   Because the cartels have figured this out, people crossing the border  today are largely families and unaccompanied minors because of the  special way they have to be processed and because of a consent decree  called the Flores decision, which says you can't detain them for more  than 20 days. That is not enough time to get them in front of an  immigration judge in order to adjudicate their asylum claim, so they  are released into the interior of the United States. Guess what.  Overwhelmingly, they don't show up for their court hearings because  they realize they have beat the system. The cartels know that because  of the money they make. They are exploiting these vulnerabilities in  our laws and in our infrastructure. The only people who can fix that  are Congress and the President, working together in a bipartisan way.   I know we have had a big debate over border barriers--walls, fences,  you name it--but, frankly, you could build all the barriers you want  along our southwest border, and it will not stop this flow of  unaccompanied minors and family units because, frankly, they are  showing up at the border, and they are turning themselves in. So we  need to act.   Two weeks ago, Ms. Nielsen, Secretary of the Department of Homeland  Security, said: ``The situation on our southern border has gone from a  crisis, to a national emergency, to a near system-wide meltdown.''   Our Democratic colleagues have called this a fake emergency. They  have opposed treating this crisis for what it is. It is even more than  an emergency; it is a total system failure, and the only people who can  fix it are Congress, working with the President. I am not sure how much  longer our Democratic colleagues could be in denial when we see this  flood of humanity coming across in higher and higher numbers every day.   The issue is staring us in the face. The numbers confirm what we have  said all along: This is a border security and humanitarian crisis.   Secretary Nielsen made an important point that our communities, our  members of law enforcement, and the immigrants themselves are paying  the price for our inaction.   We have heard it from people at the border who know how to fix the  problem, and we need to listen. They have told us time and again that  it will take a combination of technology, physical infrastructure, and  boots on the ground. It will also take legislative action to fill the  gaps in our laws that we know exist and are being exploited by the  cartels.   I want to commend the men and women of Customs and Border Patrol for  working around the clock in a thankless job but in an important job.  Frankly, I am embarrassed that they haven't seen more support by the  people who represent them in Congress.   We have sent them out on a losing battle unless we can work together  here in Congress to give them the resources and the legislative fixes  they need.   I want to assure these dedicated men and women that we are trying,  but we need their help to talk to their elected Representatives here in  Congress. We need Ms. Pelosi to consider this the same humanitarian  crisis that President Obama identified back in 2014, when he called it  a humanitarian and security crisis. By any measure, it has gotten much,  much worse. We need to give this crisis the serious attention that it  deserves.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
