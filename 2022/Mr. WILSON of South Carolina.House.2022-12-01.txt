 Mr. Speaker, Biden and Democrats have  failed to secure the southern border. Since Biden took office, over 1  million illegal aliens have evaded apprehension, including 60,000 in  October.   Among the 4 million who have illegally crossed the border since Biden  are professional mass murderers on the terrorist screening database.  American families are at greater risk than ever of mass murder, which  is why voters elected a Republican House majority to fight for  effective border enforcement.   As the co-chair of the French-American Caucus and of French heritage  myself, I was grateful yesterday to have been present with President  Emmanuel Macron at the Library of Congress.   South Carolina appreciates both the Marquis de Lafayette, who landed  at Georgetown in 1777 to support the American Revolution, with his  portrait here in the Chamber, and Michelin Tire Corporation, whose  Lexington groundbreaking I attended this week in 1979, now the largest  Michelin manufacturing facility in the world.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism, sadly which  continues, now moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
