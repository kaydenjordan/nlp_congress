 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 4606.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 4606, the Ensuring Small Scale  LNG Certainty and Access Act, a bill written by the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Johnson).   This important bill will speed up the review of applications to  export small amounts of natural gas to the emerging small LNG markets  in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. This bill will  strengthen our energy security, create jobs at home, and open new  markets for Americans.   This bill is about creating a level playing field for the smallest  projects. Right now, to export natural gas to a country that we have a  free trade agreement with, it is approved without red tape. We want to  do that for very small projects, too, no matter the buyer.   H.R. 4606 is truly focused on ``small-scale'' projects. We are  talking about projects that amount to maybe one-tenth of 1 percent of  the natural gas America consumes every single day. It is only 0.14  billion cubic feet per day. The big LNG products that you hear about  are more like 2 billion cubic feet per day. That is 0.14 versus 2  billion cubic feet. These are tiny projects worth looking at. We want  them to make their way to the emerging markets.   But don't let the small size fool you. Just as larger LNG exports  help us push back against Vladimir Putin and help free Eastern Europe,  small LNG will preserve American influence in Latin America. We can  give our trading partners a cleaner, more dependable option than  unreliable and unstable Venezuelan exports. That is why I call our LNG  exports ``liquid American freedom.'' America will never turn off the  spigot over politics.   Madam Chair, this is a bipartisan bill. It went through regular order  in the Energy and Commerce Committee, where we held hearings and  accepted a bipartisan amendment to perfect the bill.   The Department of Energy is also in support of this bill's intent.  Passing this bill, they said, means ``saving several months of review  time, at a minimum.''   We have also heard from LNG producers, terminal operators, and  overseas developers. One said it will provide certainty and speed up  ``America's rise as a world-class exporter of natural gas, creating  U.S. jobs, growing our economy, strengthening global energy security,  all while reducing emissions and pollution.''   I believe it is important to point out that H.R. 4606 makes  absolutely no changes to environmental law. In fact, at our markup we  accepted a bipartisan amendment that clarifies that any project would  have to qualify for a broad exclusion under NEPA to be put on the fast  track. This bill is not about waiving environmental laws.                                time  1345    Most importantly, DOD is working on the same problem and is improving  their rules as we speak. They say that many of the countries in the  Caribbean and Latin America don't have enough demand to cover the costs  of enormous import terminals for huge ships. The small-scale LNG export  market is the only path that makes sense to bring affordable American  energy to these projects and countries.   Congress needs to put DOE's policy into law. That is the only way we  can create certainty. No one wants to make investments on a single  administration's policy. Congress must create certainty, and this bill  does just that.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. It is good  for our economy, our jobs, and our economic diplomacy.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson), the author of the bill.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Barton), the former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee  and the current chairman and a senior member of the Texas delegation.   (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar), the chair of the Western Caucus.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   It is real simple. This bill is about good-paying, American jobs,  American energy going to our neighbors in Latin America, South America,  Central America, and the Caribbean.   This bill does not skate around any environmental laws. You have to  comply with all the rules as they exist today to export this natural  gas.   This bill is bipartisan as here today, two speakers from the other  side spoke in favor of this bill. I ask my colleagues to join those  Members and our Members and vote for this good bill for American jobs,  American security, and great foreign relations.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment is unnecessary and misguided  because emissions from natural gas wells are already regulated by the  EPA and States under the Clean Air Act.   H.R. 4606 applies only to projects that have already undergone  rigorous environmental review and are eligible for an exclusion under  the National Environmental Policy Act.                                time  1445    Other than the Natural Gas Act, DOE has the responsibility to protect  the public interest. In doing so, DOE must consider whether the project  applicant is following the laws and regulations, including those under  the Clean Air Act.   Let's be clear about the environmental benefits of natural gas in  general and this legislation, specifically.   U.S. carbon emissions in 2017 were the lowest they have been since  1992 because we are using more clean natural gas. Unfortunately, carbon  emissions are increasing in other parts of the world because they don't  have access to clean-burning natural gas. Our friends in South America,  Central America, and the Caribbean are still burning Venezuelan fuel  oil in places where our U.S. LNG can replace that fuel oil.   H.R. 4606 is good for our economy. It is good for new American jobs,  and it is good for our environment. This legislation will start  America's rise as a world-class exporter of natural gas, which will  help reduce emissions and pollution all across the globe.   If you really care about reducing emissions, you can't deny the  benefits of this legislation.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, this bill is all about good-paying  American jobs.   American exports of liquified natural gas help our neighbors in South  America, Central America, and the Caribbean. This bill makes our air  cleaner. Let's lock those benefits in for years to come.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4606 and oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  Cheney) having assumed the chair, Mr. Calvert, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4606) to  provide that applications under the Natural Gas Act for the importation  or exportation of small volumes of natural gas shall be granted without  modification or delay, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, this is just a procedural motion to deny the  important benefits of this bipartisan legislation to American workers,  businesses, our energy security, and global American energy dominance.  It fits a pattern of delay and obstruction that we simply can't afford.   Our neighbors in South America, Central America, and the Caribbean  are praying for American LNG instead of fuel oil from unstable and  collapsing Venezuela. Let's answer those prayers today. Vote against  the motion to recommit and for final passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, September is the National Childhood Cancer  Awareness Month. It is a month about a young lady from home. Her name  is Marlee Pack.   On April 10 of 2015, she was told a small bump on her left foot was  cancer. Two weeks later, her left foot was cut off. Next was 40  straight weeks of chemotherapy in Houston. The chemo took all of her  hair, but it never took her smile.   She kept smiling when her cancer came back in July of 2017. She  smiled because she beat her cancer again. Marlee smiles because she is  bathed in love from her parents, a teacher who let Marlee shave her  head at school,  [[Page H7901]]  and a parade at her school, Sienna Crossing Elementary in Fort Bend  County.   But Marlee's biggest smile is yet to come. Soon, she will ring that  bell that she is cancer-free. Let's smile with Marlee and make D.C.  gold this month.                            ____________________
