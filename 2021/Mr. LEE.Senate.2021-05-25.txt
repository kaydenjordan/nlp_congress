 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 2  minutes.    Mr. President, all human lives from conception to natural  birth have innate, immeasurable dignity and worth. They are not play  things. They are not mere objects for scientific experimentation.   Experiments that use aborted fetal tissue and practices that create  and destroy human embryos or human lives in their earliest stages of  development flatly deny that truth. Unfortunately, our own tax dollars  sometimes incentivize experiments of this very kind. And the bill  before us provides no exceptions, no protections to prevent it.   The Endless Frontier Act includes over $80 billion of authorized  funding for key areas of biotechnology, medical technology, genomics,  and synthetic biology without any ethical guardrails or protections for  the earliest stages of life.   Many Americans do not want to see their taxpayer dollars used to  destroy, experiment on, or unethically alter human life, and they  shouldn't be forced to do so.   Now, thankfully, there are some of these protections in annual  appropriations measures that go through the Department of Health and  Human Services. And they have been there for decades, but because this  bill expands research at the NSF, the Department of Commerce, and the  Office of Science and Technology, which are funded through a different  appropriations bill through CJS, the HHS riders do not apply.   That is why I am offering this amendment, which would simply prohibit  any research funded through the Endless Frontier Act from using fetal  tissue obtained from an abortion and creating, destroying, discarding  or putting human embryos at risk.   While the NSF currently has an Agency policy that bans research in  which a human embryo is created or destroyed, this would codify that.  We need it to codify that. We need this to be consistent with what we  do elsewhere to protect the sanctity of human life.   Look, human lives at every stage are too precious to tinker with. Our  research and laws should uphold this truth. This amendment would help  ensure permanent protections to do precisely that.    I call for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, it is my distinct pleasure to  recognize 13 exemplary men and women who are among the best and  brightest that Utah has to offer. These individuals have answered the  call to service by applying and receiving appointments to the U.S. Air  Force Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Military  Academy, and the U.S. Naval Academy.   As a Member of Congress, it is my privilege under title 10 of the  United States Code to nominate a number of young men and women to  attend these iconic service academies. However, receiving a  congressional nomination does not guarantee acceptance. To be admitted,  each applicant must meet--on his or her own merits--the academies'  rigorous standards.   I am happy to report that all of the appointees being recognized  today surpassed the expected standards. Not only have they demonstrated  their impressive mental and physical aptitude, they have also shown  their high moral character, the capacity for leadership, courage,  honesty, prudence, and self-discipline. These appointees maintain a  steadfast commitment to service and to standing up for our country.  They emulate the foundational character qualities upon which our  service academies are built.   I can say, without hesitation or exaggeration that you would be hard- pressed to find a more accomplished, talented, patriotic group of  American citizens anywhere. They will be a credit to our Nation as they  set off for Colorado Springs, Kings Point, West Point, and Annapolis. I  look forward to seeing what they accomplish in the years to come. I am  honored to recognize and congratulate these fine Utahns in the U.S.  Senate.   Grace Bales, from Heber City, UT has accepted an appointment to the  U.S. Air Force Academy.
