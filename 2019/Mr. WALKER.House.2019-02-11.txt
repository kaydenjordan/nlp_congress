 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, if this unanimous consent request cannot be  entertained, I urge the Speaker and the majority leader to immediately  schedule the born-alive bill so we can stand up and protect the  sanctity of human life, and I would ask all others to join that  request.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend our deepest  sympathies, prayers, and certainly our thoughts to the family of John  Dingell and Walter Jones.   I did not know Mr. Dingell and only came after and served with his  lovely wife, Debbie Dingell, but certainly wish all of their family our  extended prayers.   And the same goes for one of our North Carolina delegation members,  Walter Jones, and his family, Joe Anne and Ashley, who served  faithfully for North Carolinians for a quarter of a century.   Certainly, we will remember those, as we already have tonight, in our  Prayer Caucus in praying for both families.   I don't really have any speeches written out tonight but do want to  talk about a couple of areas that I believe are continuing to impact  our country, maybe two of the foremost areas: border security, and then  I want to talk a little bit about where our country stands in the pro- life movement.   Let me start with border security. This seems to be happening in real  time. In fact, just last night, Mr. Speaker, I received a phone call  from a local sheriff who is part of the 3,000 sheriff representatives  in the National Sheriffs' Association. You see, they are becoming more  and more concerned as we get less and less, as a body, concerned about  border security.   They reached out to me last night and said: Fifty of us would like to  deliver a letter to the Capitol to Members of Congress, specifically  Chairwoman Nita Lowey and Ranking Member Kay Granger. Our plans weren't  to arrive until this afternoon, but we quickly made arrangements to be  here this morning.   If these 50 sheriffs were going to travel all over the country,  States from Massachusetts to Arizona to Washington to Texas, the least  we could do would be to be here and to greet them, which we did.    On a very cold, rainy morning this morning, we met these 50 sheriffs  on the Capitol steps, at which time they handed to me this letter, and  I would like to read it this evening. It says:         Dear Chairwoman Nita Lowey and Ranking Member Kay Granger:        On behalf of more than 3,000 sheriffs represented by both       the National Sheriffs' Association and the Major County       Sheriffs of America, we write in opposition to Congress' most       recent deliberation to place an artificial cap on Immigration       and Customs Enforcement's detention capacity.    Now, I am going to explain this in just a little bit and get into  detail.         Capping the number of detention beds utilized by ICE not       only jeopardizes the integrity of the immigration system, but       would cripple ICE's ability to detain criminal aliens and       other aliens who pose a risk to public safety or are a flight       risk.    They continue:         Any legislation that reduces ICE's detention capacity would       hinder its ability to perform its national security and       public safety missions but, also, impact local law       enforcement's ability to protect the communities they serve.    You know, we have heard a lot from some of our Democratic colleagues  who say the people who should be making these decisions or the people  who should be informing us of these decisions are the people with the  most experience. Well, here is our National Sheriffs' Association,  3,000-strong, sitting representatives here.   They go on to say:         In order to meet the cap being tentatively proposed by       Congress, ICE would be compelled to release thousands of       aliens from custody.    Now, listen to this data point:         To achieve the 16,500 adult average detainee population--      ADP--caps for the remaining 7 months of the fiscal year, a       net reduction of 9,264 adults by the end of this fiscal year       would be required.    Now, what does that mean? It means, if you are not meeting the caps,  these folks, these criminal aliens, are going to get released.   You say, well, are these criminal aliens? Here is the number:         Approximately 72 percent of ICE's current detention       population is subject to mandatory detention due to the alien       having certain convictions or having committed certain acts.    So, of that number, 72 percent we know of, we are just going to say,  or the Democrats want us to say, Mr. Speaker, that we just need to  release these because we want to put a cap, just pick a number out of  the air because we don't think we should have  [[Page H1510]]  more than that, no matter what kind of crimes they committed.   This is ludicrous.   They conclude by saying:         Placing a cap on ICE detention beds would undermine the       efficacy of the immigration system and reduce the number of       aliens who are removed from the United States.    They use these words:         This dangerous congressional proposal not only jeopardizes       the risk of our national security, but hinders our law       enforcement officers from effectively enforcing and upholding       the law and protecting their communities.    There you have it. They are saying the reduction of these detention  beds, which is just a backhanded way of defunding Immigration and  Customs Enforcement, would hinder them from doing their job.   So tonight I am reminding my Democratic colleagues that, by pushing  for the reduction of detention beds, these sheriffs, who serve for  little pay and serve in dangerous situations in many places, in many  remote areas, they are telling my colleagues: Don't do this. This puts  us in a dangerous situation. This puts our communities in a more  dangerous situation when we allow thousands of criminal aliens to be  put back in the different communities on the streets.   This is preposterous.   The National Sheriffs' Association and the Major County Sheriffs of  America oppose the current budget proposal and urge Congress to  consider the dangerous ramifications that passing this depreciated  budget could have on the citizens of America.   Mr. Speaker, these aren't my words. Mr. Speaker, these aren't the  words of our minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, or our whip, Steve  Scalise, or our chair, Liz Cheney. These are the words of our local  county sheriffs, urging and pleading: Do not continue to push for this.   It is a real shame that these sheriffs have to come to Washington,  D.C.--33 degrees outside, in the rain--to plead with a Member of  Congress to try and stop such a preposterous suggestion.   As they stood today--and I brought them inside the Capitol, gave them  a quick tour, even took them over into the Rayburn Room, and we talked  a little bit. We talked about how structures work, how steel slats  work. We talked about the places of San Diego and El Paso, where there  has been a drastic reduction in crime.   You see, these sheriffs get it. These sheriffs are elected officials  themselves and have a duty to uphold the law, much like the same oath  that Members of Congress take to protect and serve the American people.   Structures work.   Now the Democrats, at the last minute, are trying another ploy by  trying to come up with some crazy suggestion that we should reduce the  amount of detention beds, putting a cap on it, automatically releasing  criminal aliens. It is time for my Democratic colleagues to put up or  shut up when it comes to being genuine about border security.   One of the things that we have seen recently is not only a  lackadaisical approach about border security, but we have also seen it  in the protection and the sanctity of human life.                                time  1945    Many Members are very passionate and should be so. You see, this  isn't about an argument over how much funding a certain project should  receive. This isn't about a preference on a particular issue that comes  out of committee. The reason this has brought so much passion over the  last 50 years is because this has to do with human life.   I can tell you, as a former pastor and being in the hospital room  when a loved one breathed their last breath, I have seen how families  had yearned for just another hour, another day. It is a very sad and  tragic situation. They would have given everything they had for another  few precious minutes with that loved one: a son, a daughter, a dad, a  brother, a sister, a mom.   Yet we have cheapened life to the place, in these Hallowed Halls,  that it has simply become a political pawn, a bargaining chip. How did  we get to this place?   The other night, the night before the National Prayer Breakfast, I  was speaking with a wonderful representative, a lady from the country  of Latvia, who was appalled at our abortion laws, who are so much  further than anything we see in Europe.   When we have to begin to talk about only six other countries that  have such extreme abortion laws as ours, is that not a wake-up call?   When the Governor of New York, Mr. Speaker, continues to advocate  with such lack of respect for human life, is that not a wake-up call?   When Governor Ralph Northam begins to talk about infanticide, is that  not a wake-up call?   What does it take for everyday Americans to say enough is enough when  it comes to human life?   Right now, we are trying to bring to the floor a Born-Alive Abortion  Protection Act. What does it say? Well, it is not overwhelming too  much. It basically says, if a baby survives a botched abortion, then  the providers would be required by law to sustain its life. Yet we  can't get it to the floor.   The reason why is because, when it was introduced last time, last  cycle, we had several brave, strong Democrats who had the courage to  step forward and vote for a piece of legislation that would require  providers to sustain life during these times.   I remember I was so moved by that kind of courage nearly a year or so  ago that I went back to my office and wrote thank-you cards to those  Democrats who were willing to stand up for the sanctity of human life.   What is it worth to us? Not only is the Born-Alive Protection Act  something that is important; I would even add another bill that was  passed out of the House, not taken up before the Senate, the Pain- Capable Child Protection Act, that would limit abortions after 20 weeks  to only specific circumstances.   What is it going to take for our country to put the kind of concern  and the favor that God's creation deserves?   Speaking of God's creation, Mr. Speaker, our Speaker of the House,  just 3 days ago, sent this tweet out that I will read. She said: ``We  have a moral responsibility to protect God's creation for generations  to come.'' That is why, today, she was naming a select committee not on  the sanctity of human life, but on climate control.   We need to take a look at all the issues, but we need to stand as  Members of Congress for those who cannot stand for themselves. We need  to be a voice for those who have no voice.   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to continue to remind us that God's  creation isn't just what we see in nature. God's creations are also  these unborn babies. May we come to the place that we protect.   So tonight, as I talk about border security and pro-life issues, I  yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), a large animal  veterinarian from the Gainesville, Florida, area, to share his thoughts  on what we need to do secure our border.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Yoho. I appreciate his wisdom  and his experience in this area.   As we continue to talk about these two issues tonight, I think back  to the border security issue and how this has become more of a campaign  against the President of the United States, when just a few short years  ago, the majority of Senators, who were Democrats at the time, voted  for a structure at that time, voted for a wall. It wasn't politically  incorrect at that point to call it a wall. But we see how quickly in  Washington, D.C., things do become politically correct.   Why? It is because we see the numbers. We see the work of our border  agents. We see the work of ICE, which, in 2017, was able to ascertain  over 800,000 pounds of drugs. Think about that, 800,000 pounds of  drugs. Enough fentanyl to kill every man, woman, and child not just in  our country, but in all of North America was ascertained.   A week ago tomorrow night, sitting right up to my left in the second  row there, was my sister-in-law. Her brother was an Army veteran,  wonderful young man, played basketball in college with my youngest  brother. Scott Aaron was his name.   One day, he injured his knee, and he had to have an operation. From  that operation, he was given painkillers. Painkillers went to opioids;  opioids obviously included heroin, to the place where he became a full- fledged addict.   He tried multiple times to overcome that addiction to heroin but, in  the end, failed and realized that, in his mind, he did not have hope,  which brought him to the place of committing suicide.   Now, Scott is not by himself, to the tune of 300 families per week  that are having the funeral of a loved one due to some kind of tragic  overdose, mostly heroin. Now heroin is laced with fentanyl, and we are  seeing more and more epidemic proportions.   We are doing everything we can in Congress to provide the funding to  combat the heroin crisis, but why wouldn't it make sense that we also  put up some structures, specifically in hot spots along the border, to  help reduce and maybe even, in some cases, eliminate?   On this floor, I have talked with more than a dozen of my Democratic  friends and colleagues who have told me time after time after time: We  have no doubt that a structure works.   So why not move forward? Why not come to an agreement--a compromise,  if you will--to be able to begin to lay out the places where a  structure, a fence, a wall could work?   How many lives would need to be saved to make it worth it?   How many families could be reunited without an empty chair this  Thanksgiving or this Christmas?   How many would it take for it to be worth it? How many would it take  for us to get past the political jargon of being able to use this as  some kind of pawn to argue back and forth?   I would say just one. The case could be made for thousands.                                time  2000    Border security: It is time we come together. We don't even need to  be talking about another shutdown or CR. We need to be able to resolve  this. This is a commonsense solution to be able to resolve this.   Republicans aren't talking about a border from San Diego to McAllen,  Texas. We understand there are places where drones, where technology,  where surveillance may be the better way.   We don't believe in eminent domain and blocking people's views of the  Rio Grande River with a wall, but there are things that we can do  immediately. Yet I believe it has come to the place where we put  personalities and politics over the people themselves.   Border security: It is time we do something.   Mr. Speaker, I yield again to my friend, Dr. Yoho, to have a few more  data points on border security. Then I will close out in just a few  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Yoho for his comments tonight. I  appreciate that.   Mr. Speaker, just a couple more thoughts on border security as we  move forward.   America was built on immigration. Nearly everyone within the sound of  my voice, even though the halls have emptied out tonight, can go back  and trace, from some ancestry point, the impact that immigrants had on  this country, but it is legal immigration.   Now, somebody might ask, how are we doing in that area? Thank you for  asking.   America has the most generous immigration laws in the world. In 2017  alone, we took over 1.1 million immigrants who raised their right hand,  who took an oath to pledge allegiance to this great country of America.  We are doing pretty good there, and the President has even made  proposals to increase that amount.   It is the illegal immigration. We don't want our hearts to get lost  in this, as Republicans, and specifically speaking for myself, having  worked in refugee camps, having worked internationally to understand  the plight and the struggle that goes on, to be able to expand America  as fast as we can, to legally allow people to be part of the greatest  country in the history of the world.   Yet, as Members of Congress, when we raise that right hand to do our  best to protect, we need to take that seriously.   The crazy calls to abolish our law enforcement, agencies like ICE,  which in 2017 rescued 904 children who were being exploited, how many  children would it take for it to be worth it, for Immigration and  Customs Enforcement? How many of those children would we measure any  success by this?   To go as far as calling for abolishment, that is not America. That is  crazy political speech.   Speaking of crazy political speech, the recent absurd language that  has become acceptable to talk about third trimesters and to talk about  infanticide, what are we coming to in this country?   Listen, we don't pass judgment on the young woma who is making  sometimes a life decision. Working with our own Greensboro Pregnancy  Care Center, sometimes these young ladies don't even realize they have  another option. We don't pass judgment. Do not believe the lies that  this is about hating or judging these mere innocent souls.    The problem that I have tonight is the political leaders who are  providing the pathway to cheapen the sanctity of our human lives. That  is where the focus needs to be. It needs to be that colleagues,  Republicans and Democrats, are willing to stand up for those who simply  don't have any rights.   Who advocates for the baby? Who speaks out on behalf of the baby? It  is all about reproductive rights. It is all about choice. It is all  about what is now called women's healthcare. Who voices or who stands  up for the baby?   As we talked about a little earlier tonight in our bipartisan prayer  caucus where a dozen or so Members were gathered, I brought up the  point it wasn't too long ago that I remember sitting in a prestigious  place with my wife, being the honored guests. To add to that, I think  back over the last 4 years I have served with the United States  Congress. I have sat down with Prime Ministers and royalty all across  this world to have opportunities to talk policy. But I am well aware  that, in our life, the remembrance of a Congressman lasts about 15  minutes, maybe 20 minutes, once you are gone from these hallowed halls.   We are judged, in some ways, by our policy. But ultimately, what we  do for God, to me, matters the most, when it comes to eternal values.  One day, when we all stand before God, we will be judged not by just  whatever button we pushed on the back of these chairs but, ultimately,  what we did, I believe, with life.   That is why it is important to me. It is why it is important to  millions and millions of Americans.   Let's get back to the place where we are willing to stand up, where  we are willing to raise our voices for a child who cannot raise its  own.   Tonight, let's get back to a place where we have a respect for the  Almighty, for God, who, as I read in a tweet earlier, is the giver and  the creator of life.   I think of David's writing in the Old Testament. I think of Psalm  139, where David captured quite poetically the words how we are  ``fearfully and wonderfully made,'' how that even when we were formed,  the beginning of our substance, God knew us. Not only did he know us,  it is that he had a purpose and a plan for every life born and unborn.   May we never grow weary, and may we never tire of doing all that we  can in the United States Congress to protect, stand for, and defend the  sanctity of human life.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
