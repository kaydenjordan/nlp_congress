 Mr. Speaker, as I travel Michigan's Seventh District,  from neighborhood stores to the factory floor, there is a renewed sense  of optimism. Folks I hear from feel safer and more secure about the  future.   The economy is thriving thanks to progrowth policies like tax cuts  and regulatory reform. Businesses are hiring, and there are more job  openings than job seekers, and workers and families are seeing bigger  paychecks and more take-home pay.   It is not just our economy that is getting stronger; our military is  as well. We are taking care of our troops, raising their pay, and  reforming the VA to help our veterans. We have also taken significant  steps to combat the opioid epidemic, crack down on human trafficking,  and make our communities safer.   Is there more work to do? Absolutely. Our focus will remain on  helping to improve people's lives and making it easier for them to get  ahead. The results so far are clear: Americans are better off now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2353, the  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.  I also thank my colleagues and sponsors of this legislation,  Representative Thompson from Pennsylvania and my good friend from  Illinois, Representative Krishnamoorthi.   As I have met with students, teachers, and employers in my district,  I have consistently heard the need to expand CTE opportunities and  invest in a skilled workforce.   In today's economy, we need to celebrate the fact that not everyone  follows the same path. While many students pursue 4-year degrees, many  others know their sweet spots lie somewhere else.   Career and technical education provides students with hands-on  experience that can lead to a good paying job and a rewarding career.   I am also pleased this bipartisan legislation includes my provisions  to address unnecessary and duplicative licensing requirements that act  as a barrier for workers trying to get their foot in the door.   I commend my colleagues on the Education and the Workforce Committee  for making it a priority to modernize and strengthen CTE programs.   Coming from a manufacturing hub like Michigan, this bill will make a  big difference for the hardworking men and women of our State.   Let's pass it today and help every American pursue their personal  paths to the American Dream.
