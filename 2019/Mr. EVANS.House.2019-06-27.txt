 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Gun Violence Awareness  Month and to honor the hundreds of thousands of survivors and victims  of gun violence.   In 2018, in my city of Philadelphia, there were 351 homicides, and  most of these were committed with a gun. What is happening in Philly is  consistent with what is happening every day in violence-plagued Black  and Brown communities across this country. It is sickening. So is the  Senate's lack of action on commonsense gun reform bills that the House  has passed.   While we still need commonsense gun reform, Senator Casey and I have  also introduced a bill that Members from both parties should be able to  agree on, H.R. 2585, the Resources for Victims of Gun Violence Act.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join the 50 cosponsors and  [[Page H5252]]  the many organizations that are putting their concern for gun violence  into action by supporting this bill, and I urge the Senate to act on  the bills the House has already passed.                            ____________________
