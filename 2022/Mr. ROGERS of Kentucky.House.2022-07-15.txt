 Madam Speaker, I thank Judge Gohmert for very  graciously allowing me to speak before his main subject.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of three  fallen heroes in eastern Kentucky. Last week we laid to rest three  police officers and one service canine who were slain in the line of  duty after enduring unexpected gunfire in Allen, Kentucky, on June 30,  2022.   Among the fallen were William Petry, a 31-year law enforcement  veteran and the fire chief in Floyd County, Kentucky; Ralph Frasure, a  39-year law enforcement veteran and school resource officer; and Jacob  Chaffins, was a 28-year-old police officer who just started his law  enforcement career 3 years ago and an active sergeant in the Kentucky  Army National Guard. Also among the deceased was a beloved canine named  Drago, a well-trained service dog for the Floyd County Sheriff's  Department.   Needless to say, the heartbreak and pain that have reverberated  across eastern Kentucky at the loss of these brave men who dedicated  their lives to serving and protecting our local people has been  overwhelming.   President Theodore Roosevelt, who was a former New York City Police  Commissioner, once said, ``No man is worth his salt who is not ready at  all times to risk his body, to risk his well-being, to risk his life in  a great cause.''   On Thursday, June 30, 2022, these officers, and many other responders  risked their lives as they valiantly answered the call to protect the  people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.   Their heroic deaths represent a powerful display of the selfless love  described in John 15:13, ``Greater love has no one than this: to lay  down one's life for one's friends.''   Even as we speak, several other first responders are also fighting  for their lives, recovering from their injuries from that horrific day,  and our prayers are with them and with their families.   In a Nation where police forces have been vilified in recent years by  the actions of a few bad actors, may the lives of these brave men be a  reminder of the outstanding integrity and sacrifice that the thin blue  line represents. We must continue to support our law enforcement  officers across the United States, ensuring they are fully equipped,  adequately prepared, and never at the mercy of evildoers.   This Nation owes a great debt of gratitude for the life and service  of Officers Petry, Frasure, and Chaffins. May their loved ones find  abundant peace and confidence in Matthew 5:9, ``Blessed are the  peacemakers, for they will be called the children of God.''   Madam Speaker, I request to recognize a moment of silence in memory  of William Petry, Ralph Frasure, Jacob Chaffins, and K-9 Drago.                                time  1430
