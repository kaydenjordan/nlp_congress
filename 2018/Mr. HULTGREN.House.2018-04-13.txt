 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Loyola  University Chicago Ramblers on their roller coaster dance to the Final  Four at this year's men's basketball NCAA tournament.   This is an incredible team, boasting players who showed great skill  on the court and hard work studying off the court.   No one can forget Sister Jean, who was a centerpiece of Loyola's  Cinderella story. Her selflessness, service to others, and love for the  Loyola men's basketball team gave the Nation hope and joy throughout  the tournament. At 98, Sister Jean has never  [[Page H3214]]  tired. And it was clear she was having the time of her life.   Loyola Chicago is dedicated to training students to be ``men and  women for others'' and to lead extraordinary lives. It is a class act  basketball program which has embodied sportsmanship ever since 1963,  when it became the only Illinois school to win the NCAA tournament, and  still is.   It is an honor to represent Loyola's Retreat and Ecology campus in  Woodstock, and I enjoyed cheering on the Ramblers during this amazing  ride.   I wish all the best to the Loyola Chicago men's basketball team, and  I hope to see Sister Jean dance with them again next March.   Congratulations, Ramblers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank the hardest working,  most effective chairman in all of Congress; and I also want to thank my  good friend and colleague French Hill for sponsoring this legislation.  I also want to thank my friend and colleague from Illinois, Bill  Foster, for his work on this.   I am also very happy to be a cosponsor of the Volcker Rule Regulatory  Harmonization Act. This legislation strikes a bipartisan balance for  simplifying some of the regulatory burden of the Volcker rule and  provides a clear exemption for community banks.                                time  1000    The Dodd-Frank Act granted responsibility to five different financial  regulators with implementing and enforcing the Volcker rule: the Fed,  OCC, FDIC, SEC, and CFTC. Every Member of this body knows that it can  be difficult to come to an agreement when you have too many cooks in  the kitchen. Imagine if this were the case for promulgating,  implementing, and enforcing something as complicated as the Volcker  rule.   One Illinois bank, that serves thousands of my constituents,  explained it is this way: ``This overlapping authority with respect to  interpretations and guidance, as well as examinations and supervision,  is inefficient and requires unnecessary time and effort, on the part of  banks as well as regulators, to ensure compliance.''   The Volcker Rule Regulatory Harmonization Act is an artful solution  to dealing with this issue. It grants the Federal Reserve the exclusive  rulemaking authority under section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act and  provides the sole examination and enforcement authority by an entity's  primary Federal regulator. The bill also addresses the concerns that  community banks have raised with the Volcker rule.   H.R. 4790 exempts banking organizations that do not have or are not  controlled by entities with $10 billion or more in total consolidated  assets and total trading assets or trading liabilities that are more  than 5 percent of total consolidated assets.   Because of the Volcker rule's complexity, even those community banks  that do not conduct any proprietary trading have, nonetheless, had to  incur large costs simply proving what the regulators already know, that  they are not engaged in activities covered by the rule. This is simply  not fair to subject community banks to these costs associated with  this.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.
