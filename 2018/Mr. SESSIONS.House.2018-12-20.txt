 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1180 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1180         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the  [[Page H10341]]       Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 88) to modify the boundary of       the Shiloh National Military Park located in Tennessee and       Mississippi, to establish Parker's Crossroads Battlefield as       an affiliated area of the National Park System, and for other       purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider       in the House, without intervention of any point of order, a       motion offered by the chair of the Committee on Ways and       Means or his designee that the House concur in the Senate       amendment with an amendment consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 115-87. The Senate amendment and the motion       shall be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable       for one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion.        Sec. 2.  On any legislative day of the second session of       the One Hundred Fifteenth Congress after December 23, 2018--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 3.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Torres), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.    Mr. Speaker, thank you and Merry Christmas. It is also  Merry Christmastime to the American people, Mr. Speaker, as Congress  moves to its final resolution for this term.   Mr. Speaker, we can't forget that there is important work that is  still to be done. The American people sent us here to do work and  expect us to do that.   Today I lay before the House the Rules Committee Print 115-87, the  text of the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 88. Now,  that may sound pretty pro forma, just like a normal bill, but, Mr.  Speaker, what is in here is not a normal bill.   In fact, it is a compilation of things which we do every year that  are called tax extenders because we have been unable, necessarily, to  agree on them for a longer term. So, one year to the next year to the  next year, we gather together before we leave, and we normally come to  an agreement. We have done this virtually every year I have been in  Congress.   We say on a bipartisan basis and a bicameral basis: Let's make sure  that we take care of the things that have not been taken care of on a  longer basis now.   What might that mean, Mr. Speaker? Well, that means that we, as a  body, need to be responsible and understand that during the year there  have been a number of circumstances also that contributed to people  needing tax help. Some of them are fires. Some of them are earthquakes.   Some of them are the changing of the circumstances back home where we  are trying to make sure that the Tax Code is updated in this tax year  now so that if someone--for instance, if they are in a California  wildfire--loses everything they have got, they know that Congress has  passed laws that help them as they move forward to rebuild their home,  to make decisions about their future.   It could be, Mr. Speaker, that a lot of work that the gentlewoman  from Kansas, who is a member of the Ways and Means Committee, one of  your colleagues on that committee, had done to make sure that any  whistleblower who saw something that was going wrong at work for tax- related matters is protected.   These are important issues. But they are also important because there  are broader activities, and they deal with taxation that was put into  the Affordable Care Act. It is called ObamaCare, but it is the  Affordable Care Act from years back.   What this Republican Congress has done is shielded, protected the  American people from many of the devastating effects, notwithstanding  that this Congress and the President, President Trump, signed the law  that takes away the individual mandate--not the business mandate but  the individual mandate.   But, Mr. Speaker, there are still three hugely onerous provisions  that still lag on from that piece of legislation. Embedded in that is  something called the medical device tax. The medical device tax is a  tax on the newest technology--not, Mr. Speaker, on the sale of that to  where, okay, Uncle Sam wants a little bit more of that, but the onerous  part is it is on the manufacture.   And when you put a tax on the manufacturing piece, that means that  that product is not produced in an effective, efficient way. That means  that they are produced one at a time because, upon that manufacture,  the tax has to be paid, not upon the sale.   It is something we fought on, I thought on a bipartisan basis, but it  seems like today it is simply partisan, simply only Republicans,  really, when it comes down to it, who are for doing away with the  medical device tax.   There is something called the Cadillac tax. That is the Democratic  Party's and President Obama's idea of you really shouldn't have better  healthcare than somebody else, and if you do, we are going to tax that  asset. It is at the heart of the Affordable Care Act.   This Cadillac tax has been, every single year, deferred, stopped,  agreed to. We are not going to apply that Cadillac tax, because it is  on people, many of them who work for unions, people who have earned the  right to have the healthcare that they have but the Democratic Party  wants to tax it.   Lastly, the healthcare tax. And that is a tax on every single person  that has a healthcare policy. It is about $70. That means that every  single American is going to pay an extra tax because they have  healthcare.   These are things that the Republican Party had worked on, and we  thought we were, on a bipartisan basis, going to take care of these  issues. We find out, really, today, that is not true.   But I think we found out around election time the real effort for the  Democratic Party. It is called H.R. 676, Medicare for All. Mr. Speaker,  to those of us who have looked at the bill, section 102 lays out every  single piece part of healthcare that you could think of, from an  audiologist, to a dentist, to a person who may provide massage therapy.   Section 104 in that bill outlaws all private health insurance in  America if a piece part that was in section 102 is provided or paid for  by a health insurer. It outlaws all private insurance. What does that  also mean? That means employer-provided insurance under H.R. 676,  section 104.   So, Mr. Speaker, sometimes you have got to read to the end of the  book or watch the end of the movie to see exactly what the plot and the  theme is.   Mr. Speaker, we have, for the last 8 years, been going down a pathway  of thinking that what we were doing was really bipartisan, that our  colleagues on the Democratic Party were really opposed to the Cadillac  tax because they consented and agreed to it, voted for it, that the  medical device tax was something that they understood would cause great  harm and increase prices and deny people to get the best technology.    We thought they were going along with this. We thought they  understood how important it was not to tax medical devices, the latest  technology that saves lives. And we thought that they understood that  the healthcare tax of $70 on every single health insurance plan in this  country was probably a bad idea after we already had the Affordable  Care Act signed into law.   I find out now I was wrong. I was wrong, and I think the American  people were fooled. The medical device tax, the Cadillac tax, and the  healthcare tax are in this package, along with the ability to help the  people in California and on the West Coast and other people who were a  part of natural disasters, people who are seeking help where they are  finding an employer doing something wrong, to give them that needed  opportunity to protect themselves, a safe harbor.   So much is being done in here at the end of the year, but that is not  the  [[Page H10342]]  story that was told at the Rules Committee. The story that was told is:  Oh, this is just about the top 1 percent. This is just about a special  deal.   Mr. Speaker, that is a long way from, not just the facts of the case,  but the truth. So I am here, as chairman of the Rules Committee,  bringing to the floor an opportunity to, once again, do as we have done  in the past to say the healthcare tax, the medical device tax, the  Cadillac tax--we are asking my colleagues to join with us.   It is a very genuine offer. It is an offer that has been extended and  accepted for the past few years, since the Affordable Care Act passed.  It is the right thing to do.   So I will ask each of the Members of this body to pay attention, to  see what is in there, help the people who have been a part of natural  disasters this year. Let's get this package done. It is the right thing  to do.   And I can sincerely look at you, Mr. Speaker, and say thank you.  Thank you for your years of service, but thank you for making sure that  we were faithful to the end. Even though it is starting to look a lot  like Christmas, we still have to do our work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the argument that we are involved in today is whether we  are going to, as this body, on a bipartisan, bicameral basis,  understand that it is about hundreds of billions of dollars. It is  about hundreds of billions of dollars that the American people have  been spared from.   Mr. Speaker, we are not undertaxed. We spend too much money. But that  is not what this is about. What this is about is control. This is about  the control that some in this body want over people's lives.   This is not about whether we are going to arbitrarily cause the  Federal Government to be in trouble over a Cadillac tax, a medical  device tax, a healthcare tax and blame that on greedy people back home  who, by virtue of them wanting to have healthcare and robust healthcare  and better healthcare but somebody in Washington does not want them to  have it and blames them on being greedy for what might be billions of  dollars when you add up everybody across the country; this is about  control. This is about controlling people's lives.   And, Mr. Speaker, I will once again say it. I had thought, during  these years, we came to an agreement that the Cadillac tax, the medical  device tax, the healthcare tax, things that happened during the year,  whether they be tornadoes, whether they be wildfires, whether they be  other circumstances, would still be able to be reached on a bipartisan,  bicameral basis.   After all, President Obama signed these into law.   After all, the American people understood that their gift for being  gracious and working and doing the right thing shouldn't be an onerous  tax.   After all, many people who live, as an example, in Minnesota could  look up and see where their two Democratic Senators fought hard to make  sure this medical device tax that was the lynchpin for tens of  thousands of jobs in medical innovation, that we could get together and  work together.   Now we find out, no, that is wrong. That is wrong. What we want is we  want that $180 billion. We want that. You can't have that, and we are  going to tax you because we can, because we can control your life and  the outcome of your healthcare; because, actually, those who have great  healthcare, yours is greedy, so we are going to tax it.   So, Mr. Speaker, that is why the Republican Party in the House of  Representatives is here today, as stalwarts of not just the middle  class of this country but stalwarts of people who understand people get  up and go to work--yes, the union worker, too.   That union worker will find out, loud and clear, the party that was  for taxing their healthcare, their working healthcare.   The people in these States, where medical devices are robust and made  America at the top of the world, they will understand.   And the people, who are average families like those in Dallas, Texas,  which I proudly represent, they will understand somebody was for taxing  them further and somebody tried to continue what we have done now for  years and not tax them on their healthcare.   So it is about control, and I am sure we will find out, as the new  year comes around, about H.R. 676, Medicare for All, that will outlaw  all employer-provided private healthcare in this country. That is what  the bill says. It is very plain. Section 104 gets right to it. That is  what this is about.  [[Page H10343]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I do not.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the distinguished gentlewoman from  California, not only her comments and her ideas--I know they are well  represented by the Democratic Party.   I would say to her that the people who vote against this bill will  turn their back on the people who had the wildfires in California, the  tornadoes in Georgia, the opportunities to help provide proper  instructive help on their taxes this year as they enter next year.  After all, it did happen this year.   But perhaps, more than that, Mr. Speaker, we recognize now more about  shifting the blame for 8 years and $9 trillion worth of spending. They  called it investment.   This Republican Congress, 1 year ago, almost to the day, passed a tax  bill that has created the greatest economy in the history of this  country. More revenue is coming in today than has ever come in in the  history of the country. More people are working today because of that  tax bill done 1 year ago. More people, more African Americans, more  women, more families have an opportunity to enjoy the benefits of a job  and the creation therein that they come home at night a little bit more  satisfied, and their children, in the next generation, see work as a  positive attribute, and communities are turning the corner.   Mr. Speaker, gas is $1.82 in Dallas, Texas. What a far cry from when  it was almost $5 at the same time in President Obama's administration  when the Democrats were running the place: the House, the Senate, and  the Presidency. Oh, Mr. Speaker, we have not forgotten what a  difference it makes, but the finger-pointing still continues.   Mr. Speaker, let the Record reflect, itself, that we have more  revenue than ever coming in, more people working than ever, more  opportunity for people, and part of that success has been because  Republicans chose not to have a healthcare tax, a medical device tax, a  Cadillac tax, choose not to make in order H.R. 676, Medicare for All,  that would outlaw all employer-provided healthcare in this country.   Mr. Speaker, the differences between our ideas really find themselves  at the center point of what we do today.   Last night in the Rules Committee, the distinguished gentleman from  Lewisville, Texas, Dr.  Michael Burgess, a retired physician who has  delivered more than 3,000 babies, said that he had sat through, for  years, these arguments at the Energy and Commerce Committee, and he  lamented how the story really is not told about some 3 million people  who now have jobs in this country, that a number of them that is  undefined also got employer-provided healthcare; and that while there  may be 1 million out of that 3 million who went to a larger company, it  is their families that benefited because there was maybe a spouse  behind that and a child or two who had previously been without  employer-provided healthcare.   Now we are going to find out that Grinch showed up at Christmas, this  rush to get out the door where we failed to secure the door, where we  were so eager to get home rather than do our work.   Mr. Speaker, I can't imagine that somebody would just want to say,  ``It is okay; it is Christmastime; let's get home,'' and then stick  coal in each of the stockings of the American people who have  healthcare, stick coal in the stockings of the medical device employees  and employers, stick coal into the stockings of the medical community  for doctors who had been providing these leading-edge ideas in medical  devices, stick coal in the stockings of the workers of America who  might have great healthcare only to find out that somebody who had  voted for it for years turned their back. So that is why we are here.   Mr. Speaker, here is the bill right here, pretty easy to do. We have  seen it a number of times. Nobody complained they didn't have time to  read the bill. They actually know what is in it this time.                                time  0945    They actually know what they would not be supporting. They are going  to put their vote and be on the line, and we are going to find out  where people really are.   So, Mr. Speaker, that is the debate, whether we are going to step up  and do our job; whether we are willing to complete the task; whether we  are willing to be consistent for the things that we have stood for; or  whether we are willing to make excuses about, well, it is just  Christmastime, and we have got to get home.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say that my party believes that we should not  have a white flag in our backpack, that we should not yield and just  say, well, the timing was difficult. We should stand on our two feet,  not beg on our knees.   We should move forward and do our job for the American people, and  that is what I am proud to say my party and myself and the Rules  Committee stand for. We are men and women who can stay to get the job  done, not want to get home and not have performed our duties.   So that is the story. That is the story that we are going to tell. So  I urge my colleagues to support this rule   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
