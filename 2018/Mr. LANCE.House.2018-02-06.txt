 Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Ethics Committee, I  rise in strong support of this legislation and resolution combating the  scourge of sexual harassment.   I commend the leadership of Chairman Harper and of Representative  Jackie Speier, a national leader on this issue for many years.   From this day forward, if a lawmaker commits an act of sexual  harassment  [[Page H810]]  and breaks the trust of the people, that information will be made  public and taxpayers will not foot the bill.   I am pleased that this legislation mirrors my bill that would  increase governmental transparency and accountability concerning  taxpayer-financed harassment settlements in Congress.   The people who come forward to serve this country, particularly young  people, need to know that protections are in place and that offenders,  no matter how powerful, will face accountability.   Congress must be an exemplar for the Nation on this important issue,  and I encourage other institutions in this country--business, labor,  Hollywood, and the press--to examine their own practices to ensure a  safe workplace.   Mr. Speaker, now is the time for action and results.
