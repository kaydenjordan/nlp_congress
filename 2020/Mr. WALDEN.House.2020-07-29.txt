 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4686, Sami's  Law, as well.   I commend my colleagues who have been down here today talking about  this law and the tragedy around it and the tragedy around the loss of  Sami. And while she may never have gotten the opportunity to become a  lawyer, she will have a law. And the advocacy of her parents to get  this law in place is a lifetime statutory memorial for her for an  incredible tragedy that should never have existed in the first place,  the kidnapping and murder.   We think about our kids, and we think about all we do to protect them  and to encourage them to do the right things. And you think about  convincing them to take a rideshare, don't drive, whatever, and then to  have this happen is truly horrible.   So this legislation that is brought before us today is  extraordinarily important. I thank my colleague from New Jersey (Mr.  Smith) for his tireless leadership on this and Mr. Suozzi as well and  everyone who has worked on it.    You should, as a rider, have the opportunity to know that you are  safe when you get in that vehicle and that you don't risk your life the  way Sami did and lost it.   Madam Speaker, I hope we can all rally around this bill and help get  this into law and have a memorial for Sami and a safeguard for all  others.
