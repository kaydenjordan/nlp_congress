 Mr. President, I want to talk briefly about boil water  advisories. They are more than just frustrating. They are more than  just inconvenient. They can be dangerous.   I don't know about the Presiding Officer's community or my  colleagues' communities, but they have been happening more and more  frequently in Louisiana. Since 2005, we have had 9,661 boil water  advisories. We had 1,600 of them last year alone.   I thank the EPW Committee for working with me and all of my  colleagues. My amendment would require the EPA to provide us an annual  study on the prevalence of these boil water advisories and the reasons  therefor so we can decide whether to take action, if any.   I would appreciate my colleagues' support.
