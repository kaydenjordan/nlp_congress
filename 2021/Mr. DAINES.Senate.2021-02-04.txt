 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 678 and ask  that it be reported by number.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Montana [Mr. Daines], for himself and       others, proposes an amendment numbered 678.    The amendment is as follows:   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to the    improvement of relations between the United States and Canada with     regard to the Keystone XL Pipeline entering the United States in                         Phillips County, Montana)         At the end of title III, add the following:       SEC. 3___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO THE                     IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED                     STATES AND CANADA.         The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate       may revise the allocations of a committee or committees,       aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution,       and make adjustments to the pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or       more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, amendments between       the Houses, motions, or conference reports relating to       improving relations between the United States and Canada,       increasing energy trade between the two nations, and reducing       transportation emissions through the approval of the       importation of oil from Canada to the United States through       the Keystone XL Pipeline by the amounts provided in such       legislation for those purposes, provided that such       legislation would not increase the deficit over either the       period of the total of fiscal years 2021 through 2025 or the       period of the total of fiscal years 2021 through 2030.     Mr. President, despite President Biden's call for unity,  with the stroke of a pen, he killed the Keystone XL Pipeline and the  thousands of jobs that come with it. He eliminated tens of millions of  dollars of tax revenues for communities in Montana for education, for  law enforcement, for infrastructure, as well as across the West. Hard- working Americans across our country, dozens of families in Montana  have already been given the pink slip. They were told to go home. Their  paycheck is gone. This isn't because of a pandemic; this is because of  President Biden.   I hope all of my colleagues join me today for the good of American  energy and our blue-collar workers, or they can stand with the job- killing Green New Deal agenda. The choice is clear.
