 Mr. Speaker, today is International Women's Day, a day to  recognize the great accomplishments of women and the great  possibilities that lie ahead.   During the course of the day we will be having some recognitions. But  one very important one is that: As we speak here now, on the Senate  side, they are finishing up the engrossment of the American Rescue  Plan.   This plan, as my distinguished colleague from the Virgin Islands  pointed out, does so many great things for America's children,  America's families, and America's women. If you are a caregiver,  whether for a child or a senior or whatever, childcare is substantially  supported in this legislation.   If you are a teacher, schools will be able to be open more safely  with increased funding to do so with ventilation, separation, and the  rest to have our children and teachers return safely as well.   The child tax credit and the refundable child tax credit, the earned  income tax credit--as was mentioned by the distinguished chairwoman on  the Ways and Means Committee, which was largely responsible, along with  Rosa DeLauro, Richie Neal and Mike Thompson in getting all this done-- the point is, we will be having a further discussion about this bill as  we move forward to its passage in the next 24, 48 hours.   It is important to acknowledge on International Women's Day the  connection between the advancement of women, the recognition of the  contributions of women, and the needs that are met in the American  Rescue Plan.   As President Biden said, help is on the way. That promise is kept in  this legislation to all Americans. I wanted to acknowledge specifically  the women of America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I will take a few seconds to say thank you to the  Congressional Black Caucus, to Congresswoman Jackson Lee; Congresswoman  Terri Sewell; the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Joyce  Beatty; and so many members.  [[Page H1103]]    Mr. Speaker, I have been watching the presentation. It is so  heartwarming, but I did not want to miss the chance to say thank you to  all of you for this commemoration of this 56th anniversary. For so many  of us who have gone there many times over, it is a hole in our heart  not to be able to be there for our precious John Lewis, who gave us so  much.   In the next couple of days, we are going to be talking about justice,  jobs, healthcare, and all the things that he stood for. And we are  going to pass H.R. 1 and H.R. 4 and have the John Lewis language become  law.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank the Congressional Black Caucus.
