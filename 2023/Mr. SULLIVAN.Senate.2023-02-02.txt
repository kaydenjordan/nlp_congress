 Mr. President, it is Thursday, and it has been a while  since I have been on the floor here on a Thursday afternoon, but it is  my favorite time of the week because I get to do something that I  certainly enjoy. We have a new set of pages here. I think they enjoy  it, and I know some in our media enjoy it because it kind of signals  the end of the week here. But it is when I get to talk about an  Alaskan--or Alaskans, plural--who are doing great stuff for our State  or their community or maybe even the country, somebody I refer to as  the Alaskan of the week. We have been doing this for, geez, quite some  time. I think 5 or 6 years, going on that. We have covered a lot of  ground.   And before I talk about our two Alaskans of the week--special  Alaskans--I usually give an update about what is going on in the great  State of Alaska for anyone watching on TV. We have people back in the  Gallery. So we love that.   We always do a plug for Alaska. You have to get up there. Take a  vacation with your family. You will love it. You will have the vacation  adventure of a lifetime.   So I usually give an update of what has been going on. We have had an  intense winter, a lot of snow, particularly in Southcentral Alaska,  where I live. Schools have even been closed. That is very rare for our  State, to close schools because of winter or really cold weather, but  we have had both--some cold snaps, some warming--and much winter fun,  as you can imagine, if you love winter sports.   The winter solstice has already come and gone since my last ``Alaskan  of the Week'' and so have Christmas and the holidays. By the way, there  is no better place to spend Christmas than in Alaska, where a man named  Santa Claus--a good man, by the way--lives in North Pole, AK, and even  runs for Congress. You may have seen that news last year. He didn't  win, but he is a good guy. I know him well: Santa--Santa Claus--a  politician in North Pole, AK.   Now, our two Alaskans of the week are Frank Hughes and Lincoln Bean.  They are both Alaska Native leaders, longtime community leaders and  members of the organized village of Kake. Kake is a village of about  500 people in beautiful--gorgeous, actually--Southeast Alaska. So,  again, if you are visiting, you have to come to Southeast. But we are  such a big State that you have to go everywhere.   Now, Frank and Lincoln know what the holidays are about, which we  just celebrated, and because of their efforts, they and many others in  Kake got a very special early Christmas gift this year that I want to  talk to everybody about.   On November 18, both Frank and Lincoln were on a plane from Oregon  back home to Alaska. In the belly of the plane was a 40-gallon bin  locked with zip ties, filled with 25 precious Native objects, some  estimated to be up to 200 years old. And because of their efforts,  these precious, sacred objects and the spirits in them were coming home  once again and are now resting in Kake, where these objects belong.   Those items include baskets, a headdress, a replica of a canoe,  ceremonial paddles, and rattles used by Tlingit spiritual medicine men.  There was also a wooden mask, which would have been carved into a tree  in Kake as a territorial marker. Frank said the mask would have had to  have been cut out of the body of the tree to be removed.   These items were painfully and lovingly crafted by the village's  Tlingit ancestors generations ago, precious items that didn't belong to  others but were taken--in some cases, ripped from villages--without  even a thought of whom they belonged to. But like I said, now they are  home, and, according to Frank and Lincoln, both say that the spirits  within these sacred objects are also at home and at peace.   So who are Frank and Lincoln, and why did they think it was so  important to bring these items back to their village of Kake?   This is an effort, one of many, being taken across the country since  Congress passed the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation  Act in 1990. NAGPRA is the acronym. This congressional act requires any  public institution receiving Federal money, like colleges and museums,  to return indigenous human remains--yes, these institutions literally  have human remains--and cultural items to Tribes or descendants  throughout America, to Native communities, wherever possible.   Since then, many artifacts have been, and are continuing to be,  returned to Tribes in Alaska and in the lower 48. Still, it is a slog.  Many institutions, believe it or not, are not always cooperative--big  institutions, famous American institutions.   According to the National Park Service, remains from more than  108,000--let me say that number again--108,000 indigenous people and  more than 600,000 artifacts are known to be still held by museums,  universities, and Federal Agencies across the country. Think about  that. Your ancestors' bones are in a museum somewhere. Not acceptable.   My wife Julie is on the board of the Smithsonian's National Museum of  the American Indian and actually serves on the repatriation committee.  And the process can be tedious. But it is so important for the  communities who have had artifacts removed from their communities--or  remains, for goodness' sake--removed from their communities. It is so  important for these communities to be able to heal. It is certainly not  always easy to identify these objects, for the recipients to request  them, and then to get these objects back to where they belong. And it  takes work and determination and, literally, years, particularly for  small villages like Kake, which don't have a museum or a trained  curator. But Frank and Lincoln and others in the community had the will  and determination to make this happen. So a big shout-out to them. That  is why they are Alaskans of the week today.   They had a letter--and this is a university, by the way--George Fox  University in Newberg, OR, a private Christian college that reached out  to Kake--very cooperative, by the way--telling them they thought they  had some items that might belong to the village.   By the way, that is a great example of a university--an institution-- doing the right thing: helping, taking the initiative. It is unclear  exactly how the artifacts made their way a thousand miles to George Fox  University in Oregon in the first place. There were Quaker missionaries  in Alaska in 1891, and George Fox University was founded in 1891 by the  Quakers. So Frank and Lincoln think there is probably a pretty good  chance that there is some connection between the missionaries and the  artifacts.   And the process, as I mentioned, has taken a long time, starting back  in 2018, when Frank was the coordinator for NAGPRA and Lincoln was a  council member. As a coordinator, Frank had done many indigenous  artifact repatriations across the country, but when the community  received the letter from George Fox University, they both got very  excited because this was their home village. Some of them, they  thought, might be artifacts from members of the Eagle and Raven clans  in Kake. These are Tlinget, Haida clans in southeast Alaska.   Now, a little bit about both of these great Alaskans. Frank is an  Army veteran. By the way, Alaska Natives--they are both Alaska Native  leaders--serve at higher rates in the U.S. military than any other  ethnic group in the country. Special patriotism, I refer to this as.  And Frank is a great example of that. You go to Native communities,  Native villages in Alaska, you ask to raise your hands for veterans,  and pretty much every male in the village, in communities I have been  to raise their hand. It is unbelievable, the patriotism and service of  guys like Frank. He spent his career serving his country. When he got  out of the Army, he worked as a substance abuse counselor, as an EMT,  served on his village council, and continued serving by being the  [[Page S222]]  commander of the veterans of Kake, his village, and making sure his  Alaskan Native veterans got the care and benefits they have earned.   Lincoln also spent his career helping his fellow Alaskans in his  community. He has been a tenacious advocate for self-determination and  for healthcare for Alaska Natives, particularly Alaska Native veterans.  He did an amazing job. And I saw him in action for many years as chair  of the Alaskan Native Health Board, which is an extremely important  organization for our whole State, where he did a great job leading that  for healthcare for all Alaska Natives. So that is a little bit about  Frank and Lincoln's background.   As I mentioned, in 2018, they get this letter. Wow. We have a great  opportunity here to get artifacts from their village back home. They  got involved, undertook the very tedious process of reaching out,  writing grants. And by the time they were ready to go, COVID hit. So,  of course, that set them back and everybody back. They had to wait.   Finally, the two, as we were coming out of COVID, reenergized their  efforts. They took a plane from Kake to Juneau, Juneau to Seattle,  Seattle to Portland, where they went to George Fox University.   By the way, as I mentioned, it was very, very gracious, very  respectful. They actually held a ceremony at the university. The  university wanted these items to be returned. They knew it was the  right thing to do. It was an emotional experience for all.    So they started to bring back the objects, the artifacts. This is how  Frank described it. When he was there, when the box of items that had  been in storage at the university for about 100 years was put in front  of him, he said:         It was like running into an air-conditioned room. And then       when they opened up the box [with the artifacts and objects       from our village, it was like] the sun hit them, it was like       spirits hitting me in the face.    ``Can you feel the spirits?'' he asked other people gathered in the  room.   Lincoln said that he could feel it, particularly when they opened the  boxes of the rattles that belonged to his family--imagine that  feeling--and his clan, the Eagle Clan, with the Killer Whale House.  Lincoln said:         It was like looking directly back at my family's heritage.    He said he felt a certain wholeness when he saw the items. A piece of  his culture and that of his community that had been missing for so long  was now back. When they got back to Kake, a crowd was there to greet  them. They sang greetings songs. They ate traditional food.   And then, as per the guidelines, Frank filled out the last  paperwork--you always have paperwork when you are dealing with the  Feds--and put his hand up and said: I am relieved of duty. I got it  done.   Lincoln's next project is to build a Tribal house along with a  wellness center where these and all the artifacts and art can live in a  temperature-controlled room so the spirits he was talking about can be  there--set free, back home to pass down the wisdom to the next  generation.   As Lincoln said:         It's powerful looking back on people we know that were here       before us--as a family, as a tribe--and it's tangible, we can       touch it.    And now they are back home. Because of their efforts, Frank and  Lincoln and the whole community in Kake can now experience this power.  They can touch it.   So to my friends, Frank and Lincoln, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year  to Kake. Thank you for the great job you have done--the determination-- and congratulations once again on being our Alaskans of the Week.    Mr. President, yesterday, as some of my colleagues may  know, the Federal Government issued the final Supplemental  Environmental Impact Statement on what is called the Willow Project in  Alaska. This is a very large oil and gas development in my State. It  has been in permitting for about 20 years--20 years. That is a whole  other topic. We don't need 20 years to do anything in terms of  permitting.   But I want to first begin by thanking several of my Senate  colleagues, particularly a number of my Democratic Senate colleagues  who have been reaching out to the Biden administration and saying: Hey,  you guys need to move this Willow Project forward, for reasons I am  going to talk about.   By the way, I am going to talk about this a lot for the next 30 days  here on the floor. It is so important to my State, my constituents, but  to America. But I want to begin by thanking so many of my Senate  colleagues--a big number of them. I am not sure they all want to be  recognized. So I won't recognize any of those. Senator Manchin put a  statement out on this yesterday. But a number of them--especially my  Democratic colleague friends--reached out over the last several weeks  of the Biden administration saying: Hey, it is time; it is time. This  is good for Alaska, good for America, good for our environment.   So I want to talk a little bit about this. As I mentioned, I will be  down here talking a lot about this because it is so darned important to  Alaska and, I would argue, America.   This project, as I mentioned, has been under some kind of regulatory  review since ConocoPhillips got the leases from the Federal Government  during the Clinton administration, the late 1990s. Again, something  that people always forget: This is a lease from the Federal Government  to the private sector. They paid hundreds of millions of dollars for  these leases. We are in a contract with the Feds saying we are going to  explore and then develop.   It is also in what is called the National Petroleum Reserve of  Alaska, NPRA. It is not a controversial area, unlike ANWR--we recognize  that--or some of the offshore developments. This is the National  Petroleum Reserve of Alaska. This was set aside by Congress, this body,  I think almost 70 years ago. It used to be called the Naval Petroleum  Reserve of Alaska. For what? For developing identifying oil and gas,  which our country needs--still needs. It is going to need it for  decades to come.   So the review process has been going on for years. Every  environmental review, this project advances with flying colors. I will  get to that. The Trump administration finished the permitting with a  record of decision in 2020. They approved five drilling pads. The Biden  administration, after some court delays--and to be honest, after delays  from the Biden administration--came back, finally, with a supplemental  final EIS and said: We are going to go from five pads down to three.   All right. That is not what I would have preferred. But these are the  career people. And they think that this can be developed with this new  plan. We would agree. But that is a bare minimum. There were some  indications yesterday that the administration is still looking at maybe  less. We have 30 more days to review this. And they are looking at  maybe less pads.   Well, we have all stated--the private sector companies stated: Hey,  anything less than this, you are essentially killing it, because you  can't make this an economically viable project.   So let me just give a little bit of a background on this because it  is so important, and then I want to make a few points that relate to  the voices that need to be heard as it relates to the Willow project.   We could start building this tomorrow. This is clearly a shovel-ready  project. We only build, in Alaska, projects like this in the winter  because we have such high environmental standards, the highest in the  world. We build ice roads, ice paths so we don't disrupt the tundra,  and we only, generally, build from January to April. The Conoco team is  ready. Estimates are 2,500 jobs--2,500 jobs. Could we use that in  America? Could we use that in Alaska? Darn right we could.   By the way, the estimate is 75 percent of those jobs will be union  jobs, building trade jobs. That is why the laborers--pretty much every  major union in the country--has viewed this as one of their top  priorities, not just for Alaska, for America.   Revenues are about $17 billion for Federal, State, and local  governments--$17 billion. America, Alaska, the North Slope Borough  could all use that.   Racial equity, racial justice. I come down here and speak a lot about  why resource development in Alaska is so important because it mostly  happens in the rural communities in my State where people, primarily  indigenous people, don't have the things that the  [[Page S223]]  average American takes for granted, like running water, like flushed  toilets, like gymnasiums, like health clinics, let alone hospitals. So  Alaska Natives in Alaska, over the last 25 years, have had an explosion  in life expectancy. It increased by almost 13 years, more than any  other part of America by far. They are living longer. That is a big  indicator of policy success. Are your constituents living longer? My  constituents are living a lot longer. Why? Because of projects like  this. You get jobs; you get revenues; and you start to get things that  the average American thinks that every American citizen has. In a lot  of our rural communities in Alaska, we don't.   When you want to talk about racial equity and racial justice, this  should be No. 1--No. 1. I am going to get to it. The Native communities  in my State are 100 percent behind this project.   For that reason, let me talk about another benefit, the environment.  This will be the lowest greenhouse gas-emitting project of an energy  project of this size, of any project like this in the world--in the  world. If we need oil and gas, which the Biden administration's Energy  Information Agency says we will need for decades to come and the  International Energy Agency in Paris says we are going to need oil and  gas for decades to come, wouldn't you want to produce it in the place  with the highest environmental standards? The answer is yes. Wouldn't  you want to produce it with those 2,500 American jobs--good jobs--that  pay a real high wage? The answer is yes. Wouldn't you want to do it in  a way that really promotes environmental justice and racial equity by  helping indigenous people in their communities with jobs, with  revenues, with services that most people take for granted? The answer  is yes.   This project, at peak production, will be about 200,000 barrels a  day. That is a lot of oil, but you are going to be able to do it  without barely any new infrastructure--as I mentioned, five pads or  three pads--and it is right next to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline that is  two-thirds empty. You plug it in there, and it flows down to America.   You think we need energy? We need energy. One thing I have said to  the Biden administration, which makes no sense at all, is why would the  President go to Saudi Arabia on bended knee asking for more oil? Why  would this administration go to Venezuela--Maduro, a terrorist--and  lift sanctions on Venezuela, which has some of the most dirty,  polluting energy projects anywhere in the world, so we can import more  oil into America from Venezuela and from Saudi Arabia, when we can get  it from Alaska with our workers, our high environmental standards-- highest in the world--our Native people? These are all the reasons why  this makes sense.   These are the reasons why--again, thank you to my colleagues, so many  of my Democratic colleagues. All my Republican colleagues are, of  course, supportive, but they don't have the sway with the Biden  administration. This is why everybody here--with the exception of a  few, and I will just name one because I can't help but name him--are  for this. In terms of energy security--and I know the Presiding Officer  follows this--which countries fear American energy dominance more than  anything? Read the intel. It is Putin in Russia. They are worried about  projects like this. It is Xi Jinping in China. They are scared to death  of American energy dominance. And it is the people in the Middle East.  I was just there on a codel with six Republican and Democratic  Senators--in the Middle East. The Presiding Officer was going to come  with us. We really missed him. He couldn't make it. Our National  Security Advisor was there. We had breakfast with him. He knows all  about this project, by the way. The Biden administration's national  security teams--Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, National  Security Advisor--they think this is a no-brainer.   Of course, we need more energy. Imagine what we can do if you are  going into a meeting with the, say, Saudis or Emirates saying: By the  way, we just approved a project that will be 200,000 barrels a day for  America with the highest standards in the world. That is power. That is  still power. We need all the above. I want all kinds of energy-- renewables, wind, solar--but we are still going to need oil and gas. If  we do, let's get it from us, not our enemies.   This announcement came--like I said, three pads is not great, but we  can work with it. BLM put out a pretty good statement. The Department  of the Interior put out a statement. They didn't quote anybody, which  was very strange. It was a headless Department of the Interior  statement that kind of indicated maybe they are going to kill this  project in 30 days. That is very troubling.   Our delegation has asked for a meeting with the President to finally  pitch him on this. I pitched President Biden on this before. At the  time, he was very supportive so it will be hard to walk it back.   Here is my issue. I just want to make a couple of final points. The  media coverage on this--to our friends in the media, I am going to  ask--look, I interview with the media all the time. I talk with anybody  who has issues, but it was remarkable. Go read the articles yesterday  on the Willow project. They quote every far-left radical environmental  group in America, none of whom, by the way, live in Alaska. The list is  very long. They are calling this a horrible project. It is the highest  standards in the world, there is no doubt about it. They are just  saying apoplectic things about this project.   So yesterday's press quoted all these voices who are all negative. By  the way, they don't want to build anything. They don't want to have one  additional energy project in America. They don't; ask them. You don't  want energy from Alaska? You would rather get it from Venezuela, 18  times more polluting than an American project? When you ask them that  question--trust me, I have asked that question a lot--they never have  an answer. They don't know what to say. They just say: We hate all oil  and gas.   Guess what. We need it. Let's do it here.   Here is my point. This is a list of just some groups that need to be  heard. Next time my colleagues--my friends in the media write a story-- go ask all the unions. Laborers' International, the biggest  construction union in America, LIUNA, led by a great American, Terry  O'Sullivan, put another statement out. He has been writing letters once  a month. This is one of our biggest projects for the laborers, the  building trades, all the unions that build stuff--a giant coalition.  Sean McGarvey, another great American is head of the building trades.  They put out a huge statement. They have been putting out statements on  Willow for years. Did any of our great media in America quote the  unions yesterday? No. They quote the Center for Biological Diversity  and all these other far lefties, but the men and women who build stuff  weren't quoted at all. This is one of their biggest priorities in  America right now, 100 percent.   The group that they really did not quote at all--and this is  troubling to me--is all the Alaska Native leaders and Alaska Native  Tribes and Alaska Native elected leaders in this part of Alaska. There  are dozens of them. I was down here and gave a speech a few months ago  with all the letters from all these different groups. You know what  they do? They love to pick the one person in Alaska who is against them  and quote that person.   My ask of the media is next time you write about Willow and the Biden  administration, when you are looking for the people who really know how  this matters to their State, quote some of these incredible groups--the  ANCSA Regional organization, the city of Wainwright, the North Slope  Borough, the Native village of Barrow, the Voice of the Arctic, which  is a grouping of different Native groups on the Arctic. Here is what  they said. Here are a few. This is from the Inupiat leaders of the  Alaska's North Slope:         The Administration cannot proclaim to support meaningful       tribal consultation and environmental justice while at the       same time killing a critical resource that supports . . . the       Inupiat communities of the North Slope region.    The Native Alaskans want this. This is the Alaska Federation of  Natives. That is the biggest Native group organization that represents  all Natives in Alaska: Southeast, North Slope, Interior. They are huge  supporters of this--every group.   My friends in the media, go ask them, quote them. Don't go to  Greenpeace out of New York City or  [[Page S224]]  San Francisco. Quote the Alaska Native people who live there.   I will make two final points. As you can tell, this is very important  to me. You know we have a couple of Members of Congress--I forget this  one guy's name from Arizona--Grijalva, I think. He was saying the  Alaskan people don't want it; Alaska Natives don't want it. He said  that yesterday. He has a new member on his committee, Mary Peltola,  Congresswoman from Alaska, who is an Alaska Native. Maybe you should  ask Mary what she thinks about this project instead of spouting off on  an issue.   Unfortunately, I have one colleague here--I am not going to get into  it. He knows who he is. He makes it his life's work to go after Alaska,  including this one. I will give a speech later on the hypocrisy of that  action.   I want to just quote the voice of the Arctic Inupiat, a group of  Native leaders. Here, they sum up what happened yesterday, what the  media kind of highlighted while, literally, canceling the voice of the  people in Alaska. Here is what they say:         Outside activist groups opposing Willow have drowned out       local perspectives--    That is what happened in the press reports yesterday.       and are actively working to supersede the views of the Alaska       Native people. This is not environmental justice or any other       kind of justice.    When you put that back to a Biden administration official and say:  You guys care about environmental justice, racial justice, racial  equity that you talk about all the time, what about my constituents?  Every time I have asked that question of a Biden administration  official, they look at me blank: Hmm, I don't know how to answer that.   The indigenous people of my State want this project, undeniably. Our  friends in the media won't write that story.         It is a direct attack on Alaska Native self-determination.    This is the voice of the Arctic Inupiat. Like I said, I am going to  be coming down here talking about this because it is really important  for my State and really important for America.   A final point, too. I frequently make the argument--some of my  Democratic colleagues don't like it--you know, on these kinds of  issues, the Democratic Party that used to be for the working men and  working women of America, the people who build things, kind of  migrated, kind of left the working men and women out. If the far-left  environmental groups want something, they almost always go with them,  not the working men and women of America.   This will be a test for the administration. You say you want to  support the working men and women and the Indigenous people in my  State? This is an easy answer--easy answer. Look at the supporters.   So I hope we can get there. Thirty days is going to be a battle, but  I hope our friends in the media, when they are writing about this in  the next few weeks, don't cancel the voices of Alaskans, don't cancel  the voices of the Alaskan Native people, the Indigenous people. Hear  from them. I know you have a bias against a project like this, but  listen to the people I represent. They are great people, and they are  very clear that they are supporting the Willow project, as am I, as is  Senator Murkowski, as are, by the way, a lot of my colleagues in a  bipartisan way. I thank them again. This is going to be really  important. And it doesn't just matter to Alaska; it matters to America.   I yield the floor.
