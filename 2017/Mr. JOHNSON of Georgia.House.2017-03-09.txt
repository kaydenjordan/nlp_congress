 Mr. Speaker, since November's election, it  seems that there have been a rise in incidents of hate crimes in this  country. This wave of hate crimes has spread fear and anxiety in  communities of different faiths, ethnicities, and cultures across this  country. On Tuesday, multiple Jewish community centers, schools, and  organizations across the Nation, including in Atlanta, received  anonymous bomb threats. This follows a wave of over 120 threats against  Jewish community centers across America as well as the senseless  desecration of graves at Jewish cemeteries countrywide.   I suspect, Mr. Speaker, that these are not unrelated incidents of  juvenile delinquents. This is rank, organized anti-Semitic activity. It  is systematic and organized activity meant to terrorize Jews in  America. This comes at a time when Islamophobia is taking root and  spreading across America. Mosques are being burned to the ground,  Muslim children are being bullied at school, and Muslim women are  subjected to having attackers snatching their hijabs from their heads  as they walk the streets.   The President's Muslim ban is payback on the pledge he made to his  supporters during the campaign. Meanwhile, in February, a 32-year-old  Indian man was shot and killed, another was wounded, and a third man  who intervened was shot and wounded by a gunman shouting ``Get out of  my country.''                                time  1045    Again, on March 3, a Sikh man was shot in Seattle by an attacker  yelling, ``Go back to your country.'' At that time, the attacker had a  mask on. During these incidents, our President has remained  uncharacteristically silent on these attacks. His silence comes after  his anti-Mexican, anti-Muslim, and anti-Obama campaign sparked American  White nationalists to feel emboldened.   This is a dangerous and slippery slope that we are on, ladies and  gentlemen. It must end, and it must end now. As Dr. King once said:  ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' We must  protect all communities that have come under assault.   Today I introduce the Reaffirming DHS' Commitment to Countering All  Forms of Violent Extremism Act of 2017 to ensure that countering  violent extremism funds within the Department of Homeland Security are  used to tackle the rise of rightwing extremism, which threatens the  safety of us all here in America.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from  Maryland for yielding me the time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 725, the so-called  Innocent Party Protection Act of 2017. This cynically misnamed bill is  a Republican Party effort to coddle and protect their corporate  wrongdoing supporters by making it harder for injured victims to sue  the corporation in State court. A more accurate name for the Innocent  Party Protection Act actually would be the Corporate Wrongdoer  Protection Act.   Make no mistake about it, Mr. Chairman, this bill is my Republican  friends' attempt to--it is clear whom they are working for. They refer  to corporate wrongdoers as innocent parties. If some day you or your  loved one are injured or harmed due to the negligence or intentional  act of others, you have the option to sue in State or Federal court  based on the residence of the wrongdoers. However, if your case should  be removed to Federal court upon a motion by one of the defendants, as  a plaintiff, there are grounds upon which you could have the case  remanded back to the State court.   Republicans want to call this fraudulent joinder. However, a decision  to sue all of the wrongdoers in your State court is not fraud. Instead,  it is a legal practice dating back over 100 years which provides  balance and prevents more powerful interests from choosing which court  the case can be heard. They want to stack the deck.    For example, if it was your grandmother who was physically neglected  or sexually assaulted at a nursing home, you would not only seek  criminal charges against the wrongdoer, but you would want to file a  lawsuit against both the individual attacker and the company that  negligently hired, trained, or failed to adequately supervise the  perpetrator under their employ.   By the way, it is becoming increasingly common for nursing homes to  be owned by large conglomerates or out-of-State hedge funds. Under  current law, you have the right to sue in State court, but rather than  going all the way to Federal court in the State the corporation is  based, you have the option to stay near your home in State court. H.R.  725 would do away with that option by giving the corporate wrongdoer  the ability to keep the case in Federal court, thus unfairly increasing  the burden on innocent victims and making it less likely for the  smaller party to sue in the first place.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to oppose this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R.  985, a monster of a bill, combining the anticonsumer Fairness in Class  Action Litigation Act and the antivictim Furthering Asbestos Claim  Transparency Act.    H.R. 985 has the same goals and objectives as the bill that just  slithered out of this body just a few moments ago, the so-called  Innocent Party Protection Act, which more appropriately should be  called, the Corporate Wrongdoer Protection Act.   H.R. 985 is part of a wave of anticonsumer corporate wrongdoer  protection bills being considered this week by this Republican- controlled Congress. The purpose of these bills is to protect and  insulate big corporations from being held accountable when they rob,  hurt, and maim everyday Americans struggling to make it here in  America.   As a former and long-term Member of the House Armed Services  Committee, I would like to first remind this body of Susan Vento and  Judy Van Ness, brave widows, who joined us during the Judiciary  Committee markup of the FACT Act and shared with us the heartbreak  asbestos exposure has caused their families.   Susan is the widow of our late colleague, Congressman Bruce Vento.  Judy's husband, Richard, was a Navy veteran, who served this country  with distinction. Both men saw their lives tragically cut short--Bruce  at 60 and Richard at 62--both by mesothelioma.   Georgia is ranked 23rd in the Nation for mesothelioma and asbestos- caused deaths, in part due to the large number of military operations,  facilities, and military industrial complex projects throughout the  State. Virtually every ship commissioned by the U.S. Navy between World  War II and the Korean war contained several tons of asbestos in the  engine room insulation, fireproof doors, and miles of pipes. While the  military discontinued asbestos products around 1980, hundreds of  military and civilian installations were left with asbestos in the  flooring and ceiling tiles, cement foundations, as well as in thousands  of military vehicles.                                time  1615    After defending our freedom abroad, many veterans returned to the  civilian workforce where they were further exposed to asbestos, people  such as Richard Van Ness, who suffered asbestos exposure while on a  Navy destroyer and during his career as a union pipefitter.  Unfortunately, veterans like Richard comprise over 30 percent of all  asbestos-caused mesothelioma deaths, despite making up only 8 percent  of the Nation's population.   Eighteen veterans' groups, including the Military Order of the Purple  Heart, AMVETS, and the Vietnam Veterans of America, these organizations  have expressed their strong opposition to this bill. I include a letter  from them in the Record.   [[Page H1978]]                                                   February 14, 2017.      Re Veterans Service Organization oppose the ``Furthering           Asbestos Claims Transparency (FACT) Act''.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington           DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington DC.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, House Judiciary Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. John Conyers,      Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader McCarthy, Leader Pelosi, Whip       Hoyer, Chairman Goodlatte, and Ranking Member Conyers: We,       the undersigned Veterans Service Organizations oppose the       ``Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency (FACT) Act.'' We       have continuously expressed our united opposition to this       legislation via written testimony to the House Judiciary       Committee, House Leadership, in-person meetings and phone       calls with members of Congress. It is extremely disappointing       that even with our combined opposition, the FACT Act will be       marked up in the House Judiciary Committee later this week.        Veterans across the country disproportionately make up       those who are dying and afflicted with mesothelioma and other       asbestos related illnesses and injuries. Although veterans       represent only 8% of the nation's population, they comprise       30% of all known mesothelioma deaths.        When our veterans and their family members file claims with       the asbestos bankruptcy trusts to receive compensation for       harm caused by asbestos companies, they submit personal,       highly sensitive information such as how and when they were       exposed to the deadly product, sensitive health information,       and more. The FACT Act would require asbestos trusts to       publish their sensitive information on a public database, and       include how much money they received for their claim as well       as other private information. Forcing our veterans to       publicize their work histories, medical conditions, majority       of their social security numbers, and information about their       children and families is an offensive invasion of privacy to       the men and women who have honorably served, and it does       nothing to assure their adequate compensation or to prevent       future asbestos exposures and deaths.        Additionally, the FACT Act helps asbestos companies add       significant time and delay paying trust claims to our       veterans and their families by putting burdensome and costly       reporting requirements on trusts, including those that       already exist. Trusts will instead spend valuable time and       resources complying with these additional and unnecessary       requirements delaying desperately needed compensation for our       veterans and their families to cover medical bills and end of       life care.        The FACT Act is a bill that its supporters claim will help       asbestos victims, but the reality is that this bill only       helps companies and manufacturers who knowingly exposed       asbestos to our honorable men and women who have made       sacrifices for our country.        We urgently ask on behalf of our members across the nation       that you oppose the FACT Act.            Signed:        Air Force Association; Air Force Sergeants Association; Air       ForceWomen Officers Associated; AMVETS; AMSUS, the Society of       Federal Health Professionals; Association of the United       Statse Navy; Commissioned Officers Associatuion of the US       Public Health Service, Inc.; Fleet Reserve Association;       Jewish War Veterans of the USA; Military Officers Association       of America; Military Order of the Purple Heart of the U.S.A.;       National Defense Council; Naval Enlisted Reserve Association;       Non Commissioned Officers Association of the United States of       America; The Retired Enlisted Association, USCG; Chief Petty       Officers Association; US Army Warrant Officers Association;       Vietnam Veterans of America.    The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    I thank the gentleman, and I would ask my  colleagues to join me and the distinguished members of those 18  veterans' organizations and oppose this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 8, line 21, insert after ``Civil Procedure.'' the       following (and amend the amendment to the table of contents       on page 9 after line 3 accordingly):       ``Sec. 1724. Applicability         ``Sections 1716 through 1723 shall not apply in the case of       any civil action alleging fraud.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment ensures the draconian class action rules  created by H.R. 985 do not apply to cases alleging fraud.   Corporate malfeasance and fraudulent practices are an ongoing problem  facing American consumers. We saw this firsthand with the recent Wells  Fargo case. In response to the company creating over 2 million phony  bank and credit card accounts, thousands of account holders certified  as a class to hold Wells Fargo accountable in court. However, under  H.R. 985's new requirements, this class action would have been stopped  dead in its tracks at the certification phase. This is because the bill  does not clearly define exactly how similar the scope and how similar  the type of injury a class member must suffer. Since each individual  Wells Fargo account holder endured varying degrees of financial harm  from the company's unauthorized actions, it is unclear if the victims  would be considered a class under these new rules.   The Volkswagen Dieselgate scandal is another example of a fraud case  that would be at risk under these new rules. The German company  defrauded thousands of consumers by selling cars that did not meet EPA  emissions standards. The cars were, instead, fitted with illegal defeat  software, which allowed them to pass routine emissions tests while  still producing up to 35 times the legal limits of nitrogen oxides. A  new MIT study found that the excess emissions generated by these cars  between 2008 and 2015 will cause 1,200 premature deaths in Europe and  60 in the United States. This is in addition to the thousands of  consumers who faced financial loss because they owned these defective  vehicles that they could not trade in or sell.   As part of the class action settlement, consumers were able to recoup  their losses through a buyback program. As currently drafted, H.R. 985  would have made such a settlement unlikely because of the restrictions  on cases involving financial injuries.   Finally, we have the notorious and infamous Trump University class  action. Class certification was granted for the thousands of students  who were hurt by the President's allegedly fraudulent for-profit  scheme. Over 7,000 students were eligible for the class action because  they were cheated into thinking they would become the next big real  estate mogul. Instead, students lost thousands of dollars and wasted  valuable time at this joke of a school.   To avoid any admission of wrongdoing or face an embarrassing trial,  the President and the now-defunct Trump University opted for a $25  million settlement. Because of the impossible certification  requirements in H.R. 985, it is safe to assume that Trump University's  lawyers would have had a field day dismantling this class action from  the very beginning of the litigation.   Earlier this week, it was reported in The New York Times that one of  the students is opting out of the settlement, and if this bill passes,  the risk will be that the class action could fall apart to the benefit  of President Trump.                                time  1715    Knowing how litigious our President is, this outcome is highly  likely, as H.R. 985 applies not just to future cases but, suspiciously,  pending ones as well--an almost unheard of clause to include in  legislation.   We cannot allow corporations, whether foreign or domestic, whether  controlled by an unnamed board or by the President of the United  States, to defraud consumers without facing accountability. My  amendment looks to protect Americans in such cases and allows them to  move forward in the courts as part of a class action.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, protecting big, multinational  corporations from fraud claims is not only unfair, it is odious. If you  can't hold a big, multinational corporation accountable for fraud, then  your money is at risk, your health is at risk, and the lives of  innocent people are at risk.   Mr. Chairman, I ask that all of my colleagues support this amendment,  which protects the American people from fraud.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will  be postponed.                    Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Conyers    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6  printed in part B of House Report 115-29.
