 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute  to Shirley Parker Curry, a passionate civic and community leader,  dancer, ballet instructor, and loving friend from Jenkintown, who  passed away on October 30.   It is bittersweet, yet beautifully fitting, to be honoring Shirley's  life in this season of elections--especially this time of year. We miss  her wisdom,  [[Page H5656]]  work ethic, and that determined twinkle in her eye.   Shirley was a lifelong activist, steadfast in her ideals and  committed to democracy and good governance.   In 1960, Shirley spearheaded support for John F. Kennedy's campaign,  alongside my mother-in-law, Joan Cunnane. There was a group of about a  dozen who called themselves the ``Kennedy Girls.''   Because of Shirley, the Democratic community has grown large and  vibrant. I wouldn't be where I am today if it were not for Shirley  asking me over and over: Run, Madeleine, for something. Many in  Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, say the same.   We are better because of Shirley. Her legacy, and the legacy of her  beloved husband, Representative Larry Curry, will live on in Jenkintown  and Cheltenham.   God bless her family; her children, Jennifer, Jeffery, and Jacquelyn;  her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren. God bless Shirley Curry.                            ____________________
