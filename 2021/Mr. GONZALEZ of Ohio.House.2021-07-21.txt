 Mr. Speaker, after postponing 1 year due to the  COVID-19 pandemic, I am excited that, on Friday, the Olympic Games in  Tokyo will officially begin.   What better way to mark this occasion than by recognizing the  incredible accomplishment of Katie Nageotte, who will be one of the  many Olympians competing in this year's summer games.   A native of Olmsted Falls, Katie is a graduate of Olmsted Falls High  School and Ashland University who will be representing our community  and country in this summer's games, competing in the women's pole vault  event.   Her victory at the U.S. trials in the women's pole vault event caps a  5-year campaign to reach the Olympic Games, and she joins an elite list  of northeast Ohioans to qualify for the games.   I am incredibly proud of Katie for earning this opportunity to  represent not only our community but the United States.   Congratulations to Katie and her family. We look forward to watching  her make northeast Ohio proud.                            ____________________
