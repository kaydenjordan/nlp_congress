 Mr. Speaker, since the Republicans in Washington have  not held a single public hearing on TrumpCare, I asked my constituents  directly for feedback at a Maine healthcare townhall. Not one of the  hundreds of constituents spoke in support of the legislation. Instead,  many said they will be among the millions of Americans who will lose  their coverage under this bill.   One of those voices was Ed Saxby of Cape Elizabeth, pictured on the  board next to me. Ed stood beside his wife and granddaughter as he  bravely spoke about his own battle with cancer. He said that the odds  of survival are against him because TrumpCare will take away the tax  credits he needs to afford healthcare coverage as a retiree living on a  fixed income.   Ed's wife, Jill, asked me if those who are championing TrumpCare  would be willing to trade places with those whom it will harm.   I pose that question today to my Republican colleagues. If you can't  answer in the affirmative, you should not be voting for this terrible  bill.                            ____________________
