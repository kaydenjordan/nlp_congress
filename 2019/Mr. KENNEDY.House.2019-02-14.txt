 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Senator  Harris Wofford, a giant in our Nation's history and a dear friend.   For decades, at every single inflection point in our Nation's march  towards equality, Senator Wofford stood proudly and strongly on the  side of justice and decency. But he wasn't one who could be confined  only to our shores. Before, during, and after his time in the United  States Senate, Harris sought out injustice around the world and asked  how he could help.   Not only is he an inspiration to any aspiring public servant, he has  been a close friend to generations of my own family. To his husband,  Mr. Charlton, his children, Susanne, Daniel, and David, and all of the  members of his family and friends who loved him so dearly, know that  our thoughts and prayers are with you and that Harris' memory and our  Nation will never forget.                            ____________________
