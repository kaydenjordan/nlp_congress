 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, for nearly 70  years now, the United States has led the Western alliance standing up  to first the Soviet Union and then Russia within the organization known  as NATO.   Whether the President of the United States was Democrat or  Republican, Truman, Kennedy, Reagan, Bush, Obama, it made no  difference. Standing up and supporting our Western European allies,  standing up and supporting NATO was an absolute given and, frankly, not  even a partisan issue. Yet under this President and this  administration, we now have, for the first time ever in the post-World  War II era, a real question about American commitment to NATO and to  the Western alliance.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Trump administration to follow the bipartisan  lead of the House Foreign Affairs Committee to support NATO and support  our Western allies. It has underpinned peace for 70 years.                            ____________________
