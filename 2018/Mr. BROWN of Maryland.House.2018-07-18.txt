 Mr. Speaker, President Trump had a  straightforward mission in Europe last week: stand with our NATO allies  and stand up to Russia's Putin. Instead, President Trump squandered  U.S. influence and abdicated our leadership by abusing and dividing our  allies and fawning over a tyrant who actively seeks to undermine our  democracy.   While Putin may not be dictating American policy, President Trump is  seemingly pushing forward his agenda. Putin wants to restore Russia as  a great global power at the expense of the United States. He wants to  expand Russian influence over Europe by weakening NATO and the European  Union. In Putin's mind, when the United States and Europe flounder,  Russia is stronger.   If Putin was calling the shots, he would have encouraged President  Trump to criticize NATO and raise doubts on whether we would defend our  allies if they haven't paid their bills. He would invite President  Trump to undermine the European Union, our largest trading partner and  investor, by lauding Brexit, denouncing trade, supporting  antidemocratic populists, and undermining Germany and Chancellor  Merkel. And that is exactly what happened.   Rather than projecting unity, President Trump's participation at the  NATO summit generated nonstop images of division. Substantive issues  received little or no attention.   Putin is the biggest winner from any disunity in NATO. During the  Cold War, American and NATO troops held the line in Europe, containing  and defeating the Soviet Union.   I served in Germany for 5 years at that time and witnessed firsthand  how we won the Cold War. But we didn't do it through military power  alone. We won because NATO military strength helped create the space  for democratic dissidents in Eastern Europe to come together and bring  down Soviet rule from within. This was the success of America's  strategy--pursued by Presidents from Roosevelt to Kennedy, to Reagan-- of advancing American values.   For seven decades, the NATO alliance has ensured that America's  strength and influence are magnified around the globe. Our alliance has  extended the promise of peace, security, and prosperity to much of the  democratic world, and it has maintained the inviolable promise of  collective defense.   America needed its allies after we were attacked on 9/11, and our  allies came through. They fought and died with us.   And threats to our collective security have not vanished in the 21st  century. These shared security challenges should have been at the top  of President Trump's agenda, but they weren't.   Since Putin's annexation of Crimea, NATO has found renewed purpose  and effectiveness, stepping up exercises and establishing the enhanced  forward presence in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.   Additional measures may be necessary to continue to confront Russian  aggression. This includes Secretary Mattis' 30-30 plan to establish the  readiness of 30 land battalions, 30 air fighter squadrons, and 30 ships  ready to deploy within 30 days of being put on alert; Poland's proposal  to bring more U.S. troops to the country and setting up a joint armored  division with 15,000 American troops, and as many as 250 tanks and  armored vehicles; and completion of the European missile shield by  2020. None of this was discussed.   Contrary to President Trump's declarations, NATO members have been  increasing defense spending since 2014: almost $46 billion, the biggest  buildup by U.S. allies in 25 years.   NATO is also expanding its training mission in Afghanistan and  launching a new one in Iraq, showcasing NATO's ongoing commitment to  the fight against terrorism. Yet President Trump chose to deride our  most important allies.   With as much passion as President Trump questions our European allies  as freeloaders, his actions suggest a desire for a cozy relationship  with Putin's Russia. Russia is one of our most aggressive adversaries,  working to rupture the relationship between the United States and our  closest partners, weaken our influence in the Middle East, and pose an  ongoing cyber threat.   Other than elevating Putin and failing to mention Russia's illegal  annexation of Crimea, what good did President Trump accomplish during  this summit? I have no answer as to why he, unlike any of his  Republican or  [[Page H6473]]  Democratic predecessors, is so unwilling to defend the interests of the  United States and our allies against Russia. All that is clear is that,  by embracing our adversaries and denigrating our allies, President  Trump is inviting grave and historic consequences for the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, today, I simply call on President Trump to unequivocally  affirm the United States' commitment to our European allies and to  condemn Russian aggression, meddling, and malign influence.                            ____________________
