 Madam President, I rise today to call for every  Senator to have the opportunity to cast their vote on the Military  Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act.   I started calling for this up-or-down vote since May 24, because I  knew--sexual assault survivor advocates knew--that if the Armed  Services Committee leadership had the chance, they would strip the  provision out of the NDAA behind closed doors, despite the overwhelming  support the bill has in both the Senate and House. That is exactly what  has just happened.   Time and time again, I have asked on this floor for the same  opportunity to have an up-or-down vote. Time and time again, I have  heard the same false promise that we would proceed under regular order  and that the will of the Members of this body would be respected.   I was told that ``the best way to move forward on this issue is to  ensure that all 26 members of the Armed Services Committee have their  voices heard and to consider this legislation in the course of the  markup of the fiscal year 2022 Defense bill,'' and that it was ``the  traditional means of making these decisions.''   I was assured that ``fulsome debate during committee markup of the  annual defense bill . . . is the hallmark of our committee. It ensures  that everyone's voice is heard.'' And here on this very floor, I heard  that ``all amendments offered by Senators on the committee will be  fully considered during the full committee markup'' and ``that is, in  fact, the tradition of the committee. If a Member wants a vote on  amendments, we will vote.''   So we took it to the committee, we had the fulsome debate, and we  voted. The Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act  was included in the Senate Armed Services' NDAA bill and passed out of  committee 23 to 3. That is a pretty decisive vote.   But despite all of the claims that we would follow regular procedure  and that everyone's voices would be heard, when the doors closed for  the conference, the story changed. Our votes were not respected. Our  voices were silenced. Those promises were broken. The House and Senate  Armed Services leadership gutted our bipartisan military justice  reforms, stripped them from the NDAA, and did a disservice to our  servicemembers and our democracy.   Committee leadership has ignored the will of a filibuster-proof  majority in the Senate and a majority of the House in order to do the  bidding of the Pentagon. This is an act of blatant disregard for the  servicemembers, veterans, and survivors who have fought for an  impartial and independent military justice system that is worthy of the  sacrifice they make every day for our country.   Committee leadership has also ignored President Biden, our Commander  in Chief's public support for moving felonies from the chain of command  and fallen short of even the limited reforms that Secretary of Defense  Austin called for that would have removed sex crimes from the chain of  command. Despite claims otherwise, the NDAA does not remove sex crimes  from the chain of command because the commander remains the convening  authority, a central role to the military justice system. Every single  court-martial will still begin with the words:         This court-martial was convened by order of the commander.    Commanders can still pick the jury, select the witnesses, and allow  servicemembers accused of crimes the option of separation from service  instead of facing a court-martial--a total denial of justice.   We know that removing convening authority from commanders is critical  to providing a system that is fair and perceived to be fair by the  servicemembers. To quote Secretary Austin's own panel:         The DoD's Office of the Special Victim Prosecutor structure       must be, and must be seen as, independent of the chains of       command of the victim and of the accused all the way through       the Secretaries of the Military Departments. Anything less       will likely be seen as compromising what is designed to be an       independent part of the military justice process, thus       significantly undermining this recommendation. . . . Finally,       because of the breadth and depth of the lack of trust by       junior enlisted Service members in commanders--    The IRC goes on--       it was determined that the status quo or any variation on the       status quo that retained commanders as disposition       authorities in sexual harassment, sexual assault, and related       cases would fail to offer the change required to restore       confidence in the system.    That was Secretary Austin's own panel.   The NDAA bill does not provide meaningful change to the status quo.  Our bill would provide it by moving serious crimes like sexual assault  out of the chain of command completely, putting them in the hands of  the most capable people in the military--those independent, impartial,  highly trained, uniformed prosecutors. That is a system our  servicemembers can trust. I know that because that is the reform that  survivors have asked for over and over and over again.   Since I started calling for this vote in May, we estimate that more  than 11,000 servicemembers will have been raped or sexually assaulted  and more will have been victims of other serious crimes. Two in three  of those survivors will not even report those crimes because they know  that under the current system, they are more likely to  [[Page S9024]]  face retaliation than to receive justice. It is clear we cannot wait  for committee leadership to recognize the importance of this reform.   Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader in  consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate Armed Services  Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1520 and the  Senate proceed to its consideration; that there be 2 hours of debate  equally divided in the usual form; and that upon the use or yielding  back of that time, the Senate vote on the bill with no intervening  action or debate.    I just want to thank the Senator from South Carolina  for his work and support in this area. He has worked with me in trying  to find common ground, and I appreciate that work very much. I just  want to respond to a couple of his concerns.   One of the reasons why we wanted to have a bright line at felonies is  because we didn't want to marginalize women in the armed services. If  you only remove a small number of crimes--just the 11 that are in this  bill--that disproportionately affects women servicemembers.   Oftentimes, there will be a belief that these changes are made to  give special treatment just to women servicemembers. The reason why  both Senator Joni Ernst and Senator Tammy Duckworth--two of the female  armed service veterans in the U.S. Senate from both the Democratic and  Republican Party--the reason they support this bill is because they  believe that if you put the bright line at felonies and treat all  servicemembers the same regardless of the crime, that you won't be  further marginalizing women servicemembers. They won't be perceived as  receiving special treatment. If they are being perceived as receiving  special treatment, that is being perceived as a pink court, and we  would like to avoid pink courts. We would like to avoid the perception  of special treatment.   We believe that if you are reforming the military justice system, as  Secretary Austin has said, that it needs to be unbiased, it needs to be  professionalized, and it needs to be independent of the chain of  command; that what is good for this set of crimes is good for all sets  of crimes, just as the IRC has recommended.   Second, we know that this type of system actually strengthens  commanders because it allows them to focus on winning wars and training  troops. This bifurcated system under the NDAA is going to leave  commanders without all authority to do what they would want to do and  just some authority, so there will be a lot of bureaucracy that will  take time and effort and may lead to undue command influence and  unintended consequences.   So a system that gives all that decisionmaking directly to trained,  independent military prosecutors is preferable and a commander-friendly  system. In fact, our allies chose to do a bright line at serious crimes  for this very reason. UK, Israel, Australia, Netherlands, Canada,  Germany--they did it specifically for both plaintiffs' and defendants'  rights, so they had an equal justice system for all parties, and they  allowed commanders to focus on commanding and doing the job of winning  wars and training troops.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record a list of the roles that still remain with the commander, this  larger list of what remains with the commander under this NDAA, as well  as a list of the offenses the NDAA takes out of the chain of command,  which is 11, versus our bill, which would have been 38, as well as an  analysis that this is a less commander-friendly bill in current form.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         JUDICIAL ROLES OF COMMANDERS IN THE MILITARY JUSTICE SYSTEM

                                          prostitution) ------------------------------------------------------------------------       NDAA Final Text Does Not Meaningfully Reform Military Justice   Commander retains convening authority under the NDAA, which means there  is no true independence. Survivors' lack of trust in the system and the                      perception of bias will continue         Table A below. Under the NDAA, the commander remains the       convening authority, a central role to the military justice       system. This is usually the same commander in the chain of       command of the accused and the survivor. Every single court-      martial will still begin with the words, ``This court-martial       was convened by order of the commander.'' Commanders will       still pick the jury, select the witnesses, and allow service  [[Page S9025]]       members accused of crimes the option of separation from       service instead of facing a court-martial.        Removing convening authority from commanders is critical to       providing a system that is fair and perceived to be fair by       survivors and the accused. Only one-third of survivors of       sexual assault in the military are willing to come out of the       shadows to report their crime, showing a clear lack of trust       in the system. 44% of survivors indicated they would have       been more likely to come forward if a prosecutor were in       charge of the decision over whether to move forward with       their case. With commanders retaining convening authority       under the NDAA text, the Special Trial Counsel (``STC'') will       still be necessarily reliant on the commander for the       prosecution of a case. The perception and reality of       commanders influencing the outcome will be unavoidable.        MJIIPA is the only provision that would empower impartial,       independent prosecutors to make the vital decisions necessary       for a criminal justice system shielded from systemic command       influence and other structural defects. It is the only system       that uses the UCMJ as it is designed to implement military       justice: empowering officers to execute convening authority.                     NDAA text is not commander friendly         Under the Special Trial Counsel program alone, there is a       lack of accountability for the system. Commanders remain in       charge as the convening authority, but their hands are tied       from making key decisions such as the referral of charges.       The STC has some of the decision-making authorities, such as       referral and the ability to make plea deals, but the       commander is ultimately responsible for creating the court-      martial, approving witnesses, etc. Thus, there is not one       figure who can be held accountable for the military justice       process. Just as it would be unfair to send a commander into       combat without all the tools at their disposal, it is unfair       to commanders to keep them in charge of the court-martial but       limit their decision-making in this way. Under MJIIPA,       commanders are allowed to focus on warfighting, training, and       taking care of service members while independent military       lawyers take over the military justice system for serious,       non-military crimes.        The STC program continues the risk of unlawful command       influence. Every year, appellate courts throw out convictions       for serious crimes because the commander oversteps their       bounds. If commanders are still in charge under the STC       program, but restricted in new ways, this will only increase       this risk.        Under the STC program in the NDAA text, the commander will       be unable to give non-judicial punishment (``NJP'') to the       accused for lower-level conduct. If the STC decides not to       prosecute, the commander will be unable to credibly impose       NJP. For example, if the STC gets a stalking case and decides       not to prosecute it, the commander may want to do non-      judicial punishment, but if the accused refuses, the       commander will be unable to send the case to court-martial.       That takes the teeth out of the NJP. The accused walks away       with no punishment.    NDAA text creates an even bigger judicial bureaucracy that will slow                         down justice for survivors         See Table B below. Some crimes will be prosecuted by       Special Trial Counsels while the majority of the crimes will       remain within the chain of command. The bifurcated system       will create complexity and unfairness due to different       processes for different crimes.        Under the NDAA text, responsibilities will be divided       between the commander, the Special Trial Counsel, the Service       Secretaries and the TJAGs (the head Judge Advocate of every       Service), which will add layers of bureaucracy, slowing the       process down and making it take even longer for survivors to       see justice.       NDAA language does NOT include all serious non-military crimes     (including sexual harassment and child endangerment), creating a            bifurcated, unequal system for survivors and accused         See Table B. The NDAA also fails to draw a bright line at       all serious, non-military crimes. That bright line is       critical, because it avoids creating so-called ``pink       courts'' focused solely on sex crimes, which only further       stigmatizes survivors--something survivors have specifically       asked us to avoid doing. Drawing that bright line also avoids       creating an inherent inequality in the military justice       system.        The crimes chosen for the STC program are seemingly random.       Although sexual assault and kidnapping are included, sexual       harassment (which was in both the House and Senate versions       of the NDAA), child endangerment, murder of a pregnant women,       and obscene mailing are not (to name a few). How does a       commander have more expertise on the prosecution of child       endangerment than an independent military prosecutor?        Every victim and every accused offender in these serious       cases should be treated equally and have access to a system       that is professional and unbiased. It is unrealistic and       untenable to leave these complex legal decisions to       commanders whose expertise relates to warfighting, not the       minutiae of the law.                      Other problems with the NDAA text         Implementing the requirement that the senior STC be an O-7       will take years because there are few generals or admirals       with significant litigation experience. There is a very       limited number of military lawyers in the ranks of Admiral       and General, and most, if not all, of them are generalists       rather than military justice experts. It will take years for       the services to develop the officers necessary to fill this       role. MJIIPA on the other hand allows O-6s to fill these       roles. There are sufficient O-6s with military justice       experience currently in the services.        Senator Gillibrand is calling for an up or down vote on MJIIPA         The process is broken: MJIIPA was included in the Senate       Armed Services NDAA bill and passed out of committee 23 to 3.       It has 66 cosponsors in the Senate and 220 in the House. And       yet without a vote or debate on the floor, this bipartisan,       bicameral bill was gutted from the NDAA.        MJIIPA and the new STC system can work well together, with       MJIIPA acting as the overall structure and STCs prosecuting       special victim cases.        A good overall explainer: https://www.justsecurity.org/ 79481/ndaa-a-missed-opportunity/   I yield the floor.
