 Mr. President, I want to express thanks for the leadership  of my colleagues from Texas and Massachusetts and for the work they  have done in this space, bringing more and more attention to something  that doesn't impact our daily lives until we need it most, when there  is often an emergency, as there was in New Mexico about 2 years ago,  when the world's attention was on our beautiful State and we suffered  the worst fires in our State's history.   Now, these were forest fires that received so much attention in our  State because they were started by the Federal Government. How, you  might ask. These were prescribed burns that went out of control.   Now, when cell phones were not working, when other methods of media  were not able to connect because powerlines were going down, it was one  local radio station, KNMX, an AM station in Las Vegas, NM, that was  streaming more and more news to volunteers coming in on their time off,  radio personalities ensuring that people would know what was happening  because they were being told to evacuate from their homes, folks  driving home from work in rural areas. As Senator Cruz points out, when  there is no news connectivity, no other information coming in, we  depend on AM radio.   I just don't understand why there is opposition to this. I was hoping  Senator Cruz and Senator Markey and I could come to the floor today to  celebrate the passing of this important legislation, not to sit and  listen to that objection.   Just to point this out, in local news reporting, predominantly  through AM radio, and in New Mexico because of the fires, we heard from  the FEMA Administrator--from Administrator Criswell--who said ``AM  radio is one of the most dependable ways that we can reach individuals  across this country to get warnings out there.''   We saw this play out firsthand in New Mexico, and, as we have been  reminded, this is not just a challenge in my State or in Texas or in  Massachusetts but in every one of the 50 States across the country. The  Federal Government should be doing more to make it easier for Americans  to access potentially lifesaving emergency broadcasts--plain and  simple.   With natural disasters happening every day in every State, I wanted  to clarify a few points, some of which I heard today.   One, I heard a claim that the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act will  force manufacturers of electric vehicles to completely redesign the  drivetrain. I heard a little bit about that today.   Here are the facts. The fact is that car companies have already  solved this engineering challenge. We have already heard of the number  of companies that have come forward. With the 20 letters that Senator  Markey sent out, 10 companies responded--Honda, Hyundai, Land Rover,  Kia, Lucid, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Stellantis, Subaru, and Toyota--that  they already figured this out. Brilliant engineers at those companies  figured this out.   Some of the folks who are objecting to this are flying rocket ships  and, I would argue, have some of the most talented engineers in the  world working for them. Challenge them to solve this challenge, as the  other 10 companies have. Sometimes, it just means insulating some cable  a little bit more, not because it impacts the vehicle but because there  might be a little bit of static coming in.   I would rather have a little static and receive the lifesaving  information than not even have access to it.   I have heard that the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act would increase  costs for new vehicles by thousands and thousands of dollars by these  vehicles. Well, again, 10 companies have already figured this out, and  they are making it happen.   But here is the concern that I have. I see access to AM radio as a  lifesaving feature--important information that we all depend on. I had  heard that seatbelts would be too costly when that was being put forth  as a requirement in vehicles to help save people's lives. When there  was a conversation about airbags saving people's lives, I heard and I  read that it was too expensive, that that shouldn't happen. We don't  need airbags in vehicles.    When we were all debating about the inclusion of backup cameras to  prevent the deaths of little kids in cars, there were many who were  saying: Oh, it is too expensive. It cannot be done.   I am very concerned that when it comes to moving this technology  forward that the same tired excuses are brought forward. This body has  a chance to be able to get this done, and I hope that we can see  something put on the floor here soon because more and more vehicles  getting on the road without AM radio are jeopardizing the lives and  safety of our constituents.   The last thing I will say is this--and this is about a conversation  with a small radio owner in New Mexico, out of Sante Fe, at KSWV. I was  speaking to him before I came down, and he was reminding me about the  core physics of electromagnetic spectrum around AM, and the Presiding  Officer touched on this. It is everywhere. As a matter of fact, KOB--a  station in Albuquerque, NM--touches a little more than half the State  with their broadcasts.   It is pretty incredible what this spectrum can deliver in our  communities. We should maximize the reach of emergency alerts over AM  radio and wireless networks. The physics and the electromagnetics of  this are plain and simple, and that is why I certainly hope that we can  get this done.   To the Senator from Texas, I have so much more to offer, and I was  going to offer it in the Record because the argument is strong; it is  compelling. We have got to get this done. I certainly hope that we will  see some floor time and get this done because it could mean someone's  life in our communities after not getting the information they need to  get out of their community or out of their home because a tornado or a  hurricane or a fire is on them.   No more excuses. Let's get it done.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
