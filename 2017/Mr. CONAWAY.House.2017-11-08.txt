 Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to acknowledge the  response of our communities and Federal agencies to the recent  hurricanes and wildfires. I would like to first offer my thoughts and  prayers to families affected by these tragedies.   The USDA and FNS play a vital role in providing supplemental  nutrition assistance when disasters occur by coordinating with State,  local, and voluntary organizations. Nothing is more important that  providing food when people find themselves suddenly, and often  critically, in need following disaster-related emergencies.   FNS has worked tirelessly to provide nutrition assistance to those  affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as the Western  Wildfires. Our fellow citizens in Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida,  Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, California, and Oregon have  received assistance including automatic mass replacement of benefits,  D-SNAP, free school meals, and waivers, ultimately ensuring people have  enough to eat in their time of need.   As Secretary Perdue has said, each disaster situation is unique. The  USDA and FNS have demonstrated their ability to respond to each of  these unique situations in a timely and effective way.   The challenges facing our communities ravaged by hurricanes and  wildfires are unprecedented. Getting food on the table in a timely  manner should not be an additional challenge. I want to recognize the  fortitude of our fellow citizens as they come together to rebuild after  such devastation as well as acknowledge the USDA's diligence in  addressing the nutrition-related needs of our fellow citizens.
