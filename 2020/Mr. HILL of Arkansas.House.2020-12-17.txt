 Mr. Speaker, as this year draws to a close, I  rise to commemorate the historic Abraham Accords.   After years of foreign policy experts saying it could not be done,  President Trump and his team have now brokered peace between Israel and  the Kingdom of Morocco, the fourth such agreement in just 4 months.   Because of these remarkable diplomatic accomplishments, we will seek  continued cultural, diplomatic, and economic visits and exchanges  between Israel and Bahrain, Israel and the Emirates, Israel and Sudan,  and, now, Israel and Morocco.   I believe that this represents a historic paradigm shift in the  region and gives momentum to ultimate peace between Israel and the  Palestinians.   Mr. Speaker, it has been more than 20 years since Israel signed peace  with the Kingdom of Jordan and more than 40 years since the historic  Camp David Accords and peace between Egypt and Israel.   Since those historic agreements, the United States' efforts to  further peace in the Middle East have stumbled and faltered, with  little to no significant progress shown. In fact, the situation for  Israelis has been more dangerous in recent years, with terrorist  attacks and rocket bombardments becoming a near regular occurrence.   Expanding diplomatic relations between Israel and these other nations  will be beneficial to pushing back against the Iranian mullahs,  Hezbollah, and other extremists in the region.   I look forward to the United States working together with Israel and  these new partners at the table to solve the crisis in Syria and to  counter the mullahs in Iran.   Mr. Speaker, many of us in Congress encourage the incoming Biden  administration to build on these historic positive developments and not  fall back into the failed Middle East policies of the past.                                time  1245                  Honoring the Life of Thomas Albert Parris     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  a great American, Thomas Albert Parris. He was 87 years old.   After joining the Air Force in 1948, at age 14, Mr. Parris was  stationed in Germany for 2 years, where he drove an ambulance and  became a medic. Mr. Parris continued to serve in that capacity at  various Air Force bases in the U.S. and abroad.   While stationed in the Azores, Mr. Parris assisted in delivering 395  babies. After retiring from military service, Mr. Parris owned several  gas stations, worked on nuclear submarines, became a private pilot, and  trained racehorses.   Most recently, he was recognized by the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma  and awarded the Cherokee Warrior Medal of Patriotism by Chief Chuck  Hoskin, Jr., and the Tribal council members.   I join Arkansans, Oklahomans, and all Americans in recognizing Mr.  Parris' years of service and honoring his remarkable life. I pray he  rests in peace.                 Honoring the Life and Legacy of Nicole Inman     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Nicole  Inman and her great memory, who, over the past many months, was  recognized by her friends, family, and colleagues as a warrior of hope.  Nicole recently lost her courageous battle with cancer. Many across  Arkansas are mourning her passing.   Nicole was the Bryant High School girls' soccer coach, who led the  program to its second Class 6A state championship in May 2019, the same  year she was awarded Coach of the Year by the United Soccer Coaches.  She was more than a coach and a teacher; she was an inspiration on and  off the field.   Nicole's faith was a cornerstone throughout her fight. With her  strong faith in God, she used her illness as an opportunity to minister  and inspire her players and students.   Nicole was also an incredible wife and mother. Her legacy will live  on through her team and her husband, Scott, and their four children:  Garrett, Ashton, Abbey, and Nathan.   She will be missed by her community. I offer prayers for comfort to  her family and condolences. Thank you for sharing her with our  community.                            ____________________
