 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Nurses Appreciation Week and to celebrate America's  hardworking and professional caregivers, our nurses.   National Nurses Week is celebrated annually from May 6 to May 12,  during which time was the birthday of Florence Nightingale, the founder  of modern nursing.   Now, more than ever, nurses deserve our collective gratitude. Our  country has faced unprecedented challenges in the wake of COVID-19, and  nurses across the country selflessly stood ready to assist their  communities and neighbors in need. They spend countless hours away from  their families and loved ones while placing themselves on the front  line of our national response to the pandemic.   Nursing is a science and an art, reserved for those among us who are  the most giving, caring, and passionate about helping others. Nurses  are there for major milestones in patient's lives, from birth of a  child to the challenges of an aging patient. Patients and family  members can count on their compassion, guidance, and care.   Mr. Speaker, I thank each and every nurse for the hard work they do.  Their contributions have not gone unrecognized, especially during some  our most trying times.                            ____________________
