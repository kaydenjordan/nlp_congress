 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  removing this arbitrary time limit for ratifying the equal rights  amendment.   I ask all my colleagues: Are we going to tell our mothers, our  sisters, daughters, nieces, and granddaughters that there is an  expiration date on equality? I hope that answer is no.   This pandemic has only worsened the inequality that women are facing,  especially women of color. Making the equal rights amendment a part of  our Constitution guarantees that men and women are truly treated equal  under the law.   Today, the House can send a clear message that we will not tolerate  sexual discrimination, that gender equality should be the law of the  land.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the  survivors of domestic and sexual violence.   It is completely unacceptable that we have allowed the Violence  Against Women Act to expire.   I am proud to have introduced two amendments that will strengthen  protections for our most vulnerable communities. The first amendment  will stop punishing children who have been sex-trafficked and have been  in contact with the criminal justice system. The pandemic has also  illustrated the urgency on what we need to do to make sure that we  reauthorize it.   Madam Speaker, as Americans, we have had to follow stay-at-home  orders, and it has increased the amount of abuse among those who could  not leave home. VAWA save lives. This isn't a Democrat or Republican  issue. It is justice and safety. It is time we get this done and  reauthorize.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include material on the subject of my Special Order in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, as a co-chair of the Democratic Women's  Caucus, I am pleased to lead this Special Order in celebration of  Women's History Month. Throughout March, we recognize the women  leaders, trailblazers, and pioneers who come before us.   We have chartered a path forward that will lift up and empower young  women and girls. The soul and moral compass of our Nation rests on the  shoulders of women throughout this history.   I am proud to fight every day so that we can improve the quality of  life for women and girls in Michigan and across this country.   As the co-chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus and the vice chair  of the Congressional Black Caucus, I have made it a mission to put  women issues and Black women issues front and center in this Congress.   But before I go into the work that we have done and are doing in this  Chamber, I want to recognize the inspirational women in my life who  helped shape who I am.   First, I want to acknowledge my grandmother, who, without a high  school education, taught me the value of education, taught me the value  of being a woman, of being a wife, of being a mother. She is my rock  and my foundation. She taught me that being a woman and being a Black  woman in America ``is to be fearless, Brenda,'' to never apologize, and  be accountable for everything that I do, and that I work hard, get my  education, and keep my faith in God. There was no door I could not walk  through or no table that I did not deserve to sit at. She had strength  and confidence in something I carry with me every single day.   Then there is my shero, Shirley Chisholm, who paved the way for Black  women like me to be in Congress. She proved every day the power that  women had to change their community. Shirley Chisholm always said: ``If  they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.''   And, my goodness, the majority of women who represent us here in  Congress are carrying their own folding chair.   So we have our first woman, our first Black American, our first  Asian-American Vice President, who has coined the phrase: ``The first,  but not the last.''   We stand on the shoulders, all of us, of giants. We continue to build  the foundation so that the next generation of girls and young women can  stand on our shoulders. Look at this Congress. There are over 140  Democrat and Republican women in the House and the Senate, the most  ever in the history of our country.   That translates to the work we are doing in this Chamber to better  the lives of women and girls. If you look at today, we voted to pass  the equal rights amendment resolution and the Violence Against Women  Reauthorization Act. These are the steps in the right direction. We  have come a long way, baby, for full equality, but we still have work  to do.   We, unfortunately, have a system in America that often suppress women  and does not support women. But we know that, ``A woman is like a tea  bag,'' like Eleanor Roosevelt said, ``you never know how strong she is  until she gets in hot water.''   And I know for a fact that women have continued to stand up against  every barrier. You point to this pandemic and you see how women,  especially women of color, have borne the brunt of this health and  economic crisis. But we keep moving and we will continue in this  Congress to fight for the women in America.   This is our responsibility, and I am glad that we have women leaders  across the Federal, State, and local governments that we have looked up  to. Every woman in this Congress today recognizes that the next  generation is looking at us and asking us to stand up.   Our Vice President of the United States, our Speaker of the House,  and half of President Biden's Cabinet, and even on the other side of  the aisle, the chair of the House Republican Party, all are women. We  are making success, and I know that we can do so much more.   I continue to work, and I want to know that when women succeed,  America succeeds, as our amazing Speaker of the House reminds us.   I am so glad to share this hour with some of our amazing women  leaders who will continue to tell us, while we have a month dedicated  to women's history, we make history every single day.   I would like to ask for my first speaker to come to the podium.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my amazing co-chair for  everything she does.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman  Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Lois Frankel), my co-chair.    Mr. Speaker, it is also significant to note that the  majority of the diversity in Congress is represented by the women  Members of Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn  B. Maloney), a fighter for the ERA.    Mr. Speaker, I can't wait for that museum.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee),  another leader and fighter for women's rights.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Lee for  being a voice for women year after year after year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky), who has been one of our fighters from the beginning.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Adams), who has been a trailblazer in her own right.    I thank the gentlewoman and thank her for being the  100th woman to enter into Congress.   I now yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez).   Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining, please?    I thank the gentlewoman so much. We are standing on  the shoulders of Deb Haaland and my amazing mentor and friend, Marcia  Fudge, who have left the Halls of Congress to go to the White House to  lead the administrative staff.   I now yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath), a  community organizer who put her boots on and walked the streets, and  made change, and then blessed us by coming to Congress to continue the  fight.    I thank the gentlewoman from Georgia.   I know there is a tradition that says, as long as you say the names  of your forefathers, they will never leave you. So I just want to  introduce into the Record Etta Cranford, who was my grandmother. At the  age of 55, she inherited a 3-year-old and 5-year-old when my mother  died, and she gave everything she had until her death to ensure that I  would be a strong Black woman in America.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon).    I now yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Manning), a woman who has made a difference. I am looking forward  to the brilliance of her future.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Ross).    I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina.   I now yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild), our  final speaker tonight, who came to Congress with a mission. She has  made her voice heard, and she has made such a difference. We welcome  her as not only a woman Member of Congress but as an amazing  Representative.                                time  2030     Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I want to take this moment to thank  everyone who spoke tonight.   I want everyone to know that women are making so many strides. We are  currently on target to send women to the Moon. We are on target to make  sure that women continue to be leaders in education and healthcare. I  am proud to say that not only do we have a woman as our Vice President,  but we also have a woman as our amazing Speaker of the House. We have  six chairs of our congressional committees headed by women. We also  have over, as I said, 194 women in Congress currently.   With Women's History Month, sometimes the men will roll their eyes in  the back of their head and say: Women, why do you need a month?  Because, so often, the strides and hard work that it took for us to  accomplish what was given to privileged men are often overlooked.   I am proud to stand here today to lead this Special Order hour to  honor the women, as Congresswoman Wild said, the ones who often don't  get a platform, don't get a mic, and they just do the work every day.  [[Page H1489]]    Women are the predominant group of educators. If you are educated in  America, you were probably touched by a woman. Those who are in  hospitals and went through COVID and all the suffering, the caregivers  and nurses are predominantly women.   We all owe a debt of gratitude to the mother who gave birth to us. We  are often in the kitchens and other places that women are such strong  leaders, but now we have women in the C suites. We have women  manufacturing and designing. We have women in every area of America  working.   The only thing that any woman wants is the opportunity to have a seat  at the table to be able to show her brilliance. As my grandmother told  me, never apologize for your hard work, your brilliance, or your skills  and talents that you have been blessed with. You use them, and you do a  good thing with them.   And as John Lewis said, get in good trouble. The suffragists taught  us that the good trouble they went through gave us the right to vote in  America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
