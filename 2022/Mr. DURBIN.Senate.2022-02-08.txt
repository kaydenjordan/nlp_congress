 Mr. President, I am sure that you, more than most Members  of the Senate, remember our debate a few weeks ago on the Voting Rights  Act. I remember your statement on the floor. It was powerful and really  spoke to the truth of why we were meeting and debating this issue.   We realize that, sadly, since the Civil War, when African Americans  were finally given the right to vote, this has been a battle every year  since. And yesterday, the Supreme Court decision tells us that we still  have a battle to fight when it comes to voting rights in America.   By a 5-to-4 vote yesterday, the Supreme Court's conservative majority  allowed Alabama lawmakers to move forward with a congressional  districting map that diminishes the power of Black voters in a State  where Black Americans account for more than 25 percent of the  population.   You see, this case had been considered by a three-judge district  court panel in Alabama, and they ruled in a unanimous decision that the  map likely violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and they ruled that  we should block that map because it would violate the right to vote of  African Americans.    I might say, for the record, this three-judge panel, two of the three  judges were appointed by former President Trump, and yet they came to  that conclusion. So the Supreme Court had a decision of whether to go  along with this three-judge panel and stop the implementation of this  map until they  [[Page S552]]  could have a full hearing on the subject or allow them to go forward.  And, sadly, by a 5-to-4-vote, the Supreme Court's conservative majority  stayed a lower court's decision, where they ruled unanimously that the  district map was discriminatory.   The Supreme Court did not issue a well-reasoned decision; they issued  basically no reason. They did so on what is known as the shadow docket.  We are seeing it more and more by this Court--no explanation, no full  briefing, no signed opinion for the majority. What we have was a scant  reaction by the Court.   But I do want to note that Justice Kagan wrote that that decision by  the Supreme Court in favor of allowing this Alabama map to go forward  ``does a disservice to the District Court, which meticulously applied  this Court's longstanding voting-rights precedent.'' She went on to  note that ``most of all, it does a disservice to the Black people of  Alabama who under that precedent have had their electoral power  diminished in violation of the law this Court once knew to buttress all  of American democracy.''   Yesterday's decision is the latest example of the Supreme Court  hacking away the protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of  the most important civil rights laws in our history--a law singularly  responsible for decades of progress in minority representation in  public office.   As a result of these decisions, legal protections for voters of color  throughout the country are being systematically dismantled by the  Republican Party through State legislatures and, sadly, by our Federal  courts.   So now what do we do? Well, Congress must act. We must restore the  Voting Rights Act to its full power and potential, and we can do that  by enacting the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   This legislation would strengthen and modernize the Voting Rights  Act's protections, including by requiring Supreme Court Justices to  actually explain their reasoning behind their decisions when they  overturn a lower court's decision on a voting rights case. Is that too  much to ask, that the Supreme Court explain to the American people why  they are overruling a lower court's decision which says Americans are  being discriminated against when it comes to their right to vote? I  don't think the Supreme Court is that busy that it can't tell the  American people its logic behind these decisions.   Every day, we are seeing the consequences of this Senate's failure  just a few weeks ago to protect the right to vote. Mr. President, you  and I agree; we cannot wait any longer.                                  January 6    Mr. President, let me address a related topic: 2022 is an election  year. We know that well. And over the next 8 months, both parties will  have a chance to make our case to the American people for the November  election, to engage in spirited, public debate about the issues that  matter: the pandemic, the economy, and the challenges facing our  country.   But what happened last week in Salt Lake City, UT, is incredible. The  Republican Party made its opening move in this year's election. Instead  of offering a vision for the future of America, the Republican Party  leaders meeting in Utah chose to attack democracy itself.   On Friday, the Republican National Committee declared that the  January 6, 2021, insurrection was a form of ``legitimate political  discourse.'' This outrageous declaration, printed under the official  letterhead of the Republican National Committee, is the saddest  commentary on what Donald Trump and his acolytes have done to a great  political party, the party of Abraham Lincoln.   The violence that we personally witnessed in this Chamber on January  6, 2021, was deadly, seditious, and un-American--far from legitimate.  Is that what we call the worst assault on the Capitol since the War of  1812? Was it legitimate political discourse when the violent mob beat  police officers with metal poles and assaulted them with bear  spray? Was it political discourse that contributed to the death of five  police officers who confronted that mob? Was it just merely political  discourse when a defeated, embittered former President incited that mob  to attack this Capitol Building and do its best to overturn the results  of a free election, which he lost? No. It was an incitement to violence  and an attack on our democracy.    Let's be clear: The Republican Party's whitewashing of the  insurrection isn't just a pathetic capitulation to Donald Trump and his  Big Lie; it is a dangerous revelation of the mindset of the leadership  of America's Republican Party. By legitimizing the insurrection,  Republican Party leaders are exploring the use of violence and saying  it is perfectly acceptable, it is legitimate when it comes to the  political goals.   This is how democracies die.   Last year, the intelligence community warned that ``narratives of  fraud in the recent general election . . . will almost certainly spur  some [domestic violent extremists] to try to engage in violence.'' That  came from our intelligence community. This is not a hypothetical.   Over the past year, we have seen how the Big Lie, promulgated by the  former, defeated President of the United States, has inspired his  supporters to commit and threaten violent acts.   On Friday--the same day that the Republican Party declared that the  insurrectionist mob was legitimate political discourse--a Texas man  appeared for his first day in court. That man is facing Federal charges  for threatening to kill public officials in the home State of the  Presiding Officer, the State of Georgia.   What is exactly alleged to have happened? Well, the day before the  January 6 insurrection, this man posted a message on the website  Craigslist calling for the murder of three election officials in  Georgia. He wrote: ``It's our duty as American Patriots to put an end  to the lives of these traitors and to take back our country by force.  We can no longer wait on the corrupt law enforcement and the corrupt  courts. If we want our country back we have to exterminate these  people.''   The case against this man is the first case that has been brought  forward by the Justice Department's Election Threats Task Force, which  the Department established last June in response to the burgeoning  threats of violence against election officials. But it is going to be  far from the last case, unfortunately. Right now, the Department of  Justice is investigating dozens of similar cases.   And less than 1 week after charging this Texas defendant, the  Department also charged a man in Nevada who told an election worker  that she was going to ``die'' because she played a part in ``stealing''  the 2020 election from Donald Trump. Thankfully, that election worker  was not physically harmed, but she was shaken and disturbed by that  declaration.   She is not alone. Last April, the Brennan Center published a report  finding that nearly one in five election officials in America had  received threats because of their roles in the 2020 election. One in  three of these election officials says they worry for their safety  because of the rising tide of political violence. Political violence.  And the Republican National Committee describes it as ``legitimate  political discourse.''   Is this the cost of participating in a democracy in Mr. Trump's  vision of America? Since the 2020 election, the former President and  his supporters have latched on to the Big Lie to discredit American  democracy and the decision of American voters and to go after those who  work in it, like election workers.   But this is not the first time a malicious lie has been used to  foment distrust, disdain, and even hatred for America's public  servants. It was 72 years ago this week that Wisconsin Senator Joseph  McCarthy delivered his infamous ``Enemies from Within'' speech in  Wheeling, WV. In that speech, Senator McCarthy pulled a sheet of paper  out of his pocket, held it up to the crowd, and claimed he had a list  of more than 50 names of Communist agents who had infiltrated our  government. These scurrilous accusations by Senator McCarthy made  headlines and provoked nationwide hysteria. Rumors abounded about card- carrying Communists working within our government.   And over the next 4 years, Senator McCarthy led a personal witch hunt  [[Page S553]]  against public servants, journalists, members of the military, and  average citizens. He destroyed lives in the process. But he never  revealed his list of 57 names or any other credible evidence for his  claims. Nonetheless, Senator Joe McCarthy discredited and defamed  anyone standing in his way. He would accuse his opponents of being  Communists or Communist sympathizers if they publicly disagreed with  him.   With rare and notable exceptions--and one of them Senator Margaret  Chase Smith, Republican Senator of Maine, and a few others--no one had  the courage to question Joe McCarthy or challenge his wild allegations.  Politicians were too afraid that he would turn on them next, so they  remained quiet.    And in the absence of opposition, he assumed even greater power-- until 1954, when some courageous members of Senator McCarthy's own  political party, the Republican Party, joined together with the  Democrats in the Senate. They voted to condemn Senator McCarthy and the  lies that had fueled his witch hunt. They stood in a bipartisan  majority to do it. With that vote, Senator Joseph McCarthy's reign of  terror was brought to an end. The press began to ignore him, and the  public had had their fill.   What will it take for our Republican colleagues today to say that  they are done with the Big Lie of Trumpism? What will it take for them  to reject it and renounce the normalization of political violence? What  will it take for Republicans to admit that January 6 was a deadly  insurrection, not a ``legitimate political discourse''?   Americans of conscience of both political parties and Independents as  well need to unite in support of the truth. That doesn't mean we are  going to agree on every issue. On the contrary, real debate is the  lifeblood of our democracy. But we have to work from a shared set of  facts and reality--like the fact that President Biden actually won the  2020 election and there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud.   I want to commend my Republican colleagues who have been willing to  speak the truth in the last few days. I know it can't be easy.   Over the weekend, Senator Mitt Romney, Senator Bill Cassidy, and  Senator Lisa Murkowski spoke out against the Republican National  Committee's decision to censure Congresswoman Liz Cheney and  Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois for committing the unforgivable  sin of investigating the violent assault against American democracy.  Unfortunately, they are a small but courageous minority. The vast  majority of my Republican colleagues remain silent while their party  leaders declare January 6 legitimate.   And on Friday, former Vice President Pence publicly stated:  ``President Trump is wrong . . . Under the Constitution, I had no right  to change the outcome of our election.''   That simple, declarative statement of truth--that the Vice President  cannot singlehandedly overrule the will of the American people--is  welcomed, but the fact that it drew outrage from former President Trump  and his supporters is a sad reflection on the reality of today's  Republican Party.   If the events leading up to January 6 taught us anything, it is that  aspiring authoritarians like Donald Trump will toss aside longstanding  laws and values to cling to power. That is why for the past several  months, a bipartisan group of Senators have been discussing a proposal  to modernize the Electoral Count Act, an obscure law that was at the  heart of former President Trump's efforts to overturn the election. I  have been working on this effort on our side with Senators King and  Klobuchar, and there is a bipartisan effort, on the same matter, taking  place as well.   By updating the Electoral Count Act, we can make clear that the Vice  President does not have the power to reject a State's lawfully  appointed electors and overturn the results of an election. That is  important, and I believe it is a promising sign that Democrats and  Republicans are going to join together in discussion of finally  rewriting this ancient law.   But I also want to be honest about the scope of threats facing our  American democracy. At a moment when too many Republican Party leaders  are legitimizing the January 6 insurrection and Republican State  legislators are erecting new barriers to the ballot box, particularly  for African Americans, we must have the courage to restore the Voting  Rights Act. And we need to come together across party lines to defend  our democracy, condemn violence, and to live by the rule of law, not  the rule of the mob.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan) are necessarily  absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan) are necessarily  absent.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan) are necessarily  absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan), and the Senator  from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan)  is necessarily absent.
