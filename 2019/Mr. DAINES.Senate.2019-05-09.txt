 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, a few weeks ago, I stood right here  condemning Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's chilling remarks about  infanticide. Since then, the American people have continued to witness  disturbing abortion extremism by Democratic public lawmakers. So here I  am again today to condemn and address these horrific remarks and the  unfortunate reality we are living in today in this country.   Last week, while opposing a bill to protect unborn human life,  Democratic Alabama State Representative John Rogers said: ``Some kids  are unwanted, so you kill them now or you kill them later.'' He went on  to say: ``You bring them in the world unwanted, unloved, you send them  to the electric chair. So you kill them now or you kill them later.''   These reprehensible remarks reveal a disturbing abortion extremism  that has become far too normal, too accepted by the Democrats. All  human life is precious, no matter the stage of development or  disability. We must never forget these are innocent babies we are  talking about.   Just this week, Democratic Pennsylvania State Representative Brian  Sims posted a disgraceful video of himself online--I encourage you to  go and watch it--a disgraceful video of himself online harassing three  teenage girls who were praying outside a Planned Parenthood abortion  clinic. He went as far as promising to pay $100 to anyone who would  identify these innocent teenage girls.   Horrific comments like Representative Rogers' and harassment of pro- life teens by Representative Sims should be condemned at the State and  the national level by all, regardless of political party. We must not  let this continue to be the norm in our society. We must fight back.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in honor of National Military Appreciation  Month, I want to recognize a Montana hero, Medal of Honor Recipient SSG  Travis W. Atkins of Bozeman. Montana and the Nation are eternally  grateful for the sacrifice he made to protect his fellow soldiers and  his country. His memory will live on in the hearts of all Montanans for  years to come.   I ask unanimous consent that a poem penned in his honor by Albert  Carey Caswell be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              The Greater Good       The Greater Good . . .

With all your splendid splendor so . . .      As we now so weep . . .      As your family and your Brothers In Arms will always keep . .             .      Your most gallant memory in their hearts so deep . . .      My son, your battle is over now . . .      But, your new one is about. . .      Is about to begin my friend . . .

Our Lord's tears shall wash down upon your loved ones to ease             their pain . . .      Until, one fine day once again . . .      Up in heaven you'll meet then . . .

Who but For The Greater Good all of us so blessed . . .      Amen . . .                            ____________________
