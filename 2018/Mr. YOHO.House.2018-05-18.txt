 Madam Chairman, as a veterinarian, I rise to voice my  opposition to the amendment.   Madam Chairman, the amendment poses a threat to the health of  Americans. Consumption of raw milk has demonstrated public health  risks, as you just heard. The link between raw milk and foodborne  illnesses has been well documented in scientific literature for over  100 years.   Raw milk is a key vehicle in the transmission of human pathogens,  including E. coli, campylobacter, Listeria, tuberculosis,  leptospirosis, cryptosporidiosis, brucellosis, cowpox, diptheria, and  typhoid fever. You can throw some ascarids in there, too.   Since the beginning of time, humankind has strived to improve  survivability and increase human health. In fact, Louis Pasteur, in  1864--1864, over 154 years ago--discovered the benefits of heating milk  to kill the microbes that were detrimental to human health, hence the  term ``pasteurization.''   Nearly two-thirds of all raw milk or raw milk products--cheese,  butter, ice cream--and the outbreaks that come from those involve  children who are not able to make informed decisions on what to  consume. And according to the  [[Page H4219]]  CDC, at least one child younger than 5 was involved in 46 percent of  the raw milk and raw milk product outbreaks reported between 2007 and  2016.   It is obvious and scientifically proven that this amendment would  threaten the health and well-being of all Americans. I am not against  raw milk, but if it is your cow, I think you ought to drink it at your  house, and it shouldn't be sold as a healthy product without  contaminants.   Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  amendment.
