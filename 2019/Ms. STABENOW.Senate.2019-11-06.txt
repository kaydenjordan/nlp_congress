 Mr. President, this week, the United States House of  Representatives made history. For the very first time, an overwhelming  majority of its members--more than 400--adopted a resolution  recognizing the Armenian genocide. I rise today to urge my colleagues  in the Senate to do the same thing--the right thing--and pass S. Res.  150.   It has now been 104 years since the Armenian people became targets of  the most evil and hate-filled campaign of violence that the world had  ever seen. From 1915 to 1923, a million and a half Armenian men, women,  and children were murdered at the hands of the Ottoman Turkish  Government. It was so atrocious that no word yet existed to describe  what was happening--not until the creation of the word ``genocide,''  the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or  cultural group.   Unfortunately, nobody has ever been held accountable, and the events  surrounding the Armenian genocide continue to be denied, but the truth  is simple: What happened to the Armenian people was absolutely  genocide, and the Armenian community is right to insist that it be  described that way.   This is why I have always supported Senate resolutions calling for  the recognition of the Armenian genocide and urged my colleagues to  join me.   We know that the deeper the wound, the longer it takes to heal, and  nothing cuts deeper into the collective consciousness of a people than  genocide.   At the same time, we know now that the Ottoman Empire's determination  to exterminate the Armenian people was no match for their will to  survive, and those who survived embodied the best qualities of the  human spirit: hope, resilience, perseverance, and love.   Some survivors made their way to America, and many of them built  their new lives in Michigan. They have created thriving communities,  built businesses, raised families, founded schools, and contributed  their rich culture to the fabric of our State.   The more than 20,000 Armenians who are living in Michigan today have  not forgotten what happened--none of us should, for we know that, if we  do not recognize the atrocities of the past, we risk blinding ourselves  to atrocities in the future.   Recognition of the Armenian genocide is long overdue. A crime like  this casts a long shadow, and this shadow can be conquered only by  light, the light of truth that comes from fully acknowledging the full  scale of the horror that the Armenians endured.   I urge my colleagues to take up and support this resolution.   Thank you.                            ____________________
