 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Commander  John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act.   As this month marks National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, I am  grateful the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees are working  across the aisle to improve mental health services for our veterans. I  am proud that this package includes my bipartisan bill, the STOP  Veteran Suicide and Substance Abuse Act.   We know that too many veterans struggling with mental health  challenges, like PTSD, are often also dealing with substance misuse  issues and the impact of various traumas, including military sexual  assault.   Given how common these co-occurring problems are, VA healthcare  providers need evidence-based guidance for working with multiple issues  all at once. My bill ensures that the VA will develop and disseminate  this clinical practice guideline to share best practices VA-wide.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representative Mast for working with  me on this bill, and Chairman Takano for his tireless leadership on  this issue.   And I also want to thank Dr. Roe for his years of service to the  country, both as a doctor, a soldier, and as a member of this committee  and service in the House of Representatives. I thank him very much for  his friendship, always stopping to say hello. We are going to miss him  here. But I know he will continue his service back in civilian life,  and so I thank him very much for his years of service.
