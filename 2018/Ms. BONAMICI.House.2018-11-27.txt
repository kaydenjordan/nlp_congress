 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1768, the  National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act. This  bill will reauthorize seismological research and warning systems  through Fiscal Year 2022.   Congress established the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction  Program (NEHRP) to carry out a longterm, inter-agency earthquake  research program. NEHRP focuses on earthquake warning, hazard  reduction, and minimizing loss after earthquakes. Earthquake early  warning systems can provide several additional seconds of warning  before the strongest ground shaking arrives, enough to save lives and  protect critical infrastructure.   In Northwest Oregon, it is not a question of if, but when, an  earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone will hit our state. The  U.S. Geological Survey, in collaboration with the University of Oregon,  the University of Washington, Caltech, and University of California,  Berkley, developed ShakeAlert, an early earthquake warning system. The  technology has been tested and is proven to work effectively. Federal  investments in these programs are critical. Although it is difficult if  not impossible to know when and where the next large earthquake will  occur, we must do everything that we can to prepare ourselves and our  communities to mitigate destruction and save lives. Reauthorizing NEHRP  is an important step in recognizing the science behind earthquakes and  other natural disasters such as tsunamis and landslides.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
