 Mr. Speaker, there is a lot going on today, a lot going  on this week. I wish I could say it was all good, but we spent until 10  p.m. the night before last working on bills that would find ways to  take people's guns away and, unfortunately, not give them the kind of  due process that we think the Constitution affords people.   During my days as, well, a prosecutor and as a felony judge,  thousands of criminal cases went through my court. I don't remember  anywhere a criminal defendant bought his gun at a sporting goods store,  gun store, applied for a gun. That is not the way criminals work.   And so I didn't see anything in our hours and hours and hours of  committee hearings trying to amend bad bills with good amendments that  the majority didn't allow to be passed. We thought they might be  joining us on some. They said they would look at some, but, basically,  defeated every amendment.   Today, we met in the Judiciary Committee at 8 a.m. to take up a semi,  sort of, kind of, a bit of an impeachment resolution. We had amendments  that would have made a bad resolution a little better--still not good-- but we had a hard time figuring out, on the Republican side: What is  this?   It sounds like--in Texas, we would say we're fixing to do something.  A lot of times people say, ``I am fixing to do that,'' but it means it  may get put off and I may not really be serious, because if I was  really serious, I would do it right now.   But this resolution--and I have it here--it, in the first paragraph,  talks about the committee making discovery requests. But the second  paragraph is really the one that deals with allegations that would be  an impeachable offense, or offenses--at least, it is supposed to.   And so it says: ``Whereas, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report  released on April 18, 2019, found that the Russian Government  interfered in the 2016 election in `sweeping and systematic fashion.'''   Okay. But the Mueller report made very, very clear, and those who  investigated, I thought, made it very clear there was no collusion or,  to use the legal term, conspiracy by anyone in the Trump campaign with  the Russian Government--none. That part didn't happen.   Even though we have networks like CNN and MSNBC, and I don't know who  all else, but for 2 or 3 years they have talked about the crimes of  this President and their collusion with Russia.   Well, when people who have law degrees talked about collusion between  the Trump campaign and Russia, that immediately sent up red flags with  me because that is not--``collusion'' is not a legal term that is used  in talking about crimes; it is conspiracy. And so it immediately begins  to raise questions.   Are they really serious about some type of crime? Because if they  were, they would use words that are used in criminal terminology.   But here, this is a completely deceptive allegation when it comes to  President Trump because they take this initial allegation and say  Mueller found that the Russians really were trying to interfere in our  2016 election.   Okay. But it didn't involve anybody in the Trump campaign. That was  clear.   So they tried to brush over that and make it sound like, yeah, even  though there was nobody, President Trump or the Trump campaign who were  involved at all, but we are going to kind of word this, put it in the  same sentence so that it kind of sounds like,  [[Page H7698]]  yeah, President Trump was involved with Russia, because then it jumps  into another gear.   It says, ``that there were at least 10 separate episodes of President  Trump using his official powers to''--and here is the word--``thwart or  attempt to thwart the special counsel's investigation.''                                time  1315    And that is also very troubling language for those of us that have  dealt with legal terminology in criminal cases. I don't know of anybody  that has dealt with criminal cases. I didn't hear from anybody on the  committee that has ever heard of a crime involving thwarting. We are  familiar with obstruction of justice. But these are the kind of games  you play with words when you know, yes, there is no evidence a crime  was committed, but maybe if we use different terminology it will sound  like some kind of bad crime was committed. And clearly, we are not  going to be able to remove a President from office with the Senate  understanding that even the Mueller report, even the Mueller special  counsel team that had all these people that hated Donald Trump, they  still couldn't find anything that would be indictable.   Now, some say, Well, but there was obstruction of justice. We even  had one, I would say, incompetent law professor come before our  committee and say she could guarantee that she could get a conviction  and win on appeal. Well, I have tried enough cases in State and Federal  court and in the Army that I know--and I have told people that were  looking for lawyers in my days as a judge--I couldn't recommend a  lawyer, but I would warn people--if you ever hear a lawyer who tries  cases who says they can guarantee you a win in a trial, then that  lawyer is either totally incompetent or is one of the biggest liars in  the legal profession. I don't know which one this professor was. I got  the impression she just really didn't know what she was talking about,  because no one swears, Oh, yes, I can guarantee you, you know, I can  win this case at trial and on appeal. That is not a good lawyer. That  is somebody who doesn't know what they are talking about.   What we have found now after thousands and thousands of interviews,  subpoenas, documents, millions of documents, there was no crime. And  the reason there was no obstruction of justice by President Trump or  anybody that was assisting him is because the President made very clear  as soon as he heard about some collusion, conspiracy, whatever you want  to call it with Russia to rig the election, he knew he never colluded.  He knew that he never conspired, nor did anybody in his campaign  conspire with Russia to affect the election. That never happened, and  he knew it.   But he could see from what these 17 or so people on the special  counsel's team were trying to do. They were trying to frame him. And  this guy that was dishonored and was no longer respected by MI6 that he  used to work for in England and there was information that he was  discredited, not just his information, but he had been discredited, but  that is who was hired by Fusion GPS, that was hired apparently by the  Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee to try to dredge  up dirt on candidate Donald Trump so that they could rig the election  against Donald Trump.   And we have gotten to the bottom of it, almost. We know that  Christopher Steele is the one that didn't just collude, he conspired  with people in Russia who he ultimately had to admit, yes, it is quite  possible they could have been working for Vladimir Putin. So  Christopher Steele, it appears most likely he was the one that was  conspiring with people from Russia, sounds like Putin's agents, to try  to destroy Donald Trump.   And there has been noise made about, oh, gee, you know, Russia really  wanted Donald Trump to win. That is not the way Vladimir Putin thinks.  He wants the old Soviet empire back. It really bugs me when educated  people say, you know, he is such a complicated guy. No, he isn't. He is  one of the most easily discernable people in the world. He wants the  old empire back. He is a former KGB guy, and he will do whatever it  takes to try to get it back. I don't think he cared so much who won the  election. He wanted to divide America, and lo and behold, he was able  to see the Fusion GPS, Christopher Steele, the Clinton campaign, DNC,  they were able to take all this information that were nothing but lies  in the dossier--they have even given dossier a bad name--and divide  America.   And at least one political party in America has been totally willing  to be complicit to help divide America over a bunch of lies in a  dossier that was created as political fodder when it became very clear  very quickly to those who had paid for the dossier that it was not only  not verifiable, the person that gathered the information didn't really  know the people, the Russians that gave him the lies about Donald  Trump, and that got taken before a FISA court to get a warrant to spy  on a campaign; to wit, the Trump campaign. That is scary stuff; when  one administration can use the powers of the office of President, the  Intel community, the FBI, the Department of Justice, use all those  powers to destroy another campaign. And as Newt Gingrich has pointed  out, if Ms. Clinton had won, we would have never known how corrupted  and weaponized the DOJ and FBI had become.   And I know there are some of my friends here in Congress on our side  of the aisle that think Michael Horowitz is doing a good job, because  look at all the evidence of wrongdoing, bias, all this that he has  found. Well, if you look at the most recent report, just like the first  one, in the first report Horowitz found--and he was a good Obama  appointee as inspector general there at the Department of Justice, good  Democrat, good appointee.   And so he does his digging, finds hundreds of pages of the most  outrageous political bias--it's actually a personal hatred for Donald  Trump and absolute love and affection for candidate Hillary Clinton--so  much overwhelming bias, and every conclusion that these biased,  prejudiced, bigoted investigators had was 100 percent consistent with  all of their conclusions. That speaks for itself.   Now, if half of their conclusions had gone against their bias and  prejudice, bigotry, then you would say, well, you know, maybe it really  didn't affect the outcomes of their investigations. But when every  conclusion is consistent with the bias and prejudice, even though it is  clear, like in the case of the investigation into the Clinton emails,  you had Strzok and Page examining emails, and they were making the  calls on whether documents are classified, knowing full well if they  said something was classified that Hillary Clinton was being set up  legitimately to be indicted and convicted. So they wanted Hillary  Clinton to win. They wanted to do whatever they could to stop Donald  Trump from winning, and if he didn't win, as they said, they needed an  insurance policy, you know, just in case he won.    And Horowitz did a grave injustice within the Justice Department, and  he says there is no indication that all that bias had anything to do  with the outcomes of the cases. That is just garbage. He is being  disingenuous. He wasn't doing his job in his conclusions. And I know  there were a lot of Republicans that said, Yes, okay, but, boy, when he  investigated, when that report comes out on Comey, it is going to end  up sending him to prison.   Well, Comey did leak information that he should not. He did keep  documents that he was not permitted to keep. He secreted them, kept  them after he had left government service. He is not allowed to do  that. And the biggest thing about those and whether or not they were  felonies that would put him in jail would be: Was this information  classified and at what level?   And we find out, you know, on page one and two of the Horowitz IG  report, the FBI investigated, and the FBI determined that this wasn't  classified; the FBI this and that. And you have to wait 40 pages to see  who he means by the FBI. Well, it turns out, the two most important  people, because they had the most experience in analyzing documents to  determine their classification level, it was a couple named Peter  Strzok and Lisa Page. And he has the gall, Horowitz does, to even point  out--to try to get more credibility to Strzok and Page's work on  deciding whether Comey should go to prison, because they were  classified at a high level. He said, Oh, but they had  [[Page H7699]]  more experience, because they did all this work on the Clinton emails  determining whether those were classified or not.   For heaven's sake, somebody needs to wake up. Michael Horowitz does  not need to be doing the investigation. Maybe let him do the  investigation, but he doesn't need to be doing the reports. In a lot of  places people would say he doesn't know sic `em from come here when it  comes to proper conclusions. It is outrageous.   And he justified not having them re-examined because time was of the  essence 2 years ago in 2017, back before Strzok and Page were fired.  But not to worry, because a guy named Bill Priestap was going to rubber  stamp whatever Strzok and Page decided on classifications.   There was another unit chief. Didn't give us that name. That tells  you something right there.   But Priestap was supposed to have the final decision, apparently  rubber stamp whatever our experienced Strzok and Page decided when they  knew full well if they classified things at a certain level that it  meant Jim Comey was going to prison.   So they did Comey a favor. And so then Horowitz, he didn't want to  have them rereviewed for proper classification away from the bias of  Strzok and Page and Priestap that--you know, there were reports of him  going to London trying to help out Steele's credibility.   So Horowitz said time was of the essence, so nobody reconsidered the  classification that the bigoted bias and prejudice of Page and Strzok  would not be determinative.   And I know that people, Republicans, many of them are saying, well,  look, there is no question that McCabe lied, perjured, he should end up  going to prison. But I am telling you as a history buff, a historian,  if you would, it is true. History is often the best indicator of what  someone will do in the future.                                time  1330    The indications are that Obama's IG, Horowitz, will find some  terrible things, but he will do it in such a way that he will give not  only Comey, Strzok, and Page a get-out-of-jail-free pass, but he will  do that with McCabe and with anybody else he is investigating, because  that is his history. He knows which side his bread is buttered on and  who is doing the buttering, who got him in the position he is in.   We end up now being told, well, this isn't a formal impeachment  hearing, the investigation we started today in the Judiciary Committee.  Then, toward the end of our hearing, we heard from two different  Democrats who wanted to go on record to make it very, very clear that  this was an impeachment hearing, an impeachment investigation.   That is what it is. It is not just a resolution for investigative  procedures, as it says here on the resolution.   There was so much fraud involved in this case. I am not talking about  from anybody with the Trump campaign. I am talking about a guy like  James Comey who should have known better. He swore and apparently  verified the application and affidavit information to go before the  FISA court so he could get a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, all  while he was lying to the President about him not being under  investigation and also trying to set the President up by doing little  memos.   I hope and pray one of the things that comes out of all this  Department of Justice, FBI, and intel abuse is a practice the FBI has  had for years. It is section 302, where FBI agents, after they do an  interview, they sit down and type up their own version of what they  think or what they recall a witness said. Most of the ones I have seen  over the years in my different roles in the justice system appear to be  very accurate. But it is a problem when every other local and State law  enforcement entity I am aware of, when they want credibility for a  statement, they record it.   I saw it from juries in my court. ``Look, you are telling us this is  what the defendant said. Why didn't you record it so we could see for  ourselves, hear for ourselves, see the body language?''   That is why local governments all over the country have come up with  billions of dollars altogether so that they can make sure that they get  video and audio of someone being questioned, so there is no question  what they say.   But not at the FBI. Oh, no. They will talk to a witness and then  write out their own version of what is said. Thankfully, most of them  do a great job, but it also allows unscrupulous FBI or DOJ officials,  as now we have seen existed under the Obama Justice Department, it  allows them to twist the FBI's or the DOJ's version of what a witness  says and use that, as they have thousands and thousands of times, I  don't know how many times, to convict people, saying, ``This is what he  said because I wrote it down in my own notes after I did the  interview.''   ``Really? Well, let's see the video. Let's hear the audio.''   ``Well, we don't do that at the FBI. We only write down our version  of what is said because we really would rather you hear our version and  not the defendant's version of what he said, because we get more  credibility than any defendant.''   At least that used to be the way it was. But I hope one of the things  that will come out of all of this is, in order for the FBI to get back  the credibility they used to have as the greatest law enforcement  agency in the world, they are going to need to start doing audio and  video so that we can see what a witness said, hear what they said for  ourselves, and so that juries can hear that and judges can see and hear  that. But we don't have that here.   People like the biased Strzok and Page, who hated Trump and loved  Hillary Clinton, when you talk about obstruction of justice, I don't  know how you can be more obstructive than to get a subpoena for emails  and then BleachBit, take all the stuff off so nobody can ever see and  then beat up with hammers cellphones and whatever you need to, to  destroy the evidence. That would seem to be a classic case of  obstruction.   Fortunately, for people involved with Hillary Clinton, it was Strzok  and Page on the job, so they didn't see anything, didn't hear anything  that might resemble something that should be prosecuted.   But we end up today with this resolution that the majority passed  without allowing any amendments, and they used this word ``thwart,''  that the President used his official powers to thwart or attempt to  thwart. Nobody has ever been convicted of thwarting.   You just can imagine, say the Democrats got exactly what they wanted  and were able to impeach or charge President Trump with thwarting an  official investigation. It goes to the Senate. They get what they want,  and President Trump is removed. Years down the road, they say, ``You  used to be President. You were removed? What were you removed for?''   ``Well, I was a thwarter, apparently. I have been branded a  thwarter.''   Maybe we ought to put a ``T'' on their head so everybody knows: Here  comes a thwarter.   The only thing he was thwarting, if at all, is massive injustice from  the Justice Department. He knew he had not conspired with anybody in  Russia, nor had anybody in his campaign.   The evidence has borne that out. Even Mueller, Weissman, the people  who hated the President, had to come around to saying they couldn't  find any evidence of them conspiring with Russia.   Nonetheless, we still have to go through this hearing today, and I am  sure there will be other hearings.   The truth is, President Donald Trump never obstructed or thwarted  justice. He knew that if there was true justice, this effort to frame  him for colluding with the Russians would be found false and would be  found to be a frame-up job. He wanted justice.   The DOJ could never convict someone of obstructing justice when all  they did was what they could to ensure that an injustice did not occur.  They were seeking justice to make sure there wasn't a successful frame- up. That is not obstructing or thwarting justice. That is seeking  justice. But there certainly were people inside the DOJ who were doing  what they could to inflict an injustice on President Trump.    So here we go into this impeachment exercise that started today.   I think about those in England who would say, ``God save the Queen,''  ``God save the King.'' God save this Republic.  [[Page H7700]]    We are in a lot of trouble when we have caught the Justice Department  red-handed trying to impose a massive injustice, conspiring to do so,  even having an Acting Attorney General who we found out from the emails  this week--and some of us knew this because we knew from other  information that Rosenstein, the Acting Attorney General, did not just  once say sarcastically: I will wear a wire. I can get into the White  House. I will wear a wire and record the President.   Then, they could try to remove him under the 25th Amendment for not  being competent. They formulated a response to act like he was being  sarcastic when everybody there knew he was not being sarcastic.   Apparently, from what I understood, the reason he brought that up is  because others there in the meeting were mad at him. They said: You  have been helping the President instead of helping us get the  President. You wrote that memo that gave him a basis to fire Comey.  Whose side are you on?   That is the kind of context where Rosenstein says: Look, I will wear  a wire if you want.   He wanted to show that he was an Obama team player, a Sally Yates  team player, a Loretta Lynch team player, that he was not a Trump team  player: I will even wear a wire and go in.   That wasn't the only place he brought it up. He brought it up at  another meeting, such that McCabe went back and told people: You know,  Rosenstein brought it up again. He still says he is willing to wear a  wire.   That is because Rosenstein was trying to convince them he was a good  team player and would go set up and try to frame the President to help  remove him from office.   That is not all that has gone on this week. We had the vote today.  The House has voted to eliminate the tiny, little part of ANWR where  Jimmy Carter said that drilling would be allowed.   Now, this is Jimmy Carter who says everybody is supposed to wear a  cardigan and turn your temperature in winter way down, wear a sweater,  you know, shiver a little bit. It is okay because we are going to save  energy.   Even he said it is right that part of ANWR, that tiny, little part of  that huge area, nothing is there, so it is not going to affect any  wildlife, really, so that can be an area that can be drilled.   Since then, Democrats have done all they could to put it off-limits.  Sometimes you see these pictures of all this wildlife, this beautiful,  pristine area. Well, if that is what you see, that isn't the part of  ANWR where drilling would be allowed.   We can get a little perspective on the size. There was another poster  up here somewhere. It has a map of how big Alaska is, and then it has  the size of ANWR. Then there is a red dot that you can't see more than  a few feet away that is the tiny, little part, comparatively, where  drilling would be allowed.   There are people here in this body who are absolutely wonderful  people, friends on both sides of the aisle. Some of my Democratic  friends, I know they would never lie to me. They are honest people. We  just have disagreements on things.   One of the most honorable people I ever knew in this body was  chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee back initially when  Democrats took the majority in January 2007. He wanted socialized  medicine. We disagreed on that. But I knew the man's heart. He wanted  to help poor people.                                time  1345    That is why he didn't want to pass the cap-and-trade bill, because he  knew it would cause the price of energy to skyrocket. And he knew it  was a tough blow to the Nation's poor, to our senior citizens on  Medicare, but especially on Social Security, a fixed income. If you  start skyrocketing the price of energy to those folks, it is  devastating.   That is why John did not want to pass the cap-and-trade bill. He  wanted to do everything he could to help poor people. That was his  nature. He knew if you start doing this kind of stuff for the rich with  energy prices--gasoline, electricity, propane, and those things going  up--it is an inconvenience, but for those on a fixed income, it is  absolutely devastating.   America, under the Trump administration, has been allowed to gather  up more of our own blessed energy sources. The economy gets better.  More people are working now than ever. Unemployment is the lowest it  has ever been for minorities since they started recording those  numbers. It is fantastic. Energy prices have come down low, and it has  been stabilized because we are finding so much of our own energy and  using it.   We disagree about a lot of things on both sides of the aisle. I don't  know anybody who serves in this body on either side of the aisle who  doesn't want a clean environment. But those who know our history of the  world know that, if you have a struggling economy, the number one thing  that suffers, besides the people, is the environment.   In China, that government, as big and totalitarian as it can be, they  know if people get laid off and are not working, they could have  another revolution, and they don't want that. They are more concerned  about people being busy and working and having money than they are  about the environment.   In India, they are scared to death of too many people not being able  to work or have income.   We get all of this pollution from the other side of the world. I  heard today that 85 percent, somebody said, of the pollution that we  have in our atmosphere is coming from these other countries. When those  countries' economies are struggling, there is more pollution. That is  just the way it works, because you just can't help afford to clean up  the environment like we are and have been in the United States.   We need a vibrant economy to continue to clean up our environment. We  have lakes that were dead, now brimming with activity and with  wildlife. These are good things. In Texas, it seems like our air gets  cleaner every year.   I asked my staff to find a picture, as best they could, that would  reflect what we are talking about in ANWR in that tiny--well,  relatively speaking, tiny area of ANWR where drilling would be allowed.  This is from Google Maps. This isn't actually the area, but it looks  like most of the area where drilling would be allowed.   From time to time, there will be wildlife across this area, in the  area where drilling would be allowed, but they can't stay because they  can't live there in that area. There is just not enough to sustain life  there.   As Jimmy Carter figured out, it is an ideal place to drill, and that  is why they designated it for that. But we have been waiting over 40  years to use that as a place to even further reduce our cost of energy,  which will also allow us to export energy, which means European  countries don't have to be blackmailed or extorted by Russia.   There is one country that hopes the Democrats are very, very  successful--well, of course, the OPEC nations. But Russia is probably  the most hopeful that the Democrats are successful in preventing us  from getting the energy that we have been blessed with in this area  where you don't have caribou or things, wildlife, like you do in other  parts of ANWR. They don't want us to drill because they know we will be  able to get energy to Europe. And we won't blackmail Europe. We won't  extort Europe the way that Putin often has, countries that he supplies  natural gas to.   If we export that, we can help give more freedom to the world. We can  bring down our own prices even further. Why wouldn't we do that?   This picture was near the proposed exploration area. It is from  Google Maps. It is taken on Dalton Highway, just south of Prudhoe Bay.  It is facing east towards the coastal area of the Arctic National  Wildlife Refuge. So it is not right in the refuge, but it is a very  fair representation of the coastal areas found within the refuge.   It is actually a more accurate depiction of the proposed exploration  area than the images that we have been seeing around here about the  mountains and rainbows and all the herds of animals. This is much more  representative than any of those types of pictures.   I want to touch on one more thing about the Russians meddling in our  election.   Sean Hannity had a great article 1\1/2\ years ago, February of 2018.  In there, he quotes from President Obama. President Obama said: ``There  is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could  even rig America's elections. There's no evidence that that has  happened in the  [[Page H7701]]  past or that there are instances in which that will happen this time.''   That was at the height of the 2016 election.   He goes on to say: ``And so I invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and go  try to make his case to get votes.''   President Trump did nothing. It turns out they knew that the Russians  were trying to meddle in our election. So why wouldn't Obama try to  stop the Russians from meddling in our election? He did nothing.   There is speculation that he knew Hillary Clinton was going to win,  and he was afraid if they started admitting what they knew was true-- that Russia was trying to meddle in our elections--and then Hillary  Clinton won, it might make her victory look suspect if they talked  about the effort they knew Russia was engaged in to affect our  election.   But the truth is that Putin wants to divide America as much as he  can. Divide and conquer is what he hopes to do. And he has been  successful.   The Russians that they had who gave their lives to Christopher  Steele, the discredited former MI6 guy, that he provided to Fusion GPS  that apparently the Clinton campaign and the DNC had hired, it has done  what they wanted. It has done what Putin wanted. It has adversely  affected the President of the United States. It has divided our  country, and it has pitted family against family.   Someone once said that the last phase of a civil war involves guns,  but we have been in a nonfirearm civil war for a while now. And this  Mueller investigation--the whole Russia dossier, the lies in there  about candidate, now President, Trump--the Russians, just like Putin  wanted, have been successful in dividing this country.   As of yesterday, being 9/11, we can disagree, like John Dingell and I  did, but I loved the guy. He was a brilliant, caring, honorable man of  integrity. We have those on both sides of the aisle. You have some that  you have got to be careful on both sides. But there are people on both  sides of the aisle; and we can work together because they are honest,  honorable people, and we can disagree when we need to.   I need to touch on, before we finish the week here, of course, we  have seen in the news Afghanistan peace talks with the Taliban broke  down. The Taliban continue to kill Americans, and they are going to  continue to kill Americans. It is who they are. It is what they are.   In my trips to Afghanistan and other places, I made friends with some  of those Muslims who were part Afghan, Muslims who were part of the  Northern Alliance. It is no longer called the Northern Alliance. But  these were Muslim friends of the United States. They just wanted their  freedom. They are Muslims, but they did not want ruthless totalitarians  like the Taliban running their country.   The enemy of our enemy were people we could work with. Unfortunately,  our intelligence was not sophisticated enough, plugged in enough, so  that a day or so before 9/11, when Ahmad Shah Massoud, sometimes called  the Lion of Panjshir because he was such a hero--he was a great  warrior, soldier; he was a great politician, beloved in Afghanistan.  The Taliban wanted to kill him, but he had good security.   The Taliban, they may be crazy, they may be haters and want to kill  all Americans, but they are not stupid at all. They knew that if the  United States figured out that the 9/11 attack had originated in  Afghanistan with al-Qaida and the Taliban, that the United States would  come to Afghanistan, and we would look for an Afghan leader that the  people would rally behind, who could lead the country to destroy the  Taliban. And they knew that would most likely be the Lion of Panjshir,  the hero of the Afghan victory over Russia, Ahmad Shah Massoud.   A day or so before 9/11--I think it was around 36 hours or so  before--they had gotten Massoud to agree to an interview. His security  people checked out the reporter, known reporter, the cameraman there,  let him in, and, when they start the interview, the cameraman blows up  the bomb in his camera and kills Massoud.   If our intelligence people had been on top of their game, they would  have known something was about to happen. Something was about to happen  for them to kill Massoud now, this national hero.   Ahmad Shah Massoud has a brother, Ahmad Zia Massoud, and I think of  him as a friend. I hope he thinks the same way. He fought with and  under his older brother. His brother used him as a diplomat, but he was  one of many of the Northern Alliance.   The movie ``12 Strong'' shows General Dostum that we got after 9/11,  getting around October, got other tribal groups to agree to fight with  Dostum as the leader. Some of them weren't happy, but they agreed. And  we provided air cover, and we provided weapons for them.                                time  1400    We have 300 or so, as I have understood it, special ops, Special  Forces, CIA, in there, and only our guys could call down bombs and  direct them at specific targets.   Between the weapons we provided the Afghans, the bomb support from B- 52s 40,000 or so feet up, the Northern Alliance, our Afghan Muslim  allies, they destroyed the organized Taliban, within--some say, maybe  it was March, but February, March of 2002. Without a single American  casualty, we defeated the Taliban.   Then I think it was a mistake. We were considered heroes. We came in.  We helped get rid of the Taliban that a majority of Afghanistan did not  want running the country. And then we came in and started what appeared  to be occupying. And that probably could have been okay if we could  have helped them get a new government going and then get out.   Condoleezza Rice, as I have heard from others, relied on  recommendations to use a guy named Zalmay Khalilzad, a Pashtun. You can  be Pashtun and not be Taliban. He is not Taliban. But you can't be  Taliban and not be Pashtun, as I understand it.   And anyway, she relied heavily on him. I talked to a guy who said he  was part of the inner circle, and the decision was: What kind of  government are we going to give Afghanistan now that we have destroyed  the Taliban? Unfortunately, that shouldn't have been our decision, but  there were people who said, Look, this is a Tribal country and nothing  would fit this area better than to have strong local and state or  province governments, and then it is a Federalist society where the  national government is kind of an umbrella, but the real power is in  the provinces and the local government.   That is not what we did. The wrong people were listened to. And we  pushed a constitution through that gives the power to the President,  almost making him a dictator. The President is elected in Afghanistan,  but then he appoints the governors. He appoints the mayors. He appoints  the police chief. It just cut the local folks and the province folks  out of governing themselves.   And as my friend Massoud said: You know, look, we know you are going  to end up having to pull out some day, so please help us get an  amendment to our constitution that allows each province to elect its  own governor and allows each city and town to elect their own mayor.  Let us pick our own police chiefs, not somebody that Karzai, and now  Ghani who is President would pick, but let us pick our own leaders.   And the reasoning I thought was very sound. He said, when America  leaves Afghanistan with this strong central government where the  President has all power, all I have got to do is either knock off or  corrupt the President, and they are right back in charge of  Afghanistan.   The Taliban hate Americans, so they are going to come kill a bunch  more once they take back over Afghanistan. And then you are going to  have to come back and Americans die all over again for nothing.   If you will simply allow us to have that local provincial power so we  elect our own leaders and not have them appointed from Kabul, then,  yeah, maybe the Taliban gets one or two provinces, but the rest of us  can rise up like we did before and defeat the Taliban again, and you  don't have to have Americans die like you have for all of these years.   That made sense. But the only trouble is, the guy that helped get  Afghanistan this ridiculous constitution that has created basically a  totalitarian Presidency, that is who was negotiating with the Taliban.  There are rumors that he wanted to be President of Afghanistan at one  time himself, but  [[Page H7702]]  regardless, this guy, he gave the Bush administration bad advice. He  gave the Obama administration bad advice.   They were trying to cut a deal with the Taliban. The Taliban, you can  cut a deal with them and then they are going to cut your throat the  first chance they get.   It makes no sense. But we have people from the Bush administration  through the Obama administration. Khalilzad is still being listened to,  and he wanted to do this deal with the Pashtun brothers, the Taliban.   We don't need to be dealing with our enemies. We need to be dealing  with our allies. And this was one of the great dangers, by rejecting  those who lost family members, risked their own lives to help us take  out the Taliban, eliminate the organized Taliban originally, without a  single loss of American life, why wouldn't we want to put them in  positions of power? They can get elected, if we just--I said to  Massoud: What makes you think we could help you amend your  constitution?   And he said: You are still paying for most of our government  operations. If you threaten to pull out all of that money prematurely,  yeah, we will change the constitution. But we need your help to do it,  so you don't have to keep losing American lives here in Afghanistan.   It made so much sense. But, unfortunately, the deep state just  continues to be deep and Khalilzad has been part of that from the  beginning. He seemed like a nice guy when I met him in Iraq back in  2005. He seemed like a nice guy. He is just the wrong person to be  listened to.   Americans have continued to be killed while he has been wanting to  have peace talks with the Taliban, not with the northern or former  Northern Alliance people who risked their lives and lost family members  fighting with us and for us. Oh, no, we are not going to deal with  them. We are going to leave them. And all of the former Northern  Alliance, they know that when we leave and we cut a deal with the  Taliban or leave things so that the Taliban can take right over again,  they are all going to be killed.   Then there isn't going to be anybody in Afghanistan who will be able  to stand up and fight against the Taliban. On top of that, even if  there were, they wouldn't want to cut a deal with us, because they will  have seen the way the Northern Alliance risked lives and lost lives to  help us defeat the Taliban.   What do we do? Do we leave them high and dry? Do we allow the Taliban  to come in and kill them when we go? No. No. We need to be talking to  our friends who fought with us and got rid of all of the organized  Taliban by February or March of 2002 before we became occupiers, more  or less.   There needs to be a Federalist system there, and we need our friends,  our allies who fought the Taliban and don't want them back in positions  of authority. And I think President Ghani would be willing to do that,  but, you know, deep state just keeps getting deeper. We need to  negotiate with our friends, so they are in a position to help our  enemies not get back in control to kill Americans again.
