 Madam Speaker, I rise today as Nevadans are  facing the reality of our climate crisis head-on.   Lake Mead has reached record low levels not seen since the  construction of the Hoover Dam, and a massive heat wave has now brought  record-breaking temperatures and safety warnings.   We cannot deny the climate trajectory our country faces, and at the  same time, our State and the country are climbing out of an economic  crisis.   There is no question that the opportunity to take action on both the  economic and the climate crises is now.   That is why I am proud to have joined my colleagues in the Problem  Solvers Caucus to bring Democrats and Republicans together on an  infrastructure proposal.   We need to work together now more than ever. Our crumbling roads,  bridges, and the tools that grind the gears of our day-to-day American  life cannot support our economy and our planet without bold new  investment.   Those bold investments will create good-paying jobs in communities  across the country.   The time to deliver solutions is now.                            ____________________
