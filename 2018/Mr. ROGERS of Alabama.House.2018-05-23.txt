 Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I strongly oppose this amendment. This amendment is not about  stewardship of taxpayers' dollars, good government, or setting  priorities. Instead, this amendment is part of a broader, antinuclear  agenda that we see year in and year out.   Let's be clear about what this amendment does. It cuts $145 million  in desperately needed funding for recapitalizing nuclear weapons  production buildings dating back to the 1940s and the 1950s.   Here is a quote from General Klotz, President Obama's NNSA  Administrator, before my subcommittee a few years ago:         Our infrastructure is extensive, complex, and, in many       critical areas, several decades old. More than half of the       NNSA's approximately 6,000 real property assets are over 40       years old, and nearly 30 percent date back to the Manhattan       Project era.        Many of the enterprise's critical utility, safety, and       support systems are failing at an increasing and       unpredictable rate, which poses both programmatic and safety       risk.    That was in 2016. Folks, let me assure you, this problem has not  gotten any better since then. I know that it has only gotten worse  because I have visited all NNSA sites and have seen these deplorable  conditions firsthand.   We are asking the Nation's highly skilled scientists, engineers, and  technicians to design and build our nuclear weapons in buildings that  are literally falling down around them. We have had large chunks of  concrete fall from ceilings into operating workspaces. We have even had  tape and plastic sheathing around 40-year-old pots carrying radioactive  liquids. I have personally seen tarps hung over sensitive diagnostic  equipment to prevent leaking roofs from destroying equipment worth tens  of millions of dollars.   NNSA has a $3.7 billion backlog in deferred maintenance and repair  needs. The funding that this amendment would strip away is sorely  needed to help dig out of this hole. It is unfortunate that the  gentleman does not at least recognize that this amendment would do harm  to the safety of our workers.   I urge my colleagues to recognize this amendment for what it is and  reject this broader agenda to undercut the U.S. nuclear deterrent.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. DesJarlais), my friend and colleague and a member  of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces.  [[Page H4667]]     Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Thornberry), the full committee chairman, for any  comments he may have.    Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
