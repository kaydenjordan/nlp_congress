 Madam Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of Gold Star Spouses Day. Earlier this month, we honored  the spouses who lost a loved one in service and remember their  sacrifices.   As the son of a Navy veteran and the proud father of an Army soldier,  I recognize the challenges our military families face. It is important  to remember that our freedom is not free. Gold Star Spouses Day reminds  us of the cost of war. Each year on April 5, it is important to take  the time to remember, respect, and honor the spouses and their families  of our fallen servicemembers.   Madam Speaker, Gold Star spouses and their families deserve our  gratitude today and every day. God bless the brave men and women who  put their lives on the line to protect us and God bless their families.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  [[Page H2047]]    Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Democrat's infrastructure  bill.   We have seen a lot in the news over the last few weeks about  President Biden's not-so-much infrastructure plan. There is so much  unrelated pork in this bill that even Washington reporters are hesitant  to call it an infrastructure plan.   When we think of the word ``infrastructure,'' we think roads,  bridges, highways. We can expand further and think of ports, waterways,  and airports. Democrats so-called infrastructure plan is not really  about infrastructure--6 percent is allocated to roads, bridges, and  highways, and a mere 2 percent for airways, waterways, and ports.  Together, we are just barely getting to 8 percent of the $2.3 trillion  plan to focus on infrastructure.   But what is the rest focused on? Well, it is a wish list of  Progressive policies and it is an excuse for Democrats to give $600  billion--over half a trillion dollars--to the Green New Deal.   While I believe there is an opportunity for bipartisanship--a  successful infrastructure bill must be bipartisan--the majority must be  willing to make reasonable concessions to address our reasonable  concerns. If we do this right, it should look like a bill that we wrote  together.   This bill has the chance to fix our infrastructure, provide jobs, and  jump-start our economy following COVID-19, but it will only succeed if  Democrats choose to include Republicans and bring us to the table.
