 Mr. President, I want to start by commending my  colleagues from Georgia and Montana for their compassion and care for  our veterans and specifically for their continued efforts to ensure we  have accountability at the VA. They worked hard on this legislation. I  hope the Senate moves expeditiously to vote for it and to help our  veterans to be able to have the kind of responsibility and  accountability they deserve.                            Remembering Les Spaeth    Mr. President, I also rise today to talk about veterans. I am going  to focus on World War II veterans.   Last Monday was Memorial Day. I was in Mason, OH. I was in Warren  County, OH. My mom grew up there, and my family still has a lot of ties  there. I was there at a ceremony for the veterans memorial, one of the  most beautiful memorials in the State of Ohio. I happened to be there  about 15 years ago when it was first began, and it was great to be  back. At the ceremony, I got to see a World War II buddy of mine. His  name is Les Spaeth. He is also a good friend of my father's and  grandfather's. As always, seeing him brought back great memories, and I  was able to speak about him during my remarks.   Two days later--a few days ago--we got word that Les Spaeth died at  age 92. I want to take a moment to pay tribute to this man who gave so  much to his country and to his community.   Les was a marine corporal during World War II. He signed up after  graduating from Mason High School in 1942. He served in the Pacific,  including the occupation of Japan after the war, helping that country  make a difficult transition to democracy. Thanks in large part to  American soldiers like him, by the way, the transition worked. Japan  has become one of our greatest allies.   Les came back to Mason, OH, and started a small business called  Spaeth Brothers Cleaners. He had that optimism so many of the World War  II generation had. He had the courage to take a risk and help build  jobs and help the economy of his hometown. My dad did the same thing  after World War II.   Les was a businessman, but he was also a public servant for more than  half a century. He served six terms as Warren County auditor. He served  on the Board of Elections for 25 years. He chaired the Warren County  Republican Party for 17 years.   He was very active in the community in so many other ways too. He was  one of the very first volunteer firefighters in Mason, OH, starting way  back in 1948. He was elder at his church, Heritage Presbyterian, where  his service will be held. For 70 years, he was a freemason and member  of the American Legion. He helped set up the American Legion Buckeye  Boys Program, a great program where they are teaching young men about  State, local, and Federal government and values and leadership. His  whole life was centered around his community--through the family  business, through military service, through elected office, and through  volunteerism.   In 2009, Mason High School started having a distinguished alumni  graduation speaker every year. For all the reasons I talked about a  moment ago, a few years ago, in 2013, I wrote a letter and recommended  that they honor Les Spaeth. They agreed with me. That spring of 2013,  it was time to receive his award. He gave a beautiful speech. He talked  about his love for this country and counting our blessings as  Americans. He received a standing ovation from the graduating class. I  know that meant a lot to him. That ovation shows the respect and esteem  people in Warren County have for Les Spaeth across generations.   On behalf of Ohio, I want to express my condolences to the family of  Les Spaeth. I also want to thank them for sharing Les with the rest of  us in Ohio for these past 92 years. He was a dedicated servant to the  people of Warren County, an American hero for his military service, and  a good friend to so many.                          73rd Anniversary of D-day    As was noted, as we talk about World War II, today is also the 73rd  anniversary of D-day. As Chairman Isakson just said, it was really the  beginning of the end of that war. And 73 years ago this morning, Les  Spaeth was in theater in the Pacific, as I said, risking his life for  all of us. But in Europe on that same morning, the largest amphibious  invasion in the history of the world was taking place. Men as young as  18 years old were crossing the channel, carrying packs weighing 80  pounds. More than 160,000 Allied soldiers--mostly Americans--and more  than 5,000 ships backed by more than 10,000 aircraft were fighting to  liberate Europe from Hitler. The outcome was far from certain. The  Nazis had spent 2 years fortifying the coast to prepare for this  moment. It was Hitler's so-called Atlantic Wall. The beautiful  coastline of France was covered in barbed wire, land mines, and  bunkers.   A little more than a month before D-day, by the way, the Allies had  conducted a trial run. They practiced on beaches in western England  that were most like those of Normandy. The practice run was a disaster.  In fact, Germans spotted the Allied ships and attacked them. Hundreds  of American troops died in that practice session.   COL George Taylor told his troops as they were about to land on  Normandy: ``Only two kinds of men are going to be on this beach--the  dead, and those about to die. So get moving.'' This was  [[Page S3270]]  tough stuff. They had an enormous task, and the stakes could not have  been higher.   Erwin Rommel--and Rommel was leading the Nazi defense at that time-- said at that time: ``The fate of Germany depends on . . . the first 24  hours of this invasion.'' He was right.   Well-known historian Douglas Brinkley said that D-day was ``the  single most important moment in the 20th Century.'' It was one of the  bloodiest too. It was the beginning of the end of the most difficult  war in human history, and the lives of millions of people depended on  the outcome.   They depended on the success of brave, young Americans like Eugene  Lyons of University Heights, OH. Eugene was a medic. His ship hit a  mine in the English Channel and sank off the coast. He swam to shore  while German planes shot at him, missing him by a matter of inches. Or  the Napier brothers of Warren County, like Les Spaeth. Five brothers  all served during World War II. Two of them were there on the beaches  that day; one died. Or Jim ``Pee Wee'' Martin from Dayton, OH, who  served in the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment and parachuted behind  German lines before dawn that day. Jim received both the Purple Heart  and the Bronze Star for his service that day. Or Sigmund Czelusniak of  North Royalton, OH, who was wounded by a mortar shell on Omaha Beach.  Sigmund later said, as he lay wounded: ``In my heart, I didn't think  I'd ever come back.''   More than 10,000 Allied troops did not come back.   While those brave men and hundreds of thousands of others were  fighting, President Franklin D. Roosevelt took to the airwaves, as you  would expect a President to do. As you know, he was known for what were  called fireside chats. These were informal speeches he would give to  the Nation during difficult times. But on that day, he did something  very different. Instead of giving a speech, he was called to lead the  Nation in prayer. This prayer brought our country together. It  strengthened our resolve. It comforted us at a very difficult and  frightening time for our country, and it briefly encapsulated, as you  will hear in a second, what our purpose was--not just in World War II  but what our purpose was as Americans. He made an indelible mark on our  history.   Three years ago, after the 70th anniversary of D-day, then-President  Obama signed into law legislation that I had authored to add the words  of this famous prayer to the World War II Memorial in Washington, DC.  Since then, the site for the plaque has been approved. The architect is  continuing to work with the National Park Service on the design. I have  been told that the Park Service intends to present the design options  to the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning  Commission during their meetings this summer. Construction could begin  as soon as December and be completed by next June.   Frankly, I am discouraged this has taken so long because this prayer  belongs on the World War II Memorial, and Congress has said so. I urge  the Park Service to move as expeditiously as possible to complete this  project, to bring those words to so many veterans and others who visit  that beautiful memorial.   As has been my tradition since the time we were trying to get that  legislation passed, I would like to read the words President Roosevelt  spoke on D-day 73 years ago.   He started by saying:         My fellow Americans: Last night, when I spoke with you . .       . I knew at that moment that troops of the United States and       our allies were crossing the Channel in another and greater       operation. It has come to pass with great success thus far.       And so, in this poignant hour, I ask you to join with me in       prayer.    This was his prayer:         Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our nation, this day have       set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our       Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free       a suffering humanity. Lead them straight and true; give       strength to their arms, stoutness to their hearts,       steadfastness in their faith.        They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and       hard. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces.       Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return       again and again; and we know by Thy grace and by the       righteousness of our cause our sons will triumph. They will       be sore tried, by night and by day, without rest--until the       victory is won. The darkness will be rent by noise and flame.       Men's souls will be shaken with the violences of war.        For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They       fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end       conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice       arise, and tolerance and goodwill among all Thy people. They       yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the       haven of home.        Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive       them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom.        And for those of us at home--fathers, mothers, children,       wives, sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas, whose       thoughts and prayers are ever with them--help us, Almighty       God, to rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this       hour of great sacrifice.        Many people have urged that I call the nation into a single       day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the       desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a       continuance of prayer. As we rise to each new day, and again       when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips,       invoking Thy help to our efforts.        Give us strength, too--strength in our daily tasks, to       redouble the contributions we make in the physical and       material support of our armed forces.        And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail,       to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our       sons wheresoever they may be.        And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee; faith in       our sons; faith in each other; faith in our united crusade.       Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not       the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but       fleeting moment--let not these deter us in our unconquerable       purpose.        With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces       of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and       racial arrogances. Lead us to the saving of our country, and       with our sister nations into a world unity that will spell a       sure peace--a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy       men. And a peace that will let all men live in freedom,       reaping the just rewards of their honest toil.        Thy will be done, Almighty God. Amen.    Those were the words he spoke and the words that will soon be  inscribed on the World War II monument.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
