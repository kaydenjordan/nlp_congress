 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the legacy  and impact of Steve Berger, follower of Christ and beloved pastor,  leader, mentor, and friend.   Since Steve was called to serve the ministry more than 30 years ago,  he has been a giant in the faith. His passion, his boldness, and his  resolve in spreading love and the glory of God has been an inspiration  to so many, and has truly been a force for good in our community.   I commend the devotion to faith that marks Steve's life and has  marked the lives of many others in turn. Through Steve's courageous  preaching and wise leadership, Grace Chapel has transcended the walls  of the local church and has seen such success across our great State.   Steve has always been one to lead by example, constantly showing his  relentless love for the hurting, oppressed, and impoverished across the  globe. Steve's profound devotion has taken him to some of the farthest  comers of the world to serve, help, and save those who are suffering.  Steve has brokered peace in war-torn countries and has been a faithful,  generous, and loving friend to Israel. He has brought God's healing to  the wounded, His Word to the burdened, His sustenance to the poor, and  His hope to the persecuted.   And so it is with a glad and grateful heart that today I rise to  affirm and honor the tremendous influence of Steve Berger.                            ____________________
