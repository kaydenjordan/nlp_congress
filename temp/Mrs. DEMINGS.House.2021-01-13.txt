 Madam Speaker, five people died last week, one of them  a Capitol Police Officer who lost his life trying to protect us. The  attack and the loss of life were the culmination of the President's  calls for violence over the last five years and my colleagues' refusal  to hold him accountable.   I was in the Gallery, and after reflecting on the violent attack as a  Member of Congress and as a former law enforcement officer, it baffles  me that some of my colleagues on the other side would say that today's  vote is a ``rush to judgement.''   Well, I think it's the only appropriate response to Members of  Congress having to rush for the doors to escape the violence incited by  the President and encouraged by the Members of this body.   Madam Speaker, what happened to Congress? For we now behold mere  shadows where great men and women once stood. I remember my oath and I  intend to uphold it. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this  resolution.
