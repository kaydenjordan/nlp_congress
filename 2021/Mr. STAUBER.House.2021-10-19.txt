 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Moose Lake,  Minnesota, as they become the second Blue Ribbon City in the world,  thanks to the leadership of Moose Lake Elementary teacher Brad Hubred  and his student Piper Nielson.   For the last 13 years, Brad has taken the time to write every one of  his students a personal, handwritten letter highlighting all of the  positives he sees in them in an effort to reduce suicide.   Recently, Brad teamed up with sixth-grade student Piper Nielson to  take part in the Standing Strong Together class through the nationwide  Blue Ribbon Program, where they learned methods to inspire and uplift  others.   As ambassadors of the Blue Ribbon Program, both Brad and Piper  decided to take what they learned in the classroom and put it into  action by ordering 5,000 blue ribbons for all of the residents of the  Moose Lake community to remind them of their worth and value.   I applaud both Brad and Piper for joining such a wonderful, important  movement. Minnesota's Eighth District is a better place because of  their ongoing effort, and it is the honor of a lifetime to represent  such honorable people in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Brad, Piper, and the entire Moose Lake  community on becoming a Blue Ribbon City, and I wish them all the best  as they continue to support one another.                            ____________________
