 Madam Speaker, I rise today because every year, on  average, 36,000 Americans are killed by guns, which is equivalent to  the population of many Ohio cities. We must do more to close the  loopholes and advance sensible gun reform legislation to end this  epidemic in America.   And speaking of Ohio, where I am from and represent, according to the  Giffords Law Center's annual gun scorecard grades Ohio at an `F'. As  the Congresswoman representing Ohio's Third Congressional District,  this is something I am not proud of.   Currently at the state level, Ohio has no universal background  checks, no assault weapons restrictions, no ban on large capacity  magazines, no waiting periods, no child access prevention laws, no gun  owner licensing or registration requirements, no extreme risk  protection orders, no limit on the number of guns that can be bought at  once, and also lacks most domestic violence gun laws.   Easy gun access encourages the increased prevalence of firearms in  our communities. As someone who deeply values the families and  communities I serve, one of my top priorities is keeping them safe.   I stand proud to be a part of that push for necessary reform as a  cosponsor of the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, which would  establish checks on the transfer of firearms between private parties  and prohibits the transfer of a firearm if a preliminary background  check has not been conducted. I am also a cosponsor of the Assault  Weapons Ban Act and a number of other sensible gun violence prevention  measures.   However, we must push further and look to reform historical systemic  disparities by investing in community-based violence intervention  policies that rectify injustices in our policing, education, and  residential segregation and racial bias.   More than one in four fatal police shootings involves a Black victim,  even though Black people make up nearly 14 percent of the United States  population.   The time for action is now. As members of Congress, we have an  obligation to protect the citizens we represent and be proactive in  preventing harm to all Americans.   I urge my colleagues on the other side to come together and set aside  partisan differences before it's too late. We owe it to the victims of  gun violence; we owe it to our constituents. My fellow CBC members have  already started answering this call as we have introduced over 17  sensible gun reform and community safety bills in the 118th Congress  alone.                            ____________________
