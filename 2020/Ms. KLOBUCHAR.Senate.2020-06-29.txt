 Mr. President, I come to the floor as we start further  consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act and ask my  colleagues to pay close attention to what is included in this  legislation. No one is going to be surprised that the National Defense  Authorization Act might include something that had not gotten the  bright light of day shown on it, but I am here to say to my colleagues,  what is in this act is really egregious, and we need to correct it  before we continue to move forward.   This legislation--mostly done behind closed doors--is not unusual for  the Senate Armed Services Committee, but when you think about the  billions of dollars that we are spending, we need to make sure this  policy out here on the Senate floor is not just another rubberstamp.   We are here to look at particular provisions that I think are  troubling, particularly because it wrestles away civilian control of  our nuclear arsenal and gives it to the military--provisions that, in  the future, would allow the Defense Department to raid dollars used by  the Department of Energy for cleanup of nuclear waste, R&D for our  National Laboratories, or maybe other infrastructure investment.   I am aware that the Presiding Officer knows how much the quadrennial  review called for in investment in energy infrastructure. So I find it  troubling today to see that we are at a provision that would wrestle  away control of our nuclear arsenal and give it to the military. These  provisions are dangerous because, one, they would strip from the  Secretary of Energy the power over his own budget by requiring that he  agree to a sub-Cabinet member group of the Nuclear Weapons Council to  approve the National Nuclear Security Administration's budget.   That is right. That is why the current Energy Secretary and past  Energy Secretaries oppose this language. They oppose it because it  basically tells the Energy Secretary what the majority or a big chunk  of his budget will be, and it would allow DOD, then, to prioritize  things within the Energy budget as they saw fit for making nuclear  weapons instead of focusing on our Federal priorities of nuclear waste  cleanup, R&D that we want to see in our National Labs, or other issues  that we want to see an investment in that Energy is already doing.   I just can't even believe that this shift in control away from the  Secretary of Energy into this sub-Cabinet so that the nuclear weapons  complex would be moving away from civilians to the military is actually  in this legislation. I do not believe the Nuclear Weapons Council  understands the Department of Energy's priorities. How could they? Do  they sit in on any of the meetings for the National Labs or the waste  cleanup?   I do believe the DOD and the Nuclear Weapons Council know there is a  long history of raiding the nuclear waste cleanup budget, and other  administrations have tried this. These same individuals tried this in  2018, only to be shot down by our colleagues in the House of  Representatives. The NNSA, or the National Nuclear Security Agency, was  created in 2000 to be part of the Department of Energy, to manage both  the nuclear weapons complex and the nonproliferation activities.  Congress made them a part of the Department of Energy, not a part of  the Department of Defense. We did that because we wanted to maintain a  longstanding civilian control over the country's nuclear weapons.  Giving the DOD now control over the Nuclear Weapons Council and their  complete power over this budget gives control of our nuclear weapons to  the military.   I can't believe that we are here with all the things we have to deal  with--a COVID-19 crisis, an economic crisis, justice reform--and now we  have to worry about people, in the dark of night, changing control of  our Energy budget and turning it over to the DOD and giving them  control of our nuclear arsenal, to say nothing of the concerns I have  for what they will do to shortchange the Hanford cleanup budget, which  is a challenge to the Nation. It is an obligation that needs to be met  every year, and I guarantee you there are always people looking at the  nuclear waste cleanup budget and thinking they can either do it on the  cheap,  [[Page S3631]]  cut some of the funds early, or just skip the obligation. It is a  national obligation, and this bill undercuts it.   Yet not only does it undercut it, it would be giving the Department  of Defense greater say over building new nuclear weapons. That is  literally like obliterating some of the people here who have a say in  the budget process because, basically, it is getting rid of the checks  and balances that we have and, instead, putting this incredible process  in place.   So it is no surprise that my colleagues, the ranking member and the  chair of the Energy Committee, sent a letter in opposition to the Armed  Services Committee about this last week. I am pretty sure they have  been ignored. They were ignored before this and are continuing to be  ignored. The letter says:         Most immediately, Section 3111 would empower sub-cabinet       level officials, primarily from DOD, to make potentially       sweeping decisions about DOE's budget. We believe this goes       against good governance and is contrary to the Department of       Energy's Organization Act of 1977.    It is clear that my colleagues on the Energy Committee don't support  this. I don't know what the fake act of the NDAA bill is that somehow  you consulted with members of the Energy Committee, because I guarantee  you didn't consult with them. And now every member of the Energy  Committee has to worry about whether their priorities are going to be  set by some sub-Cabinet person over at DOD or whether they will be  questioning an Energy Secretary who will be able to give them an answer  instead of saying: Senator, I don't know; I have to go check with the  Department of Defense.   This is unacceptable. I know my colleague, Senator Manchin, has  worked on this and is trying to get a change to this legislation. I  hope that we are successful in either just pulling it out right now,  admitting it is the wrong approach and has not been discussed with the  committee of jurisdiction, or at least having our colleagues have a  vote on this.   It is unbelievable that we would be changing this big of national  policy stuck into the NDAA bill without the bright light of day shone  on it. These provisions would allow the Nuclear Weapons Council--as I  said, made up of a sub-Cabinet officials, primarily from DOD--to  require significant modifications to the DOE budget. Likely, as I said,  where else are they going to get the money but at the expense of other  critical DOE projects? I have already told you why that is so important  to me.   But let's read from their report language. Basically, they are saying  in their report language: The Secretary would be required to transmit a  proposed budget request of the NNSA to the nuclear council, and submit  it to the Office of Budget Management. That isn't like saying: Consider  this. This isn't like saying: Let's discuss this. This isn't like an  issue of saying: Here are some things we want you to better consider.   This is a total jam by the DOD, neutering the Department of Energy on  almost half of its budget, to basically say: We know better what to do.   I hope my colleagues will speak loudly and clearly about this. This  is a bipartisan issue. This is about the people we should have listened  to in the first place. I know some of my colleagues are going to say:  Wait, wait, wait. No, this is just a bureaucratic budget change. It is  an interagency thing. It is just accounting. It doesn't really mean  anything.   No, this is a very big change. That is why I oppose subtitle B of the  budget of the National Nuclear Security Administration and why my  colleagues should work in a very aggressive way to stop this  legislation with this language in it. They should take this language  out now or work with our colleagues to basically protect the Department  of Energy and the Department of Energy's budget and stop turning over  to DOD something that the U.S. Congress never had an intent to turning  over from civilian control of our nuclear weapons to the Department of  Defense   I yield the floor.
