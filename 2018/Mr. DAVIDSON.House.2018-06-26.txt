 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for working  together on this bipartisan legislation, H.R. 4311, the Foreign  Investment Risk Review Modernization Act. It addresses the intersection  of national security, intellectual property, and property rights.   We have a responsibility to protect the people of the United States  of America from threats abroad, and we also have a responsibility to  protect the system that has truly made the United States the world's  land of opportunity. We have had free flow of goods, services, capital,  ideas, and, indeed, people because we have a high functioning rule of  law here in America.   How can the entrepreneur living the American Dream truly thrive in  the spirit of enterprise when competing against a foreign state? But  that is the very state that he is up against a lot of times in trade as  an entrepreneur seeks to grow a corporation backed by a foreign  government.   This legislation addresses many of these types of concerns--countries  acting as companies that pose threats to our national security--and  this legislation has been done in a bipartisan, constructive manner,  and I appreciate the input and efforts from Members of both sides of  the aisle as well as those in the administration and the private sector  who have helped make this meaningful legislation what it is today.
