 Madam Speaker, there are few times in our  lives when we really get to honor true heroes. Today is one of those  days that we have by naming a post office after him.   I am going to read through this document that I have to give you an  idea of just who Captain Andrew Gomer Williams was.   Now, this is at a dedication. It starts off with: ``Monuments are as  old as our race and all along the history of the dim and dusty age down  to the bright and joyous present we have been perpetuating the memory  of heroic men.''   These elegant words, so very appropriate this morning, are not mine  but were the actual words of Andrew Gomer Williams, whose monument we  gather here this morning to dedicate.   He delivered them in a speech on September 11, 1889, on the  Gettysburg Battlefield during ceremonies dedicating the monument to his  regiment, the 63rd Pennsylvania Volunteers, who fought during the  famous battle on July 1 through July 3 in 1863.   Much like they gathered on that field 132 years ago, we gather here  today on this field to perpetuate the memory of a heroic man.   Ironically, Williams, who fought for the Union, was born in Richmond,  Virginia, the capital of the Confederacy on September 8, 1840, to a  Welsh immigrant father and an eastern Maryland mother.                                time  1600    His family moved from Richmond to Pittsburgh in 1847 and from  Pittsburgh to Etna 1 year later. The recipient of very little  education, Andrew Williams went to work as a nail cutter in the local  factory at the young age of 10. He was a fourth grader.   Maybe it was the sense of patriotism that swelled in Andrew Williams'  heart, or maybe it was wanting to escape the dullness of factory work  for the great unknown adventure of war, but regardless of the reason,  we do know that at age 21, in 1861, Mr. Williams was helping to raise  three companies of men to become part of the newly created 63rd  Pennsylvania Volunteers and leave the smoky city of Pittsburgh for the  battlefields of his native South.   He was elected captain of Company E but declined the honor and the  rank to initially serve as their third sergeant when their 3 years of  service began on September 9, 1861.   He was promoted to 2nd lieutenant on the field during the Second  Battle of Bull Run in 1862, and then in the spring of 1863 he was  promoted to the rank of captain of Company E of the 63rd Pennsylvania  Volunteers. He fought in over a dozen battles and was wounded four  times including at the Charles City Crossroads on June 30, 1862, and  again at the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862.   1863 would find Williams leading his men at the Battles of  Chancellorsville and Gettysburg. During the Battle of the Wilderness on  May 5, 1864, Williams was thought to have been mortally wounded after  being struck in the left temple by a Confederate minie' ball and left  for dead. Miraculously, he was found barely alive 4 days later on the  Wilderness battlefield.   According to his great-granddaughter Mary Caroline Baker Hunt,  Williams' life was saved by falling wounded inside the muddy boundaries  of a spring with the muddy soil saving his temple wound from infection  and providing him with much-needed water. He was mustered out with the  rest of his regiment on August 6, 1864. But Williams would carry the  external scars from the near fatal wound for the rest of his life.   After his return home to Etna, he was unable to find work for the  next 3 years due to his wounds. He entered Duff's Business College in  Pittsburgh to become a bookkeeper and also read law at home.   In 1868, following his father's death in a boiler explosion at the  Fort Pitt Foundry, he was forced to return to cutting nails in the Etna  rolling mill to help support his family while continuing his law  studies at night. Besides his father's tragic death, Williams,  throughout his life, experienced the deaths of 13 members of his family  by explosions, railroad accidents, burnings, and drowning.   In spite of all the personal and family trauma, Andrew G. Williams,  marched on and came to Butler in 1875, and upon being admitted to the  Butler bar the following year, immediately formed a partnership with  Alexander Mitchell. This partnership would last until Mitchell's death  40 years later.   During these four decades together, the men claimed to have never had  an argument or ever having signed a lease for their office on the  Diamond with their word as their bond. The only day in the entire  history of their practice they did not open was when both men's Civil  War regiments were holding reunions on the same date in Pittsburgh. The  two lawyers closed up shop every day at precisely 4:45. It was said  that people along their walking route home  [[Page H9672]]  could set their watches by their passing.   The house Andrew Williams came home to each night he built himself in  1887 for his second wife and three sons and daughter and for his three  children from his deceased first wife.   Williams' military service in the Civil War continued to play an  important role in his life with his membership in the local chapter of  the Grand Army of the Republic, or GAR, a Civil War veterans' group,  and contributing his time to help those survivors scarred by the  effects of the war. He helped Civil War soldier spouses whose husbands  had served and had died to get them the benefits that they deserved.    He also volunteered serving on the Board  of Directors of the Civil War Orphans' Home that was located on  Butler's Institute Hill from 1867 until moving to Mercer, Pennsylvania,  in 1905.   Outside of his legal practice and his Civil War-related activities,  Mr. Williams served one term in the Pennsylvania House of  Representatives and 4 years in the Pennsylvania State Senate. He also  served for 20 years as the choir director of Butler's First Methodist  Church and rose to the rank of Grand Commander, Knights of the Templar  of the State of Pennsylvania in the Masons.   After a full life devoted to his Nation, his church, his community,  and--most importantly--his family, Andrew Gomer Williams died in his  North McKean Street home on April 6, 1923, from pneumonia at the age of  83 at 10:40 that morning. Fittingly, for a man who had been a soldier  in the Civil War, his funeral and burial were held on April 9, the same  day, only 58 years earlier, that Robert E. Lee had surrendered his  Confederate Army to Union General Ulysses S. Grant at a place called  Appomattox Courthouse, Virginia.   Now, the finish to this speech is not mine. But I think it is so  relevant as to where we are today. Allow me to conclude my speech today  the same as it began with the eloquent words spoken at Gettysburg by  Andrew Gomer Williams well over a century ago.   Mr. Williams said:         We have met again on this field after so many years to       perpetuate the memory and render our faint and feeble tribute       of praise to the valor of those Pennsylvania soldiers.    Especially at this time in our history, these are the heroes we  should be naming buildings and Post Offices with. It has taken a long  time to get to this point.    Madam Chair, I thank you for working together on this.   I do hope people listen to these words. These are the true heroes of  America. These should be the examples that we all try to live by today.  In a country that is getting too far apart and needs to get back  together, this guy is a hero. This guy deserves as much time as we can  give him.
