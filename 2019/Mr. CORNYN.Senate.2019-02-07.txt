 Mr. President, today, the Senate Judiciary Committee held  a vote on William Barr to be the next Attorney General of the United  States.   During his confirmation hearing a few weeks ago, we saw an  articulate, measured, and highly capable individual. There is no  question in my mind why two separate Presidents have selected him to  lead the Department of Justice.   Throughout his impressive career, Mr. Barr has displayed both legal  acumen and an unwavering commitment to the rule of law--a basic  prerequisite to serve as the highest law enforcement officer in the  country.   I will add that the Attorney General is a unique member of the  Cabinet because, as I said, he is the chief law enforcement officer of  the country, but he is also a political appointee of the President. It  takes some skill to navigate that very thin line and to do it with  distinction and honor--something that Mr. Barr has done before.   President George Herbert Walker Bush recognized the talent in Mr.  Barr more than 25 years ago and nominated him for not one, not two, but  three important roles in the Department of Justice.   Mr. Barr testified before the Judiciary Committee for each of these  positions: Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel,  Deputy Attorney General, and, finally, Attorney General of the United  States. All three times, he was unanimously approved by the Senate.   As impressive as Mr. Barr was during these confirmation hearings, he  was even more impressive once he was actually on the job. It is clear  he made a lasting impression on his colleagues at the Department of  Justice.   A group of 120 former Justice Department and law enforcement  officials have written a letter to the chairman and ranking member of  the Judiciary Committee supporting Mr. Barr's nomination. The list  includes former Attorneys General and Deputy Attorneys General, FBI  Directors and Deputy Directors, a Department of Homeland Security  Secretary, and a host of high-ranking DOJ officials.   They wrote: ``Bill is that rare combination of intellect and  principle who has served our country in the Department of Justice with  great distinction and then excelled as a senior executive in the  private sector.''   They continued: ``Bill also developed great partnerships with state  and local law enforcement around the country through the Department's  Executive Working Group, creating joint task forces to combat white  collar crime, drug trafficking and violent crime across the nation.''   Knowing that, it is no surprise he received the endorsement of  several organizations that represent law enforcement, like the  International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs  Association, the Fraternal  [[Page S1149]]  Order of Police, the Major County Sheriffs of America, and the National  Narcotics Officers' Associations' Coalition, as well as others.   I quote our friend, the ranking member Dianne Feinstein herself, who  said: ``No one can say he isn't qualified.''   We are fortunate to have such an individual who is willing to, once  again, step back into the spotlight to serve his country. To me, that  speaks volumes.   It would be the easiest thing in the world for Mr. Barr to say: Well,  I have been there and done that. Now I have worked in the private  sector, been a success, and I am ready to hang it up or at least enjoy  my retirement years with my grandkids and my wife.   That is not Bill Barr. Bill Barr is a person driven by his sense of  duty and his desire to serve the American people. To me, that is one of  the distinctions about him that impresses me the most.   It would be easy for him to take a walk and to not accept this  responsibility during these polarized times, but he is willing to  serve, and I think we ought to embrace that willingness to serve and  confirm him.   I was proud to support Mr. Barr's nomination in the Judiciary  Committee today, and I look forward to voting yes on his nomination  next week when we vote on it.   Although Mr. Barr's name has been in the headlines, there are also a  number of well-qualified nominees for Federal judgeships across the  United States who were reported out of the Judiciary Committee today,  including four Texans. They are J. Campbell Barker and Michael Truncale  to be U.S. district judges for the Eastern District of Texas, Matthew  Kacsmaryk to be U.S. district judge for the Northern District of Texas,  and David Morales to be U.S. district judge for the Southern District  of Texas. These individuals are principled and highly qualified for the  Federal bench.   Senator Cruz and I worked closely with our Federal Judicial  Evaluation Committee--a bipartisan committee of the best lawyers in the  State of Texas--to screen these individuals and then make  recommendations to the White House. I am confident in their ability to  serve Texans by faithfully applying the law, and I hope the Senate will  move quickly to confirm them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, following the President's call  for unity and bipartisanship in his State of the Union Address earlier  this week, I am glad to see the Senate responding to that call and  taking up legislation that we are currently on that has received broad  bipartisan support in the Senate just today.   Near the end of the last Congress, the Senate and the House reached  an agreement on a package of more than 100 individual lands bills that  received broad bipartisan support. Unfortunately, we ran out of time  and weren't able to get it done, but next week, we will have the  opportunity to vote on this important piece of legislation and send  this bipartisan bill to the President's desk and demonstrate, once  again, to the American people--lest anybody be in doubt--that we are  capable of working together in a bipartisan way in advancing the  interests of the American people.   Throughout my time in the Senate, I have been an advocate for  America's outdoor sporting traditions and commonsense wildlife  conservation policies. Enhancing and expanding sportsmen's access to  Federal lands has been on Congress's to-do list for years, and this  legislation will help make that a reality.   This package includes a series of bipartisan provisions negotiated  over years, which will provide increased opportunities for sportsmen  and sportswomen to utilize Federal lands for hunting and fishing. Those  changes are coupled with additional ones for conserving and enhancing  wildlife habitats to ensure we are protecting these lands for  generations to come.   This legislation also authorizes dozens of land swaps--exchanges--and  conveyances, which will deliver big changes to communities across the  country, including in my State.   For example, the Lake Fannin recreation area was once a thriving  tourist attraction for Texas, but, through the years, it has become  dilapidated due to the inability of the Forest Service to properly do  maintenance.   The county has now developed a comprehensive plan to manage that land  for recreation, and this bill will restore local control to more than  2,000 acres in Fannin County, TX.   This legislation will also protect property owners along the Red  River--the border between Texas and Oklahoma--who have faced  uncertainty following a flawed Bureau of Land Management survey under  the previous administration. This legislation will assure these  landowners that the Federal Government has no rightful claim and will  make no claim to their property.   Again, I look forward to debating this legislation in the coming  days, and I hope we can pass this bill, which will allow for the  responsible development and conservation of land across our country.   I see no Senators seeking the floor, so I yield the floor.                            ____________________
