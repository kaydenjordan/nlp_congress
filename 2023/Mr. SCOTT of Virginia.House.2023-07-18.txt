 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I speak in opposition to H.R. 3941, the scapegoating not  solutions act. It is frustrating that we are taking up another proposal  that, among other things, purports to improve school safety, yet does  nothing to address school safety, does nothing to address learning  loss, does nothing to address gun violence in the schools or improve  students' mental health.   Regrettably, so far this Congress, House Republicans' priorities for  K-12 education focused entirely on culture wars.   First, they passed legislation that would facilitate the banning of  books. Then the House advanced a bill to seek to bar trans students  from participating in sports activities.   House Republicans are currently working on a budget that makes  devastating cuts to Federal support of education.   Now the House is considering yet another proposal to threaten to  strip away funding from schools and institutions of higher learning if  they use any of their facilities to temporarily house asylum seekers or  undocumented immigrants in an emergency other than those caused by a  disaster.   The message is clear: If you do not support this extreme agenda,  congressional Republicans will pull your support for education.   Republicans have also falsely implied that temporarily using school  facilities to provide shelter diverts educational resources from  students already impacted by learning loss, and yet, they present no  evidence to support this claim.   We can't meaningfully address learning loss or meet students' mental  health needs if we are talking about taking away Federal funds from  schools and institutions of higher learning that are not aligned with  the Republicans' extreme agenda.   Republicans also claim that this bill is about school safety. Let's  remember that this bill prohibits emergency sheltering of undocumented  immigrants except due to disasters.   If it is not a disaster, and it is an emergency, you can't house the  immigrants. If it is not an emergency, there is no prohibition. You can  house the undocumented immigrants all year just so long as it is not an  emergency. If it is a disaster, there is no prohibition.   You can also house other people. If it is school safety, how about  housing defendants awaiting trial in pretrial detention or those on  work release? How about housing them? No prohibition against that.   This isn't about school safety. We can't talk about protecting school  safety without addressing gun violence. The reality is that Republicans  have done nothing about gun violence in schools, which we know causes  the greatest threat to our children's safety.   We have repeatedly said that any conversation about school safety  that doesn't meaningfully address gun violence is not a serious  conversation.   H.R. 3941 does not address the real issues confronting our students  today, and that is ending gun violence and helping students address  learning loss and threatens to take funds away from  [[Page H3675]]  schools and institutions of higher learning.   I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose the bill and reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, prior to yielding to the  gentleman from New York, I yield myself 1 minute to remind the  gentleman about what his bill actually does. It does not prohibit the  sheltering of anyone other than undocumented immigrants in an emergency  short term. I mean, long term and not in an emergency, that is okay.  Other people, that is okay.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Goldman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Vasquez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from Third Way  urging Members to stand up for students across the country and vote  ``no'' on this bill.  [[Page H3678]]                           [From Third Way, July 18, 2023]            Third Way Statement on the Schools Not Shelters Act                            (By Lanae Erickson)         Washington.--Third Way released the following statement       from Lanae Erickson, Senior Vice President for Social Policy,       Education, & Politics:        ``House Republicans have found another target for their       'defund' campaign: schools. The Schools Not Shelters Act       would pull federal funding from any school that provides       undocumented immigrants with shelter, even temporarily. By       bringing this bill to the House floor, majority is yet again       signaling that their priority is to put politics over the       welfare of our country's students.        ``During a time when teachers and students are working       tirelessly to overcome learning loss from the pandemic,       Republicans are threatening to defund schools to protest       something that has nothing to do with students' quality of       education. What's worse, schools in the poorest communities       across the country are the targets of this political stunt.       If Republicans really cared about students, they'd work with       Democrats to invest in our nation's schools and improve       educational outcomes. Instead, they're focusing on banning       books, banning history, and banning migrants. Teachers and       students have much bigger things to worry about.        ``Republicans have backed out of every major bipartisan       immigration reform deal this century, leaving the system       outdated and overwhelmed. And now they're punishing American       students for the consequences of their inaction.        ``We urge all Members to stand up for students across this       country and vote `no' on this bill.''     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record another  letter from Council of the Great City Schools pointing out that the  bill does nothing to help urban school districts and communities  provide the needed educational and transitional services for newly  arriving students and families.                              Council of the Great City Schools,                                                      June 12, 2023.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chairwoman, Committee on Education and Workforce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and Workforce, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: For more       than a century, urban schools have taken in children and       families from other countries who came to the United States       seeking a better life and who eventually served as the       backbone of the country. The nation's Great City Schools seek       to not only meet our legal obligations to provide educational       services to whomever comes through our doors but to do       everything we can in partnership with our local communities       to make sure that newly arriving students and families are       welcomed and prepared to give back to the country.        In recent years, the nation's urban public schools have       opened their doors to families from Afghanistan, Ukraine,       Cuba, Haiti, Guatemala, Vietnam, Sudan, and many other       countries as they were seeking refuge, freedom, and a better       tomorrow. In addition to providing newcomer aid, instruction,       and social services to students, the Great City Schools are       helping families find housing, coordinating community       services, and providing much of their initial social       contacts, translations, and food services. They have also       provided cultural orientations, language lessons, and other       assistance for refugee families upon their arrival. The       Council has examples from school districts across the       country--including Anchorage, Sacramento, Indianapolis, St.       Louis, Tulsa, Charlotte, and countless other cities--that are       working with their local agencies, faith-based leaders,       charities, and financial institutions to welcome new       arrivals, align and coordinate services, and create a       seamless transition into the public schools and the       community.        Unfortunately, the Schools Not Shelters Act (H.R. 3941)       before the committee does nothing to help urban school       districts and communities provide the needed educational and       transitional services for newly arriving students and       families. After decades of inaction, we urge Congress to       focus on bipartisan and comprehensive solutions to address       immigration reform rather than threatening federal funding or       intervening in local decision-making regarding housing for       those who need it.            Sincerely,                                                      Raymond Hart,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that my Republican colleagues are  forcing through another proposal that contradicts our responsibility to  help students succeed.   This bill threatens to take funding away from schools if they are  used for emergency shelter to shelter undocumented immigrants, except  specifically exempting cases of disaster. It allows anyone else to be  sheltered, just not undocumented immigrants in an emergency.   We should be focusing on helping students make up for learning loss.  They were out of school for a long time. Last Congress, congressional  Democrats took critical steps to actually address learning loss by  passing the American Rescue Plan Act, investing in students' abilities  to offer after-school and summer mentorship and tutorial programs, yet  not a single congressional Republican voted to pass the American Rescue  Plan Act.   Now, they are seeking to pass a bill that takes funding away from  public schools while also considering a budget that makes dangerous  cuts to Federal educational funding.   If my colleagues want to address learning loss, we should be talking  about evidence-based strategies that actually meet the needs of  students.   If my colleagues want to keep students safe, we should be confronting  what is actually killing them. Parents, teachers, and students are  demanding that we take meaningful action on gun violence. Yet, my  Republican colleagues refuse to budge on that issue.   Instead of coming up with meaningful solutions, Republicans are  continuing to push their extreme agenda that does nothing to address  learning loss or improve school safety.   We should all agree that our students, parents, and schools deserve  better.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is hard to respond to the amendment because the  underlying bill makes little sense. I am not sure what the amendment  does because if the amendment is passed, undocumented immigrants would  be properly sheltered in the schools because there is an exemption for  disasters. After 72 hours, 3 days if the disaster is still going on, I  guess you would have to kick them out to avoid liability, unless the  emergency is over. If there is no longer an emergency and they are not  being housed under an emergency, they can't be housed because only  emergency sheltering is allowed.   I don't know if this is good or bad, but I just oppose it, and I  yield back the balance of my time
