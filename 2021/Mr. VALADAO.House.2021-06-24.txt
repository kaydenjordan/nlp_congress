 Madam Speaker, I rise today to request an urgent  response to California's drought.   Since returning to Congress, I have introduced two pieces of critical  water legislation. I have stood here before my colleagues asking the  House majority to address the drought. I have requested hearings be  held and sent letters. Yet, the majority has done nothing to help those  suffering from this crisis.   Communities in my district, like Avenal, Coalinga, and Huron, totally  rely on 100 percent of their water from the delta. That is about 37,000  of my constituents relying solely on the delta for water.   My bill, the NEED Water Act, would allow communities like these and  communities growing our food the ability to purchase and transfer water  more easily.   As if water wasn't scarce enough, now communities in my district,  like Teviston, are completely out of water. They are forced to rely on  bottled water delivery programs to receive water because their wells  have failed. It is only a matter of time before there are more towns in  my district in the same situation as Teviston.   I implore my colleagues across the aisle to work with me to combat  this crisis. This is an emergency, and it is unacceptable to stand back  and watch these communities suffer and completely run out of water  while the real solutions available can bring immediate relief.                            ____________________
