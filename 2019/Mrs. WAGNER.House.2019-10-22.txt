 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. McHenry), ranking member, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2513, the Corporate  Transparency Act. I thank my friend, Carolyn Maloney, for her  tremendous work to fight trafficking and expose criminals who make  money for exploitation; and my friend and colleague, Blaine  Luetkemeyer, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Consumer  Protection and Financial Institutions for all his work on this issue of  beneficial ownership.   I agree with my colleagues that we should not place unnecessary  requirements on small businesses, and I believe that this legislation  strikes the right balance.   It helps hardworking law enforcement officials expose traffickers who  are laundering money through shell companies without placing onerous  mandates on small businesses.   Human trafficking is an incredibly lucrative industry, with profits  estimated at $150 billion a year. America lags behind our peers in  other countries in collecting the beneficial ownership information that  helps us to go after these anonymous companies that are exploiting the  most vulnerable in our society.   Mr. Speaker, my amendment further simplifies the reporting process,  and prevents identity theft and fraud. It creates a fast-tracked  process for beneficial ownership where any citizen who is a frequent  investor can be pre-verified. I am glad to see my amendment included in  this underlying bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' so  that Congress can finally close the loopholes that allow criminals to  rapidly move money and conceal illicit profits in the U.S. banking  process.
