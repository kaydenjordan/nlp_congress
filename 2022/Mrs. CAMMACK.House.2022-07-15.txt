 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record some articles  that I feel are relevant to this debate.                  [From the New York Times, July 3, 2022]                       Abortion Laws Around the World         The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on abortion quickly led to       bans in at least eight states, a shift toward criminalization       that runs counter to recent easings in countries that had       longstanding bans.        The Supreme Court's elimination of the constitutional right       to abortion, after nearly a half-century, has made the United       States one of the few countries actively strengthening       abortion restrictions.        Abortion is now banned in at least eight states, a shift       toward criminalization that runs counter to the longstanding       policies of some close allies, like Canada, and to recent       easings in several nations that had long imposed bans, like       Ireland, Mexico and South Korea.        But no nations share the same history regarding abortion,       nor does any part of the world have uniform laws: Women       seeking abortions everywhere must navigate distinct rules, in       a variety of health care systems, if access is available at       all. The following examples, while not comprehensive,       illustrate the diversity of those laws--and how they're       changing.                                    Canada         No laws restrict abortion in Canada, where it is covered by       provincial and territorial public health care systems as an       essential medical procedure within 20 weeks of conception       and, under some circumstances, after that point, such as when       a pregnancy threatens the mother's life. Access and       exceptions vary by province, and sometimes by hospital.        Until 1988, criminal laws allowed abortions only if       approved by committees of physicians. That year, the Supreme       Court struck down the laws in a landmark case. Most legal       scholars agree that if the issue were to reach the court       again, it would make the right to abortion explicit.--Ian       Austen                                    Mexico         Before a court ruling last year, abortion was largely       restricted, with Mexico City and only three of 31 states       permitting the procedure up to 12 weeks of fetal gestation.       But the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in the fall that       penalizing women who undergo abortions was unconstitutional,       and in the months since, five more states have moved to       legalize abortions.        The justices did not specify how far into a pregnancy       abortion was permitted, leaving the details to the states.       For the states that still ban abortion, legislatures will       need to change laws to permit the procedure.--Maria Abi-Habib                                  nicaragua         Abortion is completely illegal and punishable by jail for       the woman and the doctors.        The Legislature eliminated all exceptions in 2006, ending a       century of law that allowed abortions in cases of life-      threatening complications or pregnancies caused by rape.       President Daniel Ortega, a strong supporter of criminalizing       abortion, has received support from Evangelical leaders in       Nicaragua and the United States.--Yubelka Mendoza and Maria       Abi-Habib                                   Britain         Abortions have been legal in England, Scotland and Wales       for more than 50 years, protected by the Abortion Act of       1967. Abortions can be legally performed up to the 24th week       of pregnancy and must be medically approved by two doctors.        The 1967 law allows some exceptions for later-term       abortions, including when the pregnancy endangers the woman's       health or if a prenatal scan reveals a fetus abnormality. A       provision of the law allowing abortion if the fetus carries       significant risk of serious disability was at the center of a       court case last year.        In rare circumstances, such as when a woman, without       doctors' consent, takes medicine intended to terminate a       pregnancy, an abortion could be prosecuted as a criminal act.        The 1967 law did not cover Northern Ireland, which for       decades prohibited almost all abortions.        British lawmakers overturned that ban in 2019, legalizing       ``unconditional termination'' of pregnancy within the first       12 weeks. But with resistance coming from anti-abortion and       church groups, abortion services remain limited.--Saskia       Solomon                                   Ireland         A 1983 constitutional amendment banned nearly all abortion,       reflecting the Roman Catholic Church's deep influence in the       country. That influence had waned by 2018, when a referendum       to end the ban was approved by 66 percent of voters.        Lawmakers then legalized abortion in the Health Act of       2018, allowing abortion for any reason up to the end of the       first trimester. The law provides exceptions beyond 12 weeks       in cases of fetal abnormalities considered fatal after birth       or a potential risk to the woman's health.--Saskia Solomon                                    Poland         Soviet-era Poland offered some of Europe's broadest       abortion access, and it became a destination for women       seeking abortions. But after the Soviet Union's collapse, and       under the influence of the Catholic Church, the Polish       Parliament in 1993 passed one of Europe's strictest bans,       asserting that ``every human being shall have an inherent       right to life from the moment of conception.''        It allowed three categories of exception: danger to the       mother's health or life; rape or incest; severe fetal       abnormalities.        Despite mass protests, the ban was tightened last year by       the nationalist Law and Justice Party, eliminating the most-      used exception--fetal abnormalities--which accounted for       almost all of the roughly 1,000 legal abortions a year. An       estimated 100,000 to 150,000 illegal abortions take place       very year in the country, activists say.        The remaining exceptions are problematic for abortion       seekers. Rape victims face a deadline of the 12th week of       pregnancy, and they require a certificate from a prosecutor,       which takes a long time to acquire. And the definition of       what constitutes a ``serious'' risk to a woman's health is       too vague for doctors to always act decisively. In a small       number of cases, women have died of sepsis after doctors       refused to intervene while the fetus's heart was still       beating.        Women cannot be punished for taking an abortion pill or       undergoing an abortion abroad.        Anyone deemed to have aided or abetted an illegal abortion       faces up to eight years in prison.--Katrin Bennhold                                    India         A total ban was eased in 1971 with the Medical Termination       of Pregnancy Act, which made some abortions legal.        But activists continued to seek further easing, to include       abortion in cases of fetal anomaly or pregnancy caused by       rape. In 2021, the federal government amended the law,       expanding the criteria for legal abortions and adding a       privacy clause to protect women who went to clinics.        The law allows women to terminate pregnancies until 20       weeks. Between 20 and 24 weeks, a woman needs two doctors to       approve an abortion, and after 24 weeks, abortions are       allowed only when the woman's health is at risk. Women can       now terminate unwanted pregnancies caused by contraceptive       failure regardless of marital status; before the amendment,       only a married couple could do that.        Still, abortions done in violation of the law are       punishable by up to seven years in prison for the woman and       medical personnel.--Sameer Yasir                                    China         Abortion has been legal in some form since 1953. By the       1970s, as the ruling Chinese Communist Party grew       increasingly worried about overpopulation, abortion became       more widely accessible, and the one-child policy led to some       forced abortions.        Sex-selective abortions are illegal, meant to counter the       widespread preference for boys over girls. In response to       recent concerns over declining birthrates and an aging       population, families may now have three children without       penalty. Given the government's invasive family planning       policies, some women fear it will restrict abortion access.       The authorities last year said they intended to reduce       ``medically unnecessary abortions,'' without explaining how.        Access to abortion services varies by region, with some       requiring women to produce certificates of medical necessity.       In Jiangxi Province, women who are more than 14 weeks       pregnant need three signatures from medical personnel.        Scholars, activists and some foreign governments have       accused the authorities of using family planning policies to       suppress ethnic minorities, which the government denies.--      Vivian Wang                                    Kenya         Under the 2010 Constitution, abortion is permitted if a       trained health professional determines a need for emergency       treatment, or if the pregnancy endangers the life or health       of the mother. In other circumstances, abortion providers can       face up to 14 years in prison under Kenya's penal code.        In practice, many women who could obtain a legal abortion       cannot because of poverty, lack of access to health services       or a lack of information about their rights.--Matthew Mpoke       Bigg                                    Benin         Last fall, Benin joined South Africa and Mozambique as one       of the few African countries to broadly legalize abortion       within 12 weeks.        Under the new law, abortion will be allowed ``when the       pregnancy is likely to aggravate or cause a situation of       material, educational, professional or moral distress       incompatible with the interest of the woman and/or the unborn       child.'' In doing so, Benin became the third country in       Africa, along with Ethiopia and Zambia, to allow abortion       based on the social or economic needs of the woman.        The previous law authorized abortion only if the pregnancy       endangered the woman's life or was the result of rape or       incest, or if the fetus was malformed. The new law will take       effect after the authorities detail how it will be applied,       which could take months.--Elian Peltier                                    Egypt         A strict anti-abortion law has been on the books for 85       years, derived from the French Penal Code of the colonial era       that bans the procedure under nearly any circumstances. The       woman and doctor face imprisonment if convicted.        It does have one loophole, which is based on the medical       code of ethics: Doctors are allowed--but not legally       obligated--to terminate a pregnancy if it puts the woman's       life  [[Page H6637]]       at risk and she signs a document saying the procedure was       lifesaving.        Though convictions are uncommon, the law and social stigma       have pushed abortion practices out of public sight, where the       woman's safety cannot be protected and the procedure can be       prohibitively expensive.--Nada Rashwan                                    Turkey         Since 1983, abortion has been legal up to 10 weeks after       conception. Married women need spousal consent. The law       allows exceptions after 10 weeks when the pregnancy threatens       the life of the woman, if the doctor concludes the fetus has       a grave disability, and in cases of rape.        Violators face prosecution and prison--for both the woman       and the doctor.        Abortion remains a divisive issue. In 2012, Recep Tayyip       Erdogan, now the president and then prime minister, called       abortion murder and urged more restrictions. After popular       outrage, the law was never amended, but in practice, abortion       services are unavailable in many state hospitals--Safak Timur                                   ____                      [From CATHOLICVOTE, June 9, 2022]    Summer of Rage: Tracking Attacks on Pregnancy Centers and Pro-Life                                   Groups                       attacks since supreme court leak         CV News Feed--More than 50 pregnancy resource centers and       offices of pro-life groups have been attacked and vandalized       since a draft Supreme Court opinon overturning Roe v. Wade       was leaked in early May. Pro-abortion domestic terrorists       have claimed responsibility--and are promising more attacks       in a ``summer of rage''.        Pregnancy centers are bracing for more attacks and acts of       vandalism after the Supreme Court issued its final ruling       overturning Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022. The Department of       Homeland Security issued a memo the same day warning that       ``domestic violent extremists'' would exploit the decision to       commit acts of violence against various targets, specifically       naming Jane's Revenge. Various terror groups have issued       threats against them on social media since the decision was       made, with one group urging its followers to ``mask up, stay       dangerous''.        Some attacks are going unreported because pregnancy       resource centers want to protect their clients.

You know, I never thought that I would have to stand here on the House  floor and debate the fact that killing someone for their gender, their  sex, their race--but here we are.   We are debating a bill that is being pushed by my colleagues on the  other side that would legalize abortions based on a baby's sex, race,  or potential disability. I am going to say that again because I think  that is perhaps the most outrageous, horrific, regressive, sexist, and  racist part of this legislation.   This bill allows for abortions up until the day of natural delivery  because the child maybe isn't the right sex or the right race,  according to the mother, who is a woman, by the way. We need to stop  this lie that suddenly abortion is healthcare--it is not.   I have heard repeatedly talk about this 10-year-old girl who was  brutally raped--this is a heartbreaking situation--yet, not a single  peep about the man who did this. He was an illegal who crossed our  border, who never should have been in our country in the first place,  who committed this crime. Not one peep.   In our country, we are based really, quite frankly, on a simple  notion that we are of equal opportunity, not equal outcome. Abortion,  that is equal outcome. We know the outcome.   All I am asking today is that my colleagues think a little bit  critically about what they are doing and what they are saying, the  message that they are sending--that they believe in equal outcome, not  opportunity because they are, quite frankly, denying the right for  every single one of these children the opportunity to live.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle to stop lying. Stop lying. Roe did not make  abortion illegal, it returned the issue to the  [[Page H6652]]  States. Now we see that you all want to take those rights away from the  States--strip them, in fact.   Under this bill that we are considering here today, you want to take  this issue further than Roe ever did and take away the rights of  children, those most vulnerable. The notion that women will somehow be  stopped at checkpoints, in some 1984 scenario, this is insane and  political fear-mongering at its best. You know that. You know that.   I hear constantly about these ``extreme positions'' that  conservatives and those in the pro-life movement are taking, but what  is extreme is not taking a stand for the child that survives an  abortion attempt. That is extreme. Denying medical care for that child,  that is the extreme.   Madam Speaker, I always say--and bless your heart, 36 years of  service, that is incredible, 2 years longer than I have been alive.     Madam Speaker, in that 36 years of service, Madam  Speaker, 60 million children have been murdered, with over 30 percent  of them being minorities, African Americans and Hispanics.   It is curious logic that we murder these children to empower them.   Where were the rights of those young, little girls that were  murdered? They didn't have a voice.   Yet here we are debating the fact that this is a right. A right?   No, no, no. This is an issue that has gone back to the States. Not an  issue for us here in this Chamber to be deciding, when we know that  this Nation is based on life: life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. It starts at life.   The extreme positions, they are being held on that side of the aisle.  We are a Nation of equal opportunity, not equal outcome. We know that  abortion is equal outcome. Give those children the opportunity to live.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this ridiculous  bill.
