 Mr. Speaker, first, I love this 1 minute, and  I try not to abuse it too much, but I am going to right now.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start off by thanking Chairman Kevin Brady and  all of the members of the House Ways and Means Committee for this job  well done.   Mr. Speaker, we are in a generational defining moment for our  country, and what we are doing here--what we are doing here--is not  just determining the kind of Tax Code we are going to have, what we are  doing here is determining the kind of country we are going to have.   Right now, because of this anemic economic recovery--don't forget, we  had the worst recession in our lifetimes in 2008, and ever since then  this economy has been flat. This economy has been way under its  potential. This economy has been growing at a limp 1 to 2 percent.   Do you know what that means for hardworking taxpayers? Do you know  what that means for Americans? Nobody gets a wage increase. Living  standards are stagnant. Economic anxiety is high.   Seventy-eight percent of our workers in this country today are living  paycheck to paycheck. Most Americans say that they don't even have $500  in their bank account for an unexpected emergency or an expense. This  is the economic anxiety that is for real in this country today. Instead  of thinking about getting ahead, families are just struggling to get  by.   Think about all the moms and the dads and the hardworking taxpayers  going to bed tonight and not sleeping, worried about what comes next  week. This is not how it should be. This is not how it is in this  country traditionally.   We need to restore growth. We need to restore opportunity. We need to  restore this beautiful thing we affectionately call the American idea.  Passing this bill is the single biggest thing we can do to grow the  economy, to restore opportunity, and to help these middle-income  families who are struggling.   People always ask: Well, what is in it for me? How do I benefit from  this?   I am a chart guy.   Why is this important? What this shows you, under this plan, the  average family at every income level gets a tax cut, a tax cut at every  average level.   What this chart shows you, the people here who are struggling, the  people here who are in middle-income brackets, the people here in low  income trying to become middle income, they get the biggest tax cuts.   This plan is good for people in all walks of life all across the  country, and the bigger relief goes to those who need it most.   Let's put it into numbers.   A typical household of four people, they make $59,000 in this  country. That family of four gets an $1,182 tax cut the first year  alone.   The median family income, Mom, Dad, two kids, the median family  income in America today is $87,000. That family will get a $1,941 tax  cut right away, year one. If you are one of those 57 percent of  Americans who say you don't even have $500 to go through an emergency,  this really helps you.   Let's talk about those people who itemize their taxes, who live in  high-tax States. Let's talk about a couple making $1115,000, living a  high-tax State. Let's say they have $8,400 in a mortgage interest  payment and $6,900 in property taxes for the year. They can still write  all of those off under this plan, and they will still see a tax cut of  $1,130; if they have kids, an even larger tax cut.   Not only do people get to keep more of their own money in their own  pocket, but we dramatically simplify the tax system. We make it more  fair.   Today, 7 out of 10 Americans don't itemize their deductions. That  means 70 percent of Americans take what we call the standard deduction  for their taxes. It is just that. It is standard. It is  straightforward. You are not taxed on that income.   But over the years, Washington has piled on special interest loophole  after special interest loophole after special interest loophole. These  loopholes are skewed to the people who are wealthy, who are well  connected, who can afford all the tax lawyers and all the accountants  to navigate the Tax Code so they can get a good deal. But if you are  not in that group, if you don't have the lawyers and the accountants  and you are just scraping away with your middle income, you don't get  those deals.   What we want to do is take those loopholes away, make it fair for  everybody, lower tax rates, and make it easy.   Here is how easy this gets. We are going to make it so easy that, by  doubling the standard deduction, 90 percent of Americans, 9 out of 10  Americans, will be able to fill out their taxes on a form the size of a  postcard. What this means is, for a single person, you don't pay taxes  on your first $12,000 of income. For a married couple, you don't pay  taxes on your first $24,000 of income.    Here is the basic philosophy. Instead of jumping through all the  hoops that the IRS puts in front of you, instead of doing what the  special interest groups say you need to do in order to get some of your  money back, we basically say: Keep your money in the first place. It is  your money. Do what you want with it.   All of this is about tax relief. It is about fairness. It is about  simplicity. It is about easing the stress and anxiety that is in this  country.   What we really need to do is we need better jobs, more jobs, faster  economic growth, higher wages.   This brings us to the way we tax ourselves as businesses. This brings  us to what do we do to make America the most competitive place in the  world.   Here is the real problem we have got when it comes to the way we tax  our businesses. We are the worst in the world at it. We, right now, tax  our businesses at the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized  world.   What does that do? Well, let me give you an example of where I come  from.   In Wisconsin, the example is Johnson Controls. Johnson Controls is a  company with a history dating back, in our State, to the 1880s. It was  the biggest company we had headquartered in Wisconsin. Not anymore,  because Johnson Controls is an Irish company, and their Irish tax rate  is 12\1/2\ percent.   This is happening all over the country. Companies, just to stay  competitive, are becoming foreign companies. And when the headquarters  of that company leaves your hometown, when the headquarters of that  business and that employer leaves your State and goes to another  country, there goes the United Way Campaign. There goes the white- collar jobs. There goes the manufacturing. There goes the research and  development. There goes America's competitiveness.   What is worse is all these foreign companies are buying U.S.  companies because it is cheaper because of taxes.   Here is what we do. Instead of being the worst in the pack, we  leapfrog ourselves by bringing that tax rate down  [[Page H9412]]  to 20 percent. Because, guess what. When you tax your businesses at  much, much higher tax rates than our foreign competitors tax theirs,  they win and we lose. We have got to stop losing. We have got to start  winning. That is what this does.   What is even more impressive about this is it lowers taxes for those  small businesses, those mom-and-pops even more. We have got to make  sure that our businesses, the job creators of America, have every  incentive to stay here, have every incentive to build here, have every  incentive to hire here.   What is more, we are finding that by doing this, we are going to get  faster economic growth. We are going to get more jobs. We are going to  get higher wages, better take-home pay.   Let me just break it down in simple numbers.   The Tax Foundation ran the numbers. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation  said, with this bill, we will get faster growth, about 3\1/2\ percent  faster economic growth. We will get about 890,000 new jobs. They  estimate that in New York State alone, 57,834 new jobs; In Wisconsin,  17,999 new jobs; in California, 101,422 new jobs; in Texas, 74,037 new  jobs. You get these new jobs when you grow this economy. You pass this  bill, you grow this economy.   So why do we do all of this? Because it is about giving people more  take-home pay. It is about raising wages. It is about helping families  that are struggling to get ahead. It is about getting Washington out of  the business of picking winners and losers and giving the American  people the kind of economy they deserve, the kind of economy we can  have.   This just shows you that across every income scale across the board,  wages will go up because we are going to grow the economy. Most of the  wage growth goes to the people who need it most, people who are in the  middle, people who are struggling. That is why we are here.   Right now, we are in the middle of a long day where people are  working tooth and nail in their jobs. We are right here in the middle  of a day where America's workers are trying to figure out how they are  going to make ends meet, how they are going to keep up with everything.   Those people, the hardworking taxpayers of this country that we  represent, that is why we are here. This is why we are doing this. They  are the foundation of this country. We are here today for them.   The special interest groups are trying to protect their piece of the  pie. All the negativity you see out there, there is probably a special  interest group back there trying to keep their special niche in the Tax  Code.   It is high time we root that out, we don't settle for the status quo,  and we give people the kind of Tax Code that they need and they  deserve. It has been 31 years since we last did this, and it is finally  time that we get the general interests of this country to prevail over  the special interests in Washington.   We know that this brings more fairness. We know that this increases  take-home pay, bigger paychecks, and we know that this grows the  economy and creates more opportunities.   Faster economic growth is not going to fix every problem America has,  but faster economic growth is going to help us solve every problem  America has.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues today to raise their gaze and do  something bold, to see the forest through the trees, to think about the  people we are here to actually represent, to think about the people who  are struggling, who are going to go to bed tonight and probably not  sleep because they are worried about what is going to happen tomorrow.  That is what this is. This is one of the most historic and the biggest  things that we will ever do.                                time  1330    And the reason is because this is one of the biggest things we can do  to improve people's lives, to revitalize that beautiful American idea,  to spread liberty and freedom. This is something that is going to  refresh our confidence in ourselves and our confidence in each other.   Enough settling. Enough giving in. Let's start to reclaim our future  right here in this moment, in this Chamber. In this moment, let's pass  this bill.
