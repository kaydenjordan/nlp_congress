 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 5 minutes.    Mr. President, I regret that I come to the floor to  announce my opposition to one of President Trump's political nominees,  Ms. Lynda Blanchard. To be honest, I cannot even believe that we are  considering her nomination on the floor of the Senate.   U.S. Ambassadors are supposed to represent the best of America to  nations around the world, and I challenge my colleagues, Republican and  Democrat alike, to look at this nominee's record and tell me with a  straight face that Lynda Blanchard should represent the United States  anywhere.   Look, I have made a good-faith effort to work with this  administration to confirm a number of well-qualified individuals to  State Department positions that are vital to advancing America's  interests around the world. I don't think anyone can deny that.   But there are some nominees who just raise too many red flags, and I  raised this to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a letter I sent in  June of 2018, shortly after his confirmation.   I explained that a number of nominees before the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee had demonstrated histories of questionable  temperament and judgement, of questionable conduct, of #MeToo issues,  just to mention a few, and I expressed my hope that we could work  together to find qualified nominees to the U.S. Department of State. I  am disappointed that that effort went unheeded.   Ms. Blanchard has a history of using Facebook as a platform to post  incendiary, false articles and disturbing statements. For example, she  once shared an article titled ``The Clinton `Body Count' EXPANDS--5  Mysterious DEATHS in the Last 6 Weeks,'' resurrecting the vicious lie  and preposterous conspiracy theory that President Bill Clinton and  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have systematically murdered  political opponents and associates.   Then, on election day of 2016, she posted on Facebook ``Make God our  Father paint this country Red with the Blood of Jesus!''-- inappropriately using religion as a blunt instrument in a political  campaign.   She has also shared articles by the far-right Conservative Tribune,  some of  [[Page S4886]]  which were taken down for failing to meet its ``editorial standards''-- quite literally, fake news.   What is perhaps most disappointing to me is that 2\1/2\ years into  the Trump administration, none of this is particularly new. We have had  Trump diplomatic appointments call for putting political opponents in  prison, such as Kyle McCarter, President Trump's Ambassador to Kenya,  who tweeted on election night of 2016: ``Hillary for prison. No,  really!''   We have had Trump diplomatic appointments, already at their posts,  make totally inappropriate and inflammatory forays into American  politics, which is taboo for the Foreign Service, such as in June of  this year, when Carla Sands, President Trump's Ambassador to Denmark,  appeared to accuse former President Obama of an ``attempted coup d'etat  in America''--the U.S. Ambassador in Denmark, June of 2019.   And we have had Trump diplomatic appointments embarrass the country  by making false claims and then failing to take responsibility for  them.   Pete Hoekstra, appointed by President Trump as Ambassador to the  Netherlands, has claimed that there were ``no-go zones'' too dangerous  to enter due to Muslim migration. When asked about these statements,  Ambassador Hoekstra claimed they were ``fake news'' until he was  confronted with footage of his own words.   This is not normal. We cannot grow accustomed to this kind of  disgraceful behavior. We cannot look at the poor behavior of already- confirmed nominees and conclude that we should lower our standards when  it comes to Ms. Blanchard's nomination.   This is the U.S. Senate--supposedly, the world's greatest  deliberative body. We should examine the fitness and qualifications of  every single individual nominated to be the face of America in nations  across the world. We should expect our Ambassadors to represent the  United States with dignity, respect, and sound judgment, and we should  remember that America's role as a leader of nations rests on our moral  standards and greatest values.   Something is wrong if we willingly confirm people to these positions  who repeatedly spread fake news, baseless slander, and the most  despicable of conspiracy mongering.   For these reasons, I will be opposing the nomination of Lynda  Blanchard and urge my colleagues to do the same.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
