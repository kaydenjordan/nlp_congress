 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, next week marks Teacher  Appreciation Week, which recognizes the special role educators make for  American families.   As the husband of a retired schoolteacher and a grateful dad of four  sons with eight grandchildren, I know firsthand the positive impact  educators have for students.   South Carolina's Second Congressional District is filled with  dedicated and talented teachers and administrators, and it is always a  pleasure to visit with them at their school or when their classes visit  Washington.   I would also like to recognize the 2017 Teacher of the Year, Jennifer  Wise, of Hand Middle School of Columbia, which my mother attended. As a  math teacher, Jennifer motivates her students for mathematics to  energize their lives outside of the classroom.   The success of our teachers is amplified by the leadership of State  Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman, working with Education  Secretary Betsy DeVos, and the parents, teachers, administrators, and  locally elected school boards who are making a difference for the  students of South Carolina for job opportunities and meaningful lives.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
