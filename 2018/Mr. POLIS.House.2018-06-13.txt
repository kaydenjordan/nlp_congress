 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman for yielding the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule that provides for  consideration of H.R. 2851, H.R. 5735, and H.R. 5788. We could have  done so much better. I am going to get into some of the great ideas  that we talked about and amendments were submitted but didn't make it  through.   This week is supposed to be about bringing bills to the floor that  actually do something about the opioid crisis that is having  devastating consequences on families and entire communities, including  in my home State of Colorado.   Legislation to address opioid abuse and save lives is long overdue.  But I am sad to say that the bills that are being brought forth make,  at the most, incremental changes and will not substantially affect the  plague that is affecting our country of opioid addiction, abuse, and  death.   As you know, this is a crisis that cuts across State lines. It  affects every congressional district in our country. I certainly know  people directly affected in my constituents. I am sure every Member of  Congress does.   In Colorado the rate of drug overdoses since 2000 has more than  doubled. This is not a partisan issue, and I  [[Page H5109]]  wish we could come together around a more significant response that  actually did something to combat opioid abuse.   If Republicans were serious about dealing with opioids, they would  drop their assault on Medicaid. Medicaid is a critical service to help  individuals battling opioid addiction, including supporting inpatient  treatment centers and case managers to help get people the help they  need.   Frankly, we should have a discussion about how to achieve universal  healthcare. There are people today who are unable to get coverage or  support to recover from the substance abuse that holds them hostage.  While Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act have dramatically improved  and expanded access to health coverage, including drug treatment, there  are too many Americans today--in fact, over millions--who do not have  health insurance.   There is no single solution to the opioid crisis. Instead,  policymakers should use a multipronged approach, universal healthcare,  substance abuse, and mental health treatment being one. Another prong  is identifying alternative treatments, instead of highly addictive  opioid compounds for pain management. That is one of the things that I  am so disappointed is not being advanced to the floor.   Many States have medical marijuana available to patients with a  variety of health issues, including chronic pain. Doctors across the  country have prescribed medical marijuana as a legitimate treatment  option for pain management. In cases where it works, it provides a less  harmful alternative, a less harmful and less addictive alternative to  opioids.   Opioids have a role in pain management. But if a first-line therapy  like medical marijuana, acupuncture, or acupressure can work, you can  prevent people from developing a dependency, because almost three- quarters of opioid abuse starts with prescription drug treatment for  pain management. In some cases, those first-line treatments like  medical marijuana, acupuncture, and acupressure won't work, and  prescriptions to opioids have their role. But let's at least prevent  some people from having to go on prescription opioids when a less  harmful, less addictive, and less damaging therapy can work effectively  for their pain management. I have heard from so many Coloradans for  whom medical marijuana works instead of having to resort to opioids.   Unfortunately, medical marijuana is still illegal at the Federal  level. There are limited research opportunities about the safety and  efficacy of marijuana, and that is holding us back from really  understanding how medical marijuana can be used for pain management.   I offered a very simple and commonsense amendment at the Rules  Committee last night that authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to study medical marijuana as an alternative treatment option to  prescription opioids, just very simply. According to the Department of  Veterans Affairs, the VA alone has treated about 70,000 veterans for  opioid addiction last year alone, but my amendment was, unfortunately,  blocked from getting a vote.   The issue is personal for me, Mr. Speaker. I was able to present a  Purple Heart to a veteran who lives in my district in Colorado, a young  man who put his life on the line for our country. He told me that he  uses medical marijuana for his pain issues and has successfully been  able to take himself off of the opioids that the VA had prescribed for  those pain issues.   I also offered an amendment with Representatives Pocan and Gosar last  night that, unfortunately, was not even allowed to be debated here on  the floor that would prevent a natural botanic substance like kratom  from being scheduled under the new scheduling authority created by  SITSA. Unfortunately, it was blocked.   Kratom, which is a cousin of the coffee plant, is used by many as an  alternative to addictive opioids and a way of escaping addiction. I  have heard from so many constituents for whom legal access to kratom is  critical to their sobriety and their battle against opioid addiction.   We can very simply ensure that that legal access could be retained  had this amendment been allowed. If it is cut off, as the FDA and  others have been threatening, there is no doubt in my mind, nor should  there be any doubt in anybody's mind, that people will resort back to  deadly opioids, rather than managing through harm reduction using other  compounds that are less dangerous and less deadly, be it medical  marijuana or kratom.   We are debating these bills today because we know we need to take  action to address the opioid epidemic that we all have felt the human  face of in our communities. But instead of trying to ban substances and  put more Big Government bans on top of things that people are using to  recover from opioids, we should be exploring and embracing alternative  treatment options to opioids.   Simply put, we need to improve access to alternative pain relief  options beyond opioids like kratom and like medical marijuana, because  75 percent of opioid abuse starts with prescription drugs usually for  pain management. We need to embrace that part of the solution. Increase  freedom. Let Americans choose less harmful compounds that work for pain  management and free people up to never become the victim of a terrible  cycle of opioid addiction. Unfortunately, both of those amendments were  blocked.    H.R. 2851, the Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic  Analogues Act, is a bill that would create a new schedule of drugs  under the Controlled Substances Act giving even more authority to the  Department of Justice to wage a failed drug war and determine which  substances are illegal, sidestepping the current process for scheduling  drugs, sidestepping Congress, and often sidestepping common sense. When  you put Government bureaucrats in charge, they only take more power  every time.   This bill creates lengthy sentencing and penalties, indulging in the  over criminalization. It could harm hundreds of thousands of people  battling opioid abuse by relying on incarceration and penalization,  rather than treatment and helping people recover from opioid abuse.   This is a public health issue. It is not that there is not a criminal  dimension; there, of course, is for cartels and smugglers. But when it  comes to your niece or nephew, Mr. Speaker, your cousin or your  neighbor's kid, we want to help them get better, recover their lives,  and free themselves from the vicious cycle of opioid addiction. This  bill does not do that.   While it is well-intended, it has serious flaws that need to be  addressed. If we want to have an impact on fighting epidemics, the  answer is not to give even more authority to government bureaucrats in  Washington. It is to empower the American people themselves to take  control of our own destiny.   The rule also provides for consideration of the THRIVE Act, that is  H.R. 5735. It is a different topic, but it is related. It is designed  to create housing opportunities for people suffering from substance  abuse disorders.                                time  1245    The problem with this bill is it sets arbitrary time limits on those  who seek stable housing while receiving treatment for substance use  disorders, and it doesn't actually increase the supply of affordable  housing.   When we are dealing with homelessness and transitory housing, we need  to take meaningful action to actually increase the supply of beds for  people who are in recovery. We have to walk the walk. Without funding  for beds and for treatment, we are just talking around the edges and we  are not really solving this problem.   The final bill under this rule is H.R. 5788, the Securing the  International Mail Against Opioids Act, which is another bill that  creates more paperwork for the Postal Service. Frankly, it just adds,  again, another level of bureaucracy.   I am pretty sure, Mr. Speaker, that people smuggling opioids into  this country don't put opioids on the Customs form. They don't say:  ``We are illegally bringing opioids into the country.'' Yes, we need to  do more against smuggling, but creating more forms to fill out by  government bureaucrats is not the answer.   This bill is being considered under a closed rule. This is the 86th  closed rule of this Congress. What that means, Mr. Speaker, is that not  a single Member, Democrat or Republican, was able to  [[Page H5110]]  offer an amendment to this bill, the Securing the International Mail  Against Opioids Act. There were good ideas from both sides that aren't  even allowed to be advanced.   The Republicans continue to bring bills to floor this way that limit  the opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to actually do something  to stop opioid abuse. It is frustrating.   As a legislator who has a lot of ideas about what we can do to  actually save lives, increase freedom, and reduce opioid abuse, which  would pass--I think a lot of my ideas would get 300, 350 votes here in  the House--we are not even allowed to bring them forward. It is just so  frustrating when we all know the human face of people who are suffering  from being caught in the vicious cycle of opioid addiction. We have  seen it affect so many families, including so many of our friends and  even family.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation is in the midst of a devastating opioid  crisis that is spiraling out of control. According to the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, opioids are responsible for 6 out of 10  overdose deaths in the country. More than 115 Americans die each day  from opioid overdose.   The house is on fire; yet, with these bills today, unfortunately, the  Republicans are not addressing this problem in a meaningful way. The  American people need strong action from Congress to stem the tide of  the opioid scourge and save lives.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Lujan's legislation,  H.R. 3495, the Opioid and Heroin Abuse Crisis Investment Act, which  would make a difference by extending badly needed funding to combat the  growing public health crisis of opioid-related addiction and deaths.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), the distinguished ranking member of the Ways and  Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas.  [[Page H5113]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Cummings), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, here we are, a year and a half into this session of  Congress, and finally the Republicans are bringing something to the  floor around the opioid epidemic, but it is too little, too late. They  prioritized, unfortunately, corporate tax giveaways over families that  are struggling and communities which are affected by the path of  destruction caused by opioid drug abuse.   As we address opioid addiction, we need to remember that many  communities were suffering from substance use disorders long before  Congress began to wake up to this issue. Opioid abuse affects both  rural and urban communities and has a human face and a tragedy in every  congressional district.   We should support efforts to address this through treatment instead  of incarceration or punishment, through alternatives instead of giving  Washington, D.C., bureaucrats more power.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question and ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
