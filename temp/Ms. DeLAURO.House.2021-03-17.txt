 Madam Speaker, for nearly 50 years, our country has  strived to make equal rights for women a foundational value in the  United States Constitution through the equal rights amendment. Women  deserve nothing less than equal treatment, whether it be equal pay for  equal work, freedom from discrimination, freedom from sexual assault,  or freedom from domestic violence. The equal rights amendment will help  to fill those gaps.   We now have enough States for that to become the law of the land.  This resolution will help clear the path for this much-needed change,  and I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution so that  every woman and every girl can have equal justice under the law.   I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: What are you  afraid of? Why? Why can you not affirm equal rights for women in the  United States of America? It is not a hard mountain to climb. But it  says every woman and every girl can have equal justice under the law.
