 Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate the workers at  Columbia Generating Station for sending over 9.7 million megawatt hours  of electricity to the Northwest power grid last year, a new record in  its 34-year history.   Operated by Energy Northwest, the Columbia Generating Station is the  third largest electricity generator in Washington State and has set  five new power generation records in the last 7 years for its increased  production. Its gross megawatt capacity can power a city the size of  Seattle and is equivalent to about 10 percent of electricity generated  in Washington.   Nuclear power and advanced technologies like small modular reactors  are critical for safe, reliable, and clean baseload power generation in  the United States.   As we begin the 116th Congress and as the Nation strives to depend  more upon carbon-free sources of energy, I will be a steadfast advocate  for the safe, clean power we receive from nuclear energy.   Congratulations to the Energy Northwest employees at Columbia  Generating Station on a job well done. You play a vital role for our  State's and our Nation's energy security and independence.                            ____________________
