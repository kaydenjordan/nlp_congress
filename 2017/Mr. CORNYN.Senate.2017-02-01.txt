 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, finally, on Monday, the Senate moved  forward with the nomination of Rex Tillerson to be the next Secretary  of State. His confirmation before this Chamber to serve as our top  diplomat should have been a no-brainer, but we know that our Democratic  colleagues are still trying to relitigate the election of November 8,  and because their preferred candidate lost, they are now trying to do  everything they can to slow-walk and to hamper the ability of the  winner, President Trump, to get his Cabinet up and running to govern  the country. While they think they may be hurting the President and his  administration, what they are really doing is hurting the American  people whom the government serves. I hope they will reconsider.   It is really sad it has taken this long due to the foot-dragging of  our colleagues across the aisle who are sort of in a resistance mode. I  really do believe it is like the stages of grief, like the Kubler-Ross  stages, where the first one, of course, is denial, the second is anger,  and then ultimately you get to acceptance. But they are a long way to  acceptance, and they are still in the anger phase of their grieving the  outcome of the November 8 election.   When the shoe was on the other foot, we confirmed seven of President  Obama's Cabinet nominees on the day he was inaugurated--January 20,  2009--but apparently this is the new normal.   I just hope our Democratic colleagues realize that this is not  serving the public interest, and it is not, frankly, good politics, it  strikes me, to be so angry and throw a temper tantrum--or, as I said  yesterday to some folks, growing up, people used to talk about throwing  a hissy fit, and this really strikes me as throwing a hissy fit.   Much has been made of Rex Tillerson's incredible leadership role in a  major corporation. Obviously, he has done a tremendous job for one of  the largest businesses in the world. He was working for the  shareholders of that corporation in that capacity. Now his enormous  experience and aptitude and talent are going to be put to work for the  American Nation and for the American people.   I believe that not only is he a person of conviction and competence,  he is also a man of character. He believes in putting this country  first, and I have no doubt he will serve the United States with great  integrity and care.   It is none too early for us to transition to somebody of his great  qualifications and experience. Our country is no longer respected by  many of our friends around the world because we have withdrawn from  international leadership. We are no longer feared by our adversaries,  who are all too quick to fill the leadership vacuum around the world-- Russia being perhaps the most obvious example not only in Crimea and in  Ukraine but obviously in Syria and now in Libya. It is dangerous. It is  destabilizing. So I am very pleased that we will have a new Secretary  of State and a new national security leadership team.   If there is one thing that I think President Trump has done right, it  is select good people, from Mike Pence as the Vice President, Gen. Jim  Mattis as Secretary of Defense, Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State,  and Gen. John Kelly of the Department of Homeland  [[Page S545]]  Security. I think he has chosen very well. I could go on and on with  his Cabinet members and say the same thing about each one of them.   We will vote on the confirmation of Mr. Tillerson shortly, between 2  and 2:30 p.m. or in that time frame.    Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Alabama (Mr. Sessions).
