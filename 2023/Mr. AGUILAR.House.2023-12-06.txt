 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  resolution because House Democrats want a functioning House of  Representatives. We are in the midst of the least productive Congress  since the Great Depression. This historic dysfunction is what happens  when extreme MAGA Republicans dictate the agenda.                                time  1815    The majority is fixated on censures, expulsions, and impeachments.  Meanwhile, the American public is worried about making ends meet.   Where is the Republican urgency around lowering costs? Where are  their solutions for their constituents who are worried about rent,  groceries, and utilities?   The truth is that they have no plan and no solutions. They are taking  orders from the former President and being led by the most extreme  members of their Conference.   However, when House Democrats held the majority, we passed the  bipartisan infrastructure law, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,  the bipartisan Chips and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act.  These laws are creating good-paying jobs, lowering energy costs, and  making schools safer in communities across this country.   A vote for this resolution will further divide this body at a time  when we should be coming together to make the needs of the American  public front and center.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with my colleague from New York, Mr.  Bowman, and I urge a ``no'' vote.
