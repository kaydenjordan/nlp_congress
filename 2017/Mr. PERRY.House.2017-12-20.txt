 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody  B. Hice), my good friend. I thank him for bringing this issue to the  attention of the Congress and for this Special Order.   When I was growing up, Mr. Speaker, I believed that my government  would do all it could to stop crime from happening in the community I  lived in, including drug use.                                time  1945    I have always been, my whole life, an ardent opponent of drug use. I  have never used drugs, but yet I have seen the ravages and the  devastation in the community I live in of this. You just knew in your  heart that your government--the police, so on and so forth--were  stopping those kind of things.   Then years later, as I grew up and was privileged to serve in  uniform, I ended up going to Iraq. I got a briefing on this new type of  weapon that was being used in Iraq called an EFP, an explosively formed  penetrator, for which we had very little defense. There were other  kinds of IEDs, whether they were used with a cell phone or a pressure  plate or whatever, but these things were particularly grave because  [[Page H10337]]  we didn't have anything to stop them. We all knew, from the briefing,  that they were coming from Iran.   And, of course, we thought, wearing the uniform, that our government  would do everything it could to protect the servicemembers who were in  harm's way and to protect our national security. That includes making  sure that we got to the bottom of these EFPs, where they were coming  from, and prosecuting and persecuting those who were providing them.   So imagine my surprise and my dismay just a few short days ago  reading an article from a publication here in Washington, D.C., that  outlined how our government, essentially, sanctioned not only the use  of these EFPs from Iran in Iraq and Afghanistan, but, essentially,  allowed for them to be paid for and enabled the paying for them.   There was this operation ongoing called Operation Cassandra to root  out drugs coming into the United States being supplied by Hezbollah, a  client of Iran. While this was ongoing, this nuclear agreement concern  came into being. It was, apparently, so important that all of the work  that was done in Operation Cassandra to stop these drugs from coming  into the United States, that had to stop because we didn't want to  irritate, we didn't want to disrespect, we didn't want to insult the  Iranians when they were so close to getting a nuclear deal.   So we said, well, all these people have been working on this for  years--this Operation Cassandra--to identify these people from Iran who  were using this operation of selling drugs, illicitly moving stolen  cars, and laundering money to then sell drugs into the United States  and Europe, but also to use that money that they got from selling the  drugs and the used cars to make these EFPs, to send them to Iraq, to  send them to Afghanistan to kill American soldiers. That all had to  stop because, heaven forbid, we can't offend Iran. We can't offend  Iran.   Now, I will tell you this, Mr. Speaker. Nuclear war is a grave issue  and it is worth a lot. If we have to stop nuclear war and give up some  things to do that, I get it, I get it completely. There are no second  chances with nuclear war. Once the bomb goes off, it is over. So if you  have to give a little bit to get something on that, that is something  even I could understand, even though I find some of it objectionable.   Where I come into conflict is this, Mr. Speaker. There is no  question, at this point, whether Iran will have a nuclear weapon. There  is no reason to be testing ballistic missiles except to deliver a  nuclear weapon. They are not delivering leaflets, Mr. Speaker. They are  going to deliver a nuclear weapon with that, which is why they are  testing it.   There is no reason to have centrifuges. There is no reason to enrich  to the level that Iran is except to create a nuclear weapon. We don't  need that to have a nuclear power plant, which is what Iran says it  wants to do.   And, of course, we all know, since the Ayatollah took over and took  American hostages back in the day that Iran is a known liar. That is  what they do. They lie. They obfuscate. They just say one thing and do  another. It is not a question of if they will have a nuclear weapon,  Mr. Speaker; it is a question of when.   So what we did here was we said, look, let's not offend the Iranians.  Even though they are killing Americans on the battlefield, and even  though they are killing Americans in your hometown by selling drugs to  them--and the two are working towards each other; they are selling  drugs and using that money to buy the articles of war, the implements  of war that are killing Americans--it is okay. We are going to allow  that to happen as long as we delay Iran from having a nuclear weapon  for 15 years. That is exactly what it looks like.   Now, I didn't do the investigative reporting. It is, I think, 14,000  words, so it is pretty in-depth. But I will tell you this. It is being  discredited out there. These are a couple of rogue employees who just  disagreed with the policy.   Mr. Speaker, the Drug Enforcement Agency agent on the case, who has  over 20 years of government experience tracking the financing of terror  networks, said this of the leader of Hezbollah:         I had no clue who he was, but this guy was sending money       into Iraq to kill American soldiers.    The point is he had 20 years on the job. This wasn't some piker who  just showed up on the job at Treasury and said: ``Hey, track this money  and see what you can find.'' This is a guy who did this for a living  for 20 years, and he ran into Hezbollah. He ran into Hezbollah, based  on his investigation.   And then they tracked him. They tracked the money. They tracked the  drugs--not just a little bit, tons--tons of drugs coming into the  United States, literally at a time when we have 60,000 Americans dying,  annually, of drug overdose. That is more people than we lost in  Vietnam, Mr. Speaker, in the whole time of Vietnam. A year, that is how  many are dying in America based on drug overdose.   These people tracked it. They tracked the weapons on the other side,  and they were told to stand down. They went to get these guys. They had  one in custody in Prague. He was arrested. The United States wanted him  extradited and prosecuted.   Do you know where he is right now, Mr. Speaker? He is back on the  battlefield because we let him go.   So not only did Iran get to sell drugs in the United States and kill  American citizens in your hometown, but they used that money to then  make EFPs to kill the soldiers from your hometown who went to defend  America's freedom.   And, oh, by the way, in less than 15 years now, you can expect Iran  to be a nuclear armed power.   Mr. Speaker, if nothing else, if absolutely nothing else happens here  from this, we need to have hearings on this in both the Foreign Affairs  Committee and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to make  sure that this never ever can happen again, that we don't trade the  safety of the lives of American servicemembers overseas and American  citizens at home for a bad deal overseas of something that we are never  really going to be able to reconcile with, which is a nuclear-armed  Iran.   We are going to have very few options at stopping them, like we do  with North Korea right now. That is where we are headed. We will not  only have North Korea to deal with, but we will also have a nuclear- armed Iran.   That circumstance can never happen again, which is why hearings are  so critical, so that we get to the truth, so that we get to the bottom  of this, so that there are no skeletons in the closet, Mr. Speaker, so  we understand who did what for why, so we can rationalize was this  worth it or was this just political expedience. We need to know that so  that we learn from that, so that we never make those mistakes again.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B.  Hice). I appreciate his interest in this topic, as I am, and bringing  it to the floor.
