 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we recently learned that fiscal year 2023  set a new record for the number of illegal immigrants apprehended at  the southern border--the third recordbreaking year of illegal  immigration under the Biden administration.   First, fiscal year 2021 set an alltime record. Then, fiscal year 2022  broke that record. And, now, fiscal 2023 has broken that record. In  other words, we have had 3 straight years of the Biden border crisis  getting worse and worse and worse.   Since the President took office, more than 6.2 million individuals  have been caught attempting to illegally cross our southern border--6.2  million. If every one of those individuals lived in one city, it would  be the second largest in the country.   I don't need to tell anyone that the kind of unchecked illegal  immigration we are experiencing represents a serious security threat.   The Department of Homeland Security recently noted in its 2024 threat  assessment:         Terrorists and criminal actors may exploit the elevated       flow [of migration] and increasingly complex security       environment to enter the United States.    And by all indications, bad actors are, in fact, taking advantage of  the chaos at the border to try and enter the United States. During  fiscal year 2023 alone, 169 individuals on the Terrorist Watchlist were  caught attempting to illegally cross our southern border--169 on the  Terrorist Watchlist. Those are the ones they apprehended. That is more  than in the previous 6 years combined.   The head of the Border Patrol recently said that his Agency is  arresting an average of more than 47 people per day who have ``serious  criminal histories''--more than 47 people per day with serious criminal  histories. Those are just the individuals who are being caught.   Since January 2021, when President Biden took office, there have been  more than 1.7 million known ``got-aways.'' Those are individuals the  Border Patrol saw but was unable to apprehend. We can only imagine the  number of unknown ``got-aways'' who have sneaked into the country.   How many of those individuals have ``serious criminal histories'' or  hail from hostile countries? We just don't know, but we can be pretty  confident that among those ``got-aways'' are dangerous individuals who  should not be entering our country.   This is a serious issue, and we need a serious course correction from  this administration.   Vice President Harris, who is in charge of overseeing border policies  for this administration, recently told ``60 Minutes'' that ``we need a  safe, orderly, and humane border policy.'' This has been the purported  goal of the Biden administration for almost 3 years now, but the  administration has been failing on all three counts.   The current crisis we are experiencing is a predictable result of the  Biden administration's decisions. Before the President took office, his  team was warned of the possibility of a migrant surge. Yet the moment  the President took office, he set about dismantling the immigration  policies of his predecessor and weakening our border's security, and  the result has been, as I said, 3 successive years of recordbreaking  illegal immigration.   While the Biden administration has finally started to, at least  halfheartedly, acknowledge our Nation's border crisis and put in place  policies attempting to encourage legal migration and penalize illegal  border crossings, the changes are insufficient--far too little, far too  late--or, as one columnist recently put it in the Washington Post,  ``The Biden administration's various efforts have amounted to Band-Aids  on a massive, open wound.''   The President's recent supplemental funding request has not left me  hopeful that the administration is suddenly going to become more  effective. Potentially billions of dollars in reimbursement for blue  States struggling to house illegal immigrants won't do a single thing  to solve the crisis we are facing at the border.   While the President's proposal does include some funding that would  actually go toward security, funding alone is simply not enough. We  need meaningful policy changes that will, for starters, end the rampant  abuse of our asylum system and sweeping parole designations.   Senators Graham, Lankford, and Cotton, among several others, are  working hard to craft a set of changes to our asylum and parole  policies that would stem the flow at our southern border. These changes  would address obvious flaws in President Biden's immigration policies  and make tangible progress toward getting our border crisis under  control.   Recent events have underscored the importance of national security,  and a porous southern border is a huge--huge--vulnerability when it  comes to our national security. We need to use every tool we can to  secure the border and keep terrorists and criminals out of the United  States.   Senate Republicans are committed to putting policies in place at the  border that keep Americans safe, and I hope that, in the days and weeks  to come, Senate Democrats will join us to make securing our border a  priority.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
