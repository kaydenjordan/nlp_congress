 Madam Speaker, today we debate much more than the words  on parchment that define our congressional responsibility.   Long before I knew this legal responsibility, I learned the moral  responsibility inherent to what must be the most sober and deliberate  decision we can humanly muster.   As a young boy, indelibly etched in my mind is the conversation with  my grandmother the day she pulled a box out from underneath her bed,  reverently handing me the medals and final belongings of my uncle who  was killed in action and telling me about her lost son. I wondered then  what was so important to justify such a loss and what my uncle must  have been thinking about.    That day carried with me as I traveled to Iraq as a newly elected  Congressman to visit our troops during a time of war. I remember having  a conversation with a young marine. I asked him his personal thoughts  about the goals of the war, what he thought, did he think it was  justified. He told me: ``With all due respect, sir, that is your job.  My job is to serve.''   He was right. It is our job. That is why we are debating this, and  that is why I am supporting this resolution.
