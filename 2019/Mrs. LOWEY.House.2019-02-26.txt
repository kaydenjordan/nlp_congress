 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the joint  resolution to terminate President Trump's phony declaration of an  emergency at the southern border.   Unable to convince Congress to pay for his wasteful border wall, the  president has decided to make an end run around the legislative branch,  upending democratic norms and creating a dangerous precedent.   To pay for the wall, the Administration intends to rob money from  critical military construction projects and from other parts of the  Defense Department and the Treasury.   This would threaten national security, undermine the readiness of our  military, and could disrupt critical infrastructure improvements that  benefit service members and their families--all to prop up a political  vanity project.   As a country, we should be focused on real law enforcement needs, not  a border wall that will do virtually nothing to keep Americans safe.   Today's vote to block the president's emergency declaration is a  critical first step, and I am proud to cosponsor this resolution.   I hope my Republican colleagues recognize that this isn't about  politics--it's about defending our democratic institutions and the rule  of law from presidential overreach.   It's about protecting our institution and our Constitution in the  face of an unprecedented power grab from a president who rejects  Congress' authority as a co-equal branch of government.   Mr. Speaker, the greatest power we have as members of Congress is the  power of the purse. As we exercise that power, we should invest  responsibly in priorities that strengthen and protect American families  and communities.   We do not exist to rubber stamp the President. I urge my Republican  colleagues to join us in defending our constitutional prerogatives and  upholding the rule of law.
