 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share an update with the  people I represent in Alabama on my travels during the August district  work period.   Each year, all of the Members of Congress take the month of August to  spend time on the ground in their respective districts, meeting with  constituents and local leaders, businesses, industries, and,  ultimately, listening to the concerns of the people at home.   Having this opportunity to hear firsthand from the people who live  and work in Alabama's Second District is very important, and I believe  it enables me to be a better representative of our shared priorities  while I am here in Washington.   It was a busy month. I was fortunate to spend time in Montgomery,  Ozark, Hartford, Geneva, Millbrook, Troy, Dothan, Fort Rucker, and Hope  Hull.   During my time in Montgomery, I met with Elmore County Commissioner  Troy Stubbs, Alabama Farm Service Agency director David McCurdy,  leadership from Deatsville's Ingram State Community College, members of  the Alabama Association of School Boards, folks from the Alabama Law  Enforcement Agency's Fusion Center, and more.   Also in Montgomery, I visited the Gift of Life Foundation's office,  toured the MOOseum at the Alabama Cattlemen's Association, spoke to the  American Society of Civil Engineers at their lunch meeting, stopped by  Sabel Steel for a visit, addressed the Squadron Officer School at  Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base, toured Common Ground Ministries' Mercy  House facility, and more.   In Ozark, I paid a visit to Wayne Farms to tour their recently opened  feed mill.   In Hartford, I participated in a meeting about rural broadband  development efforts with Wiregrass Electric Cooperative.   In Geneva, I had the opportunity to tour the impressive, newly  completed career tech center called G-Tech.   In Millbrook, I was privileged to speak to the Millbrook-Coosada  Kiwanis Club during their weekly lunch meeting.   In Troy, I visited with Troy Cable to learn more about their upcoming  projects and some of the issues they have recently been facing.   In Dothan, I spoke to the Wiregrass chapter of the Association of  General Contractors. We had a great discussion about a wide variety of  topics, including efforts right here in Congress to revitalize our  Nation's badly aging infrastructure.   I also visited Dothan Behavioral Medicine Clinic, where I received a  briefing about Clinicom technology that is being used to diagnose  mental illness. Mental health is an acute problem in this country, and  I was pleased to learn more about their work.   I stopped by Fort Rucker to tour the aeromedical research laboratory.  I talked with many employees there about the importance of Army  Aviation to our national security and the innovation happening on-post  right in the Second District.   I visited the Army Aviation support facility in Hope Hull for a  briefing and an overview on their facility as well. While I was there,  I enjoyed talking with General Gordon and Colonel Bass and many others.   Mr. Speaker, these are just some of the many productive, informative  meetings I had during this August district work period. Now that the  month is behind us, I would like to extend a sincere thank you to all  the individuals, businesses, local officials, and others who hosted me  and visited with me over the last several weeks.   It is always a true joy to be back at home visiting the various  communities across Alabama's Second District, and I look forward to  more opportunities to learn from the people I represent.                            ____________________
