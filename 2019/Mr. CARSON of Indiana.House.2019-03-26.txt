 Madam Speaker, on April 2, just a few days  from now, we will observe Equal Pay Day in the United States. This  commemoration represents the amount of time into this new year a woman  must work to earn as much as a man earned in 2018 alone.   As long as this continues, we are effectively telling our wives, our  daughters, our mothers, and every woman in our life that they are  inherently worth less.   I don't believe this. I don't believe my colleagues do either, which  is why I encourage everyone to support the Paycheck Fairness Act when  it comes to a vote tomorrow.   This bill represents a major step toward closing the pay gap,  ensuring employers pay women what they are due, and the process will  grow our economy by putting more money in Americans' paychecks and  helping families thrive.   I am honored to support this legislation for my daughter, for the  hardworking families in our district, and for women across America who  deserve a fair wage for honest work.                            ____________________
