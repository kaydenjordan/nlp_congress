 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, while I rise today in support of S. 1942, the National  Heritage Area Act, I also have serious concerns with the process by  which it came to the floor.   Americans have long been known for our ingenuity. From hearing aids  and cardiac defibrillators to traffic lights and microwave ovens,  Americans have been developing effective solutions to problems for  hundreds of years.   George Washington Carver discovered more than 300 uses for peanuts  and more than 80 uses for sweet potatoes. Americans invented Coca-Cola,  Whoppers, Big Macs, the Chick-fil-A sandwich, and chocolate chip  cookies. You would think Congress would hold to a legislative process  that was more appetizing and didn't end up trying to force feed us a  4,000-page stink sandwich at Christmas.   Americans invented countless methods to efficiently and effectively  move people across the country. We invented automobiles, airplanes, and  the GPS system. We put people on the Moon and built the Panama Canal.   So why can't Congress invent an efficient way to move bills through a  hearing, markup, over to the Senate, and finally to the President on  time, on budget, and with transparency and clear direction?   Americans invented the team sports of football, baseball, and  basketball.   Why can't Congress work together to solve our problems of the day  instead of having a small group determine what the Congress must pass  without giving us an opportunity to actually legislate, as we all were  elected to do?   Americans discovered electricity, invented the light bulb, and the  laser.   Why can't Congress operate in the light and be transparent with  Americans instead of producing 4,000-plus page bills, like the omnibus  that will be before us in the final days of this session?   Americans have invented countless ways to communicate. We invented  the telegraph, the telephone, radio, TV, Al Gore's internet, the  iPhone, voicemail, email, Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.   You would think the House of Representatives could come up with a  better process to communicate with the Senate and the White House so it  can pass appropriation bills by September 30 and stop the madness that  has become the omnibus process. If we did that, maybe we wouldn't have  to be here today debating bills that could have and should have been  completed long ago.   There is a glimmer of hope before us today. This National Heritage  Area Act could have easily been buried in the omnibus, adding even more  pages, but here we are with the clock running out, doing something  that, again, could have and should have been done months ago.   It is amazing that when this bill was not agreed to in the omnibus,  the Senate magically found time to pass it and send it to the House.   I can find many shortcomings in the process that got us to the point  that we are at today, but I would like to focus on the positive things  we can take from it. As the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), my  friend, said about this National Heritage Area Act, it is important to  many of my colleagues across the Nation who have very successful  National Heritage Areas. These areas have private entities that work  very hard to promote their local communities and conserve their unique  heritage.   This bill, as proposed today, has bipartisan support, and while the  process that brought it to the floor leaves much to be desired, again,  at least it was not tucked into yet another omnibus spending bill.   In fact, if all the authorizations were removed from the omnibus, it  would have been 2,238 pages shorter and would be truly about funding  the government. Let me repeat that. If we took the authorizations out  of the appropriation bill, it would be 2,238 pages shorter. Maybe  somebody would have time to read it then.   Considering bills on the floor shows us a process that can work the  way it was intended. My commitment as chairman of the Natural Resources  Committee in the next Congress is to work extremely hard, to have  hearings, markups, and pass authorization bills out of the committee,  off the floor, and send them to the Senate using a regular order  process.                                time  1045    Moving legislation the right way will also prevent the need for  authorization bills to be tucked into massive spending bills.   But that is only part of the equation. We have to work together to  fix the process that gives us bloated omnibus bills in the first place.  We should all commit to passing a budget, passing individual  appropriation bills, and sending them to the Senate with the  understanding that the ball is in their court, and there is not another  option, except possibly a continuing resolution--  [[Page H10008]]  which we all know is not a popular way to fund the government.   I have talked to many House Members and Senators on both sides of the  aisle throughout this omnibus process. Interestingly, not one person  has told me they like this process, and everyone thinks it needs to be  changed. Maybe I just haven't talked to the people that are benefiting  the most from this broken process, but I do believe that those of us  whose constituents are suffering from it make up a vast majority and  can change it.   Our constituents think that Washington is broken. It is time for us  to work as a team to develop another effective and efficient solution  to American problems.   With all that being said, I support S. 1942, the National Heritage  Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I encourage support of this bill, which should have been done a long  time ago. It could have been done a long time ago, but I am grateful to  see it is not part of the omnibus spending bill. We are actually voting  on it on the floor like we should be doing with all authorization  bills.   Madam Speaker, I encourage passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, S. 4439 would place into trust approximately 1,031  acres of U.S. Forest Service land where the Salmon River meets the  Klamath River in Siskiyou and Humboldt Counties in California for the  Karuk Tribe.                                time  1100    This bill would require that the land be taken into trust for  traditional and customary uses for the benefit of the Tribe. This bill  would prohibit gaming on the land and would require that the land held  in trust shall not affect the status or administration of this section  of the Klamath River as a wild and scenic river. The trust land is also  subject to valid existing rights, contracts, and management agreements  relating to easements and rights-of-way.   The Karuk Tribe is one of the largest Tribes in northern California  with approximately 3,300 enrolled Tribal members. Its people have lived  in northwestern California for thousands of years. The land being  placed into trust for the Tribe is considered, as Mr. Tonko stated, the  center of the world of their religion, and it is used for their annual  world renewal ceremonies.   The Tribe has a special use permit with the Forest Service to access  these lands for their ceremonies and closes the river during certain  times in the summer to facilitate them. However, there have been public  disruptions during the ceremonies from some unknowing individuals  rafting the river.   This bill would ensure the Tribe is able to continue its religious  practices and continue teaching future generations of the Karuk people  the Tribe's culture and customs.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge adoption of the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 3519, offered by  my colleague and good friend from Arkansas, Senator John Boozman, which  would designate the Butterfield Overland Trail as a national historic  trail.   This historic trail commemorates the route pioneered by the  Butterfield Overland Mail Company as they transported mail and people  along the Oxbow Route between 1858 and 1861. Starting in Missouri and  Tennessee and ending in California, this route was pivotal to westward  expansion prior to the Civil War and plays an important role in  Arkansas' history.   In fact, four segments of the route have been designated on the  National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas and the Potts Home in  Pope County as the most intact stagecoach station in this country. This  station has been well-maintained by the Pope County Historical  Foundation as the Potts Inn Museum.   In 2018, the National Park Service completed a special resource study  of the trail and found that the Butterfield Overland Trail meets the  criteria for national significance and is feasible, suitable, and  desirable for designation as a national historic trail.   I concur that this trail is well-suited for designation, and I hope  that this new national historic trail will help bring renewed attention  to the important role Arkansas played in shaping our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I thank Senator Boozman for his steadfast leadership  on this bill, an issue that he has championed since 2007. I would also  like to thank him for ensuring that important provisions protecting  energy development and private property rights were added to the  legislation. These are commonsense provisions that will ensure the  historic trail will not interfere with any energy development,  production, or transmission.   On a personal note, during the summers when I was in college and I  was having to carry out a long-distance relationship with my college  sweetheart back before iPhones and the internet, my late father-in-law  actually retired from the Postal Service, and I think it was very  fitting that their address was 1208 Butterfield Trail. I sent many  letters to that address during those long summers. Butterfield Trail  holds a special place in my heart.   Madam Speaker, I support this bipartisan bill. I urge its adoption,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
