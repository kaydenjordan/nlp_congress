The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Ferguson) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson)  each will control 20 minutes.

General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 35.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 35.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 35 authorizes the use of the Capitol  Grounds for the annual National Police Officers' Memorial Service and  the National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition. These events are  held each year as part of Police Week to honor the men and women who  sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. This use of the Capitol  Grounds is a worthy recognition of the honorable sacrifice of our  Nation's brave first responders and their families.   This year, 234 fallen officers will be honored, which is 100 more  than last year. Ten of these officers are from my home State of  Georgia, and 70 died from 9/11-related cancer. This year, we will also  remember five officers of the Dallas Police Department for their  courage in the line of fire while responding to the shootings in Dallas  at last July's protest.  [[Page H2821]]    This is a clear reminder of the sacrifices that our men and women in  law enforcement make every day as they put their lives on the line to  maintain safe communities for us and our loved ones. We must do all we  can to support these brave men and women and their families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this resolution, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Ferguson) that the House suspend the rules  and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 35.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 36) authorizing the use of the  Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 36         Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring),       SECTION 1. USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR SOAP BOX DERBY RACES.         (a) In General.--The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby       Association (in this resolution referred to as the       ``sponsor'') shall be permitted to sponsor a public event,       soap box derby races (in this resolution referred to as the       ``event''), on the Capitol Grounds.

SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS.         The Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board       are authorized to make such additional arrangements as may be       required to carry out the event.       SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT OF RESTRICTIONS.         The Capitol Police Board shall provide for enforcement of       the restrictions contained in section 5104(c) of title 40,       United States Code, concerning sales, advertisements,       displays, and solicitations on the Capitol Grounds, as well       as other restrictions applicable to the Capitol Grounds, with       respect to the event.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Ferguson) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson)  each will control 20 minutes.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H. Con. Res. 36.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   H. Con. Res. 36 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the  annual Greater Washington Soap Box Derby in June.   Since the first official All-American Soap Box Derby in 1934, the  mission of the soapbox derby has been to build knowledge and character  and to teach fair and honest competition. This tradition also allows  children to demonstrate their dedication and creativity.   Winners from this local competition will join those from other races,  including from my home State of Georgia, in competing at the world  championship in Akron, Ohio.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this resolution, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 455) to designate the United States courthouse located at  501 East Court Street in Jackson, Mississippi, as the ``R. Jess Brown  United States Courthouse''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 455         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.         The United States courthouse located at 501 East Court       Street in Jackson, Mississippi, shall be known and designated       as the ``R. Jess Brown United States Courthouse''.       SEC. 2. REFERENCES.         Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper,       or other record of the United States to the United States       courthouse referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a       reference to the ``R. Jess Brown United States Courthouse''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Ferguson) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Ferguson).                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 455.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 455.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 455 would designate the United States courthouse located at 501  East Court Street in Jackson, Mississippi, as the R. Jess Brown United  States Courthouse.   Mr. Brown, a native of Oklahoma, attended Illinois State University,  Indiana University, and the Texas Southern University law school.   In the 1960s, R. Jess Brown was one of only four African-American  lawyers licensed to practice in Mississippi. In 1962, Mr. Brown took on  his most famous case, where he worked on behalf of James Meredith, an  African-American student who sought enrollment at the University of  Mississippi. Mr. Brown's successful lawsuit broke the color barrier at  the University of Mississippi and helped set the tone for future  litigation in the civil rights movement.   Although the Meredith case may be his most famous trial, Mr. Brown  already had established a history of litigating for civil rights  stretching back to 1948, when he sued on behalf of Black teachers in  Jackson, Mississippi, who sought salaries on par with their White  colleagues.   R. Jess Brown helped to break down barriers and set historical  precedent that has shaped our Nation for the better. It is only  appropriate that we honor the work of Mr. Brown by naming this  courthouse after him.  [[Page H2823]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
