 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize seven high  schools located in Indiana's Sixth District for their extraordinary  Early College Development Program that I observed when I was at  Lawrenceburg High School.   Participating in this program are also high schools in Greensburg,  Connersville, Richmond, Muncie Central, Delta, and the New Castle  Career Center.   The Early College Development Program provides students the ability  to earn both a high school diploma and an associate's degree or up to 2  years' college credit towards a bachelor's degree. The Early College  Development Program also provides higher learning at a much lower cost,  with early college tuition waived for some students.   I am proud to see the Hoosier State being a leader in education,  preparing our students for the future, and finding solutions to fight  the rising cost of higher education.
