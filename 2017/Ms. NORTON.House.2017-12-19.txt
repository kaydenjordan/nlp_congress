 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of S. 1393, the Jobs for  Our Heroes Act.   This bill is a step in the right direction to help the Nation tackle  the longstanding commercial driver's shortage--a shortage that I must  say I have been working on ever since I have been on this committee and  especially since becoming ranking member of the subcommittee--and, of  course, at the same time, to support veterans in a successful  transition from military to civilian life.   S. 1393 ensures that all qualified medical professionals employed by  the Department of Veterans Affairs can perform commercial driver  physical examinations for their veteran patients.   The medical professionals that this bill addresses are already  eligible to become certified medical examiners. This bill simply allows  these individuals to utilize an alternative certification process that  is currently being finalized by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety  Administration.   The most recently available data shows that, of the 54,000 medical  professionals listed in FMCSA's National Registry of Certified Medical  Examiners, only 25 medical professionals are employed by the VA. The  online training and testing system being developed by FMCSA and the VA  should help remedy this situation. These two agencies have done a good  job creating an alternative process that will eventually allow more VA  doctors to become certified medical examiners, while maintaining the  safety and integrity of the certification system.   Although the FAST Act provision authorizing this process referred to  physicians, FMCSA should allow VA-employed nurse practitioners,  chiropractors, physician assistants, and other qualified medical  professionals to participate. This bill ensures that these medical  professionals are eligible to use this process.   The bill also ensures that current servicemembers who have military  experience operating commercial motor vehicles will be able to more  easily obtain a commercial driver's license. Congress included a  provision in the FAST Act to allow States to waive the written CDL  knowledge test for drivers with military commercial motor vehicle  driving experience, but it restricts this waiver to ``former members''  of the military.   There are a significant number of current reservists and members of  the National Guard with military commercial motor vehicle experience  who could benefit from the waiver. These servicemen and -women receive  what the FMCSA describes as ``thorough and comprehensive training,''  including many hours of behind-the-wheel training, something that I  have long sought and advocated for as a requirement for civilian  drivers. These military drivers already have it.   FMCSA has already taken action to make current servicemembers  eligible for the knowledge test waiver on a temporary basis. Last year,  FMCSA issued an exemption that allows States to waive the CDL knowledge  test for trained military truck drivers, whether they are current  members of the military or our veterans; however, FMCSA's temporary  exemption expires October 2018.                                time  1445    This bill makes permanent the ability of current members of the  military to utilize the FAST Act waiver. S. 1393 is nearly identical to  two bills the House previously passed earlier this year, H.R. 2547 and  H.R. 2258, both of which passed by votes of 409-0, or unanimously.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Aguilar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill marries two priorities: jobs for our veterans.  So many come back, and they have had training, yet we are finding that  we can't always find jobs for them. Here are jobs where there is a  chronic problem, tough jobs, jobs which require people to be away from  home, often for long hours, jobs that do not pay as well as some other  jobs. So there has been a chronic shortage.   This bill serves both purposes, and it serves our Nation very well.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of S. 1532. This  legislation institutes a lifetime ban from operating a commercial motor  vehicle for any individual who has used such a vehicle to commit human  trafficking.   In the summer of 2017, 10 people died in San Antonio, Texas, in the  process of being illegally trafficked in a truck at Walmart. That  horrendous incident served as a stark reminder that the transportation  sector can be exploited for heinous acts.  [[Page H10218]]    Since 2007, the National Human Trafficking Hotline has received  reports of more than 22,000 sex trafficking cases inside our country.  In addition, it has received over 5,000 reports of individuals who have  been coerced into forced labor or indentured servitude.   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children estimates that  one of every six runaway children who was reported to them last year  had become victims of sex trafficking.   The FMCSA currently prohibits any individual from operating a CMV for  life if he or she is convicted of committing specific crimes, including  negligent manslaughter and drug trafficking. This bill ensures that the  FMCSA also takes action against perpetrators who use their CMV to  commit ``severe''--and that is the operative word--forms of sex  trafficking, as defined by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.   The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure reported an  identical bill, H.R. 3814, to the House by a voice vote in November.  This legislation takes important steps to reduce human trafficking in  the transportation sector.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is another example of what  bipartisanship can achieve in the House of Representatives, unlike,  sadly, the tax bill that was just passed just before us in the House of  Representatives here this afternoon.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill as well. S. 1536  will help ensure that the U.S. Department of Transportation has the  necessary tools to reduce the prevalence of human trafficking in  commercial vehicles.   In 2016, more than 7,000 cases of human trafficking were reported to  the National Human Trafficking Hotline. With this legislation, Congress  is stepping in to ensure DOT has additional authority and resources to  combat this egregious crime.   This bill provides the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration,  FMCSA, more flexibility to combat human trafficking by authorizing  funding from two existing grant programs to be used to support the  reporting and the prevention of human trafficking. The bill will also  help DOT coordinate efforts to fight human trafficking with other  Federal agencies, and it establishes an advisory committee on human  trafficking.   The advisory committee will convene experts from law enforcement,  victim advocacy organizations, and the transportation industry to  advise DOT of concrete steps it can take to improve the recognition and  the prevention of trafficking.   The advisory committee will also develop and share best practices  with State and local stakeholders so that they are better equipped to  combat the trafficking in their own communities.   The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure reported an  identical bill, H.R. 3813, authored by the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. Esty), to the House in November.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. Esty), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
