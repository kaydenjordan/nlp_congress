 Mr. Speaker, while our Nation faces many challenges,  perhaps none is more pressing than that of growing our economy. The  positive impact of strong, sustained economic growth has the potential  not only to help families make ends meet, but it will also address the  many other pressures we face. The time is now for Congress and this  administration to act on meaningful tax reform.   The model is simple and straightforward. We need to simplify the  ridiculously complex Internal Revenue Code, eliminate the loopholes  that allow corporations and individuals to avoid paying their fair  share, lower the rates for middle class families and small businesses,  and broaden the tax base.   As a certified public accountant, an independent voice for the people  of Bucks and Montgomery Counties, I intend to push vehemently to make  tax reform a reality in this Congress. Moreover, this can and must be a  bipartisan priority.   A 1.5 percent growth in GDP is simply unsustainable. If that trend  continues, we will not be able to fund priorities such as bolstering  our national security, taking care of our veterans, combating the  addiction crisis, funding public education, preserving our environment,  and a whole host of other priorities.   Economic growth has three essential aspects: tax reform, regulatory  reform, and a balanced budget. The REINS Act and the upcoming vote on  the CHOICE Act will start this process on the regulatory side, which  will revive the ability of community banks to support local economies  and advance infrastructure investment that puts Americans back to work  by rebuilding roads, schools, bridges, as well as our IT infrastructure  and the electrical grid.   The other critical component is tax reform, and we owe it to the  American people to get this done. I call on my good colleagues from  both sides to put politics aside and do what we were sent here to do,  and that is to stand up for hardworking families and unleash the power  of the American economy.                               Type 1 Diabetes     Mr. Speaker, over a million Americans, including  200,000 young Americans, are living with type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune  disease in which a person's pancreas stops producing insulin. This  disease is fatal without strict adherence to a regimented schedule of  multiple daily insulin injections or continuous pump infusions, along  with close monitoring of blood glucose levels.    My constituent Aislinn Keenan was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when  she was just 2 years old. She does not remember a day when she did not  need to lance her finger multiple times a day to check her blood sugar  or receive insulin injections. Despite these challenges, Aislinn and  her family serve as an inspiration to all those facing this disease.  Through courage and perseverance, they refuse to let type 1 diabetes  stand in their way. Aislinn just finished her sophomore year at  Villanova University.   The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation projects that 5 million  Americans will have type 1 diabetes by 2050, including 600,000 young  people, yet only one-third of the people with type 1 diabetes are  achieving safe blood glucose levels. Accordingly, I am urging my  colleagues to fully fund the National Institute of Diabetes and  Digestive and Kidney Diseases.   Presently, there is no way to prevent type 1 diabetes and no cure for  it once diagnosed. Only through robust funding and exhaustive research  at the NIH can we continue to drive scientific progress to make the  lives of those living with type 1 diabetes safer and healthier.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, June is National Alzheimer's and Brain  Awareness Month, and as a member of the bipartisan Congressional Task  Force on Alzheimer's Disease, I am working to address this debilitating  disease, its impact on everyday Americans, and its effect on our  healthcare system for years to come.   Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, and it remains the  sixth leading cause of death in the United States, afflicting 5 million  Americans, a number which could rise to 16 million by the year 2050.   While there are drugs to mitigate the effects of Alzheimer's, these  medications only help those in the early-to-moderate stages of the  illness, which worsens over time. Right now there is no cure.   I am committed to funding groundbreaking Alzheimer's research and  serving all Americans afflicted and their families suffering from the  devastating effects of this disease. The time to act is now.                            ____________________
