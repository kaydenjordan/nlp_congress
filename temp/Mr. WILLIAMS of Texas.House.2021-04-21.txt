 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  the Dripping Springs Tigers women's soccer team for their outstanding  win in the UIL Class 5A final.   Dripping Springs finished the season as the Class 5A State Champion  with a record 26 wins. They outscored their opponents this season 104- 8.   The team showcased their amazing talent and skills on the field, and  I am proud that all of their hard work and dedication throughout the  year ultimately paid off.   Congratulations again to the Dripping Springs Tigers. Texas' 25th  Congressional District is extraordinarily proud of their achievement,  and we cannot wait to see what they will do next. Go Tigers.   In God We Trust.  [[Page H2002]]                                ____________________
