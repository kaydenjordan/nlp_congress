 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  Computer Science Education Week. In 2009, this opportunity for  awareness was established to highlight the many ways computer science  education benefits individuals as well as entire industries.   Computer Science Education Week is a chance for students of all ages  to learn about the importance and benefits of computer science and the  endless professional opportunities that abound with a skills-based  education.   I am co-chair of the bipartisan Career and Technical Education  Caucus, and it has been a pleasure to work across the aisle to support  important educational programs like investments in computer science.   Our Nation is in desperate need of skilled workers, and career and  technical education is a win-win. It can offer rewarding professional  futures for learners of all ages, while simultaneously closing the  Nation's skills gap.   An industry that can particularly benefit from a skilled workforce,  and especially those trained in computer science, is cybersecurity.   H.R. 1592, the Cybersecurity Skills Integration Act, is a bill I am  proud to cosponsor with my Career and Technical Education Caucus co- chair, Congressman  Jim Langevin from Rhode Island.   The Cybersecurity Skills Integration Act seeks to develop a critical  infrastructure workforce that is well-trained to handle cyber threats  from bad actors. H.R. 1592 authorizes $10 million to create a  competitive grant program within the Department of Education to  incorporate cybersecurity education into new and existing career and  technical education programs. The bill also requires the Department of  Education to coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security to  better support cybersecurity education programs.   COVID-19 demonstrated how much we rely on a skilled and trained  workforce, and sadly, the personal lives and careers of many Americans  have been uprooted as a result of the virus. Far too many people lost  their jobs through no fault of their own. That is why I was eager to be  an original cosponsor of H.R. 7032, the Skills Renewal Act.   This legislation would help displaced workers gain new skills and  advance their careers upon reentry into the workforce. The bill would  create a $4,000 fully refundable skills training credit to cover a wide  range of career and technical education programs.   Mr. Speaker, we need a workforce that can meet modern technical  demands, and students who choose a career in technical education are  best suited for that challenge. Through career and technical  educational programs like computer science, we can begin to close our  Nation's skills gap and help individuals restore the rungs on the  ladder of opportunity.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, yesterday, marked the 79th  anniversary of the Pearl Harbor naval base attack.   On December 7, 1941, the surprise attack by the Japanese on a U.S.  Naval base in Hawaii left nearly 2,500 people dead. Innocent lives were  taken; members of the United States Navy, Army, Marines, as well as  civilians. It remains one of the deadliest attacks in American history,  often described as ``a date which will live in infamy,'' according to a  quote by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.   Every year on December 7, we pause to reflect and remember the  sacrifice made by the men and women who perished in the attack on Pearl  Harbor. President Roosevelt went on to say, ``No matter how long it  will take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American  people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.''   Mr. Speaker, thanks to the selflessness and sacrifice of the Greatest  Generation, that is exactly what they did. God bless all of our Pearl  Harbor victims, the survivors, and their families.                            ____________________
