 Mr. President, earlier this week, the administration and  House Democrats reached a bipartisan budget deal to deliver on the  President's priorities and prevent a funding crisis this fall.   As our Armed Forces continue their global engagements, this agreement  importantly secures the funding necessary to maintain readiness and  modernize the force. It provides increased defense spending to recover  from the depressed military readiness rates of the previous  administration. It provides our men and women in uniform with the  resources, equipment, and training they need in order to defend our  freedoms.   I know Congress deals with a lot of different topics, and all of  them, by and large, are important, but there is nothing more important,  nor is there anything more quintessentially a Federal Government  responsibility than national security.   All other considerations aside, if this bipartisan budget deal did  nothing more than fully fund our national security efforts, I would  support it, but importantly, it also keeps other important elements of  the congressional consensus intact--things like the Hyde amendment,  which, as the Presiding Officer knows, since the late 1970s has ensured  that no taxpayer dollars can be used to fund abortions. In addition,  this agreement prevents our Democratic colleagues from trying to block  President Trump from using funds to strengthen border security.   The administration--Secretary Mnuchin--negotiated a tough deal and  one that excludes any radical, leftwing poison pills--a difficult task  in these times, to be sure.   We know they wanted to use policy riders--nearly 30 of them and  counting--to try to implement elements of the Green New Deal to undo  the President's regulatory reforms or to rewrite our immigration laws  through the back door. Earlier this year, their far-left policy riders  led to the longest government shutdown in history and almost prevented  the enactment of bipartisan border supplemental funding. I saw the  devastating impact that shutdown had on dedicated public servants  across the country, especially in Texas. This agreement will prevent  another senseless shutdown and ensure that the trains of government run  on time.   To be sure, no bipartisan agreement is ever perfect. That is the  definition of a negotiation--both sides give a little. It is the nature  of compromise, which  [[Page S5033]]  is a necessary part of effective governing. There is no doubt that  there are other priorities I would have liked to have seen included in  the deal. I wish we had done something to reform our entitlement  programs, which will continue to outpace inflation and increase our  national deficit. Someday, we are going to have to deal with our  deficits and debt; I just hope it is not during the time of a national  emergency. But as a practical matter, Speaker Pelosi wasn't going to  agree with such far-reaching reforms in the context of this spending  deal and debt limit provision. Thankfully, the President was able to  secure half of the spending cuts he asked for--roughly equal to next  year's increase in nondefense spending.   Above all, this deal carries out the most critical responsibilities  of the Federal Government, which is to support our national defense and  fully fund the government's operation.   Again, I appreciate the President's efforts here and particularly  those in his administration who helped negotiate this bipartisan deal-- particularly Secretary Mnuchin. I look forward to supporting it.    Mr. President, I have 10 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
