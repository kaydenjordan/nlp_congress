 Mr. President, I have come to the floor this  afternoon, unexpectedly. I had anticipated that I was going to be  taking the long trek home, for even a short weekend, going back to  Alaska. That is not the case this weekend, unfortunately.   Our COVID numbers are at alltime highs, and most of the events and  meetings that I would have had back home canceled. They are on Zoom. So  life is just a little bit different. You roll with it. And it means  that I am here in Washington, DC, on this Friday afternoon.   But I opened up the paper this morning, the Anchorage Daily News, our  largest statewide newspaper, to, again, headlines that have just kind  of unfolded over these past weeks with more just grim and difficult  news. The headline today is: ``Alaska infection rate remains high with  over 1,200 new COVID cases.''   We are leading--we are leading the Nation right now in our COVID  rates, and it is interesting. Alaska has--we are separated enough  geographically, but through the advantages of air travel and road  travel, we mix, we mingle, we get around, and the virus knows no  bounds, as we all know. But as we are seeing, thankfully, the case  counts beginning to decline here in the lower 48, Alaska is doing just  the opposite.   I am quoting here from our paper:         On average, the U.S. saw a 26% decrease in cases over the       last two weeks while Alaska recorded an 84% increase.    They go on to say:         If Alaska were a country, it would be the nation with the       world's highest per capita case rate, according to data from       the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns       Hopkins University.    The article proceeds to state that:         Alaska's 171 average daily cases per 100,000 over the last       seven days is nearly double the rate seen in West Virginia,       which . . . [is currently] second in the [Nation]. Bermuda       and Serbia, at the top of the global list, have a case rate       of 99.    So we are at 171 average daily cases per 100,000. It has been  challenging. We are a State that has limited capacity. We have got a  smaller population, obviously. But that also means that we have fewer  hospitals. We have more limited means, in terms of our ability to care  for those who have become very, very sick, and it is straining--it is  really maxing out our hospitals to levels that we really just could not  have even anticipated could happen.   As our hospitals are maxed out, it is not just the capacity, the  number of people that you can put into your ICU; it is those who are  daily doing the work of caring for those who are coming into our  hospitals, coming in sicker and staying longer. We have maxed out our  hospitals, and when I say ``maxing out,'' in the Alaska vernacular,  basically that means there is no room at the hospital. Our largest  hospital is Providence, Alaska Regional, Mat-Su, Alaska Native Medical  Center, Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, Bartlett--they are at capacity  within their ICUs, and let me share with you what it means to be at  capacity in your ICU.   I will share. I was at Alaska Regional just a weekend ago--actually,  now two weekends ago--and I was told that their ICU, which is a 16-bed  ICU, had been expanded to 20; and 100 percent of the beds, when I was  there on that Saturday, were occupied by COVID patients with no room  for anyone else to come to that particular medical facility.  [[Page S6874]]    I had been at Fairbanks Memorial Hospital--actually there on an  emergency, not myself but with another individual. We go to the  emergency room, and as we were waiting for the doctors to come and  address this non-COVID-related medical emergency, I was advised by the  evening supervisor that Fairbanks Memorial Hospital was at capacity  within their ICU. And what that meant was that Fairbanks Memorial was  at capacity and, as of that evening, all of the other hospitals in  Alaska that could care in an ICU capacity were filled. So I was told  that my loved one may be in a situation, if he needed to be in the ICU,  that I needed to prepare myself and others that he may be sent to  Seattle or Portland that night. For those of you that don't know your  geography there, that is a 3, 3\1/2\-hour flight by jet. It would have  been a medevac. It is thousands of miles away.   That is what is happening in Alaska right now. When your hospitals  are full, you just can't put them in an ambulance and take them to  another town. We are taking these folks to another State. And, again,  keep in mind, the reason that I was there that evening with this  individual was not COVID-related, but that is the squeeze. That is the  pressure that it puts on the rest of your system.   Just this week, the State is dealing with crisis standards of care  guidelines as it relates to how individuals may receive monoclonal  antibody treatments because the supplies are scarce out there.   So it is tough right now. It is tough. Beds are hard to find, and the  extraordinary men and women who every day are going in and doing as  best they can to provide for the level of care that is needed are doing  so, but they are tired. They are tired. They can't get enough help. You  have those who are exposed. You have to quarantine. It puts pressure on  everybody else. People are running themselves to the ground.   But we have good news that is happening. Our Governor has been  working to bring additional health workers in, and we are starting to  see, just this week, as many as--we were hoping 500 but maybe a little  bit less than that--nurses, respiratory therapists are starting to come  to the State as part of a Federal contract. So you have got State- contracted healthcare workers. The Alaska Native Medical Center is  going to be receiving additional support from a disaster medical  assistance team. Again, we are at a point where you just can't take it  on anymore. And our numbers have not yet peaked.   I don't share these statistics and I don't share the front page of  the Daily News just to bring people up to speed as to what is happening  in Alaska. That wasn't necessarily my purpose here.   My purpose this afternoon is, in the midst of this, in the midst of  this real crisis in my State, when it comes to the availability of  healthcare and responding to this virus that is killing--killing-- Alaskans, killing Americans, killing people around the world, that we  show a little kindness because right now that seems to be in as limited  capacity as some of the hospitals that we have in Alaska. It is  kindness and respect for where people are.   Your healthcare workers are giving every ounce of what they have to  be there, to leave their families. They are worried about everybody.  But they are there for us, and they are doing the best job possible.  And some of what we see in return is not the best of America. It is not  the best that Alaskans have to offer.   We have had some just horrible, horrible confrontations in our public  meetings in Anchorage. The top of the fold in the Anchorage paper is  about an assembly meeting where individuals wore yellow Stars of David  to protest the mask ordinance that the Anchorage assembly was taking  up, comparing the mask mandate to the Holocaust. It is shocking. At  some of the assembly meetings--and it is not just in Anchorage, we are  seeing it in other communities as well--it is neighbor against  neighbor.   We have had providers go to provide testimony before in these public  meetings, and not only have they been ridiculed and mocked, but we hear  the stories, we read the stories that they have been spit upon. This is  not how we show appreciation for those who are trying their absolute  best to be there for us. And they will literally turn the other cheek  and make sure that the care that they are providing in that ICU, in  that ER, is without discrimination as to whether or not you have been  vaccinated or not. They are going to be there to take care of you. So,  please, can we please show some kindness to one another at these times  of stress and of anxiety to families?   We in Alaska are pretty hardy. We are independent. We can handle  things on our own, but we are better because we are also good neighbors  to one another, more often than not.   When somebody's car breaks down by the side of the road, and it is  cold and it is dark, we stop. We help them. We are there for them. When  somebody is sick, we deliver the food. We are good neighbors. So we, in  Alaska, need to remember to be that good neighbor to one another. We  can have disagreements. We can have differing points of view. We can  express them without degrading one another, without denigrating one  another, without humiliating, and mocking one another.   So I know that we will be beyond COVID. It is not coming soon enough  for any of us. But I just ask that as we go through this, in this State  and around this country and around the world, that we remember that we  are all better when we care for one another and we show a little  kindness.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
