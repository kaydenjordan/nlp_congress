 Madam Speaker, Harrison Township, New Jersey, recently  celebrated its 175th anniversary. This town has been a staple of south  Jersey for many years.   Harrison Township was built on farming, as its local economy and its  access to Philadelphia and New York continued its prosperity.   After the railroad opened in 1889, the station became a major  shipping point. Postwar Harrison Township saw an era of change and  growth with new regional highway construction that made the area much  more accessible to all.   Harrison Township in the 21st century continues to grow with staples  like wineries, antique stores, continued agriculture, and farming.   But what is most noticeable about Harrison Township is their  residents, their people, those who are new, and those who have been  here for generations, like Vince Gangemi, Sr., who for so many years  has given back to their wonderful town. They love their town.   South Jersey is proud to consider this historical place a part of our  community.  [[Page H4052]]                                ____________________
