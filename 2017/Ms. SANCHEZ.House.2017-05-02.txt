 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition H.R. 1180, a  bill that would rob workers of pay they've earned.   This proposal guts overtime protections and forces working men and  women to make the false choice between time with their loved ones and a  fair wage. Instead of offering ``flexibility'' to working families,  employers should be following the letter of the law and pay workers  fairly for the hours they work. Employers shouldn't be able to put  their workers' well-being at risk under the guise of giving workers a  choice.   If Republicans truly wanted to help working families, they would  guarantee paid sick days and paid family leave instead of offering the  ``flexibility'' for employers to choose how workers live their lives.  This bill is a bait and switch that amounts to nothing more than  another attack on worker's rights. I strongly oppose this bill and urge  my colleagues to vote no.
