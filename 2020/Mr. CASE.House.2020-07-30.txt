 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7797, the  Boosting Long-Term U.S. Engagement in the Pacific Act, also known as  the BLUE Pacific Act.   I am proud to have introduced this bill, together with my colleagues,  Congressmen Ami Bera, Ted Yoho, Brad Sherman, and   Don Young, as well  as other members of our Congressional Pacific Islands Caucus.   Scattered across the vast waters of the Pacific, from Hawaii to Rapa  Nui to Palau, and New Caledonia, are countless isles and atolls that  constitute what we know as the Pacific Islands and their subregions of  Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. The collective land and maritime  exclusive economic zones of the Pacific Islands cover more of the  Earth's surface than the land areas of China and Russia combined. These  islands are home to diverse and dynamic cultures and people on the  front lines of climate change and facing significant challenges to  long-term sustainable development.   The United States is not some remote power in this integral part of  our world. For two centuries plus, we have been, and today we are, a  Pacific nation. We have jurisdictions of our own among the family of  Pacific Islands, including my home State of Hawaii. We have  longstanding ties with all of the Pacific Islands, be they independent  nations, countries in free association, or territories of our friends  and allies.   Countless Americans died to liberate our Pacific neighbors in storied  battles, including Tarawa, Peleliu, Guadalcanal, and more, during the  Second World War.   In my own district is the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific,  the final resting place of so many of these warriors. Our foreign  policy in the Pacific Islands is driven by this deep historical  relationship and the shared interests and values built by decades of  consistent but quiet engagement.   Over the past 20 years alone, the United States has provided over $5  billion in assistance for the region. In just the past decade, multiple  administrations and Congresses have heightened our engagement in the  Pacific Islands as we have focused our attention increasingly in the  Indo-Pacific region.   Reflecting this renewed attention to the Pacific Islands, last year I  joined several of my colleagues in cofounding our first-ever,  bipartisan Congressional Pacific Islands Caucus. We are dedicated to  promoting greater understanding of this region and advocating for a  sound United States foreign policy in the Pacific Islands that advances  our shared interests and values.  [[Page H3989]]    Our BLUE Pacific Act establishes a comprehensive, long-term framework  for United States foreign policy in the Pacific Islands, focusing on  three essential pillars:   Security, development, and shared values.   Our legislation would expand diplomatic and development presence;  increase maritime security cooperation and assistance; deepen and  diversify trade; support regional economic and social development in  areas like public health and education; invest in climate adaptation  and climate resilient infrastructure; coordinate with existing regional  institutions and like-minded allies and partners; promote shared values  like press freedom and gender equality; and strengthen people-to-people  relationships and civil society. It would back up our commitment by  authorizing $1 billion in assistance programs for the region for each  of the next five fiscal years, more than triple current levels of  assistance.   In naming this bill, we not only pay tribute to the concept of the  ``Blue Pacific'' embraced by leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum  themselves as a shared identity and platform for collective action, but  also intend for our efforts to be informed by and coordinated with the  work of existing regional institutions and frameworks. This legislation  would also integrate these programs with those of our like-minded  allies and partners, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Taiwan,  and more.   I have no doubt that the introduction and enactment of the BLUE  Pacific Act will be welcomed by our partners and allies in the Pacific  Islands.   In uncertain times, this legislation sends a clear and powerful  statement of what our foreign policy seeks to achieve--a regional  order, built on mutual assistance and benefit, free of coercion, and  fully respectful of the sovereignty of all nations. We seek to empower  the countries and people of the region to determine the course of their  own destinies. As a Pacific nation, we hope to share in that future  alongside our Pacific Islands neighbors.   The BLUE Pacific Act is the first step in that direction. I encourage  my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring the BLUE Pacific Act and urge  swift consideration of this critical legislation.                            ____________________
