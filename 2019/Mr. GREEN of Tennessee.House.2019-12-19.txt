 Mr. Speaker, I want to just say today that I  live in the State of Tennessee, and in Tennessee, we are a fiscally  responsible State. We have the lowest per capita debt in the Nation. We  have no income tax at all. We have no investment income tax.   When a State has superhigh taxes and you allow individuals to write  that tax off, it is unfair to those well-managed States like Tennessee  that don't tax our people as much.   So, when you raise caps or you raise deductions, those States that  are poorly managed, those States that are high-tax States to their  individuals are subsidized by the people in Tennessee. We wind up  paying more tax so that those States that are poorly managed can pay  less.   To say, oh, we have got to do this for the low-income individuals out  there, well, how about those States just manage themselves better, tax  their people less, and then there wouldn't be an issue? Why should the  people of Tennessee have to subsidize States that can't manage  themselves?
