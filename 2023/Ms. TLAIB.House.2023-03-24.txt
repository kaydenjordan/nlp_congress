 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of Imam  Abdullah El-Amin, whose memory lives on in the hearts of communities  across metro Detroit.   Imam El-Amin was a proud Detroiter. He was also a spiritual leader  who created strong ties to our diverse community throughout his  impactful service work.   Imam El-Amin has always been passionate in his belief that interfaith  dialogue creates stronger, more meaningful relationships across  cultures.   In 1983, he was one of the founding members of the Muslim Center of  Detroit, a masjid that was formed as an outreach center to bring people  from different religious backgrounds together.   As a spiritual leader, he witnessed the need for compassionate end- of-life care in communities throughout the area and was inspired to  found an organization called Crescent Janazah Services to support  countless individuals in their transition.   I still remember, Mr. Speaker, after a speech, I had stated one of my  favorite verses, my favorite surah in the Quran, which is: ``With  hardship comes ease.'' He came up to me with a big smile, and he said:  ``That is also my favorite verse.''   Please join me in honoring the memory of Imam Abdullah El-Amin as we  mourn his loss. Allah yerhamo.                            ____________________
