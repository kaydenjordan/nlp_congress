Res. 3, the  Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2017, allows the  chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations,  aggregates, and levels in the budget resolution for legislation related  to healthcare reform. The authority to adjust is contingent on the  legislation not increasing the deficit over the period of the total of  fiscal years 2017-2026.   I find that S. Amdt. 267 fulfills the conditions of deficit  neutrality found in section 3001 of S. Con. Res. 3. Accordingly, I am  revising the allocations to the Committee on Finance, the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, HELP, and the budgetary  aggregates to account for the budget effects of the amendment. I am  also adjusting the unassigned to committee savings levels in the budget  resolution to reflect that, while there are savings in the amendment  attributable to both the HELP and Finance committees, the Congressional  Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation are unable to produce  unique estimates for each provision due to interactions and other  effects that are estimated simultaneously.   I ask unanimous consent that the tables, which provide details about  the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              BUDGET AGGREGATES                       BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS   (Pursuant to Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and  Section 3001 of S.
