 Mr. Speaker, today I introduced the PLUS Loan  Disability Forgiveness Act, a bill to relieve the burden of student  loan debt on parents whose children become permanently disabled. While  most student loans are forgiven if a student becomes totally and  permanently disabled, parent PLUS loans are not.   It is simply wrong that a parent struggling with a child's disability  is not afforded the same loan forgiveness as other borrowers. My bill  would extend disability discharge to parent PLUS loans. It would allow  families to focus on healing, not servicing debt. It would help lighten  the $1.4 trillion owed by student borrowers and their families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these  parents, who are just trying to help their children succeed.                            ____________________
