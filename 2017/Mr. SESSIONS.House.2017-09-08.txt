 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 509 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 509         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 601)       to enhance the transparency and accelerate the impact of       assistance provided under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961       to promote quality basic education in developing countries,       to better enable such countries to achieve universal access       to quality basic education and improved learning outcomes, to       eliminate duplication and waste, and for other purposes, with       the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate       amendment thereto, and to consider in the House, without       intervention of any point of order, a motion offered by the       chair of the Committee on Appropriations or his designee that       the House concur in the Senate amendment to the House       amendment to the Senate amendment. The Senate amendment and       the motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be       debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the motion to adoption without intervening motion.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1  hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule, and  I believe the entire country understands why we have the underlying  legislation that we have before us today.   The rule provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to the  House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 601, the Hurricane  Supplemental, Debt Limit, Continuing Appropriations, and Flood  Insurance Package.   Mr. Speaker, what this means is that the United States Congress, the  House of Representatives, first acted in response to the hurricane that  hit Texas and Louisiana and caused flooding across the United States.  We then passed that directly to the United States Senate, in working  with the President of the United States and the administration, and the  Senate has provided back the necessary agreement that they passed. That  is why we are here today.   We are here today because this great Nation is finding itself in a  desperate plight of fighting with, for, and against Mother Nature, in  an effort to provide the citizens of the United States of America with  the assurances that, at a time when FEMA is engaged in over 30  different efforts across the country, the United States Congress is  nimble enough and able enough to see the need of the people of the  United States and to respond appropriately.   It is a private-public partnership that takes place not just with the  Federal Government, but it is a government-to-government relationship  that takes place also with the United States FEMA organization  representing the administration and the American people of the States  in which those people reside.   I must tell you that I have been impressed with not only the actions  that the Federal Government has taken, but I am proud each morning that  I stand up and see FEMA and its representatives discussing, preparing,  and providing the American people with the necessary information, the  cause and the backup to be prepared for what lies ahead.   This legislation directly addresses the critical responses that are  needed by this Nation and meets the funding obligations of the Nation.  My fellow Texans, several of whom will be speaking this morning on the  rule, are men  [[Page H7188]]  who were directly in the face of the storm; and the people whom they  represent and the people who have confidence in them are asking them  for the necessary proper help that the United States Government would  wish to give. These men and women of the Texas delegation have seen  this problem together, and they are addressing it as a team.   We come together not just as Republican and Democrat, men and women,  but we come together as a nation. And quite honestly, Mr. Speaker,  Texans are overwhelmed with the response that we have seen not just  from our colleagues, but the wishes, hopes, and prayers of this Nation,  those who have come to Texas and are helping us out.   We now turn our thoughts and ideas and prayers to others who are in  harm's way. We are well aware that it has come across our territories,  it is entering the United States soon, perhaps as early as this  morning, and we have done our work here today and will get that work  done as we finalize the vote.   We appreciate and respect and thank the Nation for its support.   Please know that this legislation provides us, today, essential  emergency disaster relief for those areas devastated by storms. A  $15.25 billion emergency supplemental package is contained within this  legislation. What we intend to do is to provide this and make it  available to the States, where our elected officials will be  administering the things that will make them available, along with  FEMA, to the American people and to the people who were affected.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday I received a call from a gentleman, George P.  Bush, who is our land commissioner in Texas. Commissioner Bush asked me  to not only thank the United States Congress, but also the American  people. He asked me, along with Governor Greg Abbott from the State of  Texas, to thank the American people for standing with us.   We may have been in harm's way, we may have seen over 50 inches of  rain, we may have tens of thousands of people who are still in harm's  way, but we are not too proud to say thank you, thank you to this great  Nation for hearing our call, seeing our need, and, today, providing the  necessary resources to help us rebuild our lives.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, over the next few speakers, you will have  an opportunity to hear from members of the Texas delegation who were  not only in harm's way, but who represent many brave people who have  responded to the call of others.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Corpus Christi,  Texas (Mr. Farenthold).    Mr. Speaker, this rule and the underlying legislation  is specifically answering a question of national emergency, and that is  as it relates to hurricane and hurricanes that are nearing the United  States.   I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Weber), one of the Members of Congress who was in the direct bull's-eye  of this, in the district and the people that he represents.    Yes, I appreciate the gentlewoman engaging me.   I had understood that I had several other speakers, so what I would  say to the gentlewoman is, if she would like to move on, I have none  that I see right now. As we know, our Conference is in a meeting, so I  would allow the gentlewoman to move forward. I will do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would like to publicly thank the Democratic members of the Rules  Committee. The gentlewoman, Mrs. Slaughter, has recognized from the  first moment when we came back the genuine desire and need for us to  work together. Her entire team, including the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), and the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis) and their staff,  has worked diligently to ensure that this piece of legislation would  become ready for Members of Congress to vote on it.   I would like to thank my staff and also our members, our members of  the Rules Committee who spent a great deal of time this week.   Mr. Speaker, we are public servants and we are expected to do what we  are doing. But it should also be noted that my colleague went out of  her way to ensure that the discussion, the debate, and the delivery of  this package is done.                                time  0945    Mr. Speaker, last night I received information from Dr. Shelley Hall  and Dr. Rick Snyder from Dallas, Texas, speaking most directly about  the people who they have come in contact with as volunteers from the  Dallas County Medical Society at the convention center in Dallas,  Texas.   As people have filled our city from outside these storm areas, I hope  that they have met also Texans who cared about them. We have a history  of this because we had to do this 12 or 13 years ago with Katrina, as  we took people, young babies, little babies, who were flown in to  Dallas and other areas in Texas; Fort Worth, Texas, opening up its  doors; Austin, Texas; San Antonio, Texas. This is an effort that is  more than just a State's effort, however, today. This is the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Texas delegation, I want to thank  Members of Congress, and, in particular, Ms. Slaughter and her team,  for expeditiously providing this information of us working together.   Lastly, we will hand this to Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, from the  Appropriations Committee, and Nita Lowey, who is that ranking member. I  have seen all four of us work together on an important effort.   Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this  rule and the underlying measure to provide FEMA with this emergency  downpayment, as the agency is running out of funds and bracing for  Irma's impact, and perhaps two other storms that may be headed to the  United States of America or our territories.   We are one Nation under God. I give thanks for that, Mr. Speaker.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 509 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What it Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment ``        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools  [[Page H7191]]       for those who oppose the Republican majority's agenda and       allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer       an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.   The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
