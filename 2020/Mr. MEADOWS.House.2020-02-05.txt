 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5214, the Representative Payee  Fraud Prevention Act.   Federal employees often dedicate decades of their lives to public  service.  [[Page H808]]  When they retire, those Federal employees receive their hard-earned  retirement benefits. Currently, the Federal Government issues payments  to more than 2 million retirees and more than half a million survivor  annuitants each year. Annuitants receive an average of $2,500 a month.   If a Federal annuitant becomes incapacitated in some way, a  representative payee may be appointed. A representative payee is a  person who receives and manages benefits on behalf of another person  who is not fully capable of managing their own benefits. Certainly,  things like mental illness, disability, or long-term illness are just a  few examples of situations where a payee may step in and provide that  counsel.   Obviously, as we look at this, a representative payee has a duty to  use financial benefits to assist with the care and well-being of the  intended beneficiary. Surprisingly, though, it is not a crime for a  representative payee to commit financial fraud against an incapacitated  Federal retiree. However, under the Social Security Act, it is a crime  to do so.   I have always assumed that this type of financial abuse of retired  Federal employees was also a crime. But right now, under Federal law,  it is not.   As the chairwoman from New York mentioned, this is a commonsense  piece of legislation. I would like to thank my colleague, Ms. Tlaib,  for her leadership on this.   This bill will make it a crime to embezzle Federal retirement  benefits as a representative payee. If convicted, the representative  payee could be subject to criminal fines and up to 5 years in prison.  Obviously, this is a protection for our Federal workforce.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this particular piece of legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I certainly would rise in support of this  legislation. I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan for her kind words.  Ms. Tlaib has been leading on this.   The gentlewoman is right. Chairman Cummings had an infectious way of  bringing people together, and I rise in support of this legislation as  a tribute to his leadership and to her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3830, the  Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act.   The Federal Government is a complex and diverse organization. As  Members of Congress, we are responsible for ensuring the Federal  Government is efficient and effective. However, we lack the tools to  understand how the taxpayer dollars are spent. Oftentimes, we lack a  detailed list of the programs that are there.   This bipartisan bill will increase transparency and make it easier to  see how the Federal Government uses its tax dollars.   May I edit that last statement just a bit? It is not the government's  tax dollars. It is the hardworking American people's tax dollars. So  this is a critically important additional tool.   In fiscal year 2019, the Federal Government spent nearly $4.4  trillion. Taxpayers should know where their hard-earned money is going.  To follow the money, we need to know what the government is doing, so a  comprehensive inventory of Federal programs will help us do that.   In 2010, Congress required the executive branch to develop a  comprehensive Federal program inventory. The program inventory Congress  envisioned would have given the public insight into the government's  organizational structure and provided a comparable list of all Federal  programs.   Comparability is key. We need to see how these programs match up. To  give you one example, there were 678 duplicative programs in the  Federal Government that dealt just with sustainable energy. You can  argue the merits of priority or the lack thereof, but, certainly, over  600 programs to deal with one particular issue across the government is  something that cannot be efficient.   However, the Government Accountability Office found that the program  inventory built for the previous administration in 2013 failed to meet  the intent of the law or needs of Congress. Implementing guidance  allowed far too much flexibility for agencies to define programs. Each  agency used its own definition, which prevented programs to be compared  to one another. So the Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act updates the law to  require a more consistent definition of Federal programs across all  agencies.   Mr. Speaker, I think this is a good bill that goes with the intent of  Congress as laid out, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am sure we have one other speaker who is  running in the halls right now, but I may let him speak upon a  different bill.   Let me just mention Mr. Walberg's leadership on this, a real shout- out to him and his leadership on trying to make sure congressional  intent was indeed addressed. I thank him for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    I appreciate the gentlewoman's flexibility, but if you  would let me reclaim my time and yield to the gentleman, who made it in  by the hair on his chinny chin chin.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman's courtesy. I urge  support for this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and rise in opposition to the bill. No one has invested more time than  perhaps Mr. Connolly or myself on postal reform. But I think it was  Winston Churchill who said that no matter how beautiful the strategy,  we must occasionally look at the results. And the results of this bill  will do nothing to stop the post office from hemorrhaging money.   As we look at this prefunding--and I would agree with the  gentlewoman--part of our solution, part of the bipartisan solution in  the previous Congress, was to look at this prefunding issue and to try  to address it. But to do it as a standalone bill, Mr. Speaker, is  certainly not what the doctor ordered. Because even with this, the  Postal Service continues to lose money each and every day.   I would say that if this was the bomb that solved their problem, it  would have already been solved because they haven't been making the  payments.   What the American people need to understand is, they are wanting  relief from a payment that they are not making, and it is going to make  zero difference in terms of the viability of the Postal Service.   Now, we can all agree that there need to be major reforms, but this  particular bill, and the way that it is being put forth, would actually  hurt the potential progress we have in addressing real reforms. With  that, I sadly rise in opposition to this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I love the passion. The only problem is it  is misplaced.   I can tell you that, if this bill would truly solve the business  model that the Postal Service has, I would rise and support it. If this  is all we are going to do, hallelujah. Let's do it and get it done. But  the gentleman is wrong. This does not solve the problem.   You can give them a pass on $5 billion a year, and they are still  losing money. That is the whole issue. That is the crux of the issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia, and I  want to highlight his work on this particular issue, and I agree with  him that this, ultimately, will be part of what has to be dovetailed  into anything we do to fix the Postal Service.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis) in the spirit of letting my colleagues express their  full-throated support of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments, and  I would also join him. We have got a number of great unions that I have  had the privilege of getting to know over this time as we looked at  comprehensive reform, and his acknowledging them and his willingness to  look at something that actually solves the problem is to be applauded.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate all the points that my friends opposite are making. In  fact, I have made some of the very same points when we talk about  reform bills.   The problem is, all the wonderful things that they are talking about  in this bill do not exist. They are not making the payments. They  haven't made a payment since 2010.   So how does giving relief from a payment you are not making suddenly  make the Postal Service viable? It doesn't.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Bost), who will give you an opposing view from our side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I do need to correct a few things that the gentleman from Oregon just  addressed. This is not--support or being against this bill is not an  attack on the Postal Service.   I mean, there is no one who has invested more time--I can promise  you, when I came to Congress, fixing the Postal Service was not on my  bucket list. And as we have invested time, and I see my good friend,  Mr. Lynch, my good friend, Mr. Connolly, let me just tell you, we have  invested days, if not weeks and months, to try to address this.   But the gentleman from Oregon is just not correct. This particular  bill, while it may be part of a solution, gives them no flexibility. It  gives them no additional cash flow. They are still going to go out of  business if we do not come together and get something worked out for  all of us to make sure that, not only do we have a postal system that  works, but one that is not a mere shadow of its former self.   I will say this: I want to make sure that my postal unions and all of  those that are watching very intently, you have made an impact on this  Member from North Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, they have let me know exactly how important this is. And  yet, at the same time, I am afraid I cannot support this bill because  it does not do what we need it to do, and that is, address the problem  today. This just kicks the can down the road. And unfortunately, it  doesn't even kick it down the road long enough to allow the postal  workers to depend on the very system that employs them.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I know that everybody is tuned in in their offices, paying attention  to this unbelievable debate, and so for all of you that are tuned in on  C-SPAN, and as we debate this, I think it is important that I share a  couple of sentences from the U.S. Postal Service. So it is not from my  colleagues opposite. It is not from my point of view; but this is what  they have to say about this bill: ``It would neither reduce the  underlying RHB liability nor improve our cash flow or our long-term  financial position. It would not impact the liquidity crisis that we  have.''   These are not my words, Mr. Speaker. These are the words of those  that are closest to the financial responsibility, the Postal Service  themselves.   So if the gentlewoman is prepared to close, I will just recommend to  my colleagues a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 3941, the FedRAMP Authorization Act.   Cybersecurity and IT modernization are both vital issues that we need  to make sure run properly. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly)  has been very proactive on this front.   The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP, as  it is commonly referred to, would allow Federal programs to focus on  cybersecurity for cloud services, and it provides a process for  agencies to follow when procuring cloud systems to ensure that those  systems meet strict cybersecurity controls.   The gentlewoman, the chairman of the full committee, has certainly  talked on a number of issues as it relates to this bill, but since  there is no opposition that I am aware of, I will just submit my  remarks for the Record.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3941, the FedRAMP  Authorization Act.   Cyber security and IT modernization are both vital issues to ensure  this government runs efficiently and effectively.   The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP, is  the main federal program focused on cyber security for cloud services.   It provides a process for agencies to follow when procuring cloud  systems to ensure the systems meet strict cyber security controls.   Recent federal policies make the focus on securing cloud services  especially important.   With the Cloud First initiative in 2011 and the Cloud Smart  initiative from last year, the government has focused on implementation  of cloud technologies.   The federal government has been plagued by reoccurring problems in  information technology, such as low asset utilization, duplicative  systems, and fragmented resources.   Shifting to the cloud provides for improved asset utilization,  increased innovation, and a more responsive tech environment.   These improved efficiencies lead to a significant cost savings.   In fiscal year 2018, the government spent roughly six and a half  billion dollars on cloud computing, with eighty four percent coming  from FedRAMP authorized providers.   Efficiencies from FedRAMP saved agencies over two hundred fifty  million dollars.   Codifying the program is an important step to encouraging agencies to  take advantage of this program and all the benefits it offers.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this. I will say that I  have had a number of conversations in recent weeks with stakeholders  who have offered some suggestions on what we could do, so I look  forward to working with the gentleman opposite on how we can address  this critical issue.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge support and adoption of this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 375, the Payment  Integrity Information Act of 2019. I know that I am not alone in  addressing the Speaker on the will of the House, but there are very few  times that we see a whole lot of good that comes out of the other  Chamber in the Capitol. This is one of the rare moments.                                time  1600    So as I see this, I would actually encourage support of it.   According to the GAO, since 2003, we have had $1.5 trillion--that is  trillion with a T--in improper payments. In fiscal year 2018 alone,  Federal agencies estimated that there was $151 billion in improper  payments.   The Speaker probably knows that oftentimes we have had, in Oversight  Committee, annual reports on improper payments, and consistently we are  talking about hundreds of billions of dollars that are sent to not only  the wrong place, but in terms that are not even accounted for. And  after you get hundreds of billions year after year, eventually that  adds up to real money. It is time that we address it.   This is a commonsense piece of legislation that brings everything  together so that we can start, hopefully, addressing the sad state of  where we are in addressing improper payments. The American taxpayers  demand it, the American taxpayers deserve it, and, ultimately, we have  a responsibility to address it. So I rise in support of this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, this bill actually takes five  different laws that have really not been codified in an appropriate  manner, brings them together under one umbrella, and allows us to  address this in a meaningful way, a commonsense bill.   Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues opposite to thank them for their  support. I rise in support of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of S. 394, the Presidential Transition Enhancement  Act of 2019.   First, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Johnson for taking  a serious look at the needed ethics reform. The Senate has developed  this legislative package in a bipartisan manner, something that we  would be well served in this House to do.   At the beginning of Congress, I think the Democrats introduced H.R.  1, which was a grab bag of unrelated Democrat messaging bills. One  section of H.R. 1 was really directed at the President of the United  States and his administration without really addressing serious ethics  reforms.   S. 394, on the other hand, is an honest ethics reform package. The  bipartisan support in the Senate shows that ethics reform does not need  to be a partisan exercise.   I would suggest Senator Johnson's bill addresses a number of  ambiguities about how agencies work with Presidential transition teams  that were identified by the Trump transition team. For example,  agencies and the Presidential transition team should come to an  agreement about the use and disclosure of transition team records.   The bill also establishes a requirement for a transition team's  ethics plan. The plan would include consideration of how conflicts of  interest would be addressed by members of the transition team and the  President-elect.   I hope that we can use this for our future benefit as we work  together in a bipartisan manner to make sure that ethics are addressed  and stop politicizing ethics reforms.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3976, introduced by my friend,  Representative Brenda Lawrence.   This bill, as has been mentioned, names a post office located in  Detroit, Michigan, in honor of the ``Queen of Soul,'' Aretha Franklin.   Aretha Franklin was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, and  civil rights activist, and so we want to give honor where honor is due.   She began her career as a child singing at her church in Detroit. For  the next six decades, her distinctive voice captivated listeners and  influenced countless other singers.  [[Page H828]]    So it is my delight to rise in support of this particular bill. It is  out of ``Respect'' for my good friend from Michigan, and so we will  ``Say a Little Prayer'' and hope that this goes through.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I will just cut to the chase. Let's get  this thing done and get it over with and make sure that we show the  ``respect'' that we should.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4794. I  appreciate Representative Rose's willingness to acknowledge the great  work of Mother Cabrini and so much has been said already about her  accomplishments.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4981 introduced by my good  friend, the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams).   Certainly, she has gone over all the reasons why support for this  measure is not only demanded, but it is certainly deserved. I would  just join her in asking my colleagues to support it, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of this legislation, H.R. 5037.   Walter Jones was not just a colleague; he was a friend. For many of  us in this Chamber, we can remember when he sat just off the center  aisle there, just a few rows back from the front. He was consistently  there and consistently a voice, as my friend from North Carolina (Mr.  Price) just said, of those who had fallen in the ultimate fight for  freedom and liberty. Many of us have pictures outside of our  congressional offices recognizing those who have fallen in their fight  for liberty in the armed services, and that is due in no small part to  our good friend, Mr. Walter Jones.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Murphy), who is carrying on that legacy in his congressional  district.    Mr. Speaker, all of us have come together to give a  little bit of what we got in big doses, and that was compassion and  care from a man who was not only strongest in his convictions, but  resolute in those convictions as well.   So I rise in support. I appreciate my colleagues opposite for their  support of this. I appreciate Congressman Murphy for his leadership as  well, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3317, introduced  by my good friend, Representative French Hill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I urge the bill's passage, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4279, introduced  by Representative Fred Keller. Certainly, his leadership on this is to  be applauded.   I also thank the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence) for her  willingness to not only lead on this, but manage the floor for  Chairwoman Maloney.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
