 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last weekend, I had the privilege of  attending the welcome-home ceremony for 112 members of the South Dakota  National Guard. These men and women, who serve in the 147th Forward  Support Company or the Bravo Battery of the 1-147th Field Artillery  Battalion, were deployed to Europe as part of Atlantic Resolve, a  partnership with our allies in Eastern and Central Europe developed in  response to Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014.   The Atlantic Resolve allows U.S. and allied forces to build strong  working relationships and to hone their ability to conduct operations.  Members of Bravo Battery and the 147th Forward Support Company spent  most of the year in Europe working with partner forces. They  participated in two multinational exercises and brought artillery to  Germany and Hungary.   These soldiers finally got home last weekend, but they didn't leave  Atlantic Resolve without South Dakota support. Other members of the  147th Forward Support Company and Alpha Battery of the 1-147th Field  Artillery Battalion head for Europe in September. Other South Dakota- based military members--airmen from Ellsworth Air Force Base--also  deployed abroad recently.   Four B-1 bombers from the 34th and 37th Bomb Squadrons at Ellsworth  made a flying trip to Saudi Arabia late this month to support the U.S.  military presence there. The bombers flew directly from South Dakota to  Saudi Arabia, refueling six times in midair, once again demonstrating  the incredible capability of this aircraft and of our Ellsworth airmen.   Atlantic Resolve, the B-1 mission, the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr  al-Baghdadi during a raid conducted by U.S. troops--they are all a  reminder of the vital work that our military members are doing.   A lot of military missions don't make a big splash in the news. We  don't hear a lot about everything that our men and women are doing on a  daily basis. We don't hear details of all the operations: the joint  exercises with our allies, the countless training evolutions, the  never-ending aircraft and vehicle maintenance, the hours watching radar  systems for contacts, the endless logistical work to support troops in  the field, the painstaking weeks and months of intelligence gathering  for a single mission.   Every hour of every day, members of the U.S. military are on duty  working to keep the peace and to ensure the security of our Nation. As  Members of Congress, we have no greater obligation than to ensure that  our troops have the resources they need. We owe it to the men and women  who get up each day willing to lay down their lives for us, and we owe  it to every man, woman, and child we represent because the safety of  our country depends upon the strength of our military.   Ensuring that our troops have the resources they need obviously means  ensuring that they have adequate funding, but it also means getting  that funding to them in a timely fashion. It means passing regular  order appropriations bills instead of forcing our military to rely on  temporary funding measures that leave the military in doubt about  funding levels and unable to start important new projects.   Getting military funding approved in a timely manner is a priority  for me and for a lot of my colleagues here in the Senate. Chairman  Shelby, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, worked  hard this year to ensure that we could bring the Defense appropriations  bill to the floor in a timely fashion, but Senate Democrats have so far  blocked Senate consideration of this important legislation. Their  refusal to allow the Senate to move forward on funding has left the  military in limbo, unable to fully fund 2020 priorities and to move  ahead on key projects for the future.   Later today, Democrats will have another chance to move forward with  the Defense appropriations bill and to get our military the resources  that it needs. I am hoping that they will have a change of heart and  decide that funding our military is more important than the partisan  games they have been playing. Our military members are waiting on that  funding. Their ability to do their jobs is being jeopardized by  Democrats' continued blockade of Defense appropriations.   We live in peace and safety every single day because of the men and  women of the U.S. military. It is not a new sentiment, but it bears  repeating because it is too easy to forget that we would not be  enjoying the freedoms and benefits that we enjoy without the constant  vigilance of our men and women in uniform. The least--the very least-- that we can do in return is to make sure that they have every resource  they need to do their jobs and to come home safely.   I strongly urge my Democratic colleagues to vote yes on moving  forward with the Defense appropriations bill later today and to send a  loud and clear message to the American military that we are going to  ensure here in the Congress that you have the resources, the training,  the weapons systems, the equipment, and everything that you need to  keep Americans safe each and every single day.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, for the information of the Senate, in the  managers' package of amendments that was just agreed to, amendment No.  1143 was misidentified as a Capito  [[Page S6316]]  amendment. It is actually an amendment by Senator Jones that Senator  Capito cosponsored.    I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson) and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran)  would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2763         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
