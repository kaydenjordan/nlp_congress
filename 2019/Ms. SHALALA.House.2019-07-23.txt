 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  lifesaving bipartisan legislation to designate temporary protective  status for Venezuelans.   Maduro's evil regime has plunged Venezuela into catastrophe. The  once-thriving country is in free fall, with Venezuelans now suffering  from the largest economic, political, and humanitarian crisis in the  entire hemisphere.   Just in 2018, nearly 30,000 Venezuelans applied for asylum in the  United States, becoming the number one country of origin for asylum  claimants.                                time  1800    Many Venezuelans have come to south Florida, where they have  contributed so much to our diverse community. In my district, there are  approximately 17,000 Venezuelan-born residents.   My constituents cannot safely return. A recent U.N. report detailed  the shocking government abuses, including extrajudicial killings at the  hands of Maduro's death squads.   Simply stated, granting TPS for Venezuelans is the right thing to do.   TPS has bipartisan support in the House and in the Senate. We now  have an opportunity to take real action to support those who have fled  the crisis caused by the illegitimate, inhumane Maduro regime.   Madam Speaker, I thank my Florida colleagues on both sides of the  aisle, as well as our colleague from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon),  for their work on this important legislation. I strongly urge a ``yes''  vote.   Vive Venezuela.
