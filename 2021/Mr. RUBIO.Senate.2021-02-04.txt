 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 69 and ask it  be reported by number.    Madam President, this amendment simply says you can't  raise  [[Page S434]]  taxes on small business during the pandemic, and I hope everyone can  support it. I can't imagine anyone being against that idea.   I yield the floor.    I call up my amendment 651 and ask that it be reported by  number.    Mr. President, starting 7 days ago, if you arrived at the  border of the United States with children, you were allowed to stay in  the country on a notice to appear.   I have tremendous compassion for the extraordinary challenges and  horrifying conditions in which people live in the Western Hemisphere  and Central America and the like. There is nothing compassionate about  this policy. What this is doing, what is happening right now--and I  have seen it, and I have talked to people; you can talk to the  government officials in these countries--is these evil traffickers who  take money from these people, who push them through the jungles, who  abuse them, who sometimes kill them and do horrifying things, are now  out there marketing this. They are going around telling people  throughout the Western Hemisphere: You can now get into the United  States and come with children because, if you do, they are going to  give you a little piece of paper, and they are going to let you go on a  Greyhound bus anywhere you want in the country, and you never have to  show up again.   This is going to create chaos on the border, and it is inhumane to  lure people to this country with a policy that is encouraging these  traffickers to go out and do this to them.
