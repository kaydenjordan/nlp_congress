 Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, tragedy struck  Orlando, Florida, at the Pulse nightclub.   Over 100 people celebrating life with friends, partners, and family  were gunned down on a dance floor at a gay club; 49 of them lost their  lives.   A place of refuge was transformed into a death trap by a hateful and  cowardly act, and today we can honor those lives by calling for action.   At the time, the Pulse nightclub was the deadliest mass shooting in  modern U.S. history. Tragically, in the 3 years since this shooting, we  have witnessed more senseless suffering and death:   Parishioners in Texas and South Carolina and worshippers in  Pennsylvania;   Students in Santa Fe and Parkland;   Municipal workers in Virginia Beach;   Neighbors on sidewalks and parks;   Over 50 people shot in just one weekend in Chicago 2 weeks ago;   And then 58 concert goers in Las Vegas lost their lives, taking the  grizzly title of the deadliest mass shooting.   Days after the Pulse shooting, I joined with my colleague, the iconic  Congressman   John Lewis, in leading a sit-in right here on this very  floor. We could not stand for another day of inaction. We stopped  Congress because Congress had stopped working for the American people.   Now, 3 years later, within months of taking the majority, we have  passed two gun safety bills. And while I am encouraged and proud of the  work we have done here in the House, we see the same obstructionist  game being played out in the Senate. The two bills are stalled, and  Americans continue to die.   Mr. Speaker, 40,000 people a year die from gun violence in our  country. Every day, 100 Americans are killed with guns, and hundreds  more are shot and injured.   Gun violence and mass shootings have gone from a rare event to a  public health crisis. Just this week, Massachusetts General Hospital  opened a Gun Violence Prevention Center to teach doctors how to deal  with firearm safety in recognition of the public health risk that gun  violence has become to Americans.   Mr. Speaker, today I come before you standing and not sitting, but  still imploring with the Senate to take a vote: Perform your basic  responsibilities not as Members of Congress but, also, as members of  our communities.   We cannot waste another day. Millions of Americans at home are  worried for their families, frustrated by our inaction, and scared that  they or anyone they love could be next.   We have a simple message on this grim anniversary for the Senate:  Stop the silence. Pass commonsense gun violence prevention measures.  Pass the Equality Act, and do your job for the people.                            ____________________
