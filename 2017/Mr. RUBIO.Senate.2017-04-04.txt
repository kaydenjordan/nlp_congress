 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the  issue of human rights as part of my office's ongoing effort on what we  call the Expression Not Oppression Campaign, where we highlight human  rights abuses around the world and tell the stories of political  prisoners and other brave leaders who are being repressed, jailed,  beaten, or even worse, simply for criticizing the government of a  nation in which they live.   This is an important week for human rights. Two nations with  concerning records regarding human rights--Egypt and China--have sent  their heads of state to meet with our President. And I will have, I  hope, a chance later on this week to discuss the issues we confront in  China, and they are many.   Today, I want to discuss the state of human rights and our general  relationship with Egypt.   Over the past 2 days, the President of Egypt, President Elsisi, has  been visiting our Nation's Capital. He had the opportunity to meet with  the President and other officials in the administration. Earlier today,  I had the opportunity to visit with him as part of a meeting with  members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   Before entering my remarks, I want to make abundantly clear that we  are incredibly impressed and grateful and supportive of the efforts  that President Elsisi and Egypt are undertaking in battling radicalism  and in particular ISIS. They are undertaking this effort, for example,  in the Sinai, and it is quite a challenge.   I also understand that the ongoing ability to defeat radicalism in  the world depends on the stability of our partners internally. That is  why the human rights situation in Egypt is concerning. I believe it is  fair to say it is at its worst in decades, and that is saying  something. It is important.   Some may ask ``Why does America care about that?'' beyond, obviously,  our moral calling to defend the rights of all people. It is that it is  counterproductive behavior. These abuses--the conditions that exist in  Egypt and in other places around the world--are actually conducive to  jihadi ideology, which is the ability to recruit people who feel  vulnerable, who feel oppressed. They become more vulnerable to those  campaigns when they feel they are being mistreated.   The current Government of Egypt, under the leadership of President  Elsisi, has cracked down on civil society. On that, there can be no  debate. They have jailed thousands of political prisoners, including,  sadly, some Americans, and it has responded with brute force to those  who oppose that government.   Again, I reiterate that a strong U.S.-Egypt relationship is important  to America--to advancing our interests in the Middle East. I am here to  speak on behalf of American interests and why this is so important in  our relationship with Egypt and in the stability of the region, but I  must do so by describing the situation on the ground.   In the national interest of our country, we cannot turn a blind eye  to the ongoing repression of Egyptian citizens by their government. It  weakens our moral standing in the world, and, as I have already said  numerous times, it makes Egypt less secure. If Egypt is less secure,  ultimately America will be less secure. Today, I said that to President  Elsisi.   Over the last decades, the American people have provided Egypt with  more than $77 billion in foreign aid. This includes what is currently  $1.3 billion per year in military aid. But as the human rights  situation in Egypt continues to deteriorate and the government refuses  to take the serious and necessary steps of reform and respecting the  rule of law, then this Congress, on behalf of the American people--who  are giving $1.3 billion of their hard-earned taxpayer money--must  continue to pursue the reform of our assistance to Egypt to make sure  that not only is it allowing them to confront the challenges that are  posed by radicalism today but that it also promotes progress in a way  that does not leave Egypt unstable and ultimately vulnerable in the  future.   It is in the interest of both our country and Egypt and the Egyptian  people to implement reforms and to release all of its jailed political  prisoners, including all jailed Americans. Nations cannot thrive and  they cannot prosper if their citizens are oppressed or are unable to  express themselves freely without fear of being jailed, tortured, or  killed.   Inevitably, if these conditions continue, there will be a street  uprising in Egypt once again, and it could very well be led by radical  elements who seek to overthrow the government and create a space for  terrorism.   Human rights abuses in Egypt take on many forms. An example is the  lack of press freedom. In 2016, Egypt joined other nations in rising to  the top of the rankings as the world's third highest jailer of  journalists. According to the Reporters Without Borders' 2016 World  Press Freedom Index, Egypt currently ranks 159th out of 180 countries  in terms of press freedom. The media, including journalists, bloggers,  and those active on social media, are regularly harassed and arrested.  There are currently 24 journalists who are jailed on trumped-up and  politically motivated charges. Their ``crimes'' have included  publishing false information and inciting terrorism. Censorship has  grown as they continue to interfere in the publication and circulation  of news--although, by the way, a lot of Egyptian news coverage is very  anti-American. These are just a few examples of the ongoing repression  of press freedom in Egypt.   There are also human rights abuses the Egyptian Government continues  to commit with regard to freedom of association and of assembly. In  November of 2016, the Egyptian Parliament passed a draconian law that,  if signed by President Elsisi, would ban nongovernmental organizations  from operating freely in Egypt. The law would essentially eliminate all  independent human rights groups. It would make it nearly impossible for  charities to function by imposing strict regulations and registration  processes. Individuals who violate this law could face jail time simply  for speaking out and fighting to defend human rights. Passing laws like  these has a chilling effect on dissent.   Here is the good news: President Elsisi has not signed it over 4  months later, and I truly hope it is because he is having second  thoughts about it, because he recognizes the terrible impact it will  have on his country's future, on their perception around the world, on  their ability to make progress and reform, and ultimately because he  also recognizes the impact it will have on free nations, like the  United States, which desires to work with Egypt on many issues of  common interest. I strongly encourage President Elsisi to reject that  anti-NGO law.   There is the issue of political prisoners. According to the Project  on Middle East Democracy, since 2013 at least 60,000 political  prisoners have been arrested in Egypt and 1,800 people have received  death sentences in what many  [[Page S2222]]  organizations have described as being politically motivated sentences.   In 2014, President Elsisi issued a decree that expanded the  jurisdiction of military courts over civilians. According to Human  Rights Watch, since the decree was issued, the military courts have  tried over 7,400 Egyptian civilians.   Additionally, individuals who have been victims of enforced  disappearances in Egypt have claimed that they were tortured and  subjected to other forms of abuse when they were taken. There has been  little accountability for this excessive use of force.   Egypt's repression is not limited to its own citizens. There are  currently a number of Americans who are jailed in Egypt. There is one  American in particular whom I would like to raise: the case of  American-Egyptian citizen Aya Hijazi.   Aya was arrested in May of 2014, along with her husband and other  members of her organization, which is called the Belady Foundation,  which works with abandoned and homeless youth and rescues these young  children off the streets. Three years ago, she was arrested and charged  with ridiculous allegations, including sexual abuse and paying the  children to participate in demonstrations against the government. To  date, no evidence has been provided to back these horrible allegations.  Almost 3 years later, this American citizen remains in prison.   Throughout that time, I and others here in the Senate have been  calling for her release, and it is time that the charges against her be  dropped and her husband and the other workers be released immediately  because her case and many others like it are an obstacle to better  relations.   The Egyptian people deserve better than the brutal treatment they are  receiving at the hands of their government. All human beings do. It is  incumbent upon us, the elected representatives of the American people,  to make clear to friends, allies, partners, and foes alike that no  matter what issues we are working with you on, negotiating a resolution  to, or dealing with you on in some other way, we are not going to look  the other way when human rights are being abused. We are going to  encourage you to reform because in the long run, that is in your  interest and ours.   We have seen in recent history the consequences when governments do  not respect their citizens. It creates instability in those countries.  Instability is the breeding ground of terrorists and radical elements  around the world. Ultimately, those terrorists train their sights on  us.   As I told President Elsisi today, Egypt is a nation rich in culture  and history and has made extraordinary contributions to the world. It  has played a leading role in fostering peace with Israel. But it faces  a dangerous future if it does not create the conditions within the  country in which its people can live peacefully and securely without  fear. Otherwise, Egypt remains vulnerable to the kind of instability we  have seen in Syria, Libya, and other countries. That is why it should  matter to the American people.   I am disappointed that this issue of human rights did not come up  publicly when the President met with the President of Egypt. I hope  that will change in the weeks and days and months to come, for it is in  our national interest to further these goals. Otherwise, sadly, we  could very well have yet another and perhaps the most important country  in the region destabilized and ultimately left vulnerable to becoming a  breeding ground for terrorism that ultimately targets our people and  our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume executive session and then resume legislative session following  the remarks of the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Merkley.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume executive session and then resume legislative session following  the remarks of the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Merkley.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, tomorrow morning or tomorrow afternoon at  some point, we will, I believe, vote to confirm Judge Gorsuch to be a  Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court. There is so much that has been said  about him and his qualifications. I have been listening to the speeches  all week. Even headed to the committee hearing, I think so much had  been said about him. This is a mainstream candidate. This is a  mainstream judge. He is someone who voted with the majority 99 percent  of the time during his time on the bench. He is someone who 97 percent  of the time, in 2,700 cases, was a part of rulings that were unanimous.  He most certainly, I believe, is someone who believes the Constitution  should be interpreted according to its original intent of the writers,  but he is certainly not someone outside the mainstream of American  legal thinking, and he is certainly eminently qualified. It is  interesting in that you see a broad array of individuals come forward  and talk about his qualifications.   I also thought it was interesting that there really was no coherent  reason for  [[Page S2410]]  opposing him. There are a lot of different opinions on the floor that  claim he would not commit to certain decisions that people would like  to see him make on the Court. That would be true of virtually everyone  who has been nominated to the Court over the last quarter century.   There is no doubt that he is someone who has certain beliefs and  views about the Constitution that are reflective of the President's  party, but that is what elections are about. Obviously, the great  people whom President Obama appointed reflected his thinking. That is  our system.   A lot of the attention, though, in this debate has been about the  process that brought us here. There has been tremendous consternation  about the change that no longer would there be a requirement of 60  votes in order to end debate. I think a lot of people have a  fundamental misunderstanding of what has happened and how we have  gotten here, and I thought it was important for the people of Florida  and others who may be interested to know how I approached it, because  it was something that I am not excited about or gleeful about or happy  about. I would say that is probably the sentiment of most of the people  here in the Senate. Yet it happened anyway.   I saw a cartoon by one of these editorial cartoonists; I am not quite  sure who it was. It had this picture of both sides basically saying:  This is terrible, but we are going to do it anyway.   I think it is important to understand, first and foremost, about the  Senate. It is unique. There is no other legislative body like it in the  world. Unlike most legislative institutions, it does not function by  majority rule. It actually requires a supermajority to move forward.  That was by design; it was not an accident.   The people--the Founders, the Framers--created a system of government  in which they wanted one branch of the legislature to be very vibrant,  active, representative of the people. They represent districts, and  they have 2-year terms. Then they created another Chamber which was  different in nature. At the time, the U.S. Senate was designed, first  of all, to represent the States. Where the House was the people's  House, the Senate was the place the States were represented.   The other thing they wanted to design was a place that was at some  level possibly immune from the passions of the moment. They wanted a  place where things would slow down for a moment, where we would take a  deep breath and make sure we were doing the right thing. It was a wise  course.   Our Republic is not perfect, but it has survived for over two  centuries. In the process, it has given us the most dynamic, most  vibrant, and, I believe, the most exceptional Nation in all of human  history. While not perfect, the Senate has been a big part of that  endeavor.    By the way, at the time, Senators were elected by the legislature;  they were not even elected by people. Of course, that changed. I am not  saying we should go back, but that is the way it was.   That Senate was also unique because it had this tradition of  unlimited debate. When a Senator got up to speak, they got to debate as  long as they wanted, and no one could stop them. Then, at some point,  that began to get a little bit abused, so they created a rule that  required a supermajority, and that supermajority was further watered  down. Then we arrive here, over the last 4 years, to see what has  happened.   Basically, what happens now is that there are two ways to stop  debate, which is as a result of a procedure that was undertaken on the  floor first by Senator Reid when he was the majority leader and now by  the majority leader today on what is called the Executive Calendar,  where there are nominations for the Cabinet, Ambassadors, the sub- Cabinet, courts, and now the Supreme Court. No. 1 is by unanimous  consent, when everybody agrees to it, or, No. 2, through 51 votes, a  majority vote.   I think that is problematic in the long term, not because of Judge  Neil Gorsuch, for I believe that in any other era and at any other  time, he would not have just gotten 60 votes or even unanimous consent  to stop debate; I think he would have gotten 60-plus votes, maybe 70  votes, to be on the Court. I think it is problematic because we do not  know who is going to be the President in 15 years or what will be the  state of our country. Yet, by a simple majority, without talking to a  single person or getting a single vote from the other party or the  other point of view, they are going to be able to nominate and confirm  and place someone on the bench of the Supreme Court--to a lifetime  appointment to a coequal branch of government--without even consulting  with the other side. I think, long term, that is problematic--in the  case of Neil Gorsuch, not so much, but for the future of our country, I  think it could be problematic.   The argument has been made that this has never been used before, so  all of the stuff brings us back to where we once were. I think  technically that is accurate, but this is not exactly where we once  were. Where we once were was that there were people who worked here who  understood they had the power to do this. They got it. They understood  that if they had wanted to, they could have forced the 60 votes. They  understood they had the power to do it, but they chose not to exercise  it. They chose to be judicious because they understood that with the  power, there comes not just the power to act but sometimes the power  not to act, to be responsible, to reserve certain powers for  extraordinary moments when it truly is required. And over the years, it  has been abused.   This is not going to be a speech where I stand up here and say that  this is all on the Democrats, although I most certainly have had  quarrels over some of the decisions that have been made by the other  side of the aisle. I think it is a moment to be honest and say that we  all have brought us here to this point, both sides, and it has required  us to do this.   The reason I was ultimately able to vote for the change today is that  I am convinced that no matter who would have won the Presidential  election and no matter which party would have controlled this Chamber,  that vote was going to happen. Both sides were going to do this because  we have reached a point in our politics in America where what used to  be done is no longer possible, and that has ultimately found its way  onto the floor of the U.S. Senate.   Rules are rules, and ultimately the Republic will survive the change  we have seen here today. I think the more troubling aspects are the  things that have brought us to this point.   A couple of days ago, while at a lunch with my colleagues, I said  that one of the things, I think, we are going to have to accept is  that, quite frankly, the men and women who served in this Chamber  before us--20, 30 years ago--were just better than we are. They were  human beings who, quite frankly, had deeply held beliefs. I do not know  of any Member of this Chamber who was more conservative than Barry  Goldwater or Jesse Helms. I do not know any Member of this Chamber who  was more progressive or liberal than Hubert Humphrey or Ted Kennedy or  others. Yet somehow, despite their deeply held principles, these  individuals were able to work together to prevent what happened here  today.   The fact is, for both sides, that is not possible anymore. Today, our  politics require us to use every measure possible, even if it is for  symbolic purposes. That is just the way it is. That is more of a  reflection of our political process than it is of the Senate.   I have seen these articles that have been written of ``the end of the  Senate'' or ``the death of the Senate.'' It is a little bit of an  exaggeration, but I think it is actually just reflective of the fact  that this is the way politics has become, that as a nation today, we  are less than ever capable of conducting a serious debate about major  issues in the way we once were able to do. I think everyone is to  blame.   I think the way politics is covered is to blame. Today, most articles  on the issues before us are not about the issues before us; they are  about the politics of the issues before us. Today, most of the work  that is done in this Chamber and in the other Chamber has more to do  with the messaging behind it than it does with the end result of where  it will lead us. That is just the honest fact.   Before people start writing or blogging: Well, look at all of these  other times when the Senator from Florida--when I did some of these  things--I admit it. I do not think there  [[Page S2411]]  is a single person here with clean hands on any of this. I admit that I  have been involved in efforts that, looking back on some of these  things, perhaps, if we knew then what we know now, we would have done  differently. I think it is important in life to recognize and learn  from those experiences and to adapt them to the moment before us.    I think, moving forward, the biggest challenge we will face in the  country is that our issues are not going to solve themselves. They will  require people from very different States, very different backgrounds,  and very different points of view to be able to come together and solve  some pretty big deals. It is ultimately not about silencing people or  having them compromise their principles but about acknowledging that in  our system of government, we have no choice but to do so. We have no  choice.   I think it also requires us to take a step back and understand that  the people who have a different point of view than ours actually  believe what they are saying. They hold it deep, and they represent  people who believe what they are saying. I say this as someone who will  admit that, in my time of public service, perhaps I have not always  applied that as much as I wish I had. I try to. You certainly live and  learn when you get to travel the country and meet as many people as I  did over the last couple of years. I certainly think that impacts us  profoundly.   I have a deeply held belief in limited government and free enterprise  and a strong national defense and the core principles that define  someone as a conservative. But I have also grown to appreciate and  understand the people who share a different point of view--perhaps not  as much as I hope to one day be able to understand and respect it, but  certainly more than I once did, simply because the more people you  meet, the more you learn about them, and the more you learn and  understand where they are coming from.   Are we capable as a society to once again return to a moment where  people who have different ideas can somehow try to figure out how to  make things better, even if the solutions are not perfect? I hope so,  because the fate of the most important country in human history is at  stake. Are we capable of once again having debates, not that aren't  vibrant and not that from time to time people may say things or even do  things that they may regret, but certainly ones that at the end of the  day are constructed for the purpose of solving a problem, not winning  an election. I hope so, because if we don't, we will have to explain to  our children why we inherited the greatest country in human history and  they inherited one that is in decline.   I don't mean to exaggerate, because ultimately this is a rule change.  We don't vote on the Supreme Court every day, every week, every month.  Sometimes we don't vote on it for long periods of time. But I think it  exposes a more fundamental challenge that we face today in American  politics, and that we better confront sooner rather than later, and  that we should all confront with the understanding and the knowledge  that none of us come to it with clean hands.   We were reminded again this week by the images that emerged from  Syria of what a dangerous world we live in, and we are reminded that  the threats remain.   I ask people tonight--no matter who you write for, who you blog for,  what political party you are a member of, or whom you vote for in  November--to ask yourself a question and to be honest about the answer.  If, God forbid--and I mean this, God forbid--there were another 9/11- style attack on the United States, how would we honestly react? Because  September 11 was a scary day, and on that day I remember there weren't  Democrats or Republicans. Everyone was equally frightened and everyone  was equally angered. There was a sense of unity and purpose that we had  not seen in a long time and have not seen since.   I honestly believe, sadly, that if today there were another 9/11- style attack on America, one of the first things we would see people  doing is blaming each other, saying whose fault it was. You will have  some people saying: Well, this terrorist attack happened because  President Obama didn't do enough to defeat the terrorists. And others  would say: It happened because the Republicans and the new President,  President Trump, has not done enough, or has done things to provoke  them. I honestly believe that. I think that is what the debate would  look like. I hope I am wrong.   Just think about how far we have come in almost 20 years, 15 years.  That is the kind of debate I believe we would have. Think about how  destructive that is.   I also think we would see a plethora of crazy, fake stories about  what was behind it. And here is the craziest part: Some very smart and  educated people would believe those stories because we have reached the  point now where conspiracies are more interesting than facts.   I know that people may see this and say: Oh, I think you are  exaggerating. Maybe, I hope so. But I honestly think that we are headed  in a direction that is actually making us--not us the Senate, but us,  Americans--incapable of confronting problems.   I will just say this. What I really hope will happen soon is that we  are going to get tired of fighting with other Americans all the time,  that we will finally get fatigued with all of this constant fighting  against other Americans. Americans are not your enemies. Quite frankly,  I hope we have no enemies anywhere in the world, other than vicious  leaders, and we hope to be a part of seeing taken them out of power at  some point for the horrible things they do. I hope we will reach a  point where people are saying, I am just tired of constantly fighting  with other Americans. We will have differences and we will debate them.  Thank God that we have been given a republic where we have elections  every 2 years and where we can have these debates. But, in the interim,  whether we like it or not, none of us is going anywhere.   The vast and overwhelming of majority of Americans will live in this  country for the rest of their lives. This is their home and this is  their country. We are going to have to figure out how to share and work  together in this unique piece of land that we have been blessed with  the opportunity to call home. If we don't figure out a way to do that  soon enough, then many of these issues that confront America will go  unsolved, and not only will our people pay a price and our children pay  a price, but the world will pay a price.   So I know that is a lot to say about a topic as simple as a rule  change and ultimately a vote for the Supreme Court, but I really think  it exposed something deeper about American politics that we had better  confront sooner rather than later, or we will all live to regret what  it leads to, and that is the decline of the single greatest Nation in  all of human history.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.   Congratulating the University of South Carolina Women's Basketball Team              on Winning the National Basketball Championship     Mr. President, I have a question for the Senator from  South Carolina. It is very important.   Is the Senator aware that Frank Martin, an incredible coach for the  men's basketball team is from Miami, FL?    I just wanted you to know.    I just wanted you to know.    I will.    I will.    I will.    Florida.    Florida.    Florida.    South Florida.    South Florida.    I have. Coach Martin is a good friend, and I think a  testament to how much Florida has to contribute to South Carolina.    I would say to the Senator from South Carolina, South  Carolina has gotten better results for Frank Martin than it did for me.  But we are very proud of Coach Martin. I would just add that, given the  litany of athletic success this year by the State of South Carolina, I  find that to be highly suspicious. I know I just spoke about conspiracy  theories, but statistically, it is very unlikely that a State would  have that many championships. I am not calling for a congressional  inquiry, but I think it is an interesting topic of conversation.    That is highly unlikely. But in all seriousness----    That is highly unlikely. But in all seriousness----    I do want to restate that Frank Martin is really an  extraordinary person. Much more, Senator Scott and I both had a chance  to interact with him on a number of occasions. I don't mean to single  them out among all of the other suspicious athletic accomplishments in  South Carolina that are certainly worth noting, but I would say, with  Frank, one of the things that really impresses me is not what he does  with these young men on the court but the kind of influence he is in  their lives off the court and the impact he has.   He was a high school coach in Miami and won State championships  there. He comes from a hard-working family of Cuban exiles who made  their home in South Florida. So we are very, very proud of what he has  achieved. But what I am most proud of is the way Coach Martin has been  able to influence those young men.   He did defeat the Florida Gators to make it to the final four, and I  was not happy about that. But I would say this--and I have said it to  others--if the Florida Gators had to lose, I would want it to be to  Frank Martin because of the extraordinary work he does. So I can't wait  to see which Florida university hires him away.   Thank you.    I was going to say, I am not going to invoke that rule.    I think it is a good opportunity to say nothing--but  congratulations, and we will be back.
