 The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Tillis).    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would just  say that the fact that the Senator from Oregon is down here right now  instead of the Democratic leader I would characterize as movement in  the right direction. And the fact that he is making a proposal that is  based upon legislation that, as he mentioned, he has introduced that  actually has a trigger, if you will, or a way of phasing down  unemployment benefits, I think, is a step in the right direction  because, up until now, every time that the Senator from Arizona has  come down here to offer up a 1-week extension of unemployment  benefits--and, by the way, I think it is very reasonable and, to the  Senator from Oregon's point, I find it hard to believe that any State  and any computer system which is already paying out the $600 bonus  wouldn't be able to continue that. It strikes me as just really  unexplainable that you would have problems adjusting a computer system  that is already programmed to pay $600 to continue to do that for an  additional week. That defies logic to me.   So I think that is a very reasonable request. It would allow us  additional time to work on proposals like what the Senator from Oregon  has suggested. And there are others out there. The Senator from Utah,  Senator Romney, has a proposal that would ramp down the unemployment  benefits over time. It seems to me, at least, we might be able to find  some common ground there between what the Senator from Oregon has  proposed and what the Senator from Utah or other Members on our side  have proposed.   I do believe that what the Senator from Oregon is suggesting--that  is, to lock in the $600 bonus indefinitely--one, puts it on autopilot;  two, sort of takes Congress out of the equation; and, three, it  continues to offer a benefit that, for five out of the six people who  are receiving unemployment benefits, offers them more in terms of a  benefit than what they were making when they were working.   That, to me, is something that I think needs to be addressed. And if  you talk to any small business across this country right now, they will  tell you one of the big challenges they have is trying to find workers  and to compete with an unemployment payment that actually pays them  more than when they were working. Trying to get those employees back, I  think, has been a real challenge for a lot of the employers across the  country.   So I think that is an issue that has to be addressed, and I have  heard people on this side of the aisle, both House and Senate, say the  same thing. There have been Democratic Governors who say the same  thing, that the $600 benefit needs to be modified in a way that more  reflects what people were actually making when they were working.   So I think there is some common ground that we can find, but, again,  the idea that has been advanced by the other side prior to the Senator  from Oregon coming down here, which has been put forward by the  Democratic leader, is that the Heroes Act should be taken up and passed  by unanimous consent. That has been the unanimous consent request now  on multiple occasions when Senator McSally or others have come down  here to try and get action on this unemployment issue, which is to come  over and offer unanimous consent to pick up and pass the Heroes Act,  which, as we all know, is not a serious piece of legislation.   In fact, the Democratic leader's paper of record in New York, the New  York Times, said: ``The bill was more a messaging document than a  viable piece of legislation.'' That comes from the New York Times. Many  of the proposals in that legislation had nothing to do with the  coronavirus and, in fact, addressed a lot of other what I would call  extraneous items on the policy agenda of the Democratic majority in the  House of Representatives, to include mentioning ``cannabis'' more times  than it mentioned the word ``jobs'' in that legislation.   There are studies authorized in the Heroes Act that look at  diversity--diversity--in the cannabis industry--more mentions of that  than mention of the word ``jobs,'' which I think right there tells you  that it wasn't a serious piece of legislation.   It, furthermore, included--if you can imagine this--tax cuts, tax  cuts for Manhattan millionaires. Tax cuts for Manhattan millionaires is  included in the Heroes Act--again, not something that has anything to  do with helping the people who are hurting as a result of the pandemic  or get at the point that the Senator from Oregon is talking about; that  is, addressing the unemployment issue.   So I view this as progress. I view this as movement in the right  direction, the fact that the Senator, not the Democratic leader, is  down here offering an unemployment proposal, not the Heroes Act. I hope  we can build on that and find that common ground that would enable us  to address clearly what are serious needs among lots of Americans who  are, through no fault of their own, unemployed as a result of this  pandemic.   Having said that, I will object to the request of the Senator from  Oregon right now but suggest to him that he and Democrats other than  the leader--and I think there are a number of Democrats on this side of  the aisle, including those who lead committees like the Senator from  Oregon, who is the ranking member on the Finance Committee, a committee  on which I serve and with whom I have worked on a lot of issues--can  sit down and find common ground.   But as long as rank-and-file members and leaders of relevant  committees are sort of locked out and the leaders continue to try and  do this behind closed doors, it is going to be very hard, I think, to  find those types of practical, real-world, commonsense solutions.   I object.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and pay tribute  to Mr. Eugene F. Coyle, a patriot who served in the U.S. Army during  the Korean war.   At the age of 23, Sergeant Eugene F. Coyle enlisted in the U.S. Army,  just 3 months after the war started in Korea. As a rifleman and  machinegunner assigned to the 24st Infantry Division, 21st Regiment,  2nd Battalion, F Company, Eugene was quickly put into the fight,  experiencing a number of combat engagements with the enemy.   One such engagement occurred in April 1951 near the Hwacheon  Reservoir, South Korea, where Eugene exhibited composure under fire. As  squad leader, Eugene led an advance against the enemy until his  position was hit by mortar fire. Despite sustaining injuries from the  shelling, he continued to provide covering fire for his unit.   During another combat engagement in early July 1951, in the vicinity  of Sabanggo-ri, North Korea, an enemy mortar round threw Eugene from  his fighting position. Eugene, though injured by shrapnel, would not  leave the fight. He regained his footing and ran to aid a severely  injured soldier, getting him to cover. Eugene was later sent to the  hospital ship USS Repose for his own injuries.   Eugene, deserving of commendation for his courage under fire, as well  as for his wounds resulting from close engagement with enemy forces,  would unfortunately wait decades before the Nation properly recognized  him for his service and sacrifice, even as he carried a piece of  shrapnel embedded within his body for over 60 years.   On November 15, 2017, Eugene F. Coyle was awarded the Purple Heart in  addition to the United Nations Service Medal, the National Defense  Service Medal, the Korean War Service Medal, and the Combat Infantry  Badge. Like many veterans of his generation have experienced, poor or  lost records have made it difficult to meet stringent administrative  requirements for certain military awards. This challenge does not  diminish their courage, nor our gratitude, for their actions in defense  of freedom.   The gallantry of Eugene F. Coyle reminds us what we owe heroes like  him for the sacrifices, often unrecognized and unrequited, that they  have made. I am honored to pay tribute to Eugene F. Coyle and thank him  for his exemplary service to our county.                            ____________________
