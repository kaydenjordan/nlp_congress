 Mr. Speaker, we have the solemn duty to find the facts,  to be stewards of the truth. It is the truth that must guide our work.  When the truth is contorted, twisted, and disregarded, the American  people lose. The fabric of the institution starts to erode.   Sadly, that is exactly what is happening with the House Intelligence  Committee under Democratic leadership. It should not have to come to  this.   On numerous occasions, as outlined in this resolution, the chairman  of the House Intelligence Committee has used his position to mislead  the American people.   But this resolution is about more than the actions of one individual.  When false evidence is entered into the official record or communicated  directly to the American people, the people's House loses the  credibility it needs to function properly.   If the credibility is not restored, if the American people cannot  trust that the process will be fair and that the information will be  honestly shared, they will lose trust in the soundness of our system of  government.   This is what this resolution is all about, and I want to thank  Congressman Biggs for introducing it: to protect the integrity of our  proceedings, which censure is designed to do; to restore a process that  is fair, objective, and fact-based; and to reassure the American people  that the stakes and intensity of our current debate will not overwhelm  their government.   We face a critical moment in the life of Congress in the history of  this country. History will judge what happens on this floor.   Mr. Speaker, it should not have to come to this, but it has. This is  not a decision we take lightly, but it is the right thing to do.   We serve on this floor as Americans, not as in a party. We have to  stand for truth. We have to stand for a committee that many of us don't  even have the capability or the opportunity to read what happens. We  put a trust into those individuals to be honest with us and to the  American public.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  support of this resolution: to bring integrity back to this floor and  to this body.                            ____________________
