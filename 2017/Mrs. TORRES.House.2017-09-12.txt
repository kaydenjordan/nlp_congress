 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my amendment to this  appropriations bill.   Mr. Chairman, since I have been in Congress, I have been working with  manufacturers in my congressional district to ensure that we are doing  all we can in Congress to support them in creating good-paying, high- skilled jobs right here at home.   Last month, I took a ``Made in the 35th'' tour and traveled across my  district, meeting with manufacturers who are creating jobs here in the  U.S. They told me about how they are competing with importers from Asia  and an unfair playing field created by how our trading partners support  their manufacturers.   I continued my tour to the Port of Los Angeles, where it became  clearer where this unfair playing field has left us. Ships from Asia  come in full and leave empty.   Mr. Chairman, the ships that leave Los Angeles should be full of  American-made goods. This is the goal of the Manufacturing Extension  Partnership, or MEP: supporting American businesses through expanding  markets and supporting innovation.   Two of the nine MEP success stories in California have happened in my  congressional district. Insulfoam in Chino used the MEP to increase  production by 20 percent, while reducing their energy costs by more  than 5 percent.  [[Page H7257]]    Diamond Wipes, a very impressive company that I visited on my Made in  the 35th tour, used the MEP to expand their wet wipes business to  markets around the world.   A small investment in MEP meant real wins and expansions for these  real American businesses.                                time  1430    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is common sense. For every dollar of MEP  investment, we can generate nearly $20 million in new sales growth and  $20 in new client investment. That is a $100 million return on my  amendment.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment because that  investment could end up in one of our communities.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the congresswoman from Connecticut  (Ms. Esty).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano), the ranking member of the  subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Chairman, this is a $5 million investment for manufacturers in  the U.S., and I strongly ask for the support of my colleagues in  passing this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
