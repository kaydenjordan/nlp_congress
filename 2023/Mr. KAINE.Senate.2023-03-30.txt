 Mr. President, I take the floor because of a letter that I  received in my office a few days ago. This was a letter that was mailed  to our office via email on March 23, and I just want to read it.         Hello Senator. My name is--    I am going to omit the name.         My name is . . . and I am terrified to go to school. I have       lived in your district for almost six years, and never have I       been more scared than I am when I go to school every day. My       father was in the army, my mother works with wear blue run to       remember (a military non-profit for gold star families). I am       no stranger to death, and yet I am scared that one day that       may be waiting for me at school. I lived in Lakewood       Washington, I went to Saint Francis Cabrini, and we once had       a lockdown because a car ran down our fence while children       were at recess. I was present during the shooting at Fort       Hood in 2013, my sister can't remember, but she was so close       to the perpetrator. I still have nightmares from both of       these incidents. I am supposed to be safe at school, but       today when it was rumored that someone was planning to target       our school out of revenge on an ex-partner, I was reminded of       that day I spent huddled under a desk in art class,       [feverishly] reciting the Hail Mary. Something needs to       change, I'm not the only kid who feels this way. Why should I       be scared to go to school?    This letter came to my office on March 23. A few days later, this  student and all of America woke up to the story of the shooting in  Nashville.         Why should I be scared to go to school?    In January of this year, just a few months ago, there was an incident  that also attracted significant attention in Virginia and around the  country where a first grade teacher, Abby Zwerner, at the Richneck  Elementary School in Newport News, VA, saw a 6-year-old pointing a gun  at her, and she acted heroically to come toward the student to try to  take the gun. And she was shot and badly, badly wounded, but she was  able to protect the lives of her students and others in the school  building. She is recovering slowly from that and just starting to talk  about that experience.   Mr. President, I went to Newport News about a month after that  incident, in early February, to meet with a number of the parents and  teachers. And they wanted it off the record, no press--just let's sit  down and talk. And I am going to respect their privacy by not talking  about their names, the names of their kids, or particulars of their  story. But I can summarize it.   These parents are afraid when they drop their kids off at school, and  they are afraid that, when they come at the end of the day, something  might have happened to their children. They are afraid that they may  get a call in the middle of the day that something has happened to  their kids.   And the teachers who were with me that day, they have that same fear.  They go into these classrooms every day because they love children, but  they are afraid now to do that job. Lord knows, we have got teacher  shortages all over this country, and we are working our best to try to  attract people to the profession. But these teachers, many of whom have  been in the profession for decades, they are now afraid, for the first  time in their lives, to go to school every day.   Emergency room visits for gun-related injuries in Virginia increased  by 72 percent from 2018 through 2021. In an average year, about 1,020  people die in Virginia and another 2,050 or so are wounded by guns. And  among young people, guns are the leading cause of death among children  and teens in Virginia. An average of 85 children and teens die by guns  every year. Fifty-five percent of these deaths are homicides. Others  are accidental shootings or deaths by suicide.   I don't know what to do with this. I don't know what to do with this.  I react negatively when, in the aftermath of shootings, it sometimes  seems like all Members of Congress can say is that they are heartbroken  and they send thoughts and prayers to the family. That starts to sound  very hollow. Of course, thoughts and prayers are meaningful, but it  starts to sound very hollow to those who are victimized by gun violence  when that is the response and nothing more.    But let me be self-critical. I am not into offering hollow thoughts  and prayers. I tend to say I am heartbroken for the families and I  think we need to do things in the Senate, like do an assault weapons  ban or other meaningful legislation that would keep kids safe.   Some of the things we ought to do in Congress are things we have done  in Virginia in recent years, and that has made our State safer, but  there is nothing you can do that is going to completely eliminate this  problem.   But I was challenging my staff the other day. If we think thoughts  and prayers and nothing else is hollow, then saying we should do an  assault weapons ban when we know that is not going to get 60 votes on  the floor of the Senate--I do think we should do an assault weapons  ban. When we had one in the nineties, it worked. But I also know with  certainty that, in the near future, there is zero chance that this body  is going to get the 60 votes for an assault weapons ban or other kinds  of gun safety regulations that would take a student and make her less  afraid to go to school or a parent and teacher and reduce their fear.   So what I am challenging people around me, including my own staff and  challenging myself on is: Have we allowed this tough issue--the debate  about this tough issue--to get a little stale?   Thoughts and prayers, assault weapons ban--thoughts and prayers don't  do anything to help people. An assault weapons ban might, but we are  not going to pass it.   Have we allowed it to get stale, and are there solutions and  strategies that we are not talking about that we might be able to find  common ground on?   Because, if anything should cry out to us and demand that we find  common ground, it is that we not do nothing; that we not listen to the  fears of students and parents and teachers and just say: Well, that is  just the way life is in America, right? That is just American life.   We can't be complacent about it. And, Mr. President, I am just  thinking about our differences in age. My children are out of high  school now. My youngest is 10 years out of high school. You still have  school-aged kids. So you are still grappling with the reality of safety  in schools at the pickup and the dropoff.   This has gotten so much worse just in the last 10 years. My children  all went to the Richmond public schools, which are an urban public  school setting in a community that had some significant problems with  violent crime. But my wife and I were never nervous when we took them  to school, and we never worried about getting a text or something in  the middle of the day; and we never were afraid that, when we got there  at the end of the day, something would happen. And that was just a  little bit over 10 years ago.   My children finished high school right before--my youngest--right  before the Sandy Hook shooting. So they were not in the K-12 system in  Virginia when there has just been this steady drumbeat of one school  shooting after the next. They weren't terrorized or afraid. Their  teachers weren't. My wife and I weren't. And that was just 10 years  ago.   How much more devastating the problem of school shootings has become  in the last 10 years.  [[Page S1078]]    So I just take the floor to say: I need to write something back to  this youngster. Her question:         Why should I be scared to go to school?    I have got to write her and respond in some way, and I don't really  know now what to say. But I have challenged my team and I challenge my  colleagues. We are in a recess period where we are back in our States.  We are talking to people. We are, hopefully, getting ideas from them  and listening to them. Let's ask some young people who go to school,  let's ask some teachers, let's ask some parents of schoolkids if they  have ideas for us that are new or different. Let's ask them whether our  political debate about solutions has grown stale and whether there are  solutions that we haven't yet contemplated that could respond to the  question that this student has raised.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I have six requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.
