 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  my longtime friend and community leader, James Allan Guthrie of  Pasadena, Texas, who passed away on December 18, 2021, at the age of  70.   James was born in Houston, Texas, on April 27, 1951, to James and  Loretta Guthrie. A devoted member of the Zion Lutheran Church in  Pasadena, James was baptized on June 5, 1960, and confirmed on June 6,  1965. He attended Zion Lutheran School in Pasadena, graduated from  Lutheran High School in Houston, and went on to study at San Jacinto  College. At age 18, James became a real estate broker and he worked  alongside his father in that industry for 30 years.   On May 6, 1977, James married the love of his life, Ms. Pamela Ann  Rothermel. Last May marked their 44th year of marriage. James and Pam  were blessed with a daughter, Moriah Ashlee Guthrie, on October 18,  1984.                                time  1045    James, Pam, and Moriah never missed an opportunity to serve their  community. They could often be seen side-by-side at many church,  community, and civic functions. James' passion for helping people and  supporting his community remained throughout his entire adult life. He  served on the following organizations:   Councilman, city of Pasadena, Texas; vice chairman, city of  Pasadena's Texas Planning Commission; chairman, Pasadena Chamber of  Commerce; board member, San Jacinto College Foundation; board member,  Pasadena Independent School District Education Foundation Board;  member, Bridge Over Troubled Waters; founding board member, Habitat for  Humanity Pasadena; chairman, Pasadena Philharmonic Orchestra; founding  board member of the Pasadena Kiwanis Club; board member, Preston Trails  Homeowners Association; chairman, Pasadena Salvation Army Advisory  Council; chairman, Innovative Alternatives; board member, Pasadena  Rotary Club; board member, Pasadena Community Pregnancy Center; board  member, Armand Bayou Watershed Partnership; and board member, Advisory  Council of the Methodist Retirement Community--The Crossings. Few have  done more than Mr. Guthrie.   Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to recognize my wonderful friend,  James Guthrie, today on the House floor. He was a one-of-a-kind leader  in the 36th Congressional District that I have been privileged to  represent, who left behind a legacy that will long be remembered.   His loyalty and his friendship will be deeply missed by myself and  countless others in our community. My heartfelt prayers remain with his  family and friends during this difficult time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Moore).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Cammack).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I stand in strong opposition to what should be called the concedes  act. Once again, we are voting on a bill that was forced through this  Chamber in a partisan fashion, and one that lacks the policies needed  to bolster our competitiveness and combat the threats from our foreign  adversaries.   The hard work and the bipartisan collaboration of the Space, Science,  and Technology Committee has, once again, been obliterated so that the  left can pass partisan policies.   Once again, in a sincere and goodwill attempt to work across the  aisle on important policy, I introduced an amendment that would have  reauthorized NASA's enhanced-use leasing program for 1 year, a timeline  supported by both parties. But to no surprise, the Democrats put  messaging over good governance and refused to make that  noncontroversial amendment in order.   And just a few weeks ago, we had a bipartisan EUL bill that had  already passed this House. It was stolen from us, gutted, and turned  into a Federal election takeover bill.   Instead of focusing on commonsense solutions to our China problems,  H.R. 4521 hurts the American people. It lets China off the hook for  failing to contain COVID-19. It fails to ban funding to CCP-tied  organizations. It fails to punish the CCP for its blatant human rights  abuses, and it fails to stop China's theft of America's intellectual  property.   Today, we had another opportunity to pass important legislation to  support American technology and to hold foreign adversaries  accountable. Instead, we are, once again, wasting the American people's  time, and I urge every single one of my colleagues to vote ``no''.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I take great offense at what I just heard,  that we are supposedly Asian bashing. Nothing could be further from the  truth. This is typical Democrat accusations, politics, and identity  politics; I should say this. We have never bashed anybody for their  heritage whatsoever. Our argument is totally 100 percent countering the  Chinese Communist Party. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the  heritage of any people whatsoever.   Our greatest adversary in the world today is the Chinese Communist  Party. If we can't push back on the Communist Chinese without being  accused of racial accusations and racism, which is so typical of this  other side, I feel like this country is not being well served at all.   Madam Speaker, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   During the past 2 hours of debate, you have heard my colleagues  mention dozens and dozens of flaws in this bill, and they haven't even  covered all of them.   There is an excessive transfer of taxpayer dollars to international  climate slush funds, with no guardrails preventing that money from  going to China, our greatest adversary today.                                time  1715    There is a dramatic expansion of the Treasury's authority, giving  them unchecked power to block Americans' digital currency payments  worldwide. There is the permanent extension of the healthcare tax  credit for trade adjustment assistance beneficiaries with no  justification. There are Solyndra-style loan guarantees.   It seems like this bill has everything in it except for the one thing  that it desperately needs: a focus on countering the growing danger we  face from the Chinese Communist Party.   There is no question in my mind that the Chinese Communist Party is  the greatest threat that we face as a nation today. I was proud to work  on bipartisan House Science, Space, and Technology Committee  legislation to make America more competitive and more secure. I had  high hopes that we could take our proposals, which passed the House  with broad bipartisan support, and conference them with the Senate to  create a strong, strategic approach for America's continued  technological growth and global competitiveness.   Unfortunately, the Speaker had other priorities. Instead of moving  forward on a true China bill, she created a massive Christmas tree with  unrelated liberal priorities hung from every branch like ornaments.   We cannot afford this partisan gamesmanship. The threat is too real  for the American people and our national security.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, this bloc of amendments includes nearly  every single Democrat amendment that was made in order by the Rules  Committee. I can't pretend to know why these particular amendments were  made in order because that decision was made behind closed doors rather  than in a bipartisan manner.   I will say that the sheer number of amendments being considered en  bloc shows that even Members of the Speaker's own party didn't have the  chance to contribute to the underlying bill until now.   I will also say that, unfortunately, most of these provisions take a  bad bill and simply make it worse. These amendments add studies on  declining salmon populations, direct USDA to research fake meat, and  establish an entirely new institute to focus on zero-emission  locomotives.   Whether or not any of these are worthy policies, I think we can all  agree that they do not belong in a legislative package meant to address  the threat of the Chinese Communist Party and to make America more  competitive globally.   America's economic success for generations has been driven by our  investment in transformational basic research. The Chinese Communist  Party wants to copy that success and take over as the global leader in  science and technology. They are investing more money in R&D than we  are and graduating many more STEM professionals than we are as well.   They have a laser focus on surpassing the United States and reaping  the economic and national defense benefits that come with technological  superiority.   They aren't wasting time on fake meat and trains, and we should not  be either.   I urge my colleagues to oppose these amendments, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This bloc of amendments we are now considering includes 51 bipartisan  provisions that were handpicked by the Rules Committee and Democrat  leadership out of more than 600 amendments that Members submitted for  consideration.   I appreciate these Members taking a page out of the Science, Space,  and Technology Committee's playbook and working across the aisle to try  to move these provisions forward.                                time  1730    If the entire bill had been done in this way, we would certainly have  a more focused and effective legislation that could have garnered  bipartisan support.   This block of amendments includes several provisions that have gone  through the proper channels of being marked up and reported out of the  committee.   Unfortunately, it also includes provisions that have not gone through  regular order. Members weren't given the opportunity to review,  improve, and vote on these policies in committee. Having a Democrat and  Republican cosponsor an amendment does not mean they are fully vetted  or bipartisan either.   But by tossing together a massive partisan package, the Speaker has  made it clear that she does not value regular order. And by ignoring  regular order, she has limited Member input. So Members feel the need  to take advantage of any opportunity to move their priorities, even if  they have nothing to do with increasing our competitiveness with China.   Much like the expansive jurisdictional reach of this legislation,  this block of amendments is simply a smorgasbord of policies, and they  would best be considered individually rather than en bloc.   I will leave it to the amendment sponsors to explain why Members  should support this en bloc.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this block of amendments includes nearly every single  Republican amendment that was made in order by the Committee on Rules.   Out of more than 600 amendments submitted to the Committee on Rules,  only 37 Republican amendments were made in order. There is no rhyme or  reason to which amendments were accepted and which were rejected. I  want to be very, very clear, that I do not support the underlying  legislation here. But that said, the amendments being considered in  this block were the only chance that most Republican Members have had  to have any impact at all on this massive, nearly 3,000-page bill.   Because so few committees held markup or bipartisan discussions in  their provisions in this bill, there have been very few opportunities  to review or revise this legislation. Among this block of amendments  were safeguards, improvements, and cost-saving measures.   My colleagues, Representatives Garcia and Burgess, offered an  amendment that would prohibit the massive climate change provisions in  this bill from taking effect until the Secretary of Energy can certify  that they will not reduce our energy independence.   Representative Grothman's amendment that would strike the $8 billion  in taxpayer funds from being given to a U.N. climate fund--a slush  fund, if you will--the same fund that has given the Chinese Communist  Party already $100 million. And Representative Bice's amendment would  demand accountability from the administration before allocating any  funding to this fund.   Representatives Gimenez and Burgess would require the Secretary of  Energy to ensure that no provisions in  [[Page H899]]  this bill will raise energy costs for Americans.   Madam Speaker, unfortunately, these amendments improve on the  underlying legislation but cannot ultimately fix this legislation. So  while I urge my colleagues to vote for these amendments, I remain  opposed to this sprawling partisan bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, we have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, my Democrat colleagues have made it  absolutely crystal clear that they have no intention of holding  Communist China accountable, for anything. Whether it is stealing our  intellectual property, flooding our colleges with Communist propaganda,  committing academic espionage, or unleashing COVID-19 onto the world,  this malicious regime does whatever it wants to and with zero  consequences.   Most shocking of all, is that much of their treacherous behavior is  being covered up by the Democrat Party, who are more interested in  Beijing's success than our very own American success. Let's be clear,  the American COMPETES Act is not about contending with China; it is  about surrendering to the Chinese Communist Party.   While our country deteriorates from skyrocketing inflation, raging  crime, open borders, crumbling supply chains, over 100,000 American  deaths from overdoses on Chinese fentanyl, the Democrats spend their  time empowering our adversaries with bad policies and American tax  dollars.   Democrats claim to care about human rights, but they will not make  the Chinese Communist Party answer for its atrocities against the  Uyghurs. Democrats prioritize climate change above everything else, but  make no effort to call out China, the world's biggest  polluter. Democrats fight to keep COVID-19 in the spotlight, but refuse  to hold a single hearing about the virus' origins. Shameful. The list  goes on and on.    Americans can see this is hypocrisy, and as my friend from Louisiana  said, there will be a reckoning this coming November. The American  people deserve better from those that they elect to keep them safe.
