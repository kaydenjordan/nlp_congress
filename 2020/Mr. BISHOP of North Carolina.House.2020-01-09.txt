 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, if it were but a matter of offering three cheers for the  legislative branch, that would be fine, but this is dangerous and  simply makes no sense.   If the majority wished to assert Congress' authority, as several have  argued, it would not use a nonbinding resolution, but let me take the  majority at its chosen words, as if binding.   The words of the resolution would literally prohibit the President  from ordering the shoot-down of Iranian ballistic missiles inbound for  Haifa or a surface-to-air missile locked onto a Ukrainian airliner.   And the resolution's chosen words, as Democrats argue them, would  prevent the President from the strike on Soleimani itself even if  devastating harm to American soldiers were imminent but Democrats  second-guessed that judgment.   The language they have chosen is designed to debilitate the President  from protecting Americans.   The intemperate words of the past week have cost many their  credibility. Now Democrats' spite for President Trump has cost them  their good judgment.
