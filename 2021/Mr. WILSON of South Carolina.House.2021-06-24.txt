 Madam Speaker, after a year of  belittling Wuhan virus reports, incredibly, The New York Times  published a front-page admission last Tuesday acknowledging that the  Wuhan virus could be a lab leak.   With the headline ``Lab-Leak Theory Flourishes,'' it cited: `` . . .  whether the world will ever learn if the virus . . . escaped from a  Chinese lab. . . . The idea that the virus may have escaped from a lab  had long been . . . dismissed . . . and shunned . . . for its  connection with former President Donald J. Trump.''   The article accurately reviews the refusal of China to allow an  independent investigation, ultimate control by the Chinese Communist  Party, 2017 creation of hybrid bat coronaviruses at the Wuhan lab, the  bizarre U.S. taxpayer lab funding by the National Institutes of Health  through EcoHealth Alliance, Wuhan researchers in November 2019 being  hospitalized, 2012 bat viruses withheld, and an attack in July by Dr.  Shi Zhengli on President Trump and others demanding that they should  ``shut their stinky mouths.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our sympathy to the  family of Milton Moore and his wife, Jean, who are beloved civic  leaders of South Carolina.                            ____________________
