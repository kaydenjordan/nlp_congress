 Mr. Speaker, I found out on Friday of this past week that  Cuba's Border Guard and Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been hosted in  the North Carolina congressional district that I am honored to  represent. The Wilmington Port facilities visit was planned and  authorized by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of  State.   As one of our Nation's oldest adversaries and a state sponsor of  terrorism, Cuba's Communist Government is no friend of the United  States or anyone else who believes in freedom. Cuba has a history of  being a strategic Western asset to our greatest adversaries, including  China, Russia, and Iran, and they regularly cooperate with narcotics  traffickers, bringing cocaine, fentanyl, and other deadly drugs to our  country.   Now I am told this trip, as well as others in the past, have been  arranged as part of a reciprocal relationship to turn back Cubans  fleeing to the United States. We apparently have this arrangement where  we view their ports and security protocols, and they view ours.   There is no reason any nation with a state sponsor of terrorism  designation should be hosted by the United States, let alone be allowed  to analyze sensitive coastal and maritime security protocols.  Ironically, the decision to designate Cuba as a state sponsor of  terrorism and the decision to authorize this trip were made by the same  agencies. This action flies in the face of the purpose of both the  Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State and makes a  mockery of American strength against our adversaries.   The shores of North Carolina's Seventh Congressional District are  used and enjoyed by its residents and countless tourists from across  the country. It is our responsibility to ensure the security of our  maritime borders, and our Coast Guard often serves as the first line of  defense against these threats.   Mr. Speaker, this visit was a clear national security risk. I don't  know how one could view it otherwise. The bottom line is, this visit  should never have happened, and the American people deserve to know  what steps were taken to protect our national security interests.                            ____________________
