 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Tyler Jamison,  Michigan's 2023 Mr. Basketball award recipient. Tyler is from  Michigan's Ninth District, playing basketball for the Huskies of Port  Huron Northern.   Let's just say Tyler is really good. This season, Tyler averaged over  26 points, 11 rebounds, and 4 assists per game. He led his team to the  district semifinals just a couple of weeks ago.   Tyler is not only an impressive athlete. He is an impressive student,  too. This year, while playing basketball at an extremely high level,  Tyler has maintained a 4.7 GPA--quite an impressive and incredible  number.   This showcases his hard work and dedication to important things in  life, such as education.   I congratulate Tyler on becoming our State's Mr. Basketball, and I  wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. I can't wait to see  what the future holds for Tyler.                            ____________________
