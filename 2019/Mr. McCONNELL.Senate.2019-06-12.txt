 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week we are continuing to confirm  more unobjectionable nominees who had to move through the Senate more  slowly than they should. Yesterday we confirmed Sarah Daggett Morrison  to serve as U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, and  despite the fact that our Democratic friends forced us to file cloture  on her nomination, when she finally received a vote, she was confirmed  89 to 7.   That is probably because Ms. Morrison, like the other nominees we are  considering this week, is thoroughly noncontroversial and very well- qualified for the job. Thanks to the modest reforms to the Senate rules  we put in place this spring, more nominees who fit this description are  being confirmed in a fraction of the time it would have otherwise  taken.   So I hope the strong bipartisan support we saw yesterday will be  shown to the jurists we will vote to confirm on the Federal bench  today: Pamela Barker to the Northern District of Ohio; Corey Maze to  the Northern District of Alabama; Rodney Smith to the Southern District  of Florida; Thomas Barber to the Middle District of Florida; and Jean- Paul Boulee to the Northern District of Georgia.   Together, these nominees possess more than a century of legal  experience. Their resumes include work in State attorneys' offices, as  county judges, and as State solicitor general. They include a former  U.S. Army defense counsel and a U.S. Supreme Court litigator. Each has  demonstrated a commitment to upholding the Constitution and preserving  the rule of law. Each deserves strong, bipartisan support.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, the Trump  administration's new agreement with Mexico marks an important  breakthrough in the ongoing border crisis. It kept harmful tariffs from  going into effect and cemented new steps to make certain that  immigration enforcement and the rule of law are priorities on both  sides of the border.   But, of course, the Mexican Government was not the only outstanding  party with an unmet responsibility to address this crisis. Right here  in Congress we have been waiting for 6 weeks now--6 weeks--for our  Democratic colleagues to get serious about the administration's urgent  request for more resources for border security and humanitarian  efforts.  [[Page S3330]]    This week's progress with our Mexican neighbors throws the Democrats'  refusal to act into even starker relief. My colleagues and I have come  to the floor day after day, week after week, detailing all the evidence  that our southern border is in a state of crisis. The inflow of would- be illegal immigrants is unprecedented. Our facilities and our efforts  to house and care for the individuals we detain are stretched literally  to the breaking point. In short, the men and women stationed on our  southern border are running on fumes. They have been charged with the  tasks that circumstances have made incredibly difficult, and they are  begging for more funding to keep up.   As I noticed yesterday, the most recent data show that apprehensions  last month reached a 13-year high, with higher numbers in every  category--more individuals, more family units, and more unaccompanied  children arriving at border facilities that are already at  overcapacity. The Border Patrol is teetering on the brink. They are  nearing the point where they will be unable to perform even the most  basic humanitarian and security functions for lack of resources. This  is even with funds being diverted away from other important priorities  at the Department of Homeland Security on a contingency basis.   So let me say it again one more time. The Department of Homeland  Security has had to pull money and people off of other critical  missions just to try and meet the overwhelming surge of human traffic  down at the border. This is the Department that includes the  Transportation Security Administration, the Secret Service, and the  U.S. Coast Guard. Congress's inaction has backed them into a corner.   The officials who are responsible for protecting the homeland and  safeguarding these individuals could not have been clearer in their  pleading to Congress. They could not have been more clear. The Acting  Homeland Security Secretary has told us already that ``given the scale  of what we are facing, we will exhaust our resources before the end of  this fiscal year''--``exhaust our resources before the end of this  fiscal year.''   The Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement has said:  ``We are begging.'' ``Begging.'' ``We are asking Congress, please help  us.''   By any honest reckoning, this constitutes a crisis. That is why  Americans across the entire political spectrum agree that Democrats in  Congress need to put aside their allergy to finding an inch of common  ground with President Trump and finally agree to get something done.   We know exactly what the holdup has been. The New York Times reported  in late May exactly why this money didn't make it into the disaster  funding package despite Republican efforts. ``Democrats balked at  allocating billions of dollars more toward border security.''  ``Democrats balked.'' That is the New York Times.   Around the same time, one House Democrat admitted as much. He told  reporters: ``In my opinion, we do have to come up with some money. But  we've got to convince our more progressive friends. . . . `'   Well, look, I am sorry that a humanitarian crisis is not convincing  enough to the far left. I am sorry that two separate New York Times  editorials haven't made an impact on House Democrats either.   So here we have it. The New York Times editorial page, May 5-- incredibly enough: ``Congress, Give Trump His Border Money.'' That is  the New York Times saying: ``Give Trump [the] border money.'' They  didn't listen.   So several weeks later, on May 23, as I quoted, ``Democrats balked at  allocating billions of dollars more toward border security.''   On June 9, a couple of days ago, in the New York Times: ``When Will  Congress Get Serious About the Suffering at the Border?''   Here is the situation. The Trump administration and the New York  Times are on the same side--and House Democrats don't want to take this  up? Goodness, I am having a hard time remembering the last time the New  York Times editorial page was on the same side as the Trump  administration or Republicans in Congress. It is not a common sight,  but here we are.   All of us agree that the border crisis is unacceptable and  unsustainable, but still, House Democrats will not act. Yesterday, even  my colleague the Democratic leader admitted where this extended delay  is coming from. He told reporters that the House wasn't for it, but we  were.   Yes, I guess that was true, but in any event, apparently that is  where we are now. The House Democrats are the problem. So if they are  serious about wanting to resolve this, I hope they will get a grip--get  a grip on their far-left colleagues--in a hurry.   So here is what we are going to do. Chairman Shelby has announced  that the Appropriations Committee is going to vote on a $4.5 billion  package a week from tomorrow, with more than $3 billion in humanitarian  funds to expand shelter facilities, increase dedicated care for  unaccompanied children, and another billion dollars to prop up critical  security missions. I am grateful to Chairman Shelby for interest in  this and his leadership, along with the work of Senator Capito and  Senator Blunt.   I cannot urge my Democratic friends strongly enough to finally--what  does it take to convince them to get serious?--find their way to yes.   House Democrats may want to come down to the left of the New York  Times editorial page--there is not much space over there--but the rest  of the country thinks it is just crazy--because it is.   Partisan theater in the House doesn't improve the conditions in  border shelters. Melodramatic hearings and Presidential harassment  don't secure the border. ``The resistance'' doesn't pay the bills. This  spectacle of opposition for opposition's sake, even on such an obvious  nonpartisan priority, has been more than embarrassing. It is completely  irresponsible. It needs to end soon.    In the coming days, it will. We are going to act in the Senate, and  we are going to move forward to find the funding necessary to try to  solve this humanitarian crisis.
