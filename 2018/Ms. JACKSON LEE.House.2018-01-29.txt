 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 534, the Protecting Young  Victims From Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017, but  I thank my colleagues here in the House, Congresswoman Brooks and  Congresswoman Frankel of Florida.   In Michigan, there was a volcanic action. One might call it the  ``Nassar volcano.'' It acted, and there was no reaction. It was  deadening silence. No one responded to the volcano that kept pouring  poisonous lava in the way of young, beautiful athletes.   I would hope and wish that I was not on the floor today with my  colleague from Texas having to discuss this life-changing experience  for these young athletes who wanted to do nothing else but to make  their families proud first, maybe exceed, and be able to adhere to  their faith, determination, and resolve and make their Nation, their  State, their school proud of them, young girls, women, who, heretofore,  Mr. Speaker, had been held back or told that this sport was not for  them.   I am reminded of the women's hockey team, and I heard a young hockey  player indicate that her grandmother said that hockey was not for  girls.   All they wanted to do was to make us proud. All they wanted to do is  to show the strength of women and the resolve of women. That is why I  think this bill not only is important, Mr. Speaker, but it is timely to  come today; but all of us would have wished, with no condemnation, that  we had it 5 years ago or 10 years ago.   But remember what I said: the volcanic action was faced with  deafening silence, for those who knew and for the girls who wanted to  make us proud thought that the best way to resolve it or to handle it  was to embrace it, accept it, suffer, and still make us proud.   That is why I believe this bill is crucial, and I am very glad to be  on the floor with the two House sponsors, and I thank Senator Feinstein  for her efforts, because this bill would prevent the sexual abuse of  minors and amateur athletes by requiring the prompt reporting of sexual  abuse to law enforcement authorities.   This is a reasonable and important measure that is intended to  protect young athletes--and listen to the sound of the volcano--from  abuse and preserve the sanctity of sports associated with the U.S.  Olympic Committee, the organization responsible for preparing and  training young athletes who might one day represent our Nation  competitively all over the world.   How proud we are as we sit and view them on the Nation's televisions,  the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics that are about to start.  How shameful it is that we have to have this legislation to protect  them and, as well, the deadening silence at Michigan State University  and Dr. Nassar. I guess the only words that he could say are how  ashamed and embarrassed and sorry he is.   Eons and eons and eons of young women now live with that pain.  Children deserve to fully enjoy the innocence of their youth by  exploring the curiosities of the world, taking pleasure in the art,  participating in sports free of abuse.   Yes, I am going to defend the parents. I know some of them are overly  eager. We have seen them at Little League, and we have seen them at  football competition for little ones and middle school and high school,  and they are overly enthusiastic. You can't condemn a parent for being  proud of their child. And if that child wants to be engaged in sports,  you can't condemn that parent for trying to get  [[Page H636]]  them the best doctor and best instructor. Those parents were not  protected--deafening silence.   Sexual abuse of children and youth is an abhorrent practice that is  intolerable in any context, and we must take appropriate measures to  eliminate it from youth sports. Young people look to adults to protect  them and keep them safe. We all have a responsibility to do so. With S.  534, we have an opportunity to ensure that individuals abide by this  duty.   Certain other professionals, such as doctors, dentists, social  workers, psychologists, teachers, and daycare workers, are already  bound by law to report suspected abuse to law enforcement. Finally, S.  534 will require the same of adults who interact with young athletes in  connection with sports activities organized by the national governing  bodies of various sports.   The urgent need for this legislation is best illustrated by the  horrible abuse and exploitation of numerous young gymnasts at the hands  of Dr. Larry Nassar, who victimized young athletes participating in USA  Gymnastics over the course of 20 years--20 years, two decades.   All of our hearts should break. In those 20 years, there were lives  ruined. They will never be the vibrant, excited young women that they  were as they entered this wonderful experience of showing their  prowess, their genius, and their strength. The stories of abuse and  suffering of these young women are heartbreaking.   Many complaints of sexual and emotional abuse by Nassar and others  went unreported for years, allowing coaches, instructors, and doctors  to repeatedly victimize gymnasts as young as 6 years old. The shocking  failure of anyone to report accusations to law enforcement or even keep  track of complaints internally made it possible for some of these  predators to commit multiple horrific acts over time. We entrust the  care of our children and young athletes to those we hope will uphold  the trust and not abuse it.   One of the more than 150 girls and women victimized by Dr. Nassar was  recently quoted as saying:         He has everything he needs to be an incredible leader. He       has the personality, the skill, and the knowledge, and he's       using it to prey on people. What a waste.    Last week, a Michigan judge sentenced Nassar to a prison sentence of  up to 175 years. The judge called Nassar's assaults on scores of girls  and women under the pretense that he was treating them as ``precise,  calculated, manipulative, devious, despicable.'' She also indicated  what a debasing human being he was and is.   We must continue to do more to help protect our young athletes, and  this bill will greatly assist in that effort. However, I must note a  concern with a change the bill before us would make to the Senate- passed version of S. 534.   The bill unanimously passed by the Senate would authorize funding to  be provided to the U.S. Center for Safe Sport in the amount of $1  million for each of the next 4 years. Unfortunately, the version of the  bill before us strips this funding authorization. I believe we should  have taken up the Senate bill without amendment.   Safe Sport is charged with important responsibilities under this bill  with respect to receiving and investigating all allegations of abuse  and setting policies to prevent future abuse, so this bill has taken  out that language from the Senate.                                time  1715    It is critical that we ensure that the center is provided the  resources for those things to be done immediately. By doing so, I hope  we will prevent the type of abuse and suffering perpetrated by the  people like Larry Nassar.   In a recent open letter from the U.S. Olympians and Paralympians  Association to athletes everywhere, they wrote:         The goal of Olympianism is to place sport at the service of       the harmonious development of humankind, womankind, with a       view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the       preservation of human dignity. Now we must ask: How can       athlete dignity be preserved when the responsible       institutions fail so in their oversight?    In an apology letter to Team USA from the United States Olympic  Committee issued last week, the committee admitted that they had failed  these young athletes.   Frankly, I believe that whole committee and system should be  overhauled, reviewed, inspected, and changed. While the USA Gymnastics  scandal is unfortunate, let it be an example and an incentive to  prevent such abuse from happening in the nooks and crannies of this  Nation, in the villages and cities and counties where young people who  are starry-eyed and ready to accept the leadership of an adult are  ready to show their proudness as well as their talent, their strength,  and their resolve. I hope that we will never end that here in America.   Mr. Speaker, accordingly, I encourage my colleagues to join me in  supporting this important legislation. I hope we will see fit to fund  it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Frankel), the cosponsor of the House bill, and I  thank her for her leadership on these issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as we have listened to various speakers, I am glad that  we are joined by men and women of the United States Congress. All of us  have indicated the sadness in which we do this now.   But I think it is also important to take note of the fact of  individuals who have to be held responsible. We know that the president  of the university was asked to resign, or in fact has resigned. As we  go forward, there will be others as well.   This should be the clarion call, even as this legislation is passed  and signed by the President, for all of these agencies and associations  that run sports for children to do their own vetting and internal  assessment of individuals who are not there for the benefit of children  but are there for the benefit of themselves.   156-plus women were molested by this doctor. One of the victims said  something that stops your breath. This could have been stopped in 1997,  more than 20 years ago.   So this legislation should move swiftly to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H638]]    Mr. Speaker, when I read the quote from the accuser who said this  could have been stopped in 1997, the article's headline was that eight  times Larry Nassar could have been stopped. Eight times. So it is  important to take note of this legislation as a clarion call, and these  words are most important.   This provision makes it unlawful for an adult who is authorized by a  national governing body, a member of a national governing body, or an  amateur sports organization that participates in interstate or  international amateur athletic competition to interact with a minor or  amateur athlete at specific events to fail to report as soon as  possible child and sexual abuse to local law enforcement or another  agency.   Many times members of the Judiciary Committee don't like wide nets.  We have a responsibility to adhere to the Constitution. But we are the  committee that has the responsibility of upholding the rule of law. And  to all of those who are now in this wide net, that is the rule of law:  to be able to protect our children against massive sexual abuse as they  pursue their dreams.   Just a comment, the requirement would arise on a person that learns  of the facts that give reason to suspect that a child has suffered an  incident of child abuse, including sexual abuse; and, therefore, those  who can say or attempt to say, ``I couldn't understand what the child  was saying; it wasn't clear,'' but if they got a sense that there was a  problem, they come under that net. I believe that that is appropriate.   Let me also indicate that there is a long list of sheroes who have  been impacted by Dr. Nassar. My constituent stated, on January 16, a  former Olympic gymnast who wowed the world, Simone Biles, said that she  was abused by Dr. Nassar.   The long list of Dr. Nassar's victims include U.S. Olympic gymnasts  McKayla Maroney, Aly Raisman, and Gabby Douglas. They represented the  country and made us proud. And can you imagine? They were abused. Let  me thank the many organizations that have worked hard to advance this  legislation, including Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, RAINN,  the Nation's largest antisexual violence organization. They have been  magnificent.   I include in the Record a number of letters, Mr. Speaker, because  each day approximately 600 individuals are affected by sexual violence,  most of whom are children or parents seeking support, and they are  served by this organization.   The first letter I include in the Record supporting this legislation  is from RAINN, which urges the House of Representatives and others to  pass this legislation so that it can move quickly into the position to  be signed by the President.                                                          RAINN,                                  Washington, DC, November 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House of Representatives.      Hon. John Thune,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Lois Frankel,      House of Representatives.        Dear House and Senate Leaders: RAINN, the nation's largest       anti-sexual violence organization, urges the House of       Representatives to pass the Protecting Young Victims from       Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act.        Every two minutes in America, someone is sexually       assaulted. Every eight minutes, that individual is a child.       The Senate-passed bill, which has RAINN's support and       reflects months of bipartisan work and deliberation, is an       important step forward in ensuring that young athletes can       train and compete in the safe environments they deserve. The       legislation strengthens and streamlines the process for       reporting abuse of amateur athletes, and requires officials       and coaches who work with prospective Olympians to undergo       training on sexual abuse.        Survivors are reaching out to RAINN, which operates the       National Sexual Assault Hotline, in record numbers. There has       been a 21 percent increase in those contacting our hotline.       Each day, RAINN's victim service programs provide support to       approximately 600 individuals affected by sexual violence,       assisting a record 19,432 people in October alone. Many who       contact the Hotline are children or parents seeking support.        We urge the House of Representatives to advance this       legislation, as passed by the Senate, without delay. Doing so       will demonstrate a commitment to ensuring young athletes who       dream of representing our nation at the highest levels can       achieve their goals safely and in a respectful environment.        Thank you and please do not hesitate to contact RAINN with       questions or concerns.            Sincerely,                                         Rebecca W. O'Connor, Esq.,                                   Vice President of Public Policy.     Mr. Speaker, every 2 minutes in America, someone is  sexually assaulted; every 8 minutes, that individual is a child.   Let me include in the Record a letter from the U.S. Olympians and  Paralympians Association, and I would like to call out their names.  These are all athletes: Dick Fosbury, track and field; Willie Banks,  track and field; Allison Baver, speedskating; Carol Brown, rowing;  Candace Cable, Paralympic track and field; Caryn Davies, rowing; Gary  Hall, Sr., swimming; Micki King, diving; Carol Lewis, track and field;  John Naber, swimming; Bill Toomey, track and field; Iris Zimmerman,  fencing.                                       U.S. Olympians & Paralympians                                                     Association.         An open letter from the U.S. Olympians and Paralympians       Association to athletes everywhere:        We hear you.        We have heard your many stories detailing the sexual and       emotional abuse you endured while training and competing in       pursuit of your goals and your dreams. We applaud your       individual and collective courage and conviction in coming       forward and telling all . . . and calling out those who       abused your trust.        We are both appalled by the actions of those who hurt you       and deeply saddened by your suffering. For those whose       stories we haven't heard (and may never hear), we respect       your decision and your privacy . . . but also acknowledge the       pain you feel in silence.        We are united in saying that there is no place for abuse in       sport--at any age, at any level, in any venue. As Olympic and       Paralympic alumni, we want you to know we are a family that       stands strong for the ideals of the Olympic and Paralympic       movements.        When we, as athletes, returned from past Games, we shared       an understanding that ``The goal of Olympism is to place       sport at the service of the harmonious development of       humankind, with a view to promoting a peaceful society       concerned with the preservation of human dignity.'' Now we       must ask how can athlete dignity be preserved when the       responsible institutions fail so in their oversight?        So what shall we do? We shall continue to advocate for       education and safe sport, to teach young boys and girls to       recognize the signs of abuse and provide a safe place to       speak without repercussion. Parents, coaches and trainers       need to be educated to recognize the signs and learn how to       behave properly in coaching situations. We shall support       Title IX, the U.S. Center for SafeSport and pending federal       legislation to protect our athletes.        For any of you who are currently in need (or know someone       who is), the newly created and independent U.S. Center for       SafeSport is available for confidential 24/7 reporting and       crisis support:        SafeSport.org        24/7 SafeSport Crisis Helpline 866-200-0796        We know the power of commitment to a belief and to goals;       our goal is that your experiences are never repeated.       Together, we shall seek to create a way of life based on the       joy of effort.        Together in sport,        United States Olympians and Paralympians Association       Executive Committee        President Dick Fosbury--Track and Field, 1968        Willie Banks--Track and Field, 1980/1984/1988        Allison Baver--Speedskating, 2002/2006/2010        Carol Brown--Rowing 1976/1980/1984        Candace Cable--Paralympic Track and Field, 1980/1988/1992/      1996, Alpine Skiing, 1992; Nordic Skiing,1994/1998/2002/2006        Caryn Davies--Rowing, 2004/2008/2012        Gary Hall Sr.--Swimming, 1968/1972/1976        Micki King--Diving, 1968/1972        Carol Lewis--Track and Field, 1980/1984/1988        John Naber--Swimming, 1976        Bill Toomey--Track and Field, 1968        Iris Zimmerman--Fencing, 2000     Mr. Speaker, likewise, I include in the Record a  letter, dated November 16, 2017, from the CWLA, Child Welfare League of  America, an organization that worked on this issue.   [[Page H639]]                                                              CWLA,                                  Washington, DC, November 16, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House of Representatives.      Hon. John Thune,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      U.S. Senate.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Congressman McCarthy,       Congressman Hoyer, Senator Thune, and Senator Feinstein:        The Child Welfare League of America, after months of       bipartisan work and deliberation, urges the House of       Representatives to pass the Protecting Young Victims from       Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act.        This bipartisan legislation has now passed the Senate and       we firmly believe it will help to address some of the recent       reports of child sexual abuse that occurred against some of       this nation's finest young athletes while training for the       United States Olympic team. Based on past history and       reports, CWLA believes that stronger legislative action is       required so that this history does not continue to repeat       itself.        Over these past several months we have been able to work       with key congressional offices to enhance the responsibility       and the accountability of U.S. Olympic organizations. Several       parts of this bill, including the authorization and funding       for the U.S. Center for Safe Sport, are critical to this       accountability.        We hope the House of Representatives will act without delay       so parents and young athletes can live out their dreams of       competing on behalf of this country and do so with the       assurance they will be safe and respected.        Thank you for your attention on behalf of children.            Sincerely,      Christine James-Brown,        President/CEO, Child Welfare League of America.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  the DC Coalition Against Domestic Violence. They have worked along with  RAINN and have emphasized that the Nation's youngest have been impacted  by this dastardly series of actions.

Steny Hoyer,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      U.S. Senate.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Ms. Brooks, Ms. Frankel,       Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Thune, and Ms. Feinstein:        The DC Coalition Against Domestic Violence urges the House       of Representatives to pass the Protecting Young Victims from       Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act.        This bipartisan legislation is imperative to respond to the       numerous disclosures of child sexual abuse by our nation's       youngest and most accomplished athletes while they were       training for the U.S. Olympics. Intervention and prevention       measures through this legislation are desperately needed to       keep our children safe and hold offenders and entities       accountable for their actions and their silence.       Authorization and funding for the U.S. Center for Safe Sport       will be the first significant step toward this goal.        We ask the House of Representatives to swiftly and       expeditiously pass this legislation to protect our young       athletes and show them they are valued and deserve to excel       in their chosen sport without fear of and violence from those       they trust.        Thank you for your commitment to ending sexual abuse,       please do not hesitate to contact our office if we can be of       further assistance in this charge.            Sincerely,                                                     Karma Cottman,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  Professor Emeritus Howard M. Rubin from DePaul University who speaks  about sexual abuse. ``My wife, Barbara Blaine, knew the lasting damage  that is caused when a child is abused having been a child victim.''                                                   DePaul University                                                  College of Law,                               Chicago, Illinois, November 16, 2017.      Re: SB.534/ HR 1973--Protecting Young Victims from Sexual           Abuse Act of 2017       Senator Dianne Feinstein,      Senator John Thune,      Representative Susan Brooks,      Representative Lois Frankel.        Dear Lawmakers: I am writing to enthusiastically support       S.534/HR 1973 and to express my appreciation for your work in       drafting and advancing this legislation. In the wake of the       deluge of sexual harassment scandals breaking on a daily       basis, the American public is crying out for recognition of       women's rights, and the rights of victims of sexual abuse and       harassment.        While there is no way to quantify the struggles of one       victim against another a young victim's childhood is       indelibly harmed by sexual abuse. My wife, Barbara Blaine,       knew the lasting damage that is caused when a child is abused       having been a child victim. For her entire adult life she       fought selflessly and tirelessly to ensure the safety and       well-being of survivors, to prevent children from suffering       abuse, and to hold accountable those responsible. Abusers and       their enablers utilizing their power and status as shields       against prosecution and retribution were dragged out into the       light of justice and accountability by Barbara's ceaseless       crusade as advocate.        One of Barbara's passions was confronting unfair statute of       limitations. They protected abusers and punished young       victims unable to confront their abuse till later in life.       The language in S.534 that extends statute of limitations for       victims of child sexual abuse pertaining to federal crimes is       a tribute to her efforts.        Barbara cast a bright light against the darkness, but       tragically, her flame was snuffed out far too soon. She left       this world suddenly and before she could finish her life's       work. It is upon us now to stoke the embers left in the wake       of that lifetime, that her legacy might live on forever       through S.534, and cast such a spark so as to permanently       light the way towards justice for those who have been abused.        I would consider it an honor to be included in the list of       supporters for S.534.            Sincerely,                                                    Howard M Rubin,                                                Professor Emeritus.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  the National Children's Alliance, which has been working with other  advocacy groups and, again, has done longstanding work against child  abuse, supporting this legislation.                                     National Children Alliance,                                  Washington, DC, November 20, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      U.S. House of Representatives.      Hon. John Thune,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Lois Frankel,      House of Representatives.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi:        Dear Congressman McCarthy and Congressman Hoyer:        Dear Senator Thune and Senator Feinstein:        Dear Congresswoman Brooks and Congresswoman Frankel: The       National Children's Alliance, in cooperation with numerous       other advocacy groups, encourages the House of       Representatives to pass the Protecting Young Victims from       Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act (S.534).        Having recently passed the Senate, this bipartisan       legislation seeks to address the numerous reports of       childhood sexual abuse that have occurred against our       nation's young athletes. The recent press surrounding the       United States' Olympic trainees only serves to heighten the       need for a strong legislative response.        The NCA's longstanding work on child abuse leads us to       believe that this legislation will increase the       accountability of U.S. Olympic organizations and help ensure       that incidences of this nature are not repeated. In       particular, authorization and funding for the U.S. Center for       Safe Sport is one of the critical provisions of this bill       that will actively enhance U.S. Olympic organizations'       responsibility in these matters. It establishes an office for       education and outreach to develop the appropnate training,       policies, and procedures to combat and prevent the emotional,       physical, and sexual abuse, of young athletes competing in       athletic activities sponsored by national governing bodies       and Paralympic sports organizations.        We hope that the House of Representatives will take swift       action and stand with us in ensuring that our young athletes       are protected as they stave to compete on behalf of our       nation.        Thank you for your consideration of our youth.            Sincerely,                                                  Teresa Huizar,                                                 Executive Director,                                      National Children's Alliance.     CHILD USA: Let's End Child Abuse and Neglect said  [[Page H640]]  in a letter, which I include in the Record: ``This bill would shine  much needed sunlight on the problem of abuse in sports. It will protect  children in the future.''                                                      CHILD USA,                                                  November 20, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House of Representatives.      Hon. John Thune,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Lois Frankel,      House of Representatives.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Congressman McCarthy,       Congressman Hoyer, Senator Thune, Senator Feinstein,       Congresswoman Brooks, and Congresswoman Frankel:        CHILD USA urges the House of Representatives to pass the       Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport       Authorization Act. This bill would shine much needed sunlight       on the problem of abuse in sports. It will protect children       in the future.        The bill, as passed by the Senate, institutes important and       minimally necessary measures to ensure the protection of       children from abuse in sports: (1) mandatory reporting of       child abuse to SafeSport and the authorities. Many states do       not mandate such reporting and, therefore, the bill fills       that need; (2) a rule against retaliation for those who       report suspected abuse; (3) a limitation on coaches and other       adults from taking a child to a place that is not observable       by others; and (4) for the first time, makes amateur sports       organizations accountable for abuse of children. Taken       together, these are large steps forward.        The epidemic of child abuse in the United States needs       Congress to lead the way on child protection with this bill.       Children deserve the protections of the Protecting Young       Victims Act and they need it now. Thank you for your efforts       for the protection of America's children.            Sincerely,                                                 Marci A. Hamilton,                                                               CEO.     Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter  from the United States Olympic Committee, dated January 24, 2018.                                United States Olympic Committee,                             Colorado Springs, CO, January 24, 2018.        To Team USA: The athlete testimony that just concluded in       the Nassar hearings framed the tragedy through the eyes of       the victims and survivors, and was worse than our own worst       fears. It was powerful because of the strength of the       victims, survivors and parents, who so eloquently and       forcefully told their stories and so rightfully demanded       justice. The USOC should have been there to hear it in       person, and I am deeply sorry that did not happen.        The purpose of this message is to tell all of Nassar's       victims and survivors, directly, how incredibly sorry we are       We have said it in other contexts, but we have not been       direct enough with you. We are sorry for the pain caused by       this terrible man, and sorry that you weren't afforded a safe       opportunity to pursue your sports dreams. The Olympic family       is among those that have failed you.        I know this apology is not enough. We have been working on       taking steps at the USOC and mandating changes among National       Governing Bodies to ensure this does not happen again. Our       next steps will be these:        1. We Must Change the Culture of the Sport. This was the       primary recommendation of the independent Deborah Daniels       Report on USA Gymnastics and the athlete testimony underlined       its importance. We heard athletes describe being unsure or       unaware of how to report abuse and to whom, and sometimes       even what constitutes abuse. We heard athletes describe being       afraid or discouraged from reporting abuse. We heard athletes       describe feeling hurt, betrayed, discounted and alone. Since       October of last year, we have been engaged in direct talks       with USAG leadership on this fundamental point. New       leadership at the board level is critical and you recently       saw three USAG board resignations. Further changes are       necessary to help create a culture that fosters safe sport       practice, offers athletes strong resources in education and       reporting, and ensures the healing of the victims and       survivors. This includes a full turnover of leadership from       the past, which means that all current USAG directors must       resign.        2. We Must Change the Governance Structure of the NGB. We       need to help USA Gymnastics better support its mission, which       is to provide the best resources and safest environment for       athletes to train and compete. We have strongly considered       decertifying USAG as a National Governing Body. But USA       Gymnastics includes clubs and athletes who had no hand in       this and who need to be supported. We believe it would hurt       more than help the athletes and their sport. But we will       pursue decertification if USA Gymnastics does not fully       embrace the necessary changes in their governance structure       along with other mandated changes under review right now.        3. We Must Know Who Knew What and When. The USOC has       decided to launch an investigation by an independent third       party to examine how an abuse of this proportion could have       gone undetected for so long. We need to know when complaints       were brought forward and to who. This investigation will       include both USAG and the USOC, and we believe USAG will       cooperate fully. We will make the results public.        4. We Must Support Safe Sport Victims and Survivors. Team       USA safe sport assault victims and survivors need access to       testing, treatment and counseling. The USOC will devote       substantial funds to help provide these resources to victims       and survivors. We are working on the details of how this       funding will become available to athletes and will       communicate them soon.        I hope that all members of Team USA remember that the USOC       ombudsman office is always available to provide free,       independent and confidential help to athletes with concerns       or questions about safe sport or other matters. Contact       information, along with other helpful athlete resources, are       here.        In order to bring even more focus and urgency to these       important points, the USOC board of directors has mobilized a       board-level working group chaired by independent board member       Susanne Lyons.        Finally, I invite any member of Team USA to communicate       with me or Ms. Lyons directly if there is more that you think       the Olympic family can or should be doing for you and your       families.            Sincerely,                                                    Scott Blackmun,                                           Chief Executive Officer.     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Poe for his  longstanding work on these issues, the two House cosponsors, and the  Senator, and I want to end with, with that volcanic action, there was  no reaction, a deafening silence. Let us, with the passage of this  bill, begin the journey of commitment, along with our acknowledgment of  the Me Too movement that we will never be silent again.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 534, the ``Protecting Young  Victims from Sexual Abuse Act''.   This bill will help prevent the sexual abuse of minors and amateur  athletes by requiring the prompt reporting of sexual abuse to law  enforcement authorities.   This is a reasonable and important measure that is intended to  protect young athletes from abuse and preserve the sanctity of sports  associated with the U.S. Olympic Committee--the organization  responsible for preparing and training young athletes who might one day  represent our Nation competitively all over the world.   Children deserve to fully enjoy the innocence of their youth--by  exploring the curiosities of the world, taking pleasure in the arts,  and participating in sports--free from abuse.   Sexual abuse of children and youth is an abhorrent practice that is  intolerable in any context, and we must take appropriate measures to  eliminate it from youth sports.   Young people look to adults to protect them and keep them safe. We  all have a responsibility to do so. With S. 534, we have an opportunity  to ensure that individuals abide by this duty.   Certain other professionals--such as doctors, dentists, social  workers, psychologists, teachers, and daycare workers, are already  bound by law to report suspected abuse to law enforcement. S. 534 will  require the same of adults who interact with young athletes in  connection with sports activities organized by the national governing  bodies of various sports.   The urgent need for this legislation is best illustrated by the  horrible abuse and exploitation of numerous young gymnasts at the hands  of Dr. Larry Nassar, who victimized young athletes participating in USA  Gymnastics over the course of 20 years. The stories of abuse and  suffering of these young women are heartbreaking.   Many complaints of sexual and emotional abuse by Nassar and others  went unreported for years--allowing coaches, instructors, and doctors  to repeatedly victimize gymnasts as young as six years old.   The shocking failure of anyone to report accusations to law  enforcement, or even keep track of complaints internally, made it  possible for some of these predators to commit multiple, horrific acts  over time.   We entrust the care of our children and young athletes in the hands  of those we hope to uphold that trust and not abuse it.   One of the more than 150 girls and women victimized by Dr. Nassar was  recently quoted as saying, ``He has everything he needs to be an  incredible leader. He has the personality . . . the skill . . . the  knowledge. And he's using that to prey on people . . . what a waste.''   Last week, a Michigan judge sentenced Nassar to a prison sentence of  up to 175 years. The judge described Nassar's assault of scores of  girls and women, under the pretense that he was treating them, as  ``precise,  [[Page H641]]  calculated, manipulative, devious and despicable.''   We must continue to do more to help protect our young athletes, and  this bill will greatly assist in that effort. However, I must note a  concern with a change the bill before us would make to the Senate- passed version of S. 534. The bill unanimously passed by the Senate  would authorize funding to be provided to the U.S. Center for Safe  Sport in the amount of $1 million for each of the next five years.   Unfortunately, the version of the bill before us strips this funding  authorization. I believe we should have taken up the Senate bill,  without amendment. Safe Sport is charged with important  responsibilities under this bill--with respect to receiving and  investigating allegations of abuse and setting policies to prevent  future abuse. It is critical that we ensure that the Center is provided  the resources for those things to be done immediately and effectively.   By doing so, I hope we will prevent the type of abuse and suffering  perpetrated by people like Larry Nassar.   In a recent open letter from the U.S. Olympians and Paralympians  Association to athletes everywhere, they wrote: ``The goal of Olympism  is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of  humankind, with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with  the preservation of human dignity. Now we must ask how can athlete  dignity be preserved when the responsible institutions fail so in their  oversight?''   In an apology letter to Team USA from the United States Olympic  Committee issued last week, the Committee admitted that it had failed  its young athletes.   While the USA Gymnastics scandal is unfortunate, let it be an example  and incentive to prevent such abuse from happening again.   Accordingly, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important legislation.   The ``Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act'' is a necessary  measure to ensure young athletes in this country are able to pursue  their athletic dreams in safe environments, free of the fear of being  victimized by predators.   I thank the many organizations that have worked hard to advance this  legislation, including Rape Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN),  the Nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization.   I'd like to enter into the record a letter from RAINN, which  indicates survivors are reaching out to its National Sexual Assault  Hotline in record numbers, at a 21 percent increase.   Each day approximately 600 individuals affected by sexual violence  are served, most of whom are children or parents seeking support.   For the foregoing reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I ask support of the legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, just a couple of hours ago, the  Republicans on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence voted to  release the Nunes report. At the same time, they voted not to allow the  rebuttal offered by the Democrats to be released.   All I can say, Mr. Speaker, as a Member who has been through  impeachment of the Federal judiciary and a President, not one time did  I see any sidetrack opportunities or efforts to dismantle that ongoing  investigation.   We are not in an impeachment proceeding. We have a special counsel  that is attempting to provide for the American people a detailed and  thoughtful investigation.   Why the rule of law has been so obliterated by our Republican friends  and the idea of democracy and the protection of the institutions of  this Nation have been undermined, I am shocked.   The American people are not clamoring for the destruction of the FBI,  nor are they clamoring for the destruction and undermining of Special  Counsel Mueller's report.   Let us stand for the principles of democracy and the Constitution.  This kind of undermining is dastardly and embarrassing.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  his leadership in galvanizing all of us, and I thank my colleagues for  very eloquent messages on the floor of the House regarding Janus v.  AFSCME Council 31.   Let me acknowledge Lee Saunders and the AFSCME family, who have been  champions in fighting for the rights of all labor, and that is why we  are on the floor of the House today, because we wanted to, in our way  as legislators, join in this magnificent fight for constitutional  rights of the First Amendment.   And let me take issue with the 1977 Supreme Court case Abood v.  Detroit Board of Education and turn the Fourth Amendment back to  supporting those workers who, in fact, want to associate and  participate in unions.   Let me also thank my colleague Chairman Richmond of the Congressional  Black Caucus for galvanizing us as well in this effort.   We offered a resolution to honor Echol Cole and Robert Walker. On  February 1, 1968, it will be 50 years that these two sanitation workers  in Memphis were killed in a horrific accident when the compactor on  their sanitation truck malfunctioned. The key is that these individuals  had no rights, no benefits. They had no death benefits. They had no  protection for their families. They had nothing. And that is why this  Supreme Court decision is so crucial and why I hope that the Supreme  [[Page H665]]  Court of the United States will rule in favor of AFSCME against this  wrongheaded approach to those who are trying to speak on behalf of  those who support the rights of workers.   The Supreme Court cases did the flip of the First Amendment and  suggested that the First Amendment of those who disapproved unions was  being violated. I believe that the Supreme Court got it completely  wrong and that the First Amendment rights of those who move positively  to be part of a union could be argued vigorously that their rights are  being violated. Not only their rights are being violated, but their  rights to have a liveable wage and to work in a safe and protected  workforce and workplace. That is what I think the real question is as  to why those who want to be in a union must be defeated by the  constitutional premise of the First Amendment.   My First Amendment is to join the union and to secure the rights and  benefits of those. I hope that the Supreme Court will look to the fact  that union members who desire to have fees selected and utilized for  the union deducted from their salary have every much a right to the  First Amendment. You can opt out, but you should not deny those members  the right to the First Amendment to have their voices heard.   In particular, it is important to note the benefits that have come  about to the African-American community. And that is the African- American community has seen increasing wages. African-American union  workers earn up to $10,000 or 31 percent more a year than nonunion  workers. In 2011, nearly 20 percent of employed African Americans  worked for the State, local, or Federal Government compared to 14  percent of other groups. And African Americans are less likely than  other groups to work in the private sector.   So let me say this about why I stand here to support the unions and  their right to the First Amendment to deduct fees to be able to express  their rights. Let me just quickly say as I close: Do you know among the  many things that unions have helped us get are weekends, all breaks at  work, paid vacations, family medical leave, sick leave, Social  Security, minimum wage, civil rights, overtime, child labor laws, and  workman's comp?   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is an important discussion because  so many good elements of saving lives, so much so that those dear  sanitation workers would not have lost their life, came about from the  sacrifice of unions, and we should provide them with the First  Amendment right.   Let me salute Clara Caldwell who will be honored by our union  brothers and sisters in Austin, Texas, and let me say the right thing  for the Supreme Court to do is rule on behalf of the unions and their  rights to the First Amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record points about African Americans  and Labor Unions, facts about Janus v. AFSCME Council 31, and 36  reasons to thank the union movement.                     African Americans and Labor Unions         1. Historically, the path to the middle class for African       Americans was through a union job.        2. African-American workers are more likely to be union       members.        3. Unionized workers promote greater income equality and       prevent wage discrimination.        4. African American union workers earn up to $10,000 or 31%       more per year than non-union members.        7. Few African Americans are self-employed--only 3.8%       reported being self-employed in 2011--making them almost half       as likely to be self-employed as Whites (7.2%).        8. Unionized workers are more likely to receive paid leave,       more likely to have employer-provided health insurance, and       are more likely to be in employer-provided pension plans.        9. Unions play a pivotal role by ensuring workers have       continued educational access for their current roles as well       as encourage workers to pursue higher education.        10. Nationally, 77 percent of union employees in 2009 were       covered by pension plans that provide a guaranteed monthly       retirement income. Only 20 percent of non-union workers are       covered by guaranteed (defined-benefit) pensions 20%.        11. Union workers are 53.9% more likely to have employer-      provided pensions.        12. When unions are strong and able to represent the people       who want to join them, these gains spread throughout the       economy and the overall community.        13. Workers who form unions are able to boost wages, which       helps attract and retain staff.        14. When non-union companies increase their wages, it gives       all workers more purchasing power.        15. Communities with a strong middle class have sufficient       tax revenues to support schools, hospitals and roads.        16. Historically, pensions, social security and personal       savings ensured that workers could retire with dignity.        17. With the current recession and the attack on pensions,       many workers are left to depend on social security and their       personal savings alone.        18. Many African American elders find themselves in a       precarious situation after decades of work.        19. Union members played a critical role in the civil       rights struggles of the past and that involvement continues       today.        20. When Martin Luther King Jr. was jailed for civil       disobedience, unions and union members frequently came to his       aid with the legal and financial help he needed.        21. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin both union leaders       help to organize the March on Washington in 1963 and in       countless cities around the country.        22. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed while in       Memphis to aid striking sanitation workers.        23. Today, labor unions are still on the forefront of       efforts to ensure that the gains of the past are maintained       and to fight for those still denied opportunity and equality.           Facts About Janus v. AFSCME Council 31--Source: AFSCME         Facts of the Case        In 1977, the Supreme Court, in Abood v. Detroit Board of       Education, upheld against a First Amendment challenge a       Michigan law that allowed a public employer whose employees       were represented by a union to require those of its employees       who did not join the union nevertheless to pay fees to it       because they benefited from the union's collective bargaining       agreement with the employer.        Illinois has a law similar to that upheld in Michigan. The       governor of Illinois brought a lawsuit challenging the law on       the ground that the statute violates the First Amendment by       compelling employees who disapprove of the union to       contribute money to it. The district court dismissed the       complaint on the grounds that the governor lacked standing to       sue because he did not stand to suffer injury from the law,       but two public employees intervened in the action to seek       that Abood be overturned. Given that Abood is binding on       lower courts, the district court dismissed the claim, and the       Seventh Circuit affirmed dismissal for the same reason.        Legal Question Presented:        Should the Court's decision in Abood v. Detroit Board of       Education should be overturned so that public employees who       do not belong to a union cannot be required to pay a fee to       cover the union's costs to negotiate a contract that applies       to all public employees, including those who are not union       members?        Janus v. AFSCME Council 31 threatens our union and all       working families. This case, which will come before the       Supreme Court in February, represents a huge threat to our       union. As a local leader, you are critical to how we defend       and protect our union, our members and public services in the       face of this threat.        This lawsuit aims to take away the freedom of working       people to join together in strong unions to speak up for       themselves and their communities. In February, the U.S.       Supreme Court will hear the case and a decision is expected       by the summer.        What are fair share fees, and why are they important?        Unions work because we all pay our fair share and we all       benefit from what we negotiate together. Fair share fees       provide public service workers with the power in numbers they       need to negotiate better wages, benefits and protections that       improve work conditions and set standards for everyone.        Each public service worker chooses whether or not to join a       union, but the union is still required by law to represent       and negotiate on behalf of all public service workers--      members and non-members alike. All employees receive the wage       increases, benefits and workplace rights negotiated through       the union.        The corporate special interests behind this case want to       take away our ability to build strength in numbers. That is       why they want the Supreme Court to rule that workers can       receive all the benefits of a union contract without       contributing anything in return. All workers should chip in       their fair share to cover the cost of representing them.        Is anyone ever forced to join a union or pay for politics?        No. The simple truth is that no one is forced to join a       union and no one is forced to pay any fees that go to       politics or political candidates. That is already the law of       the land. Nothing in this case will change that. This case is       about taking away the freedom of working people to join       together, speak up for each other and build a better life for       themselves and their families by undermining their ability to       form strong unions.        What is the real impact of this case?        When working people have the freedom and opportunity to       speak up together through unions, we make progress together       that benefits everyone. The wealthy elite behind this case       are trying to use the highest court in the land to take away       our freedom to create the power in numbers to secure better       lives  [[Page H666]]       for ourselves, our families, our communities and our country       by undermining our ability to form strong unions.        If fair share fees are struck down, employees who benefit       from the gains that the union makes will not have to pay       anything toward the cost of that representation. If the       billionaires and corporate CEOs behind this case get their       way, they will take away the freedom of working people to       come together and build power to fight for the things our       families and communities need: everything from affordable       health care and retirement security to quicker medical       emergency response times.        What is this case really about?        The case aims to erode the freedom to form unions to       improve our lives and the communities we serve. Real freedom       is about making a decent living from our hard work; it's also       about having time to take a loved one to the doctor, attend a       parent-teacher conference and retire in dignity. The       corporate special interests behind this case do not believe       that working people should have the freedom to negotiate a       fair return on their work.        Who is behind this case?        The National Right to Work Foundation is part of a network       funded by corporate billionaires to use the courts to rig the       rules against working people. For decades, these wealthy       elites have used their massive fortunes to gain outsized       influence to chip away at the progress unions have won for       all working families. Now they want the highest court in the       land to take away our freedom to come together to protect       what our communities need: a living wage, retirement       security, health benefits, the ability to care for loved ones       and more.        How do unions benefit our communities?        People in unions continue to win rights, benefits and       protections for all working people and their communities.       When public service workers belong to strong unions, they       fight for staffing levels, equipment and training that saves       lives and improves the public services our communities rely       upon. And when union membership is high, entire communities       enjoy higher wages.                   36 Reasons To Thank the Union Movement         1. Weekends        2.
