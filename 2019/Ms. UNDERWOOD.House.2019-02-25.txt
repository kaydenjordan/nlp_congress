 Mr. Speaker, 10 days ago, five people, four of whom  were my constituents, left their homes for work at the Henry Pratt  Company in Aurora, Illinois, and never returned. Their lives were taken  by an unspeakably horrible act, gun violence, which happens  heartbreakingly frequently in this country.   As we consider legislation this week that is a critical first step  towards preventing gun violence, I would like to take a few moments to  honor the lives our community lost this month.   I wish to remember Russell Beyer. Proud chair of his union and a 20- year employee of Henry Pratt, Russell was the father of two and a  steadfast Patriots fan.   We remember Clayton Parks, a Northern Illinois University grad whose  wife, Abby, describes as an incredible father to their young son, Axel.   We remember Josh Pinkard. ``I want to shout from the rooftops about  how amazing Josh was,'' his wife, Terra, wrote about a man who loved  God, family, and college football.   We remember Trevor Wehner, a college student at Northern Illinois  University, killed on the very first day of his internship. He was  described by a friend as someone who would go out of his way for  others.   We remember Vicente Juarez. The patriarch of a tight-knit family,  Vicente was a caring husband, father, and grandfather to eight. His  neighbors loved him for his efforts ridding the neighborhood of  dandelions each summer.   We will never forget our five neighbors, and we will never forget the  bravery of law enforcement and first responders who rushed toward the  violence and undoubtedly saved countless lives.   May we honor them with our actions, and may our community come back  stronger than ever before.                            ____________________
