 Mr. Speaker, it is a new day in Congress.   Mr. McGovern, you mentioned the 72-hour rule was put in by you and  the Democrats. Why didn't you enforce it? You didn't. We were forced to  vote on bills like the omnibus that was 4,155 pages long.   The American people are tired of it. Last week was a great week. You  saw democracy at its best.   Guess what? We were off 24 weeks during the last session. We can take  however many days it is to debate something that the American people  should see.   The great part about this rules package is it restores financial  sanity. That is why I am proud to support, along with Speaker McCarthy,  this new rules package that implements fiscal and budgetary restraints  on Congress. Provisions included are huge wins for the American people  for everybody to see.   We were given the assurance that this package will do the job, and we  could not continue the downward trajectory that your party has put the  American people on over the last 2 years and last 4 years.   Now is the time that we deal with what is the growing insanity. I am  just thankful that we are here.
