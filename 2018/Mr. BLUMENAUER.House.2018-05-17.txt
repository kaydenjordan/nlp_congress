 Mr. Speaker, the debate this week in Congress centers  largely around the farm bill, the most important bill that most people  pay little or no attention to.   Currently, there is a mad scramble for votes for a flawed bill from a  fractured Republican caucus.   Now, we are going to have some minor discussions on the floor. There  are some amendments that will be bounced back and forth, but they are  basically beside the point, not the big-picture issues that need to be  debated.   There are fatal flaws. First and foremost, virtually everyone on our  side of the aisle is adamantly opposed to the efforts to cut nutrition  funding through SNAP, food stamps, rather than expanding opportunities  to nutrition and healthy food.   For example, they are cutting farmers market funding, for heaven's  sake, projects that are popular across the country and connect  consumers directly with farmers for fresh, healthy food.   This is all while they are proposing to essentially hound people off  food stamps with unnecessary restrictions for employment. The vast  majority of people are already employed or have difficulty being  employed or there aren't jobs available. They are going to have a job  training program, about $45 per person, which anybody who works in this  field will acknowledge that the bureaucracy and the trouble will be  more than it is worth in terms of a benefit to people. Essentially,  they will hound people off food stamps.   This is at the same time where they are expanding subsidies for  wealthy farming interests and expanding the ability to get those  subsidies to people who aren't actively involved with farming. This  bill is going to send subsidy checks to New York City and Chicago and  San Francisco, people who are cousins and nieces and nephews, not  actively farming.   The second major problem with this bill is it attacks conservation  funding, cutting a billion dollars from essential services, cutbacks  with the Conservation Stewardship Program, $5 billion cut out of the  Working Lands Project, and not strengthening the ability of  environmental programs to produce results. There is no requirement that  we have high-quality environmental outcomes.   In fact, the EQIP Program has a wide variety of things that we pay  farmers to do that actually don't enhance the environment. We are  paying farmers for the cost of doing business: fencing, hog lagoons.  That is decidedly the wrong step to take.   The worst aspect that is not getting the attention it deserves is the  so-called King amendment, the Protect Interstate Commerce Act, which  would prevent State or local governments from regulating an  agricultural product except to the extent it is already regulated by  Federal law or the producing State.   Think about that for a moment. States are moving to deal with the  opioid crisis, and they would be prevented from having drug  prohibitions that go beyond what the Federal Government does or other  States.   Food packaging regulations. Many States are concerned about BPA-free  container requirements for baby food: prohibited.   Fishing regulations. In my State, and I suspect in many others,  people are serious about being able to protect fisheries, commercial  and recreational, but under this bill, they would be prohibited if  another State has looser requirements. My colleague from Seattle might  have some concerns in her State about protecting the clamming  operations, but some State like Nebraska that doesn't have them could  come in and not observe those limits.   The notion that we won't have invasive pest protections that are  tailored to what our States want, product transportation laws, secure  containers for animal carcasses and grease--lowest common denominator.   Licensing and permitting of commercial enterprises, for example,  professional licensing and pet sellers; you could not prohibit a  convicted animal abuser from having a license to traffic animals if the  other State doesn't have it.   These are horrific provisions trampling on States' rights, consumer  protection, environmental protection, agricultural protection.   This bill should be rejected.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, the fact is that there are lots of  companies that use sugar and are behemoths. I represent a number of  them in Portland, Oregon, that are confectioners, candy makers, and  bakers who are concerned about this.   In terms of the benefit, think about the 13 mega processors that the  sugar program forces manufacturers to pay far more than they need. This  is a $3 billion burden on the taxpayer.   We have an opportunity here to deal with one other area. If we start  getting the pricing right, there is another hidden tax in terms of the  sugar system that we have, and that has been on the Florida Everglades.   We have a $7.5 billion down payment because of the damage that has  been inflicted on the Everglades by the massive cane sugar operation  that has increased dramatically in the last 50 years, a cost that  taxpayers will be footing and environmental costs to go with the burden  on sugar-using industries.   I strongly urge approval of the amendment.
