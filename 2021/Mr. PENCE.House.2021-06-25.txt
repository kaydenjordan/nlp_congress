 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to implore this governing body  to consider the consequences of using the Congressional Review Act as a  vehicle to reinstate the harmful Obama-era regulations on methane  emissions.   American energy independence is key to the economic and national  security of Hoosiers and, of course, of all Americans.   These unnecessary and redundant regulations on new methane emissions  will stifle responsible energy development and undercut our domestic  energy potential. Because of the additional Federal regulations this  would create, Hoosiers will pay more to heat their homes and to cook  their meals, which we are already seeing right now.   As a veteran of the petroleum industry, I know that free market  innovation has always been the key driver to developing more cost- effective and environmentally friendly uses of natural gas. Let's keep  doing that.   The burdensome regulations like the one before us today have never  been the answer to improve our environment.   Mr. Speaker, I came to Washington to protect Hoosiers' way of life  back home in the Sixth District, and that is why I will continue to  advocate for an all-of-the-above, not everything-but approach to  energy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this attempt to cripple  American energy.
